the fool of quality or the history of henry earl of moreland  vol v  by mr brook  dublin printed for the author by dillon chamberlain in dame street facing fowness street mdcclxx  the fool of quality or the history of henry earl of moreland thus my lord in the recent acquisition of such a son forgot all his losses and cast the whole weight of his late calamities behind him his eye could not be tired with seeing him neither his ear with hearing the sweetness of his voice and he continued to hold to gaze at him to caress him unmindful of aught else unmindful even of his friend meekly who sat enraptured beside him  will you leave me again my child cried out the earl do you intend to go from me again my harry you must not you shall not leave me not for an hour no not for a minute a second loss of my son would quickly bring my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave never never my lord will i leave you tenderly cried harry never for a moment will i forsake you again my father i come purposely to watch over to comfort to tend you while i have life with all possible tenderness affection and duty  but where hastily asked the earl where is the murderer who stabbed my peace where is that old thief that robber who rent my child from me ah my lord cried harry he is very far from meriting such opprobrious epithets he is a summary of all that is excellent all that is amiable in nature he respects and loves you too above the world and all that is in it deserving of love o had you lately seen his grief for your losses the floods of tears he shed  for  for  for  here harry could no more but on the recollection of his mother and brother burst into tears  but tell me my dear continued the earl tell me who and what he is whom you commend so highly  even the son of your own mother my lord my much loved my revered my most honored uncle  impossible my child that old despicable man my brother no no my harry he must have deceived you my brother was all that was amiable upon earth the fairest among ten thousand the straitest cedar in the forest  and such he is at this day my lord but alas alas he has been broken by the batteries of many afflictions a man wholly made up of sorrows and acquainted with killing griefs you wanted me not when he took me my father you had other and richer treasures comforts that were infinitely more worthy your regard but little and despicable as i was he had nothing but me i became his only comfort the only treasure in which he delighted yet as soon as he heard that you wanted consolation he chose rather to be without it himself and so he restores me to you if i may be any little matter of comfort to you my father  and where is this dear uncle this precious brother my harry is he come with you shall i be so blessed to take him in with my eye to take him in with my arms to petition to obtain his pardon to press him to my bosom to my heart to my soul where is he where is this precious brother my harry  he is not come with me my lord he feared as he said that you would not forgive him the carrying off of your ganymede but he is desirous of attending you on the first intimation  then you must write to him for that purpose to morrow my son and dispatch your invitation by some of our swiftest horses the influence of his darling will unquestionably be greater than that of an offending and unnatural brother is this letter from him harry  it is my lord  then i will not peruse it till i get by myself it probably contains reproaches but too well merited or possibly matters of consolation too tender for me to bear  but mr meekly my dearest meekly ten thousand pardons  harry take to your arms the man in the world next to your uncle most deserving of your reverence most deserving of your heart  here mr meekly kissed and embraced our hero with all the tenderness of a father and the ardour of an old friend  mr meekly cried harry looking earnestly and fondly at him do i not remember something of that face mr meekly are you not the gentleman for whom i long since conceived such an attachment to whom my heart cleaved as i may say from my infancy  i am my heavenly creature answered meekly i am the man indeed whose soul was knit to yours like the soul of jonathan to david the first moment i beheld you and who saw in you then all those noble generous and divinely humane propensities that i see arrived to their maturity at this happy day  while mr meekly was thus rejoicing harry happened to turn his head aside and spying the lively portraits of my lady and lord richard he started he rose and gazing on them a minute he went softly to the window and taking out his handkerchief kept his back to the company while he vented his emotions in a silent passion of tears his father and mr meekly perceived what he was about but they did not disturb him he brought fresh to their remembrance all the passages of late affliction and they silently joined a flow of grief to his but their tears were the tears of sympathising humanity or rather tears of delight on observing the sweet sensibilities of their darling  in the mean time mr frank who attended on harry had whisperingly given the mourning domestics an intimation concerning the person of the stranger who had arrived some of them well remembered him and all of them had heard of him and conceived a very kindly impression of our harry they first expressed their mutual joy by kisses embraces and silent shakes of the hand but in a little space their congratulations became more loud and tumultuous and the voice of exultation was heard through all the lower house  harry hereupon felt himself secretly hurt and turning to his father his yet tearful countenance my lord says he i beseech you to suppress this unseasonable sound of joy among your servants in a house that ought so justly to be the house of mourning  my love mildly and kindly answered the earl i cannot wholly refuse to my poor and afflicted people some share of that comfort which i myself feel on the return of my harry they are all my old and true servants my child this is no other than an expression of their love to you and to me and i request you to receive them affectionately for my sake  here the earl rung a bell and desired tha tall his domestics should come in  they accordingly entered harry perfectly recollected mr john the steward mr samuel the butler and old mrs mary the cook he called them by their names reminded them of old times and took them in his arms with much affection he then turned to the other servants he took each of them by the hand in turns and spoke to them with such a natural ease and lowliness as though he himself desired in his fathers house to become also as one of his hired servants hereupon gathering all about him they catched and kissed his hand by force and then kneeling around they promiscuously petitioned for blessings on his head and rising retired in a pleasing passion of sobs and tears while the enraptured earl beheld all with a mixture of such blissful sensations as he had never felt before  it now began to grow late and after a short repast of some small matters my lord proposed their retiring to bed but my friend said he to harry you must content yourself with being my prisoner for the present you must lie in my chamber i will not trust my lamb from my side for fear of its going once more astray ah my lord cried harry there is no fear of that my heart is wholly your property and you have thereby a sure hold of all that i am or can have  the next morning harry impatiently rose before the servants were stirring and unlocking the great door and closing it softly after him he went out exulting on his premeditated expedition he reconnoitred and recollected the quondam scenes of his childhood and flying like a bird over the hedges and other obstacles he made the shortest way to his still precious mammys  when he approached the place of his infant endearments he met his fosterfather going forth to his field with a solemn and melancholy air on his usual occupations harry instantly remembered the features once so delightful and springing to him and catching at him he kissed and clasped him repeatedly and cried aloud my daddy my daddy my dear dear daddy dobson how glad am i to see you once again how is my mammy my dear mammy how is little tommy and little rachel and all our dear family  the old man then respectfully withdrawing a space i dont know you my sweet master said he i never saw you before indeed but you did many and many a time and often cried harry you carried me in your arms almost the livelong day and pressed and hushed me to sleep at night in your bosom dont you remember your little harry dont you remember my two dogs dont you remember my cock  o exclaimed the good old man i now believe that you are my child the dearest child that ever was born but i never hoped to see him such a thing as you are i never thought to see such a glorious creature upon earth  here old dobson returned harrys caresses with a twofold force and blubbering all aloud had like to have smothered him with the intenseness of his embraces  bring me bring me cried harry to the sight of my dearest mammy i am all impatient to behold her  not so fast said gaffer dobson i love my old loving cate and should she find you out of a sudden she would certainly die of joy but i will bring you to her as a stranger and so you may bring matters about and indeed i fear that my own head is likely to be crazed by this business for i do not find that i am the same man that i was a while agone i shall grow too proud i doubt and look down upon all my better neighbors  goodman dobson then conducted harry to their ancient habitation nurse dobson was just up and preparing to comb the heads of her children when they entered  cate says he i have brought to you a young stranger who says he can give you some account of our little harry who says he is still alive notwithstanding all your frights and will shortly pay a visit to some parts of this country and who knows then but that we among others may happen to set our eyes upon him and that i think would be a great blessing my cate  o no no no exclaimed nurse without deigning to cast her eyes on the stranger he is dead he is gone from me these many many years i once hoped to have his infant on my knee and in my bosom but that hope is quite gone never never shall i behold my darling again  harry had seated himself just opposite to nurse when looking up she started and stared eagerly in his face dont impose upon me william says she tell me tell me at once mayhap this is my child ah against the world the dimple in that smile is the dimple of my harry  here harry sprung up and at one leap caught his rising nurse in his arms crying my mammy my mammy my dearest mammy do i live to be pressed once more to your dear bosom  but the poor woman breathed short and could not get out a word twenty times she put him from her and catched him to her again gazing at him by intervals with a frantic affection at length she cast herself back on the bench that was behind her and clapping her hands together she gave a great shout and burst into an hysterical passion of tears while harry seated himself beside her and gently drawing her head to him placed it fondly on his bosom and mixed his tears with here is  this gush came very seasonably for our loving nurses relief she soon recovered her breath and her senses and seeing some drops on her harrys cheeks she drew them in with her lips crying precious pearls be these i would not exchange one of them for the brightest diamond in the mines  mammy says harry i stole away to come and see you while my father was asleep or else i should not have had leave to stir from him a foot but you and my daddy must promise to come and dine with me we will have a table by ourselves and do you my dear mammy step to our house and if my father should miss me tell him i am gone into the town and will be back with him before breakfast  harry then stepped to the village and remembering gaffer trucks house he went familiarly in and enquired of the good woman how all the family was pray how is my honest old bartholemew says he and how is your pretty daughter molly and above all what is become of my old friend tom the poor woman all in amazement cried a pretty tom he is forsooth to be friend to such a sweet young gentleman as you are but truth is that our tom is at prentice to a barber at next door well says harry when gaffer truck comes home tell him that his old acquaintance harry clinton called to see him  tom had just finished an operation on a neighbor as our hero entered how are you tom says he carelessly tom gaped and stared and gaped but answered not a word will you give me a cast of your office tom ay that i will master as soon you get a beard why tom you are grown a huge hulking fellow since i saw you last will you step to yonder green and wrestle one fall with me no no master i should hurt you methinks i could throw a dozen of such fairweather gentlemen as you are master  harry instantly seized tom by the breast with one hand and by the shoulder with the other when tom feeling the hardness and hurt of his gripe immediately exerted his powers and grappled with his adversary but harry giving him a slight foot laid him on the broad of his back in the middle of his own floor but kept him with both hands from being hurt against the ground  i believe said tom rising you must zertainly be the devil and come as they say to fling poor sinners in the shape of an angel of light ah tom tom cried harry this is not the first struggle that you and i have had do you remember the bag of nuts and poor blind tommy have you forgot your old friend your little harry clinton  blessed mercy exclaimed tom can you be my young lord my hearts dear young master i am indeed answered harry your old acquaintance my dear tom your loving friend harry clinton and so saying he took tom about the neck and kissed him very cordially  tom says harry i want you to take a walk with me tom instantly assented and out they went  as they walked along harry began to grow sad tom said he do you know where my dear brother dickey was buried yes sir said tom a great way off in yonder church yard below the towns end do you know where the sexton lives tom in a little white house sir just joining the yard  as soon as they arrived tom called out the sexton and harry putting a guinea into his hand ordered him directly to unlock the family vault  the man looked astonished but obeyed in silence and harry as he entered desired the sexton and tom to wait at a distance and promised to be with them by and by  he put to the door after him just leaving light enough to distinguish the recent deposits of the dead  o said he as he advanced thou true house of mourning thou silent end of all men how sad art thou to sense how sad to me above all who bear in thy dark bosom such precious and beloved relics  then casting himself on the coffins of my lady and lord richard as they lay side by side and clasping his arms about them as far as he could reach o he cried my mother my brother my dearest brother my dearest mother you are gone you are gone from me and you never knew the love that your son and brother had for you ah how did i flatter myself what happiness did i not propose in attending serving and pleasing you in doing thousands of tender kindly and endearing offices about you but you are snatched from me my mother you are snatched from me my brother all my prospects are defeated and cut away for ever you will no more return to me but i shall go to you and o that i were laid with you this minute in this still and peaceful mansion where hopes and fears cease and all are humbled together  mean while mr meekly and gone abroad on his mornings walk he met nurse on her way to the mansion house and accosting her in a kind of triumph my good nurse says he we have blessed tidings for you your harry your hero is come to the country i know it sir i know it answered nurse it is but a little while ago that my babe left my bosom  mr meekly then proceeded in order to join his young friend enquiring of all he met which way lord henry went till at last he was directed to the church yard there he found tom and the sexton who on further question silently pointed to the door of the family vault that hung on the jar  mr meekly felt himself affected and withdrew to a greater distance but still keeping his tearful eye on the sad mansion that now held the living with the dead  at length harry came forth drying his cheeks with his handkerchief he assumed a constrained air of cheerfulness and joining tom and the sexton observed that a great crowd was gathering in the town  who are those tom says he i suppose answered tom your honors tenants and old acquaintances who are getting together to welcome you to the country if that is the case tom we must go and salute them and you shall introduce me and tell me who is who  mr meekly perceiving that harry was on his return kept onward aloof from him but with an eye on his motions  by this time the crowd had sorted themselves the principals of the families into one group the young men into another and the fair maidens into another and as harry approached they all set up a joint shout of triumph  please your honor says tom this is my father and this is gaffer gubbins and this goodman demster and this farmer felster and so on  harry with the lowliness of a washer of feet would have kissed and embraced them all in turns but pressing about him they seized a hand on either side and eagerly kissed them as also the skirts of his clothes all round  god bless your sweet face god bless your sweet face cried goodman demster who so sees it in a morning cannot fail i think of prospering the livelong day  when he came in succession to the companions of his infancy as he kissed and shook hands with each in turn some reminded him of his having beat them at boxing others at wrestling and all of his having played with them at prisonbars leapfrog shoot the gate and so forth  mean while the girls panted gazed at him and longed to get him to themselves sir says tom here is your old acquaintance my sister molly there is not a lad in the town whom she is not able to toss except your honor molly looked full of health as haebe and rosey as the may and harry caught her about the neck and kissed her very cordially do you remember me molly o answered molly i shall never forget since your honors lordship and i used to wrestle every day behind our house ay molly cried harry there was no harm in it then but a fall at this day might be dangerous to one of us above all things take care of that my good molly and if you know ere a pretty lad to whom you have a liking i will give you fifty guineas for old acquaintance sake toward making up your portion  the rest of the girls now pressed for their share of harry and it was with difficulty that he divided himself with any satisfactory equality among them as they all kissed him so close and seemed so loath to part  at length harrys watch reminded him that it was time to attend his father and as he parted they shouted after him long life and health and honors to our townsman our own boy our own dear sweet child  in the mean time mr meekly had returned home with his heart full of tidings to the earl when harry arrived breakfast was on table and he perceived that his father had been in tears but no notice was taken of the affair at the charnel house on either part  when breakfast was over harry called in john mr john says he can you tell me how many families there are in this village of yours twenty five families exactly my lord then harry turned to his father and said if your lordship will be pleased to lend me five hundred guineas for the present i will pay you very honestly the hour that my uncle comes to the country why sirrah cried the earl pleasantly what right has your uncle to pay your debts especially to such a great amount as you speak of o my lord answered harry i have already squandered away above fifty thousand pounds of his money and this is but a trifle which i am sure i may very safely add to the rest  here the earl looked truly astonished fifty thousand pounds he exclaimed impossible harry why you had neither such ponds or lakes as mine in london wherein you might make ducks and drakes of them how in the world could you contrive it where did you dispose of them  in hospitals and in prisons my father answered harry in streets and highways among the wretched and the indigent supplying eyes to the blind and limbs to the lame and cheerfulness to the sorrowful and broken of heart for such was my uncles orders  let me go let me go from this place my lord cried meekly this boy will absolutely kill me if i stay any longer he overpowers he suffocates me with the weight of his sentiments  well harry said the earl go to my desk here is the key of the drawer on the left hand and i make you a present of the key and the contents perhaps you may find there nearly as much as will answer your present exigencies  harry went and opening the drawer was astonished to see it quite full of gold however he took no more than just the sum proposed and returning to his father said what shall i do my lord with that vast heap of money why you extravagant rogue replied the earl there is not as much in it as will pay the debt you have contracted with one man o cried harry i am quite easy upon that score i will never affront my uncle by the offer of a penny and dont you think said the earl that we have got poor among us in the country as well as you have in the city harry i believe you may have got some my lord but then i am much more difficult than you may think in the objects on whom i would choose to confer charity i look upon the money amassed by the wealthy to have been already extracted from the earnings of the poor the poor farmer the poor craftsman the hardhanded peasant and the day labourer whose seven children perhaps subsist on the milk of a couple of cows wherefore the objects on whom we bestow these gatherings ought at least to be something poorer and more worthy of compassion than those from whom the money was exacted so saying he stepped out  amazing boy cried mr meekly how new and yet how just was that observation i am cried the earl as it were in a kind of delicious dream and can scarce yet believe myself so blessed as to be the father of such a child  in the mean time harry had called john aside mr john says he here are five hundred guineas be pleased to step and distribute them by twenty guineas to each of the families in the village i would save you the trouble and give them myself but that for the present my heart turns with disgust from their thanks and their honors tell them that this is a token in memory of my dear brother to keep them in mind of him tell them further that i will have no carousals no rejoycings on account of my arrival and that it would please me infinitely better if my return would bring their late losses to their remembrance and set them all in tears and lamentations  my lord now proposed a saunter into the park in order to procure an appetite for dinner accordingly the gate was ordered to be unlocked and they entered on a gravel walk that was walled in on the left hand and paled in on the right along the verge of five canals that fell successively in cascades the one into the other beyond the canals a vast lawn fled the eye thinly interspersed with trees of different hues and natures the lawn again was closed by an extensive lake and on the further side of the lake there rose and sunk several glens that varied their forms to the prospect as they walked beyond the glens there arose again to the eye a huge forest of timeimmemorial oaks and beyond all there ascended a range of romantic mountains whose fronts were whitened here and there with impending rocks but whose tops scaled the heavens and confounded their forms and colors with the clouds  as they talked and walked along they met with a six barred gate that directly thwarted their passage and my lord reached his hand through the rails for the key that the keeper had left in the lock on the inside but he could not get at it we are all at a full stop now said he unless harry could make a shift to climb over the gate but no dont my dear your foot might happen to slip between the rails and hurt you i will obey your lordship answered harry i will not venture a foot upon one of them so saying he catched at the topmost bar with his left hand and throwing himself slightly over opened the gate for his companions the earl and mr meekly stood mute in utter astonishment at length the earl cried child you must surely be of more than mortal mould or else you have a familiar spirit that conveys you through the air i have indeed a familiar spirit my lord answered harry a spirit much humbled by the sense of its own defects  on their return john called his master aside and told him of his due distribution of harrys bounty to the villagers but my lord said he when i went down i found them all very busily employed in preparing bonfires and illuminations in honor of my young lord this however i was obliged to countermand by his special order and it has greatly mortified all your poor people well well said the earl it cannot be helped for the present we must not dare to offend our harry at any rate and so those matters of rejoicing may rest in reserve till the arrival of my brother  soon afterward our heros fosterers came decked out in their best attire and harry ordered a side table to be covered for him and them but my lord insisted on their dining all together  harry placed himself very lovingly between them at table that he might help them and prevail upon their bashfulness to eat  when the repast was nearly over nurse enquired after the little beggarboy whose absence she imagined had caused the elopement of her darling he is come to great fortune answered harry he has found his father and mother and is heir to a large estate harry then told the manner in which ned had been discovered and they were all highly pleased and affected by the relation  but mammy says harry what is become of my sister nelly on whose milk i was suckled and what is become of my little brother tommy who was but two years younger than myself  they are both dead my precious but god has been pleased to give me others in their room  well mammy i find we must all die and some time or other that will be a great grief to one of us whichever of us shall happen to outlive the other i am satisfied to die once said nurse but never let me hear again of your dying my angel i cannot suffer the thought she cried and burst forth into tears i could not bear i could not bear to die a thousand deaths in the death of my harry  but mammy said harry in order to divert her passion you have not yet enquired after the man with the beard o the old rogue exclaimed nurse i cannot think of him with patience ay but mammy you must know that that same old rogue is my own darling uncle an own and only dear brother to my own dear father here if that is the case said nurse i dont wonder he should so greatly yearn after you and indeed i would rather wonder if all the world did not yearn and long after you my love  and now mammy to show you how much you are obliged to this same darling uncle he has ordered me to make you a present of five hundred pounds in payment as he says of the grief he has cost you and take no heed for your children mammy i will take that care upon myself for this same dear uncle has made me a gift of the lands and house and plate and furniture that he has in this town and so you see i am well able to provide for you all  here my lord cast an eye of tender jealousy upon harry i perceive my son said he that your uncle is your only trust the only dependence that you choose to have upon earth harry with a glance of his eye instantly caught the meaning of the eye of his father and throwing himself at his feet o pardon my lord he cried pray pardon the overflowings of a grateful and simple heart my uncle is my property but i am yours my father to be disposed of in life and in death at your pleasure i do trust i do depend upon you my father and you have already overpowered me with the weight of your affections  my lords eyes then glistened and raising his son and taking him fondly to his bosom i believe i have been wrong my love said he and hereafter i shall always think so rather than think any thing amiss in my harry but tell me my dear and tell me sincerely you speak of your uncle as one of the richest and greatest men upon earth as a prince as an emperor enabled to give away fortunes and provinces at pleasure  and he is my lord cried harry he is greater than any prince or emperor upon earth to speak only of his temporal wealth and power the most inconsiderable part of his value he can do as i may say what he pleases in england the ministry are at his beck they profess themselves his servants and even his majesty acknowledges himself deeply his debtor and owes him i dare say half a million of sterling english  and yet this is the man exclaimed the earl turning an eye of penitence on mr meekly this is the man as i told you my friend on whom i looked down with such provoking contempt whom i treated with such unpardonable insolence and ignominy  my lord then enquired concerning the personal adventures of our hero in london the account of which would have been more entertaining had not harry suppressed throughout his narration whatever he apprehended might tend to his own honor  as soon as the fosterers had taken their leave my lord proposed a walk to his guests in the gardens and after a few turns they sat down in a rural arbor that was interwoven all about with jessamine and honeysuckle  mr meekly said the earl i have often longed to hear the particulars of your life and how you came to live by faith and not by sight and to hold your conversation in heaven as you do at this day  i can soon obey your lordship answered meekly for my story is very short and very simple and no way adorned with uncommon incidents  my mother died a few hours after i was born my father did not survive her two years and i fell to the care of my only kinsman an uncle by my fathers side  my uncle was an old bachelor and though he was of a cold temper and had no tenderness for any one he yet spared no cost in my education he sent me to eaton school and from thence to cambridge where i remained till i took my degrees i then went to london bought a sword and swordknot and commenced fine gentleman  though my head had been duly stored by my tutors in the rudiments of our religion my heart had not yet felt any of its precepts and i conceived that to go regularly to church receive the sacrament confess myself a miserable sinner and avoid gross vices was the sum of christianity i therefore entered without scruple into all the fashionable pleasures and vanities of the age and i held that to pardon an affront would have been one of the deadly sins in a gentlemanchristian  one day at jamess coffeehouse colonel stannard and another gentleman engaged at backgammon for five hundred guineas and as the stake was so considerable and both parties celebrated for their skill in the game we all crowded about them to see the issue  i happened to be next behind the colonels chair and others pressed behind me eagerly bending and looking over my shoulders at length he began to fret as the game was drawing to a close and going against him pray gentlemen he would cry dont bear upon me so for heavens sake keep off you will make me lose the game hereupon i did my utmost to bear back from him but the company pressed me forward in spite of all i could do till the colonel giving an unhappily decisive cast turned about in a fury and spit directly in my face  indignation gave me sudden and unusal strength and casting all off who had borne upon me i instantly drew my sword and ran the colonel through the body the company cried out that all was fair and opening a window for me they urged me to escape accordingly i got off rode post to dover and there embarked for france  the colonel god be praised did not die of his wound he lay under the hands of the doctors for about seven months then recovered and went to join his regiment in flanders  of this my uncle sent me advice telling me at the same time that i might return with safety yes thought i with safety to my life but with death to my honor i have taken revenge indeed but not satisfaction the colonel must be compelled to make me personal reparation for the affront which he dared to put upon me his recovery has again dashed the spit into my face and i will pursue him through the world till it is wiped from the observation and remembrance of all men  with this deadly determination i went post from paris to flanders and traced the colonel from place to place till i found him in a village on the road to amsterdam  i believe sir said i bluntly you may not remember me for our acquaintance was sudden and of very short duration i am the man in whose face you spit publicly at jamess coffeehouse then sir said he i am scarce yet recovered of the cause which you gave me to bear you always in mind but pray what may your commands be with me for the present i am come to demand a remedy at your hands for the wound which you gave my honor and which otherwise must remain for ever incurable ah he cried no man ever exacted so severe a satisfaction as you have already taken what then may be the nature of the further reparation that you are pleased to require either to ask my pardon or fight me within this hour  that is very hard upon me indeed replied the colonel the honor of my commission will not allow me to beg pardon of any man at least in order to avoid a combat so sir if you insist upon it i must obey your summons though very reluctantly i confess then sir said i meet me in half an hour with your pistols and sword behind yonder little hill  the colonel was punctual to the appointment we both grasped a pistol at a distance of twenty paces and advancing step by step cried fire fire fire each seeming determined to make sure of his adversary till coming within arms length i fired directly in his face but the ball passed through his hat and only grazed the skin of his left temple  the colonel then took his pistol into his left hand and reaching out his right to me with a smile of great complacence i think sir said he i may now ask your pardon with honor and to convince you that i did not come to engage you in malice be pleased to examine my arms you will not find so much as a grain of powder in the one or the other  ah colonel i then exclaimed i acknowledge you my conqueror both in honor and humanity had i been so unhappy as to kill you and find your arms unloaded i should certainly have done you justice by shooting myself through the head but why did i pursue you from kingdom to kingdom why was i unappeased by all the blood that i shed was it from any malignity of heart toward you by no means but while i lamented the misery i had already occasioned you i was impelled to finish your destruction by a barbarian world or rather by the bloody prescribers of custom whose censure i dreaded worse than death or even futurity courage colonel incites soldiers to fight for their country but it is cowardice alone that drives duellists together  for three affectionate days i remained with my late enemy but now warm friend he then was obliged to return to quarters and we parted with a regret much exceeding the hostility with which we had met  on the departure of the colonel i went to amsterdam from whence i drew upon my uncle to the amount of l 00 for i resolved before my return to take a tour through the seven provinces though i had gone for a very different purpose  during nine months i resided or journeyed from place to place among that people holland is unquestionably the wealthiest the busiest and most populous state upon earth not a hand is unemployed not a foot of ground unoccupied and for a long time i ascribed their extraordinary prosperity to an industry and ingenuity peculiar to them alone but on further observation i discovered the true source as well of their industry as their opulence and am persuaded that any nation bordering on the ocean might derive the like prosperity from the same spring  not my lord that i think opulence a real benefit to a people for mans life consists not in the abundance of his possessions but i look upon industry the natural parent of opulence to be as well a blessing as a duty to man from the time that he was appointed to earn his bread in the sweat of his brow many mental virtues also as well as temporal benefits follow in the train of industry it makes men healthful brave honest social and pacific he who labors hard to acquire a property will struggle hard to preserve it and exercise will make him active robust and able for the purpose as the man of industry has in himself a living fund of competence for his own occasions he will be the less tempted to plunder or prey upon others and the poignant sense and apprehension of being deprived of a property so justly acquired will give him the nicer and stronger sense of such an injury to others industry further incites to commerce and good neighborhood in order to dispose of mutual redundancies for the supply of mutual wants and lastly it delights in peace that its time and its labors may not be interrupted nor the fruits thereof endangered by rapine and invasion and all this may be said of nations as well as of men  your observations said the earl are perfectly just the works of industry are unquestionably the works of peace and tend to open the avenues wherein the virtues may walk but how to incite men or nations to industry that is the question the finer arts we see may be encouraged and promoted by national bounties as now in france but there is no inciting the bulk of the people to industry in like manner that would be as though the public should grant a bounty to itself nations certainly differ from nations as man differs from man some are by nature industrious and ingenious such as china and holland it is their propensity their talent while others like ireland are naturally lazy and listless and therefore remain in well merited indigence  you have greatly mistaken this point indeed my lord china and holland are industrious and ingenious because whether it were through good hap or good policy they hit upon the only method whereby industry and ingenuity could be duly promoted whereas great britain and ireland are totally ignorant of the said method to this day though both of them highly capable of having it put in execution  you surprise me mr meekly said the earl a method to make men ingenious a method to make them industrious how can that be  experience has proved it to be even so my lord for where a method may be found for encouraging and promoting ingenuity and industry that method will infallibly make people become both ingenious and industrious no man will work my lord without some hire or wages or return for his labor neither will any who are in want refuse to work when assured of a due reward for so doing  when the good householder walked out to the marketplace and found laborers loitering there when it was now toward evening he asked them why stand ye here all the day idle and when they answered because no man has hired or given us employment he took this for a sufficient apology he had compassion upon them and he supplied them with the divinest of all kinds of charity the means of earning their own bread  now throughout china and holland no person is in want because all are hired all employed the young and the old the lame and the blind and all find a ready sale without anxiety or loss of time without travel or delay for the products of their industry throughout great britain on the contrary nineteen in twenty are in real want and in ireland as i am told forty nine in fifty are nearly in a state of beggary merely for want of being employed for want of encouragement to labor  permit me then to explain to your lordship how some men and some nations come to be encouraged to industry and others to be discouraged or in a manner prohibited from it  different men are endowed with different talents and powers insufficient in many respects though superfluous in others to their own occasions different countries are also endowed with different productions superfluous in many respects to the natives though necessary or desirable for the wellbeing of foreigners  now these alternate qualities of deficience and abundance at once invite and impel all men and all countries to claim and to impart that reciprocal assistance which is denominated commerce each gives what he can spare each receives what he wants the exchange is to the mutual advantage of all parties and could a method be found out for encouraging manufacturers to persevere in their industry and improve in their arts by a ready conveyance and sale of all their redundancies neither want nor superfluity could find place upon earth  all this is quite clear and selfevident mr meekly but how to procure this ready sale is the question  your lordship must allow that the way to procure it would be to bring barterers and commuters buyers and sellers all who mutually want and mutually abound together for this is the end and purpose of every market upon earth  now in great britain and ireland and in all continents or inland countries the several deserts mountains marshes and other obstacles with the difficulty danger and toil of travel and the great expense of land carriage have utterly precluded all commerce and communication to any considerable extent insomuch that it would be easier and cheaper to convey a commodity of any burden to either of the indies than from many parts of great britain or ireland to others by land  while god appears to separate the several nations of the earth from each other by the intervention of seas lakes and rivers he has actually and intimately united them thereby  water serves to the art and navigation of man as air serves to the wings of the feathered species it is the easy and speedy medium the ready conduit and conveyance whereby all redundancies are carried and all wants supplied it makes man as it were a denizen of every country on the globe it shortens every distance and ties the remotest regions together it carries and communicates the knowledge the virtues manufactures and arts of each climate to all it gives new springs and motives to industry action and invention it gives a general importance to the meanest manufacturer it gives to each man an interest in whatever is done upon earth the productions of every region and the tribute of every nation  now china and holland are the only countries upon earth who have considerably availed themselves of this capital benefit of watercarriage or watercommerce and therefore they are incomparably the most populous and most prosperous of all countries in the world  china as your lorship knows extends from under the tropic of cancer to about thirteen hundred miles north and thereby contains within itself all the variety of climate and degrees of heat and cold that are requisite for the sundry productions upon earth inspired by some forecast or sagacity not imparted to the rest of mankind they cut and quartered this vast continent by as many navigable canals as answer to the ducts and veins in the human body for the dispensation of life and nourishment these canals serve as links or chords to the grand community of the chinese they bind region to region house to house and man to man and hold the whole as one system or family together this great kingdom is thereby become as one city and the canals as so many streets through which plenty is diffused by commerce to every part if any art or useful invention commences or receives improvement in any place it is immediately conveyed to every place for imitation and promotion no portion of this wide continent lies waste or uncultivated because the canals are as so many markets brought to every mans door and by the perpetual demand of whatever is saleable incite the natives to exert themselves in providing all the redundancies they possibly can that they may derive wealth to themselves by supplying the respective wants of others thus throughout the expanded dominion of china nothing is wasted nothing lost nothing superfluous nothing wanting all are employed active industrious ingenious and thriving their canals are intimately to them what seas are diffusively to the rest of the globe they are thereby become as a world within themselves sufficient to their own happiness and occasions they never change their manners or policy they never enterprise war against others and china is affirmed at this day to contain one hundred and twenty million of prospering inhabitants  the dutch also about a hundred and forty years ago followed the example of the chinese their country is now become as one great and extended metropolis to the universe and through their canals as through paved and spacious highways the world resorts with all its wealth so encouraged and so incited neither the lame nor the blind nor the maimed sit unemployed every child is taught its trade from the moment it can apply its little hands to a regular motion and they bring to the parents vast sums in lieu of an infinite variety of toys and trifles that are dispersed among the idle of the other children of men for barterers and commuters buyers and sellers manufacturers and merchants like pyramus and thisbe want nothing but the removal of envious obstacles to meet and to multiply a similary progeny  from what has been premised my lord it is most evident that industry is the parent of the wealth of this world that no mans industry is sufficient to his own occasions that the mutual assistance denominated commerce is therefore necessary to the wellbeing of all people that the reciprocal advantage of this commerce consists in supplying mutual wants with mutual redundancies that this commerce however cannot be carried on without a medium for the conveyance of such supplies that such a medium by land even where it is practicable is tedious toilsome expensive extremely discouraging and cannot be pushed to any considerable extent or effect that god however has opened for the purpose an easy speedy and universal medium of seas lakes and rivers part of which he has left unnavigable that man might finish by art what nature had prepared and contribute in some degree to his own advantages that accordingly china and holland and france of late have pursued the path so divinely appointed and that power wealth and prosperity have flowed in upon them in proportion as they have opened the medium of watercarriage for their reception and that causes which have produced their concomitant effects without variation from the earliest ages to the present period must be presumed to produce the like effects through all countries and ages to the end of time  i protest mr meekly exclaimed the earl you have pushed this matter into mathematical demonstration what a happy what a glorious prospect now opens to my view how easily how speedily how profitably might this method be put in execution throughout the earth there is no deficiency of rivers or collateral streams for the purpose the sinking into the earth would give vent to new springs and extract plenty of water in all places for an inland navigation and half the number of hands that perish through war and want might be peacefully and plentifully employed in accomplishing this weal of mankind famine and depredation would then cease nation would no longer rise up against nation nor man against man the earth by culture would soon become capable of sustaining tenfold the number of its present inhabitants we should no more be tempted to push each other from existence we should find ourselves mutually interested in preserving and multiplying the lives of all from whose labors we were to derive such advantages all would be plenty all peace and benevolence throughout the globe the number of inhabitants instead of being a burden would then become the riches of every climate all hands would be set to work when thus assured of a purchaser for every effect of labor the buzz of wheels reels and looms the sound of hammers files and forges with the shouts of vintage and the songs of harvest would be heared in all lands i am quite astonished that a work so full of benefit and blessing to the universe of man is not already commenced advanced and completed  how comes this to pass mr meekly have you yet mentioned this matter to any of our great ones  i have my lord to several they confessed themselves convinced of the utility of the scheme and could each of them be assured of engrossing to himself the most considerable part of the profits that would thereby accrue to the public the work would instantly be begun and would shortly be perfected for such is the nature of unregenerate man that he grudges to others any portion of those goods which he so eagerly craves and grapples after for himself he would hedge in the air and make a property of the light in proportion as he sees his neighbors in comparative want he exults in the accumulation of imaginary wealth but should he deem them in a measure more prosperous than himself he sighs at his inmost soul and grows wretched and repining  i protest cried the earl were i young i would to morrow morning at my own cost set about this great work of national or rather of universal beneficence but my harry here has youth enough with an abundance of benevolence also for the purpose and i recommend it to him as the greatest of charities a charity to great britain a charity to mankind what would you think my lord said harry of my expending your whole drawer of gold upon this business great as it is it would be but a small matter toward the value of purchasing peace upon earth and the sons of peace upon earth will be likeliest to be the sons of love in heaven so that we cannot lay out our money to better advantage in any purchase for the benefit of the brothers of our own frailty  alas my love rejoined mr meekly though you were master of half the wealth of the people of england and were willing to employ the whole for their emolument in this way the people themselves would oppose you in every step you should take some would be too proud to accept a benefit from you others would tell you that no man should dare to violate their property with either spade or pickaxe and others would indict you even for treading on their grounds nothing less than the act of the whole legislature to whom the people have committed their confluent powers can avail for an undertaking of such national import  then my dear mr meekly be pleased to let me have in writing what you have already set forth on this head and if i live to come to the lower house of parliament i will bend all my powers to this capital charity and if no other oratory will avail for the purpose i will bribe the members with a hundred thousand pounds and corrupt them if possible into one act of patriotism it is observable that within ten years subsequent to the period of the above prouie the inland navigation of england commenced since which time the river isis has been made navigable from oxford to cricklade in wiltshire and to abington in berkshire the river avon in warwickshire from stratford to the severn the avon from bath to bristol the medway from maidstone in kent to tunbridge the lug in herefordshire to the wey the lea from ware to the thames the river kennet in berkshire to the thames at reading containing  0 locks in    miles the river are in yorkshire containing    locks whose tolls are now valued at about l 0000 yearly beside the stroud the nen and the wey with many others now in island  but mr meekly i interrupt you pray proceed in your narrative  on my return to amsterdam from my tour through the seven provinces i grew affected one evening in a manner i had never before experienced i did not feel myself any way sick or in pain and yet i wished to exchange my sensations for any other species of malady i was wholly pervaded by a gloomy despondence i looked abroad for comfort but it was no where to be found every object gave disgust to my discontented imagination i secretly enquired of my soul if riches honors dignities if the empire of the world would restore her to joy but she turned from them and said all these things are strangers and aliens to my peace alas said i tell me then where your peace may be found i know not she replied but i feel that i am wretched  for three days i continued under this oppression of spirit and on the third night an increasing horror of deep and heavy darkness fell upon me all hope died within me and misery seemed to open a gulf of ever deepening destruction in my soul i lay all the night bathed in drops of unutterable anguish i wished and struggled to arise and change my situation but i felt that my mind was its own place and its own hell from whence there was no removal no possible escape  i now concluded that some how i must have sinned beyond the measure of all sinners since my damnation was deeper than that of any other i therefore turned toward god and wished to repent but as i did not feel conviction for the sins of which i accused myself no place for repentance was found in my soul  tremendous author i cried i find that thou can sink and slay at pleasure but can thou not also raise up and make alive if all things have their existence in thee o god is it not near and easy unto thee to impart to us some sensation of thine own existence also some sensation of thine own peace the sense that it is thou alone who can be our sustainer save me jesus save me from the hell of mine own nature save me thou son of david o save me from myself  while i thus prayed in an agony my whole frame was suddenly overpowered and sunk as i suppose into a state of insensibility till the following day was far advanced at length i perceived that i still existed  i dreamed that i found myself in a deep and noisome dungeon without a single ray that might even suffice to show me the horrors of my situation i attempted to rise and grope about but i perceived that i was tied and fastened down to earth by a number and variety of bands and fetters  at length a sudden light appeared and diffused itself throughout the darkness of my mansion when looking up i observed that the keeper of my prison had entered the doors being yet locked his head as i thought was bound about with a tiara from whence the glory arose that shone around me in the coronet instead of gems were inserted a number of thorns whose points streamed with incessant and insufferable brightness and on the golden circlet was engraved in all languages jesus of nazareth king of the jews  immediately my shackles loosened and fell away of themselves and i wished to cast my whole existence under the feet of my lord but was so overcome with ecstasy that i could not rise when looking upon me with a smile of ineffable graciousness he approached and took me by the hand and at the contact i sprung up a great height in my bed and awoke to sensations of indescribable blessedness  you are come then my lord my salvation you are come my master i cried and i will cling inseparably to you never o never more will i suffer you to depart ah i have felt severely felt what it is to be without you for in your absence though but for a moment lies the essence of hell and misery but in your presence my beloved in your presence is peace unspeakable and joy for ever more  from that day my nature became as it were wholly inverted all the honors and worldly respects for which i formerly risqued my life were now my aversion and i turned from carnal indulgence and sensuality with loathing  nothing could now affront nothing could now offend me as i totally despised myself so i wished after the process of my divine master to be despised and rejected of men this made all others the very meanest of human creatures respectable unto me even in reprobates methought i discerned some unerased traces of the image and superscription of my god and i bowed down before it  if any attempted to injure or defraud me of my property i yielded it without variance and thereby i found myself cordially enriched  i grew weary of my own will and of my own liberty and i earnestly prayed my lord that he would rid me of them and be instead thereof a controuling principle within me ever influencing and directing me according to his own pleasure turn me jesus master o turn me i cried from all the evil propensities of my own evil nature though thou should turn me as thou did sennacherib with thy ruling rein on my neck thy bridle in my mouth and thy hook in my nose take my heart and affections captive and into thine own divine guidance compel me into all the ways and all the works of thy commandments till thy yoke shall become easy and thy burden light and delightsome till i shall move as down a descent wherever thy goodness would guide me till i shall feelingly find and know that all thy ways are ways of pleasantness and all thy paths the paths of peace  this my lord may look somewhat like boasting but it boasts of naught excepting christ crucified or rather arisen in me whereby all worldly matters are crucified unto me  within about a fortnight after my conversion i received a letter from a friend in london informing me that my old uncle had secretly married a young creature who was lately delivered of a son that he now openly acknowledged her for his wife and that this as he feared did not bode me any good  at another time these tidings would have greatly alarmed me but i was now equally resigned and indifferent to all events  in a few days after as i was stepping out of my lodgings i was arrested in the name and at the suit of my uncle for l 00 the precise sum for which i had drawn upon him about nine months before all the consequences of this caption immediately occurred to me i perceived that my uncle intended to deprive me of my patrimony in favor of his new family and as i had no means for opposing his machinations save what lay in his own hands i concluded that a jail was to be my portion for life wherefore i lifted up my heart and said within myself to prisons and to death give me cheerfully to follow thee o thou who in death art the life and resurrection  my spirit had no sooner uttered this short ejaculation than i felt such a weight of peace descending upon me that my heart leaped within me at the prospect of suffering and i would not have exchanged my prison for a throne  while i quietly walked with the officers toward the place of my durance they came to a great tavern where they entered and proposed to regale themselves at my expense  mean time a dutch merchant of great eminence happened to be with his lady in the principal room and hearing a bustle in the house he enquired the cause and sent for the chief bailiff  soon after i was conducted into their presence they both rose as i entered and the gentleman approaching took me familiarly by the hand and said in dutch mr meekly i hear you are in distress and that is sufficient to recommend you to my services but your appearance exacts something more from my inclinations pray let me know wherein and how far it may be requisite for you to command me  i muttered somewhat as i suppose inarticulately toward an answer for i protest my lord i was so struck so awed so confounded by his presence that i was lost for the time to the consideration of my own affairs mean while he placed me at table just opposite to the heavenly vision of his bride and then went and resumed his seat beside her while i gazing in silence and utmost wonder recollected those lines of milton where speaking of adam and eve he calls them the loveliest pair that ever since in loves embraces met  adam the goodliest man of men since born his sons the fairest of her daughters eve   the gentleman perceived my astonishment and graciously smiling again asked me what sum was requisite to extricate me from my present difficulty ah sir said i it is a sum that far exceeds all human bounty and indeed i would not accept the obligation from any man unless i were assured of being shortly in a capacity to reimburse him of which i see no likelihood i think no possibility  here i told him in few words how my father had left me an infant at the disposal of my uncle who had now put me under arrest for l 00 which some time since he had freely remitted to me as in my own right  i see said the gentleman your uncle is a villain and means by casting you into prison in a strange and distant place to deprive you of the power of bringing him to account but he must be detected it is a justice which you owe to the public as well as yourself and as the amount of the pretended debt is not sufficient for that purpose here is an order on the bank in town for double the sum for this you must give me your note of hand be pleased to reimburse me when it is your convenience if that should never happen be under no concern for i hold myself already repaid with usury in the opportunity of serving an injured and a worthy man  o sir i cried i cannot indeed i cannot i will not accept it on any account i am patient nay i am pleased with the lot that is appointed me shall i in an instant break the yoke and cast the burden which my gracious master but this instant has laid upon me no sir i submit myself to it with thankfulness i take his cross to my bosom and press it to my heart  o meekly said he you are a very misdeeming christian if you think yourself entitled either to assume or retain your proper crosses at will there is too much of selfrighteousness in such a zeal meekly humility would rather bid the will of our master to be done and he offers you enfranchisement by my hand do my dear sir cried the angel beside him do let me petition let me persuade you to accept this little instance of our good will to so good a creature though my lord here has not been able to prevail a lady has superior claims and i must not be refused  quite sunk quite overwhelmed i dropped involuntarily on my knees before them blessed pair i exclaimed blessed and beauteous beyond expression if angels are like you what happiness must be in heaven i could no more my words were choked by my rising emotions  my benefactor then rose and coming tenderly toward me he took me warmly in his arms my meekly says he do not oppress me i pray you by this excess of acknowledgment i am but a worthless instrument in the hands of your beloved for from him and him alone is every good gift and even the will of the giver o mr meekly added the lady her eyes glittering through water we thank you we cordially thank you mr meekly you have occasioned us much pleasure this day i assure you and the means of our happiness should be delightful in our eyes  my patron then rung a bell and ordered his principal gentleman into his presence when putting the order into his hand here says he take this with the bailiff directly to the bank there pay him his demand of l 00 and fees and bring me a hundred pounds in cash and the remainder in bills on london then calling for pen and ink he drew the following short note i owe you fourteen hundred pounds to which i signed charles meekly  on the return of the messenger i was put in possession of the cash and bills and a dinner of little elegancies was served up  after a short repast the decanters and glasses being placed and the attendants dismissed my two patrons gave a loose to social joy and invited me to be a partaker in their festivity never was i nor ever shall i again be witness to such flights of fancy such a spontaneous fluency of heartspringing glee with what pleasure did erudition cast off its formal garb how delightingly did wisdom assume the semblance and at times the very phrase of childhood they laughed they rallied me themselves and the world their merriment was as the breaking forth and exuberance of overflowing innocence and virtue conceive to yourself my lord a large room surrounded with benches whereon are seated the principal philosophers literati lawyers statesmen chief captains and chief conquerors in all ages then think you behold two sportively observant children in the midst looking and laughing at the insignificance of the several sages taking off and holding up the solemnity and selfimportance of each profession in charicature and setting the whole world with all its wisdom its toils and boasted acquirements its solicitudes applications and achievements at naught  the gentleman indeed pretended and only pretended to defend the sophists the valiant and the renowned of his sex but he evidently exulted in his own defeat while the lady with a drollery amazingly valuble ran through the schools of philosophy the systems of human policy and histories of heroism unpluming the crested bringing the lofty low and depreciating and reducing all magnitude to miniature and all this she did with an archness of such pleasant meaning with such looks eyes and attitudes of bewitching transition as would have infused fascination into old age and ugliness what then must it have done when accompanied by a beauty that scarce ever was equalled that could not be exceeded did the sarah of the patriarch abraham resemble her i wonder not that nations should have been enamoured of her at the age of fourscore  at length the enraptured husband no longer able to contain bent toward her with looks of souldarting delight and restraining his arms that would have crushed her to his bosom o my louisa he cried you are too much too pearly too precious a treasure for me but giving him a sweetly petulant pat on the cheek away you rogue she said i will none of your mockeries  what can expression add further to this divinely preeminent of human creatures whatever was her present glance aspect or posture you would have wished to fix her in it that you might gaze and admire for ever but when she varied the enchantment of her action and attitude you forgot the former attractions and she became as it were a newness of ever rising delight  alas how transient how momentary was the bliss i then enjoyed a chariot and six pied horses drove up to the door attended by a retinue of ten or twelve men all armed gallantly mounted and in rich apparel  my dear meekly mournfully said my benefactor i am sorry that we are destined to different departments hodge to night at a villa belonging to one of my correspondents and tomorrow we set out to visit some of the german courts fare fare you well meekly for a short season at least  i would have east myself at his feet it was an emotion a propensity which i could not resist but he prevented me by kissing and casting his arms affectionately about me the lady then turned to me and with a smile of heartcaptivating graciousness god be with you god be with you my good mr meekly she cried perhaps we may meet ere long in your own england i answered not but bending on one knee i caught her hand pressed it fervently to my lips and permitted her to depart  alas they did depart i saw them for the last time they mounted their carriage and being seated they bent forward and bowing to me with a fixed regard off they drove and tore away with them as i thought the best part of my soul  i followed them with straining eyes when out of sight methought i held them still in view and i blessed and kissed in imagination the very ground over which they went at length i awoke from my delirium and with slow and heavy steps turned back into the house  i had not yet through shame so much as enquired the name of my benefactor i therefore called to my host in order to inform myself of all that i could learn concerning him as also to make out a bill for it had not been called for and i pleased myself with the thought of discharging a reckoning that my friends had forgotten when i questioned my host on this head he put his hands to his sides and broke into a violent fit of laughter no no master said he there is nothing for any one to pay in this house i assure you mynheer never troubles himself about those matters his major domo pays all ay and for every guest too that happens to be in the same inn with his master  why pray said i is he a lord a lord quotha not so little as that comes to neither no sir he is a prince the very prince of our merchants and our merchants are princes above all lords and pray how do they style or call him he has many names and titles when our traders speak of him they call him mynheer van glunthong but others style him my lord of merchants and others my lord the brotherman and my lord the friend of the poor  the remainder of my story is very short and still more insignificant i soon set out for england in order to file a bill against my uncle and compel him to discover what patrimony my father had left me but god was pleased in the mean space to cut off all debate his wife and child had died of an epidemic distemper and he did not survive them above a fortnight he left me a penitential letter with a small will enclosed whereby i became entitled to three hundred a year in right of my father and an additional four hundred in right of my uncle with a sum of near three thousand pounds in ready money  if i know my own heart the only cause of rejoicing that i felt on that occasion was that it put it in my power to discharge my pecuniary obligations to my late generous preserver i immediately wrote and transmitted bills to holland for the purpose but the bills were returned and i could hear no tidings concerning the residence of my patron i then put out his l  00 on the best securities that i could procure it is now close upon five and thirty years since i saw him and in that time the principal with interest upon interest yearly turned into capital has amounted to nearly five thousand pounds one penny of which i never touch but hold the whole as sacred  mean time it has cost me hundreds upon hundreds in correspondencies advertisements and even in special messengers to several parts of europe to discover where this greatest this most eminent of men could have concealed himself but alas my search proved as fruitless as that of the miser in hunting after the pearl of mighty price  during those five and thirty years the image of the persons of those my two gracious patrons never left my memory were ever at my heart ah i would say to myself they are dead they are dead or rapt perhaps like ebjah alive into heaven flesh and blood resmed as theirs might easily pass from its little impurities through the fire of the love of god to the place of its bliss and again it was my daily and ardent petition that if their mortal was not yet swallowed up of immortality i might once set my eyes upon them before i died  here mr meekly ended  i thank you my dear friend said the earl for your history it has entertained me most pleasingly and i have also been highly edified by some passages in it but with respect to the glimpse that you had of your two wonderful friends i think it must have been a vision or merely a matter of imagination for i never saw in nature nor read in fiction of any thing comparable to the excellencies that you have described in that exalted pair if it was a vision my lord it must have been one of blessed angels indeed but i hope you will allow that the benefits which they conferred were no way visionary o mr meekly said harry with a sigh the picture that you have drawn of that dear lady has almost given me a distaste to all the rest of her sex ah might i meet hereafter some daughter some descendent some distant likeness of her how happy should i think myself may heaven succeed your ominous wish my dearest child cried meekly it is just perhaps prophetic that it should be so for never did i see so perfect a resemblance between any two creatures as between the consort of that bewitching woman and yourself it struck me the other night the moment you entered the room and i thought that i beheld my very benefactor newly arisen like a young phoenix from the ashes of old age  near a fortnight more elapsed without any news or notice from mr clinton or from the messenger who was sent dispatch for him harry daily advanced in the favor and familiarity of his father and mr meekly continued with them in a most pleasing society  on a fine morning as they were walking together toward the village this is the first time my harry said the earl with a sigh that i have ventured to turn my face this way since the death of my wife and the interment of your dear brother o my lord cried harry i would gladly exchange my lot in life with the meanest of yonder cottagers who earns his daily bred by the labor of his hands provided i might thereby restore them both to your bosom not so not so my son fervently replied the earl i would not lose my harry though i were thereby to resuscitate all that are dead in england i have no cause no manner of right to complain i am still happy wonderfully happy too happy in the possession of such a child  just then a great shouting and uproar was heard in the village the huge mastiff belonging to peregrine pelt the tanner had run mad and came foaming up the road pursued by thirty of the townsmen armed with staves spits and pitchforks the dog rushed on at such a rate that there was no possibility for our company to escape him and harry observing that he made directly toward his father threw himself full in his way instantly the envenomed monster sprung up and cast himself open mouth upon our hero but harry with a wonderful presence of mind having wrapped his left arm in the skirt of his coat dashed it into the frothing jaws of the terrible animal when giving a trip at the same time to his hinder legs he threw him flat on the ground and springing up into the the air he descended upon him with all the force of his heels and dashed his bowels to pieces whereupon the creature uttered a faint howl sprawled awhile and expired  the earl and mr meekly stood yet a while pale astonished and unassured and my lord looking about in a pannic cried where is the dog what is become of the mad dog in the mean time the villagers came on in full pursuit crying out the mad dog the mad dog take care of the mad dog but when they all arrived and beheld their huge enemy looking formidable even in death never was amazement equal to theirs they stared at the earl meekly and harry in turns and seeing no weapon in any of their hands god cried goodman demster god has been wonderfully gracious in your deliverence my lord for nothing less than a thunderbolt could so suddenly have stricken this monster dead i protest said the earl i was so much alarmed that i know not how it happened i remember nothing further than that my dear child here thrust himself between his father and danger but i beheld said meekly when with one stroke of his arm he dashed the creature to the ground and then instantly crushed him to death with his feet not i mr meekly modestly replied harry god gave me strength for the season in defense of my father but are you not bit are you not hurt my child cried the earl coming up tremblingly to his son not touched indeed my lord glory for that in the highest exultingly cried the earl  i knew exclaimed tom truck with a shout and look of triumph i knew it could be no other but my brave and noble young master who did the feat on my life cried farmer felster he is able with his naked arm like another young david to save his lambs from the jaws of the lion and the paws of the bear  though these praises served only to put our hero to confusion they went trickling like balm of gilead to the heart of his father pelt said the earl let it be your task to flea and tan me the hide of your own dog i will have his skin stuffed with incense and his nails of solid gold and he shall hang up in my hall from generation to generation to commemorate the piety and prowess of my son mean while my good friends i invite you all with your families kinsfolk and neighbors to come and feast with me this day sorrow has endured her night but joy comes with my child and arises on us as a new morning  in the afternoon all the townsfolk and neighbors with their wives and children convened to the great house having their cattle and themselves heavy laden with faggots for a magnificent illumination the whole court was spread with tables and the tables with victuals and liquors beside two hogsheads of october that stood apart  the earl in the joy for his own escape and the recent prowess of his young hero went forth with a cheerful countenance and graciously welcomed all his guests whereat they wished health and long life to his lordship and their young lord and giving a joint huzza sat down to their banquet from whence after a night far spent in carousal their great fire being out and their great hogsheads exhausted they peacefully helped eachother to their respective homes regretting however that they had not been honored with the presence of their young master among them for harry had besought his father to dispense with him yet awhile from partaking in any party or scene of festivity especially when appointed in his own honor and mr meekly highly approved and applauded his motion  on the eve of the following day mr meekly rode abroad on a charitable visit to a dying man in the neighborhood and my lord was fondly toying and patting the cheek of his darling as they stood at the hall door when harry spied a mourning coach turning up the lower end of the great avenue and instantly cried out there is my uncle my lord my uncle my dearest uncle and off he shot like lightning the coach drove but slowly harry was up with it in a twinkling and vaulting in at the window was in the instant in the bosom of his best friend and patron  in the mean time the earl had retired into the house in great agitation he feared and was jealous of the manner in which his brother would meet him and this gave him equal doubt and hesitation respecting the manner in which he ought to receive his brother mr clinton on the other hand was not wholly without some similary emotions so that when harry introduced his uncle into the parlour no two noble personages could salute each other with a more distant respect  the earl however on casting a glance upon the face of his brother felt a tide of returning affection and lifting up his hands and eyes exclaimed it is he it is he my harry my harry clinton my dear my long lost my long sought brother then hastened forward in a gush of passion and caught him in his eager arms when mr clinton alternately folding the earl to his bosom cried i am content o my god give me now to depart in peace since at last i find and feel that i have indeed a brother  our hero observing the violence of their emotion interposed with a gentle care and supporting them to seats placed them tenderly by each other  for a while they both sat silent with a handkerchief at their eyes till the earl turned and plaintively said you dont forgive me harry clinton you never will you never can forgive me my brother whereupon mr clinton caught up the earls hand to his lips and pressing it with a fervent respect cried my brother and my lord my brother and my lord  o then said the earl you do forgive me i find but never can i never will i forgive myself my faults toward you my noblest brother for these many long years have been ever before me my neglects my pride and insolence my contemptuous treatment of one so highly my superior of my harry the only boast and glory of our house  mean while our hero stood aloof with his head averted weeping and sobbing with evident agitation till mr clinton cried no more my brother no more i beseech you it is already too much i cannot bear my present excess of grateful affection for you it struggles to rush forth but utterance is not given beside we shall break the heart of our dear child there his nature is too tender to support such a scene as this  harry then smilingly turned his face toward his parents all shining through tears as the sun in a shower and advancing and kneeling before them as they sat he took the hands of each alternately and pressed them in silence to his lips  in about an hour after while their affections were still at the highest but their spirits somewhat composed mr meekly returned the earl immediately rose and advancing took him by the hand with a cordial familiarity mr meekly says he i shall now have the pleasure of introducing you to that inestimable brother of whom you have heard me speak so often brother this is mr meekly my best and worthiest friend  mr clinton rose and advanced and meekly approached with an abased reverence not venturing to look up but saluted him as he would have saluted an angel of light  meekly meekly cried mr clinton i have surely heard that name before pray mr meekly were you ever abroad have you traveled sir were you ever in holland mr meekly  here meekly started as awaked by the sound of a voice whose recollected tuneings went thrilling to his heart and lifting up his eyes and beholding the traces of features once so lovely and ever deeply endeared to his memory he started and staggering back some steps he sunk down on a chair behind him almost in a fainting fit  the earl greatly alarmed went up and taking him by the hand what is the matter my friend says he are you taken suddenly ill are you not well my meekly  o my lord  he pantingly cried  there he is  as sure as i live  my patron  my benefactor  the wondrous man that i told you of  there he stands in his own precious person before us  mr clinton then approached and taking a seat beside him leaned toward him with a melting complacence mr meekly said he i expected ere this to have embraced you in heaven but i rejoice to meet you even on earth for i have ever retained a very affectionate impression of you and i more especially rejoice to meet you in the present society  but then  but then you come alone  you come alone my lord and master  alas you wipe your eye  o then it must be so  and here he broke into a passionate gush of tears  my lord and our hero hereupon recollecting the engaging circumstances of a character on whose description they had been so lately enamoured could not refuse their tribute to the memory of that admirable lady to whose person they now found themselves endearingly attached by affinity  at length mr clinton distressed to the last degree for the distress in which he saw the forlorn meekly sweetly turned from his own affliction to the consoling of that friend whom he found so deeply afflicted for him  mr meekly says he let us not weep for the living but rather for the dead for those who are yet in the vale of mortality shall we mourn the condition of angels shall we lament that a weight of glory is fallen on those whom we loved no let us rather rejoice in the prospect of being speedily partakers  when supper was over harry laid hold of the first interval of converse to enquire after his friends in town more especially mr clement his arabella and their little dicky they are come said mr clinton to sudden and great affluence old clement is thoroughly reconciled to his son and is doatingly fond of arabella and her child i am glad of it with all my heart cried harry clapping his hands but pray how did this matter come about sir by an event my dear in which the arm of providence was signally visible but before i say how it came to pass you ought to give our company a short history of this worthy family they will then become interested in their success  harry willingly and gracefully performed the task enjoined him and then his uncle proceeded  the second day after you lest me a man of a genteel appearance but pale and bleeding was carried stretched on a door by some of our charitable townsmen and brought to my house i was then abroad with clement on a visit to your old friend vindex but the stranger was instantly admitted and while some of the servants rode off for a surgeon others tenderly undressed and put him into a warmed bed  soon after i had returned and was informed of what had passed the surgeon arrived and putting five guineas in his hand i desired him to attend his patient and bring me word of his estate in half an hour he came forth and shaking his head said our patient sir will not do he is wounded in the groin with a pistol bullet the ball has got within the abdomen my instruments will not reach it and if it has entered the viscera he will die of convulsions in less than three hours i have accordingly told the gentleman what i thought of him and advised him immediately to settle his worldly affairs he tells me his name is saintbelial and he requested me as soon as i reached london to send mr clement to him who lives over against the blue posts on the strand  the name of clement made me curious to know who the party was and entering his chamber i took a chair and sat down softly by the side of his bed but the moment that i cast my eye on his visage i shrunk inward at the shock for all the malignity and horrors of hell were jointly legible on his countenance  humanity however compelled me to address him i am sorry to hear sir said i that you are not for this world but i trust that your hope looks forward to a better home i have no hope said he save such as my faith has been that since i must die i shall die wholly  i protest i was so stunned and disconcerted by the words and looks of the man that i found no answer and he proceeded  as i have no further concern with this world i have sent for an old gentleman with whom i had some connections and resolve to do an act of justice before i die the only one that ever i did during my lifetime for your charity and that of your people has half frightened me into a notion that there may be something of that which is called goodness upon earth and then how fearful how tremendous must my situation be wherefore as old clement may not arrive in season i will with your permission inform you of such things as concern him for as i have nothing to hope through all eternity neither have i any thing to fear on this side of it  my fathers name was belcher saintbelial he was an under retainer to the law and raked up a little fortune by sidelong practices so that he grew ambitious of preferring me his only child to the bar and in that view sent me to school and from school to oxford college but i ought to have began my history earlier  if there are devils i surely had one before i saw the light and was filled with the evil spirit from my mothers womb insomuch that my nurse died of a cancer in her breast occasioned by the envenomed bites i gave her nipple with my toothless gums while she suckled me  while an infant i took a heartfelt pleasure in dismembering flies and impaleing worms alive upon pins and when at school i was the promoter of all parties for worrying and torturing cats and dogs to death but my principal amusement lay in catching and fleaing frogs in seeing them spring about in the rage of their pains and so leaving them to perish in unutterable anguish  as i grew in stature i grew also in the strength of my malignity evil became my good my enjoyments lay in the loss damage and detriment of others i conceived a kind of envious hate against those who had done me a benefit i requited open friendship with hidden malevolence and i cannot remember that ever i felt a sense of any thing that goes by the name of gratitude humanity or virtue  i usually carried about me a walking stick or cane in the hollow part of which an iron spike was contained which i could cause to spring forth with a shake of my arm and again return to its case at pleasure with this as i strolled the fields which i often did for the purpose i stabbed the cattle of the neighbors in the belly or fundament and chuckled to see them leap and kick and plunge about in their agonies in short i drew to myself a kind of comfort from a comparison with the miseries that i inflicted on other creatures and had the elements been at my control nothing but pest and hurricane distemper and lingering death should have arisen and prevailed throughout the state of nature  at the college i got acquainted with one clement a gentle tempered but weak lad of whom i made a property and i prevailed upon him to turn away several of his servants under color of their having stolen the cash books and other effects of which i had secretly plundered him  at length i had private intelligence that my father had been pilloried for forgery and other double handed dealings that he had died of the bruises which he received on the execution of his sentence and that his effects had been seized by a variety of claimants wereupon without taking any notice of my father or family i made my shortest way to london with all that i could borrow or lay a light hand upon among my acquaintance  the first thing i did at the city was to wait upon old clement the father of my friend with a forged draught upon him for a hundred pounds on the sight of which he so fretted and exclaimed and walked about in such perturbation that i greatly feared i had overshot my mark at length however he laid me down the money but catching up a book swore that it was the last penny his son should receive from him for six months to come  he then began to question me touching the character of the young gentleman and under color of praising him for articles to which i perceived the old man had an aversion i exasperated him to such a degree that he again swore he would hold no further correspondence with him until he should be fully assured of his reformation  having thus effectually cut off all commerce between my friend and his father i cast aside my fears of being suddenly brought to account for my late acquisition i was even so daring as to take lodgings the very next door where i got in league with a young woman of a most seducing face and person but whose profligacy of manners was artfully covered by the most artless appearance of shamefaced innocence that ever graced the feigned character of any actress on any stage  she did not attempt however to impose upon me for kindred minds like ours instantly saw into each other and we soon concerted a plan for her marrying goodman clement and dividing the spoils of the old miser between us  this we easily brought about and never was man so happy in being so imposed upon while i shared with him in the possession of his purse and his bride  in the mean time as i had promised to procure him intelligence concerning his son i produced several forged letters from pretended correspondents in cambridge containing such accounts of the galantries and other extravagancies of young clement as wholly alienated his fathers affections from him and he sent him a final note whereby he discarded him from his fortune for ever  about two years thus passed in the full enjoyment of all that could glut flesh and blood though in order to ingratiate myself with the old man i appeared to him the most frugal and abstemious of mankind but one night while mrs clement and i sat together indulging ourselves in the hope that the good man had been knocked on the head or had fallen dead of an apoplexy he was brought to us in a chair pale and wounded and told us that he should have been certainly murdered had he not by the most wonderful providence met with his son who bravely knocked down the robber and happily delivered him and that he had given him what cash he had about him with a note for l  00 on the bank  all in a pannic and thunderstruck as i was by this news i yet pretended to congratulate him on the return of his son to duty but advised him to bed directly for the recovery of his health and spirits  the remainder of the night i walked about agonizing and racking my brain for some expedient to divert the instant ruin that impended when a sudden thought started or was rather infused into me and at dawn of day i went to an agent who had done several jobbs for me of no very laudable tendency  when i had given him his lesson and put twenty guineas into his hand he hastily went and desired to see mr clement on business of great consequence when falling on his knees he confessed with appearing penitence that he was the person who had wounded him the foregoing night that he did not intend to hurt him so much but that young mr clement had hired him for the purpose and lay in wait hard by in order that he might appear to come in to his rescue  this tale was so feasible that the old man swallowed it as a greedy fish swallows the bait that at the same time conveys the barb into his bowels he thereupon had me called to him in a hurry told me what he had discovered and gave me an order to stop payment of the l 00 with a hasty note to be left at the bank for his son  on the way i recollected an advertisement in the public papers that offered a large reward for the caption of one arabella clement who had been guilty of the murder of the late lord stivers and it instantly occurred to me that she was probably the wife of my quondam friend and patron wherefore as soon as i had dispatched my business at the bank i ran and collected a number of constables and waited with them aloof till i saw the object whom i dreaded and detested above plague and poison enter and return discontented from the counting house we then dogged him at a distance till we saw him safe lodged and following softly up stairs we demanded a woman who stood before us for our prisoner  young clement then all enraged exerted himself with wonderful action and intrepidity with one stroke of a poker he tore off my right ear and cleft my shoulder to the bone then drove us all down stairs though several shot were fired at him  what happened to him afterward i knew only from report for i lay ill of my wounds for several months together and on my recovery could learn no tidings concerning him  in the mean space my continual fears of his appearance made my life extremely miserable my paramour and i had often thoughts and consultations touching the expediency of making away with the old gentleman but it occurred to us that young clement might still be alive and on the death of his father might bring us to a severe account for his substance  at length about six weeks ago as i returned from transacting an affair at st albans i met and instantly recognized my old enemy walking with a young gentleman about a mile above this town immediately i stopped and pulling my hat over my eyes pray gentlemen said i am i on the right road to london for i have traveled far and fear i may have gone astray you are on the direct road said the lad but if you choose to stop short you are heartily welcome to a lodging with us for the night why gentlemen said i do you live in yonder town we do said clement in that answer i had all the intelligence i desired and away i spurred  from that time scarce a day passed wherein i did not take an airing on the same road still expecting and panting to meet my adversary i rode armed with one case of pistols before me and another in my pockets and i determined though i should meet clement in the midst of a hundred men to shoot him directly through the head and trust to the speed of my horse for my escape but this day as i returned near the farther end of the town a white goat pursued by a dog rushed suddenly through a hedge whereupon my horse plunged and one of the pistols that was ready cocked in my wastcoat pocket went off and reduced me to the condition in which you behold me  his last words were scarce intelligible he was seized with convulsions and lay speechless near two hours at length old clement arrived his servants helped him out of his coach i met him in the hall and led him into the parlour  there being both seated i succinctly gave him the heads of saint belials history when looking earnestly at me you appear sir said he to be much of the gentleman but if you were an angel i would credit nothing against the honesty of that good young man and least of all to the prejudice of the dear young innocent that i have married  i confess i was somewhat piqued at this sudden rebuff but suppressing the tendency that i had to resentment i wish said i you had come time enough to be present at the unhappy mans confession but it may yet please god to open your eyes to your own wrongs before he expires  so saying i conducted him to the room where the wretch lay to all appearance insensible i then recollected an approved elixir that i had in my closet and sending for it i infused a teaspoon full drop by drop into his mouth  in a quarter of an hour he came perfectly to his senses and turning his languid eyes toward the old man you are come then said he to hear my dying words  i forged the note for which you gave me a hundred pounds  i forged all the letters that you received to your sons prejudice  i was the father of the child which the strumpet with whom you live brought into the world  she is not your wife  she is wife to caleb cable the boatswain who lives by the monument  he has got hundreds of your money for keeping counsel  it was in truth your son who rescued you from the hands of the robber  i forged the tale and bribed the man who deceived you in that matter  often as you lay in bed moll cable has urged me to dispatch you before morning  had i murdered your son as i long since intended you should not have survived him four and twenty hours   here turning his eager and ghastly visage upon me o sir said he is there is there for certain a judgment to come alas i answered death judgment heaven and hell are the four capital things of which the universe affords the highest and deepest assurance o then he cried i am going down down down  this he spoke with all the visible horrors and desperation conceivable in judas when just about fixing the rope to his neck and lapsing into his last agonies he soon after expired  all pale and astonished the old gentleman sat silent and panting and seeing he was about to faint i ordered some drops and water with a bottle of wine while i supported him from falling  when he was somewhat restored and had recovered his speech he laid hold on my hand and said i beg your pardon sir i would do it if i were able upon my knees but who could have thought this  i wish that i had indeed been murdered  i would that i had died before i was thus undeceived in the only objects of my love  alas sir i have now no relation no kindred no friend except yourself upon earth all others are equally plunderers and murderers in my eyes  these words were interrupted by a flood of tears  having consoled him in the kindest manner i could word was brought that dinner was served and i led him partly by constraint to the table but whispered private orders that arabella and her dickey should not appear for clement staid to dine with his friend vindex  after dinner and three glasses which was all i could force upon him i remonstrated the expediency of his immediate return to secure his effects lest all should be spirited away upon any intimation of the present accident ah sir said he i shall scarce i fear be able to bear the sight of a place in which i so long thought myself so very happy but if you will be so gracious as to accompany me i will venture i will said i on condition that you engage to return and sleep here this night  early in the afternoon we arrived at his house in my coach attended by his two servants and four of mine well armed as we entered the parlour his supposed wife rose in an alarm that she evidently endeavored to suppress what is the matter lovee said she advancing for what did saint belial send to you it became him much better to have attended on you methinks i fear my lovee is sadly tired but pray what did he want with you to tell me answered old clement that he was a dying man that i was a dupe and a cuckold and that you were a strumpet  o fie lovee said she those are very naughty names but you cannot be in earnest  step said he and enquire of caleb cable the boatswain tell him at the same time that i cannot afford to maintain his wife any longer and that he has seen the very last of his hush money ah polly polly he continued meltingly all this i could almost away with but murder is a frightful thing who could think that my polly would murder her old man  o then she cried i see that the villain has betrayed me i see that i am undone my youth and beauty cast away my arts and time spent in vain why you doting driveling wretch your fortune was little enough to compensate the pains i took in disguising my aversion to you but you shall not live to triumph in my disappointment  so saying she sprung forward and grasping his neck in both her hands he instantly grew black in the face his eyes rolled his jaws expanded and he must have expired on the spot but i stepped hastily to her and seizing both her wrists i gave them a sudden wrench whereupon she loosed her hold shouting out that her arms were broke and throwing herself groaning into a chair she called for instant perdition on me the crazy dotard herself and all the world  in the mean time the old gentleman had sunk panting to the floor but raising him gently i placed him on a large sofa where he began to respire with freedom  i then sent for a sergeant at mace and his attendants and giving our heroine with a mittimus into his hands i desired him to provide her with a decent room and suitable accommodations and not to admit any company except her servant till further orders ay away with her away with her at any rate exclaimed the old man she has the looks of a very gorgon and every hair of her head is turned into a frightful serpent  as soon as she was gone i called her principal maid and putting a few pieces into her hand i desired her to follow her mistress and to serve her with care and tenderness and further to intimate to her that when she gave any proofs of repentance and reformation she should yet be humanely and generously provided for  having thus far settled matters i gave commission to james and andrew with a male domestic in whom the old man confided to remain and take care of the house and effects and taking the keys of the cabinets with us we set off on our return to hamstead  on the way mr clement grew deeply dejected and sighing said o sir how strong how very strongly is the desire of society impressed on the human heart when even in the absence of robbers and murderers i feel a want and disconsolation that i cannot express i have now no relation no friend but yourself no kindred or connection with any other upon earth to you indeed i owe my life and all else that i am worth and if you will not chase me from you if you will allow me to remain with you you shall be all the world to me the heir and sole possessor of all that i possess  but have you not a son i cannot think i have said he it is now above eight years since i set eyes on my dear hammel the precious pearl whom in my dotage i madly cast away but were he still living after what is past i could never more have the courage to look him in the face a cruel and a false pelican have i proved to my little one instead of fostering him with my vitals i have withheld and torn from him even the common means of life  do you know none of your name said i who may claim your substance under color of being of your blood not any sir my father was a foreigner and i never heard of any other of the name in this nation  there is one of your name said i who lives in our town but then he is in flowing circumstances quite above the desire of increasing his fortune by base or low means he is my most intimate friend a very accomplished gentleman and has one of the finest women to wife and two of the loveliest children that i have seen if you please i will invite and introduce them to you to night or to morrow  on our arrival i left old clement a while in the parlour while i stepped to give private directions respecting the conduct of your tutor harry and the interview which i proposed between him and his father  sir said i as i returned i have taken the liberty to invite your namesakes to sup with you they are a very amiable family and i hope that their company and acquaintance will prove a matter of consolation perhaps a blessing to you ah he cried my claims are of a very different nature i have no right to blessings or consolations of any kind  some time before supper a rapping was heard and arabella entered leading in a little daughter of about four years old and followed by her son dickey all elegantly dressed  madam said i this is a namesake of yours my worthy friend mr clement pray let me have the pleasure of introducing you to each other  when they were both seated the old gentleman took out his perspective and peering at her for some time ah he cried what lovely faces there are in the world but all have not proved lovely throughout like you madam  he then called dickey to him and taking him by both hands and bringing him forward between his knees what is your name my dear says he richard clement sir so please you i would it were bartholomew replied the old gentleman but names signify nothing you are a sweet little fellow and perhaps may be something the better for my death i would not wish your death sir said dickey for all that i could get by you o how very heavenly exclaimed the old man how heavenly is the simplicity and disinterestedness of infants  he next requested arabella to spare her little daughter to him for a minute and she accordingly took and led her to him when fondly caressing her and seating her on his knee could you find in your heart says he to love such an ugly old thing as i am yes me could says she and me has got some comforts for you in my pocket whereupon she produced a little paper and unfolding it presented him with some candied seeds and almonds o my god cried the old man what a heaven i should yet enjoy upon earth could i but purchase the society of these dear infants  i heard him with a moistening eye and rejoiced in the ripening fruits of my little project  pray madam says i what is become of our good friend your husband are we not to have the happiness of his company to night sir says she he was engaged on indispensable business at the time but will certainly attend you before supper  she had scarce spoke when a second rapping was heard and in came our hammel not in gay but costly apparel as i had appointed  on introducing the son to his venerable father they respectfully saluted each other as utter strangers for our present hammel was more different from the meagre and threadbare hammel that his father had last seen then pharaohs fat kine could be from his lean ones  during supper and after i purposely threw out occasional topics and gave several opens wherein i knew that hammel could shine and he accordingly made use of them with great spirit and advantage  his father gazed at him with a respectful admiration and at length exclaimed you are an ornament an honor sir to your name to your lineage and the country wherein you were born but pray of what family alas sir you add stings to the recollection of my faults this day i once had a son a son who in an humble degree might now have resembled yourself but my unkindness must long since have broken his gentle heart my child saved me from murderers and i in return was the murderer of my child o hammel my hammel my son my son hammel would to god i had died before i wronged thee would god i had died for thee o hammel my son my son  his last words were broken and nearly suppressed by a gush of tears when the tender hearted hammel turned an eye upon me and cried o sir we have gone too far  then hastily advancing he threw himself at the knees of his father i am here sir he cried your hammel your own hammel in all duty and affection submissive and prostrate before you  you my hammel are you my hammel asked the old man ah had you but his famished face and his tattered garment i would take you to my arms to my heart into my vitals  o my father cried hammy look not so strange and wild upon me i am indeed your child once the darling of your heart whom you fostered so tenderly and nurtured at school and college the true son of your true wife look upon me my father you often told me that i was her picture do you not see the very features of my dear mother in my face  yes yes i think i do  but then i have been mightily imposed upon of late i would you were leaner and worse clad my child however if you come in the name of my son i also will kneel down and crave his pardon and your pardon  here the old gentleman sunk down upon his knees and poor hammel starting up at the same instant cried aloud alas sir he is beside himself and i too shall go distracted  i then was grieved at heart for the stratagem i had made use of to connect this worthy family the more endearingly together and coming soothingly to him and raising him in my arms i replaced him in his seat and said believe me trust to me my dear mr clement this is your true child your only child your true hammel he has lived with me many years i can prove him to be yours by a thousand witnesses by those who can witness what he has suffered on account of being your son  well well well said he whisperingly it does not signify much for i have another one coming my polly is now in the ninth week of her reckoning  ay but that saint belial who knows but the child may be an imp of his begetting  a cursed couple they are i am sure she a succubus and he the devil himself incarnate  i hope they didnt hear me  shut the door  o there they are  save me save me  they come upon me  my throat they gripe my throat  my breath my breath  o  h   here he swooned but on taking a little blood he came to himself so i ordered all to be kept quiet about him and getting him to bed he swallowed a soporific draught slept soundly till morning and awoke in his perfect senses  i then went to bid him good morrow and took a chair by his bedside  that was a mighty agreeable family said he who supped with you last night sir the very worthiest i replied that i know upon earth  you called them clement i think  that is their name sir  pray did they go home  no they are here still at times we make but one family and one household  while i spoke i was surprised to see clement enter dressed in the same shabby clothes in which we first found him harry and the old gentleman turning his head to the door started up in his bed and cried if i am a living man that is surely my hammel my very son hammel  on hearing this poor clement leaped hastily forward and falling by the bed seized one of his fathers hands repeatedly kissed it and wept upon it you are restored to me then he cried my father my father god be praised god be praised you are restored to me entire i trust with all that paternal and melting fondness which was once the blessing and the treasure that i prized above the world no hammy said the old man i will not deceive you i cannot love you as i once loved you because you never can forgive me if you could forgive me hammy i would love you with a double love a love passing the love of fathers  o my father exclaimed hammel this one happy moment of reconciliation amply cancels all offenses and outweighs all sufferings permit me then my dearest father to introduce those to you who have an equal right to your blessing  so saying off he went and brought in arabella with her attending children and all the four kneeled down by the side of the old man  o my god he cried out you are too bountiful too gracious you oppress you crush me to nothing with this exceeding weight of your benefits i was a withered and a blasted branch and you have caused me like aarons rod to bud and blossom anew and to bear these blessed fruits i trust to your glory  when breakfast was laid and the old gentleman dressed i sent up for him and when we were seated clement entered with his family all elegantly dressed as on the preceding night hammy said i how came you by that disguise which you put on this morning you looked so unlike yourself you almost frightened me  dont you remember that dress sir  how should i remember what i never saw before  o you did see them before sir those were the weeds i wore when you saved me and mine from famishing and i have ever since preserved and shall ever preserve them as the precious memorial of my obligations to you what exclaimed the old gentleman my life and your life has he saved your life also my son yes sir cried the grateful creature all who are alive here live only by  here while i put one hand to the mouth of my friend his venerable father seized hold on the other and bending one knee he pressed it to his lips in a silence that passed all possible utterance  but pray mr clement said i to turn aside the subject what do you propose to do with mrs cable you know that in case of penitence i promised to have her taken care of to be sure sir said he i will make good all your engagements and i will further do whatever she desires on condition of her residing in a different country or rather in a different kingdom for i would not for the world that she should come within the reach of me by fifty leagues at least unless you were always to be with me for a safeguard  i laughed and immediately mrs cables maid entered all in a heat with a frightened and imploring countenance so my good girl said i how is your mistress to day ah sir she cried i have but a very sad account to give you of my commission my mistress is dead and i doubt that i myself have been ignorantly her murderer  soon after she was shown to her apartment hetty says she i find myself growing very sick pray step and bring me the little bottle of cordial that you will find standing in such a corner of my closet i did as i was ordered and returning in all haste i presented her with the bottle when looking mournfully at it and giving a heavy sigh ay she cried this is the right cordial this will do the business then calling for a wine glass she filled and drank it off  in a little while after she complained of being drowsy whereupon i undressed and helped her to bed and lighting a candle i sat down to watch beside her for a time she appeared to sleep quite sound and easy but again began to moan and toss the clothes in a while after however she seemed quite composed but toward the dead of night not hearing her breathe i held up the candle and saw that her fine face was livid and ghastly and her skin all discolored  i then thought that i myself should have dropped dead on the spot i gave a great shriek and i believe continued shrieking till the keeper and a servant maid came in so sir if your honor is pleased to think that the blame of this matter belongs to me i am come to deliver myself up to justice  no my girl said i you are not at all suspected i dont perceive any interest that you could possibly have in this melancholy event no sir said old clement i can answer for her innocence she is but a late comer she was particularly tender of me and i dare say knew nothing of the ill designs of her mistress and so hetty i will recommend you to a better mistress hetty an angel of a mistress even to my own dearest daughter who sits blushing before you there  that night after the inquest of the coroners mrs cable was secretly buried in the fields and my servants interred her confederate on the high road for i did not choose to have the sacred ceremony of our church profaned over a reprobate who rejected the hope of a blessed resurrection  the day before i set forward our kindhearted clement earnestly petitioned to accompany me and urged his impatience to embrace you my harry but this i peremptorily refused as i was sensible that his own affairs demanded his presence so i came away alone yet attended by the tears and good wishes of the happiest family that is i think within his majestys dominions  my dearest brother said the earl the latter part of your story is exceedingly pleasing and yet scarce makes amends for the horrors that preceded my flesh as well as my spirit still shudders at the character of that accursed belial i did not think that such a malevolence and malignity of disposition could be generated in the bottom of hell itself  and yet my lord i am persuaded said mr clinton that could it please god at this instant to withdraw from me the influence of his holy and happy spirit i should become altogether as evil as belia himself  i cannot think so my brother replied the earl you would still continue a rational and free creature there is certainly a distinction in the nature of things there is the beautiful and deformed the amiable and detestable your judgment would approve the one and reject the other and your freedom of agency would act conformable to your election  ah my lord cried mr clinton what things what beauty what amiableness what freedom is this that you speak of have you found out another universe or another deity beside him in whom our life subsists are there any things in nature save the things of our god or what beauty or amiableness can they possibly exhibit save what they derive from him save some quality or impregnation some manifestation or impression of his own beauty or amiableness  to make this matter clear let us go somewhat deeper quite back if you please my lord to the very birth of things  throughout nature we find that god can impart to his creatures a being an identity a fire of life an intelligence or sagacity a consciousness a force or action a will and a freedom distinct from himself and distinct from each other and this is the utmost extent of creaturely nature whether respecting the powers that are in hell or in heaven whether respecting the highest seraphim that are in bliss or in perdition  now all these powers or high prerogatives although distinct from god are infinitely far from being independent of him for he will not he cannot depart from his supremacy nor that universality of essence by and in whom alone all essences subsist he can indeed impart the forementioned powers to any limited degree that he pleases but then in their highest degree of fire life or sagacity force action or freedom you will perceive on the slightest reflection that there is nothing of the beautiful or amiable that you spoke of but that they are equally applicable and may be equally exercised to evil or good purposes according to the nature or disposition of the agent  your pardon for one minute my noble brother i have already specified the many great and wonderful powers that god can impart to his creatures distinctly though not independently from himself but there is one power one quality which god cannot make creaturely which with all his omnipotence he cannot possibly impart in any kind of distinction or separability from himself and this quality is called goodness  and now my dear lord in order to convince you of this most capital and most important of all truths a truth upon which time eternity and the universe all turn as on their axis it may be necessary to enquire what goodness is  it will be answered that goodness is various and infinite in its kinds and degrees it is so indeed for it is at once one and many it springs forth from our god as the living fountain in paradise that thence divided it into rivers and numberless streams to water and replenish the whole earth all those streams however were but so many parts or portions of the one variously blessing fountain and that fountain is love it is the love of others my lord  there is no species of allowed or conceivable virtue that is not reducible under the standard of this their great leader and all generating parent called love good will is the eternal blesser of all to whom it is beneficent and also generates its own blessing in the very act of its love  here lies the great and impassable gulf between god and his productions between the creature and the creator the will of god is an eternal fire of love toward his creatures and goes forth in blessings upon them as wide and universal as his own existence but the will of the creature is confined and limited like its essence while it is distinct or uninformed of the will of god it cannot possibly act beyond or out of itself it cannot possibly feel for any thing except itself it cannot wish any welfare except its own welfare and this it endeavors to compass by the exertion of all its powers indeed we may as well suppose that a crude rock at the extremity of either pole while compassed by perpetual darkness and compacted by perpetual frost should yet kindle itself and beam forth in light and warmth upon all around as that any creaturely will should of its own powers go forth in affection or kindness upon others  from this distinct selfish and craving will of the creature springs every possible evil whether natural or moral from the preference of its own identity to that of others arises pride from the eagerness of its grasping at all advantages to itself arises the envy of any imaginary advantage to another pride covetousness and envy beget hatred wrath and contention with every species and degree of malevolence and malignity and the disappointment of these passions produces rancour and misery and altogether they constitute the whole nature and kingdom of hell itself in the soul  but when god is pleased to inform the will of the creature with any measure of his own benign and benevolent will he steals it sweetly forth in affection to others he speaks peace to the storm of rending passions and a new and delightful dawning arises on the spirit and thus on the grand and final consummation when every will shall be subdued to the will of good to all our jesus will take in hand the resigned chordage of our hearts he will tune them as so many instruments to the song of his own sentiments and will touch them with the finger of his own divine feelings then shall the wisdom the might and the goodness of our god become the wisdom might and goodness of all his intelligent creatures the happiness of each shall multiply and overflow in the wishes and participation of the happiness of all the universe shall begin to sound with the song of congratulation and all voices shall break forth in an eternal hallelujah of praise transcending praise and glory transcending glory to god and the lamb  hasten hasten that blessed period great god we beseech thee exclaimed the earl but tell me my heavenly brother for it is surely in heaven that you hold your conversation and from whence you derive all your knowledge and lights tell me then is there no distinction no preference in matter of goodness between creature and creature between man and man for this seems to be the consequence of what you have set forth very nearly i acknowledge to mathematical demonstration  your question my dear lord is very deep said mr clinton and still leads to greater depths than i would choose to disclose before our harry yet awhile i will however attempt in few and simple words to give you some satisfaction on this most interesting article  there are two great and capital errors under which the world of man has labored and still continues to labor ever since the creation the first is that of ascribing and imputing to ourselves every emotion and inclination toward virtue or goodness that we seel within us the second is that as free agents we are enabled to elect and reject merely by the act of an own will independent of any impulse or bias whatever  i have already shown your lordship that every creaturely will independent of the will of its god can be no other than an eager craving after its own happiness and cannot possibly be affected in behalf of another creature who is wholly distinct from it and wholly an alien to it wherefore every creaturely will in such a separate and adverse state is altogether as an ishmael whose hand is against every one and every ones hand against him  on the other hand i have shown you that god the sole fountain of all being and blessedness can in his nature and disposition be nothing but love and that even in loving himself he must love his own productions the realizing of his own ideas and the works of his own power what indeed should hinder our god from being wholly a god of love was there any thing before him was there any thing coaeval with him to control or oppose him had he any thing to envy had he any thing to excite his anger except his own conceptions and these he was at liberty to bring or not to bring into existence or perceptibility even at his own pleasure what then should affect him with the slightest tincture of malignity could he add to his own happiness by rousing the hateful passions within his own blessed bosom we may more rationally suppose that the sun in his distant zenith of burning superiority should have his light impaired by the squirt of a schoolboy than that the deity should be affected with any touch of malevolence by any creature or by all the creatures that his omnipotence can produce  purblind reason here will say even the goodness of god himself in the human heart will say if our god is all love if he is a will to all rectitude and happiness in his creatures why did he suffer any evil to begin in nature or creature could evil have arisen contrary to the will of omnipotence if omnipotence had willed that it should not arise  ah my friends no evil ever did nor ever can approach the will of god neither can he will or affect any species of evil in nature or creature but he can allow a temporary evil in the creature as a travail toward its birth into the more eminent degree of that goodness and happiness which god affects god cannot affect or take delight in the sufferings of the most abandoned reprobate that ever blasphemed his name but he can will that the sinner should be reclaimed to happiness even by suffering when there are no other means in nature whereby he may be reclaimed  could creatures without the experience of any lapse or evil have been made duly sensible of the darkness and dependence of their creaturely nature and of the distance and distinction between themselves and their god could they have known the nature and extent of his attributes with the infinity of his love could they have known the dreadful consequences of falling off from him without seeing any example or experiencing any consequence of such a fall could they have otherwise felt and found that every act of creaturely will and every attempt at creaturely power was a forsaking of that eternal wisdom and strength in which they stood could all intelligent creatures have been continued in that lowliness that resignation that gratitude of burning affection which the slain will of the mortified sinner feels when called up into the grace and enjoyment of his god could those endearing relations have subsisted in creation which have since newly arisen between god and his lapsed creatures wholly subsequent thereto those relations i say of redemption of regeneration of a power of conversion that extracts good out of evil of a love that no apostasy can quench that no offenses can conquer if these eternal benefits could have been introduced without their ground or foundation in the admission of evil no lapse or falling off would ever have been  to make this matter still clearer if possible  in the dark and the boundless mirror called nature god beheld and contemplated from all eternity the loveliness of his own light and the beauty of his own ideas even those ideas to which he had determined to impart perceptibility or a consciousness and feeling of an owness of existence in him he also contemplated therein the whole infinity of possibilities all causes with their consequences in the remotest relation all events that ever should or ever could come to pass  he saw that without an intelligent desire no creature could be excellent or formed in his likeness but he saw also that unless such intelligence should be ruled by his wisdom and such a desire wholly conformable to his will the creature could not be wise the creature could not be happy  in the possibility of the creatures desire of independence god saw the possibility of moral and natural evil but he saw that such partial and temporary evil might be converted to the production of an infinity of good and he saw that without the admission of such evil the good that bore relation thereto could not arise  he knew that till the lapse or falling off of some of his creatures his own infinite attributes could not duly be manifested could not be duly adored in the glory of their contrast that no creature till then could be duly sensible of its own fallibility could be duly sensible that sufficiency and perfection were solely in god and that all things depended on him as well for every quality of blessedness as of being  he foresaw all the misery that should attend upon error but he saw also how amiable how beneficial was the sense of such error how it might serve to sap the selfconfidence of the creature and engage him to cast his trust where his strength alone lay and he the more willingly permitted the sufferings of all his fallen offspring as the future blissful period was already present to him when the miseries of the short parenthesis called time should be for ever shut up between the two eternities and when all his beloved and rectified creatures should enter upon the fullness of the enjoyment of their god  from the blackness of guilt and the cloud of pains calamities diseases and deaths god saw remorse contrition humility patience and resignation beaming forth into new wonders of light and eternal life he saw new relations new connections new endearments arise between creatorly good and creaturely evil between transgression and redemption repentance and pardon and he joyed without beginning in calling his loved offspring from error to rectitude from lowliness to exaltation from death into life from time to eternity and from transitory afflictions into ever enduring and ever increasing blessedness  god foresaw in future worlds of new and wonderful construction the frailty and lapse of his favorite family of man he saw him sunk into the inclemency of outward elements and into the inward darkness and wrath of his distinct and limited nature externally besieged and tempted by lying offers of enjoyment and internally rent by disappointed desires and malignant passions but he had provided a redemption of such stupendous potency as would not suffer the perverse creature to tear itself out of the arms of his affection he had provided a seed of the son of his love that should take root in mans world of inward and outward evil that should grow as a fragrant flower through corruption and abomination into the freedom the light and the purity of heaven that should reprove his unrighteousness that should convict him of wickedness that should convince him of weakness and soften him into sorrow for his own transgressions that should melt him into a sense of the calamity of others that should diffuse as a dawning light through his dark and angry nature subduing his pride assuaging his passions calling him forth from self into the expansion of benevolence into all the charities and amities the feelings and offices of the human heart thus made divine and lastly maturing in him a different nature and a new creature that god may be in all men the one will to the one goodness thereby uniting all men as one man in their god for deep indeed are all his counsels and all the mazes of his providence will finally unwind themselves in the rectitude and fullness of the wisdom of his love  that a creature inexperienced or newly brought into being should stand in the state in which he felt his delight or even that he should fall therefrom by attempting at something through an own will and the presumption of an own power does not appear to have any thing very wonderful in it but that a creature already fallen into the misery and depravity of a second and base nature should rise again superior to its original goodness and glory this is the work produced in time that will be matter of chief amazement throughout the second eternity  that man i say fallen into a body of bestial flesh and members fallen into the properties of a dark and wrathful nature fallen into circling elements of hostility distemperature and dissolution to his frame that man i repeat it thus degraded and weakened thus oppressed and assaulted from within and from without should yet advance and proceed through his course of appointed warfare denying his own appetites pulling down his own pride combating sufferings with patience subduing injuries with love delighting to labor under the hinder part of that cross which simon the cyrenian was compelled to bear conquering rising triumphing over desires disappointments tribulations languor sickness failing existence and death and all this without any constraint or violation of that principle of liberty which his eternally free progenitor imparted unto him this indeed is a wonder to cherubim and seraphim and from eternity to eternity the greatest work of god  here brother said the earl you expressly acknowledge that man is a free agent  i acknowledge answered mr clinton that man has a principle or seed of liberty within him a power of turning or at least of leaving his will to the impulse of good on the one hand or of evil on the other he could not otherwise be accountable and this brings me directly to your lordships question respecting the distinction in matter of merit between man and man  know thyself was the wisest of all the saws in the ancient schools for the most useful of all studies to man is that of man  man has been represented by the boastings of pagan philosophy as equal in many respects and in some articles superior to what they conceived of godhead  they define him a rational and lordly intelligence sole dictator to his own actions controuler of his own passions and of powers virtues and faculties wholly free and independent but what says nature on this head  man goes out of this world even as he comes into it quite passive and without his own consent from the womb to the time of his maturing in reason and even till some degree of power is awakened in him toward governing his appetites and resisting his inclinations he is as merely a sensual and servile machine as any inferior animal or brute in the creation his pulses beat his blood cruclates and all the offices of respiration secretion and perspiration are performed alike awake as asleep without any more attention or care on his part than if he had no interest or concern therein  in the mean time he is begirt by outward objects and outward elements that hold an intimate correspondence and perpetual communication with his flesh with all his organs and his animal life exciting in him a variety of appetites and desires that he can no more resist than a twig can swim against a torrent insomuch that were this the whole of the man with respect to his appetites he would of necessity be a brute and with respect to his passions he would of necessity be a devil  thus far my lord you see that man is wholly acted upon and does nothing but as he is incited or impelled thereto and were there no other agent within him to act upon him on the opposite part had he no present friend to combat with and control the evil propensities of his nature he would be as totally a slave to his carnal and diabolical lusts as the galleyrower is to the bench whereon he is chained  but blessed be our allcreating allredeeming and allloving friend who is ever present in us and to us and does not leave our impotence destitute of his help who in the center of our old and reprobated adam has implanted a divine seed of a new nature and a new creature even the renewed image of himself in our souls it is this infant resemblance of himself in our essence which god always cherishes which he always elects which he pursues which he calls upon by the word of the son of his love which he informs with the breath of his holy spirit whispering into it the still voice of his own beatifying affections  now though these two seeds or principles are so intimately united in us that very few observe any distinction between them yet no two things can be more opposite than they are to each other both in their natures and propensities and accordingly the great apostle paul has specified and marked out their separate offices and departments with the most exact precision reach me yonder bible harry  here it is   that which i do i allow not for what i would that do i not but what i hate that do i if then i do that which i would not i consent unto the law that it is good now then it is no more i that do it but sin that dwells in me for i know that in me that is in my flesh dwells no good thing for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good i find not for the good that i would i do not but the evil which i would not that i do now if i do that i would not it is no more i that do it but sin that dwells in me i find then a law that when i would do good evil is present with me for i delight in the law of god after the inward man but i see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members o wretched man that i am who shall deliver me from the body of this death  here my friends you see the apostle distinguishes most precisely between the opposite natures and tendencies of the two several seeds of the first and the second adam between the outward and inward the vitiated and regenerate the old and the new man the old warring against the new and endeavoring to bring him into captivity to sin and death insomuch that our own evil cain would willingly slay outright the good abel that is in us  now between these adverse offsprings of the earthly and heavenly adams our will or principle of freedom or power of election is placed  on the one part we are besieged and assailed by a world of tempting and seducing objects that hold intimate intercourse with our flesh and carnal sensibilities and impel their influences on our spirit through every organ while the rulers in darkness enter through the said sensual avenues excite their diabolical passions within us and begin to open a kingdom of their own in our soul  on the contrary part our heavenly father is graciously pleased to act upon us through the kindred seed of that divine nature which he had implanted in our essence he attracts us strongly though not forcibly and he sheds into us a species of mental feelings and affections to which flesh and blood is wholly an alien  here then when the will turns away from divine influence and delivers itself up to the impulses and operations of the evil agents the whole man becomes a prisoner in the regions of darkness and shadows of death and nothing but intense sufferings can awake him to a sense of the error insufficiency and folly of his pursuits and of the loss and horror of the state in which he lies  but when the will turns and yields itself to the gracious drawings and influence of gods blessing spirit god opens himself unto it and attracts it still more powerfully till he gradually delivers it from the slavery of sense of sin and of self into the perfect freedom of a willing service to goodness  above all when the will is assaulted by violent pressing and permanent temptations if yet with the assistance of supporting grace it strives and struggles to maintain the fight and to tear itself away from the custody of evil though anguishing in the strife and pierced even to the dividing of the bone from the marrow then is the scripture fulfilled that says the kingdom of heaven suffers violence and the violent take it by force then is our jesus in the highest height of his throne and dominion then does he deem all his sufferings overpaid and he will himself be the champion in the will of such a champion and he will fight the good fight and run the good course and hold fast the good faith both in him and for him and he will impute the whole of his conquests to the willing instrument of his operations and will crown him with the crown of his own glory and will stretch out his existence to the reception and expansion of his whole heaven within him  here then my honored brother you have your question fully answered touching the difference in point of merit between man and man since no creature can have any merit save so far as he opens his will to the impressions of the goodness of god upon his spirit  what you will say is this the utmost merit that the best of men can boast that of barely yielding his will to the drawings and influence of the spirit of goodness  it is indeed my lord the very whole of the merit that any creature can have as his own merit the very utmost that he can do toward cooperating with his god and conducing in any degree to his own salvation and happiness  o that all men that all men had this merit my friends that all would open the gates of their everlasting souls and humbly and earnestly petition the king of glory to come in this would lead to ever during and ever increasing merit for our god would then impute his own merits unto us not by an outward but inward imputation even the feeling sense and participation of his nature his powers and qualities within us we should become good in his goodness wise in his wisdom and strong in his omnipotence by resigning and surrendering to him our dark empty hungry and uncomfortable creature we should gain in lieu thereof the plenitude of the rich and illuminating creator the fullness of all delight would become our portion and inheritance and the proprietor of the universe would be our property and possession  here mr clinton paused and his auditors continued in a kind of respectful musing as attentive to what he might further offer at length the earl exclaimed never never more my brother will i debate or question with you further than asking your advice or opinion to which i shall instantly and implicilty submit as i would to that of the highest seraph in heaven our dear meekly here and i had some former converse on a few of these deep subjects and i received much satisfaction and instruction from him but he was not quite so explicit and convincing as you have been  ah my lord cried meekly were i as intimate with the fountain of all knowledge as your precious brother is you would not then have posed me in the conversation we last held on those heads  on the following day at breakfast mr meekly took out his pocketbook and produced bank and stockbills to the amount of something upward of three thousand pounds he then presented them to mr clinton and said here sir is a little matter toward repayment of the loan i had from you in holland i bless i bless my god that he has enabled me thus far to approve myself an honest man but above all i bless him for giving me once more a sight of the gracious countenance of my patron but for you i had miserably perished in a dungeon to you sir i owe my liberty to you i owe my life to you i owe the recovery of the inheritance of my fathers with respect to such obligations i am indeed a beggared insolvent but my heart is pleased with the thought that the connection between us of creditor on your part and of debtor on mine should remain on record to all eternity  here the worthy meekly became oppressed under sensations of grateful recollection and putting his handkerchief to his eyes he sobbed out his passion  in the mean time mr clinton held the bills in his hand and carelessly casting his eye over them perceived the amount as soon as he saw that his friends emotion had partly subsided you have mr meekly says he you have been quite a gospel steward and have returned me my own with most unlooked for usury and i heartily pray god in recompense of your integrity to give you the principality of many cities in the coming kingdom of his son but what shall i do with this money my dear meekly my wealth already overflows it is my only trouble my only encumbrance it claims my attention indeed as it is a trust for which i know i am strictly accountable but i heartily wish that providence would reclaim the whole to himself and leave me as one of his mendicants who daily wait on the hand that supplieth all who seek his kingdom with necessary things for my harry has enough and more than enough now in the abundance of his noble father you must therefore keep these bills to yourself my worthy friend retain or give or dispose of them even as it shall please you whether as your property or as my property it matters not sixpence but take them back you must take them back indeed my meekly and so saying he shoved them over from him on the table  ah my most honored sir exclaimed the repining meekly sure you would not serve me so my soul is but just eased of a load that lay heavy on it for many many years be not then so severe as to replace the burden upon me it would break my very heart should you persist in refusing this little instance of acknowledgment from one of your warmest lovers  here harry found himself affected and distressed for the parties and in order to relieve them took the decision of the matter upon himself  gentlemen says he i will with your good pleasure put a very quick end to this dispute and i offer myself to you as your joint trustee to be your almoner and disposer of these bills  as i was lately on my rambles through some villages near london the jingle of a number of infant voices struck my ear and turning and looking in at the groundfloor of a long cottage i perceived about thirty little girls neatly dressed in a uniform and all very busily and variously employed in hackling carding knitting or spinning or in sewing at their sampler or in learning their letters and so forth  the adjoining house contained about an equal number of boys most of whom were occupied in learning the rudiments of the several handycrafts while the rest were busied in cultivating a back field intended as a garden for these two young families  i was so pleased with what i saw that i gave the masters and mistresses some small matter and i resolved within myself if ever i should be able to gather together a little family of my own for the like purposes  now gentlemen here comes mr meeklys money quite in season for saving just so much of my own but hang it since i am grown suddenly rich i think i will be generous for once in my life and add as much more out of my proper stock i shall also make so free as to draw on my uncle there for the like sum and these totted together will make a pretty beginning of my little project as to my poor father here he has nothing to spare for he has already lavished all his wealth on his naughty boy  my lord and the company laughed heartily at harrys little pleasantry  but hearkee honest friend added the earl you must not think to expose me by leaving me out of your scheme cannot you lend me as much harry as will answer my quota yes my lord said harry upon proper securities i think i may venture you are a rogue and a darling and my treasure and my honor and my ornament cried the earl turning and bending fondly toward him while harrys eyes began to swim with pleasure and casting himself into his fathers bosom he there hid the tears of his swelling delight while mr clinton and mr meekly sat silently wrapped in the enjoyment of the tender scene  when harry was reseated gentlemen says he i must bid you adieu i am engaged on a party in the village this morning for this day i must quit the honor of being your lordships son and shall content myself with the station of one of your vassals or dependants and so saying he rose and away he shot  immediately the earl rung the bell and mr john entered john said he do you know any thing of harrys expedition into our town to day why my lord said john our loving townsmen have agreed to do all the honor they can to the arrival and welcome of your honorable brother the day is to be spent in sports and tomorrow is to be lighted up with the bonfires and luminations of this very night there is a football also to be and i fancy that my master harry designs to be no better than a hail fellow among them  tell me then my good john could you contrive so as to place us where we might see some of these diversions without being seen why please your honors the football is to be in our park and i can raise a stage of boards where by the help of a step ladder your honors may get up and peep over and so see all that passes get it done then get it done good john immediately  when john had gone out to execute his commission i believe sir said meekly to mr clinton that there is not such a boy as your nephew no not in the whole universe every look and accent every motion fiber and member so wonderfully answering to the meekness and modesty the honor the galantry and intrepedity of his spirit he shrinks from praise he is ashamed before it and yet his words sink as balm on the heart and his actions compel people to affront him with rejected honors wherever he goes while i look on his lovely and lowly countenance and inwardly embrace him as i would a part or portion of my god i secretly say to myself you are a proof my harry that the lower the roots of humility strike into the depths beneath the more the exalted branches ascend the heights of heaven i attend i study him as well for my instruction as delight and look upon and revere him as the most perfect copy that ever yet was taken of the omnipotent babe in the manger  the other day he preserved his noble father and me from being rent in pieces by a mad and foaming monster of a mastiff but his calmness of courage with his quickness of action his prowess and power on that occasion exceeded all that i ever met with in fable pray my lord have you not yet told you brother of that wonderful incident no indeed said the earl my harry continued with us till within this minute and i was cautious of offending him by mentioning the matter before him for he can scarce bear to be thanked for the charity that he gives and much less to be praised for any virtue or accomplishment o my brother my brother what do i not owe you a debt immense indeed never never to be paid for this precious this inestimable treasure of a boy  ah my lord cried mr clinton i am already overpaid your pearl has overpaid me for all my polishing nay i am become his debtor i am indebted to him for my life if that were a thing of value it is now about three weeks since he delivered me from the greatest peril i ever was in and in the wonderful manner i am going to tell you  the day before he set out for this place i desired him to take a walk with me in the fields where i inteded gradually to discover to him the heavy tidings of the death of his mother and brother  just as i began to open the matter to him i heard a sudden and terrifying roar and turning my eye to the place from whence it came i perceived a monstrous bull tearing the ground with his foot and denouncing his wrath in the voice of thunder when quitting a few kine among whom he stood he made directly at us instantly i cried out to harry and charged him to fly for his life but instead of obeying me he advanced with a hasty pace to meet the enraged animal  never was i in such a pannic as i then was for our precious boy i shook from head to foot and was just going to drop when the furious beast stooped his head to dash our child to pieces but harry quick as thought laid hold on a horn with one of his hands and rising into the air threw himself astride upon the creatures neck  the bull plunged and tossed and tore about at a frantic rate endeavoring to disencumber himself of his rider while harry took out his penknife and urged him to greater madness by pricking him with the point at length the monster all panting and white with foam stood still as a post when harry stooping made way through his hide opened the jugular vein and cut his windpipe in two and after some imperfect roars the creature sunk breathless beneath him  think of my transports then my brother when i saw my hero safe and smilingly triumphant i said and did things i believe that were quite beside my reason but i shall not be so readily alarmed for him hereafter as i see that his action intrepidity and presence of mind make him more than a match for any living creature  in some time after john returned and gave his lord notice that their station was prepared whereupon our company issued forth and ascended their seat of eminence where through the cover of some trees they could see and observe without being observed  after they had been seated and had talked awhile of truth the lord our righteousness of heart felt peace and the fearful looking out for judgment from the god of love a promiscuous crowd of many hundreds of old and young male and female entered and flooded the park  as all thronged about harry with an affectionate familiarity he appointed that football should begin the sports and two champions being chosen each of them chose his man and that man another alternately till about forty strenuous and active youths were ranged on either side  the field was then divided and the ball being tossed aloft in the midst they all mingled and jostled together like hailstones till after much running wrestling and sweating two games were successively lost on the side of the party where harry had ranged himself  ah cried the earl my poor harry i find is not accustomed to rude sports of this kind whereupon mr clinton laughed and cried he is a rogue he is a rogue as you will quickly see my lord  master harry master harry exclaimed his associates had you staid among us instead of going to that dull and heavy heeled london we would have taught you to play football better than you do  i never play right answered harry but when the girls are on my side and here i lay a wager of twenty guineas in hands of my daddy dobson that give me but my choice twenty of these pretty lasses and i will beat your two parties of fourscore from one barrier to the other what say you polly truck will you be on my side i will side with your honor against the world cried polly and away went her clothes to her jacket and under petticoat  on this facetious proposal of our heros a loud roar and laugh was set up that lasted a long time well well gentlemen said harry i will give you leave to double your laugh as soon as you are winners in the mean time my good polly be pleased to choose me out the rest of our fair fellows at football  when this was done harry took them all both males and females to the extremity of the barrier just opposite to his father extending to about a mile in length and while the girls stood panting through fear and emulation behind him he took the ball in hand and throwing it into the air gave it a kick as it descended aloof from his adversaries who were ranged directly against him and then following it like a bullet he gave it another kick before it touched the ground and pursued and pursued it with astonishing rapidity till he gave it the last kick high over the trees that reached high over the wall and over the heads of his parents  in the mean time polly truck had followed her beloved patron with all imaginable zeal and speed and had overrun all the lads by near a furlong at last she came up to harry panting and quite spent and wished to wish him much joy but was not able  while these things were in agitation our company beheld all from behind their cover and as harry approached their hearts beat a quick and equal measure with his feet even with such emotions as virgil ascribes to the bosom of latona while she beholds and contemplates her fair daughter dian so eminently transcending the choruses of her nymphs in grace beauty and excellence  as soon as polly truck was come to her speech laws your honor says she where in the world do you contrive to hide your wings i have nine holland smocks that i won by running at nine wakes and never was beaten before in my life harry laughed and gave his quondam playfellow a friendly shake of the hand  the company now began to come in apace though yet awhile incapable of utterance but gathering about harry they silently eyed him from head to foot and beheld him with a kind of venerating astonishment at last young felster the wit of the town cries i have always heared till now that all were fellows at football but here is one i am sure who has no fellow i will bet upon his head or rather on his heels against the ninetynine shires and desire no better than cripples to side him  at length old and young men and maidens got once more together and the question was started concerning the next sports upon which they should enter when they beheld a mighty giant approaching with strides that would have suited the arch of a river he was called by way of eminence the great roger of rosstown and was accompanied by his kinsman pelt the tanner  as soon as roger came up he very affectionately saluted those of his acquaintance asking what sport have ye got forward my brave boys the best sport answered jack felster would be to see your highness mr roger get a fall before night that man cried pelt does not step on english ground who will ever be able to crack of that feat why as to that matter said roger though i rose early this morning i have a strong fancy that i am up for the whole day tom truck cries felster if you will get on one side of him i will get on tother and try what hand we can make of this famous champion  accordingly the attack began but roger smiled superior and handled and played them together as a showman plays his puppits another wrestler was then added and then another but the four could no more move him than if he were a tower while he lifted them up in turns and laid them successively on the ground with the best natured caution  harry then came smilingly up and said mr roger if you will be so kind to teach me the art of wrestling i will make you a present of twenty guineas for your pains my daddy dobson there has the money in his pocket roger here surveyed our hero with the most inquisitive attention i rejoice to see your honor says he with all my heart and indeed it was for that only purpose that i came here to day having already heard the story of my cousins great mastiff but sir as you were proposing and as i honestly think you may do wonderfully well for a wrestler of quality for you are exceeding finely made as any thing can possibly be for the volume of you and as the jockeys say are the prettiest fellow of your inches i ever set my eyes on but you want something of my bulk master to give you the full powers however i thank your honor for your generous proffer i am ready to enter on my office whenever you please and i hope to make the very most of the little matter that is in you  they then grappled not as combatants but as tutor and pupil and the rogue harry submitted himself as a pliant twig in his hands while roger continued to initiate him in this trip and that trip and in the various methods of assailing and evading when harry perceiving his instructor a little overpoised suddenly gave him an inside foot and a push at the same instant toward the part to which he inclined  strait like a promontory sapped with all its pines nine paces huge the giant sidelong veered the tenth on bended knee his mighty arm upstaid  amazement filled the rustic powers to see with such slight moved their mightiest and a universal shout rent the wide welkin  roger rose and returned something abashed at his foil but said with apparent good humor i am sorry that i have not twenty guineas in my pocket to pay your honor for showing me that same trip however i hope you will give me one turn more for the victory i now engage you as a learner not as a teacher as you will says harry  here roger laid hold on harry with a truly hostile gripe while harry seized his brawny muscles as with little cramps of steel then was seen on either side the long calculated proportions of weight against action and of action against weight roger several times assayed to lift our hero between his hands and to lay him as he had served the other peasants on the ground but could not compel him to quit his gripes he then swayed him hither and thither and thrust him from him and pulled him to him and hooked and tripped him on every side but felt himself often staggered by the quick efforts of harry while the scales of contest seemed alternately inclining to either part at length roger beginning to find himself overbreathed plucked his adversary to him and bending heavily forward overshadowed and overbore our hero to the earth  great roger then rose triumphant and harry also arose in the best humor imaginable mr roger says he i hold it truly an honor that you think me worthy of contention although you have conquered but this has been a kind of fling for which i dont owe you a farthing till you can make me of a bulk approaching to yourself but come mr roger i will not take you at an advantage recover your breath and then as you said to me i hope you will give me another chance for the victory  soon after the combatants again engaged and mutually exerted their very utmost roger for saving his honor and harry for preventing an open disgrace before the face of so great an assembly they struggled they put every power of strength and art to the proof till roger finding himself beginning to fail had recourse to his former stratagem and plucking harry suddenly to him would again have overlaid him but our hero now aware slipped nimbly from under him and setting his right foot before the right foot of his adversary he gave a shove with his left hand to the others right shoulder and prostrate fell the great roger of rosstown extended over half a rood of ground  then indeed the clamours became immoderately high young felster above all others grew insolently triumphant and the girls could scarce be detained on the ground while they clapped hands and shouted and sprung up aloft in the congratulation of harrys unexpected victory  our hero then very affectionately stepped forward and gave roger a hand to help him up but he rose very slowly as he was something hurt by his fall mr roger says harry i am now doubly your debtor and will accordingly pay you double wages as you have taught me not only to throw others but to throw yourself also adad cried roger i find and feel too that you are already but too well taught to my hand  as soon as harry had paid roger his forty guineas part of which he borrowed from goodman demster roger seized his hand and kissing it ardently he cried o my conqueror my hero my noble child throughout life may all enemies fall before you nor death itself be able to fling my boy  just then the great bell rung loudly for dinner and harry turning and measuring the height of the park wall with a glance of his eye took a short race and running up it some steps caught hold of the copeing and threw himself over while all the assembly poured after him a shout of amazement  harry happened to alight within a few paces of the stage where his father and uncle sat but not attending to that he was hastening homeward when mr clinton cried out ho ho honest friend whither away so fast harry stopped and started and turning about looked something abashed to find that his so highly revered friends had been the spectators of his little feats and follies however he advanced toward them in order to help them down while the earl whispered to his brother and said now we shall see how proud our harry will be of having overcome the famous roger of rosstown  while they sat over a temperate meal why harry said the earl somewhat slily the great roger of rosstown was but a babe in your hands ah my lord cried harry smiling and blushing you are not yet rightly apprized how that matter stands it cost me no less than forty guineas to prevail upon mr roger to let me cast him but when your lordship was a boy perhaps you would have thought it but a small matter for the purchase of honor especially in the eyes of the pretty wenches indeed my harry said the earl i was a very very naughty boy at your years and had i been such a fellow as you are at this day i should have kept as large a seraglio as the sophy himself and that also of willing and kind hearted girls  just then john entered with tidings that an ambassy of a score of wenches waited at the halldoor and were pushing before them the prettiest maiden he ever beheld to be their spokeswoman  immediately my lord ordered that they should all be introduced and quickly after a clatter was heard without crying indeed indeed now miss aggy you must and shall speak for us  the door was then thrown open and a young creature entered coloring panting and palpitating and followed by the group of wenches who put her forward before them  the earl in pain for her sweet confusion did his best to encourage her and ordered harry to help them round with a glass of wine by the time that this was done miss aggy became a little better assured but had not yet dared to look one of them in the face but kept her eyes bent on the ground as though she had been ashamed of their brightness  if  if  my lord said she tremblingly and whisperingly if your honored  your very honorable brother is here  we come to invite him and his company to our townball  and we will attend you with pleasure my little angel cried the earl but pray who are you and where do you live  so please you my fathers name is abel jessamin and he is lately come tenant to part of your lordships estate  then i will make him a present of at least a years rent for his fair daughters sake here john give five guineas apiece to these pretty lasses to buy each of them a riband and do you hear bring me twenty guineas for this their chief ambassadress  not for the world my lord indeed i will not accept a farthing my father though poor is very jealous of his honor and should i take any thing from any man living he would never suffer me to darken the light that shines in at his door  aggy then made an elegant courtesey to the ground and retreated attended by her own graces and by the revereing and affectionate regards of the company  who can this creature be cried out the earl so lovely so uncommon such a sweet distinction about her ah exclaimed mr clinton what a pity it would be that such innocence should be seduced and such purity corrupted and yet that is most likely to be the case said mr meekly since beauty is the bawd that procures its own undoing and loveliness the very magnet that attracts men to its destruction harry half suppressed a sigh but said nothing  the horses were now immediately ordered to be put to and our company drove into the town accompanied by the acclamations of hundreds upon hundreds who lined the way  as soon as they came to the market place the coach set them down near a spacious flooring that was raised in open air about a foot from the ground and surrounded with benches behind benches and benches above benches to a great elevation  when they were shown to the seats prepared for them they were served with a variety of wines and cakes for our open hearted townsmen had spared no cost for the entertainment of their noble guests and their neighbors the band of music the choicest that could be got then struck up and the jubilee was opened in full triumph  my lord then wished in secret that harry and miss jessamin would lead the ball but observing that his son looked something dejected he imputed it to fatigue and suppressed his desire in the mean time the lads and lasses entered upon the stage and several footed it away featly and with all due applause  as harry had not yet opened his lips to the too too amiable aggy nor even presented his hand to lead her out she declined every other hand that was offered to her at length as the day began to lose of its luster mr clinton whispered to harry and requested the favor that he would dance an entry  the desire of father or uncle was instantly to harry the same as the command of the grand signior to his slave he rose stood forth and appointed the air and began to move with a slow and graceful measure but as the notes of the tune quickened he quickened his motions either now appeared to be wholly his native element no eye could perceive that his foot condescended to claim acquaintance with earth he trod air he spun around he soared aloft like a pyramid of fire while his limbs preserved the measure and his heels traversed each other as he shot forward or sideways with a quickness that dazzled the sight till poor aggy in the exuberance of her admiration very innocently and very inadvertently exclaimed sure sure that girl is not born who can deserve to have him all to herself  happily for aggy the company was so intent on the motions of our hero that few attended to her save harry himself who heard what she said to the very bottom of his heart  but aggy utterly confounded at the recollection of what she had uttered thought that the company and the whole world were privy to her shame her face neck and bosom were instantly suffused with crimson and she did not presume to raise her eye to any face or any object till she gently pulled her elderly aunt by the sleeve and stealing away deprived the assembly of its principal object and ornament  that night after supper while harry joined with the company in a kind of constrained cheerfulness they began to compliment him on the achievements and honors of the day when harry replied in evident discontent no more no more my friends indeed i never so thoroughly despised and detested myself as i do at this instant and so saying he rose hastily and withdrew to his chamber  mr meekly soon followed for he was to lie in the same room and he sat down in silence while harry was slowly undressing my dear young friend says he at length i grieve to see you indisposed indeed sir said harry i am not quite as i wish and fear i shall disturb you ah my dear boy cried meekly i know your disorder perfectly well i marked the rise and the progress i saw the whole as plain as pauls had aggy jessamin been indifferent to you you would have danced and conversed as familiarly with her as with any other wench but you dreaded your own feelings and you dreaded still more that those feelings should be betrayed to the observation of others i know aggy jessamin and her father she is indeed very lovely and very deserving but yet she is no mate for you my harry  ah sir cried harry since you have already seen so far into my soul i think i had better open my whole bosom to you you will look down upon me to be sure you will hold me in the utmost contempt but no matter for that so you promise not to love me the less  here i am deemed a mighty clever fellow forsooth at leaping high walls and flinging huge giants while alas i am flung myself by the least of my own infirmities and can no more wrestle against one of my passions than if each of them were a grecian hercules  i own to you mr meekly that i love aggy jessamin my heart also tells me that i shall always love her what then must be the consequence of my unhappy affection neither my father nor uncle will ever approve of our union and i would rather pine to death than offend the one or the other  should i happen to meet the sweet girl apart i fear nay i feel that i could not be able to resist the temptation and should she happen to yield what a ruin must ensue if she loved me it would break the poor things heart to be forsaken and the breaking of here is would break my heart also and yet i could never think of continuing in a criminal commerce  ah my dear mr meekly pity the weakness of your friend and pity the ignorance that he is in of his own spirit my heart exulted this very day in its own humility while it felt itself insensible to the acclamations of the vulgar and while i reflected that a few years would soon cripple the performer of such trifling exploits or possibly render me in old age the ridiculous boaster of the feats of my childhood but when the sweet breath of aggy gave its pleasing applause to my little matters vanity and selfesteem sunk with her approbation deep into my bosom and i have not yet been able to dispossess them  o such is my passion for her that could i get a dispensation but for a single trespass i would willingly do for it whole years of hermitical penance in the wilderness but what would that avail my friend or how might a whole eternity atone for the seduction of innocence and corruption of virtue  o help me then mr meekly help me to struggle against myself better is it to suffer all that the cruel conflict may cost me than to suffer the stings of that never ending remorse which would tear my soul for having injured the object of my affection  meekly was in tears and could not answer for some time  yes  says he at length i will assist you in this combat a combat more glorious than ever was fought by all the caesars and alexanders that ever drew sword and i will pray to the captain of our salvation in your behalf that he may sight the good fight both in you and for you and finally crown you with the wreath of eternal glory but then you must be ruled you must conform to the prescriptions of your severe but wholesome physician in short my dear child you must not see her any more  what never mr meekly never see her any more that is hard indeed  it is a necessary hardship could you answer to yourself the consequences of such an indulgence  i could not i could not i confess it my friend  i will prevail upon her father to send her far from you and i will look out for some agreeable and kind hearted man who may make her a worthy husband and be sensible of her merits   o you bear too hard upon me too hard indeed cried harry what give her to another and yet that is an ungenerous regret for why should i grudge that happiness to another which i cannot enjoy well then be it so since it must be so mr meekly take her bear her tear her away from my sight from my vitals but then she must not go empty take for her two thousand three thousand five thousand pounds she is welcome she is welcome to all that i am worth  here harry sat down and wept and was accompanied by his friend but the conflict was now over and though his heart was deeply grieved it was much more at ease  the next morning at breakfast harry appeared to be quite composed when the earl taking a bundle of papers from his pocket turned with a fond and conciliating air to mr clinton and said my dearest brother when you shall be at leisure to cast your eye over this parcel you will find that i have not been altogether at least not all along the unnatural kinsman you had cause to apprehend these are copies of the letters which i sent in search of you through several parts of europe and in which i petitioned you to pardon my past offenses and to return and possess yourself of your rights in the half of my fortune and the whole of my heart  precious pledges cried mr clinton are all things to me that bring me any instance of the affection of so dear a brother and so saying he put the papers into his bosom  but tell me my ever amiable harry clinton continued the earl where in the world could you hide yourself from my enquiries these twenty years past i have got some scattered sketches of your history from mr meekly and my son here and have been burning to learn the whole but dreaded to ask you that favor lest the recollection of some passages should give you distress i refuse no pain to do you a pleasure my brother  here the honorable mr clinton began his story as formerly recited and that night sent his auditors weeping to bed  on the following morning when he came to that part of his narrative where lady maitland broke away he proceeded as follows  having traveled through several parts of france and italy i took germany in my tour i staid some time at spa where i drank the waters and within the year arrived in perfect health at rotterdam  on a visit to mr de wit at his villa near the city he told me over our bottle that he had at that time in his house and in his guardianship one of the most extraordinary women in the universe though she is now says he advancing toward the decline of life she is by far the most finished female i ever beheld while all she says and all she does give a grace to her person that is quite indiscribable she has a youth too her son with her who is nearly as great a rarity as herself and were it not that his complexion is sallow and that he is something short of a leg and blind of one eye he would positively be the most lovely of all the human species  you put me in mind said i laughing of the barratarian wench who was commended to governor sancho as the most accomplished beauty within a league with this exception only that one eye was blind and that the other ran with brimstone and vermilion but pray who are these wonders  that said he i either cannot or must not declare they are evidently people of the first fashion and must have some uncommon reasons for their present conduct as they live quite retired and admit of no company  i protest said i you have raised my curiosity in earnest is there no managing so as to procure me a short tete a tete with em i wish there was says he for i long to know how far your sentiments agree with mine in this matter yesterday the lady told me that she intended to go and reside some time in england and that i would oblige her by getting a person duly qualified to initiate her and her son in the language of the country and now if such a fine gentleman could condescend to undress himself you might come tomorrow as a person who wanted hire and i might introduce you to an interview by the way of treating provided you are upon honor not to reveal any thing concerning them or their place of abode  the next morning i waited on mr de wit under the appearance of a reduced gentleman a character that excites a mixture of contempt and compassion  the lady received and spoke to me with that dignified complacence which awes while it engages and while it attracts forbids an irreverent familiarity she was indeed every thing that my friend had boasted of her for though her person was all majesty her manner was all grace will you answer for the discretion of this young man mr de wit i will madam says he i bowed to them both  on turning i perceived that her son eyed me with much attention and i on my part surveyed him with the utmost astonishment he labored indeed apparently under all the disadvantages that my friend described but enchantment lurked in his accents and in the dimpling of his lips and when he smiled heaven itself was infused through the fine roundings of his olivecoloured countenance  in short i felt such a sudden attachment to these extraordinary personages that i resolved to keep on the deception at least for a few days and accordingly engaged with them at a stated salary  i entered on my province my young pupil especially began to improve apace and as i was particularly cautious of observing the distant respect that suited my station i grew into great favor both with mother and son  how long mr de wit would say do you propose to carry on this farce till i can prevail upon them i answered to accompany me to england for i feel my affections so tied to them that i cannot think of parting  on a day as i sat with my pupil in his apartment he happened to let his book fall and as i stooped to take it up the picture of my matilda that was richly enamelled and set with brilliants to a great value suddenly loosed from its ribband and dropped through the bosom of my shirt upon the floor  i stood concerned and greatly abashed by this accident but my pupil still more alarmed started up and catching at it gazed upon it intensely ha my friend said he i doubt you are an impostor the proprietor of this jewel would never set himself out to hire without some sinister design who sir and what are you  i own said i my sweet fellow that i am not what i seem i am of noble delcent and of riches sufficient to purchase a principality  and what then could induce you to impose upon us as you have done  curiosity at first and then the strong inclination which i took both to you and your mother at our first interview neither did i propose to reveal myself till we should reach my native country where all sorts of honors and affluence attend you  tell me then said he whose picture is this a very lovely one indeed is this the face sir of your mistress or your wife looking very inquisitively at me ah said i she was once mistress of thousands of hearts nobles waited before her drawing room and dukes near her toilet she was once also my wife but the dear saint is now eternally blessed in a more suitable bridegroom  will you indulge me sir said he with the story of your loves it may atone in great measure for your late deception which however well meant was very alarming  here i related to him the short pathetic history that i told you of my matilda with which he was so affected and in such violent agitation that i was quite affrighted for him and stopped several times but he insisted on my proceeding  ah said he when i concluded should i ever be consorted in the manner that you and your matty were how blessed i shall think myself i have says i a little cousin in england perhaps the loveliest child in the world and if you will marry her when you both come to proper years i will settle ten million of french money upon you mean time i beseech you to say nothing to your mamma of what has passed i will not said he unless i see a discretionary necessity for it  that night i went to the city to settle the affairs of my household on my return next morning i met mr de wit at the gate of his court ah my friend said he our amiable guests are departed gone i cried gone which way where to i pray you that also is a secret said he which i am not permited to tell you late in the evening there arrived a retinue of about twenty servants strongly armed and mounted with a flying chaise and six horses and a packet of letters the lady did not go to bed but ordered all things to be in readiness for their departure against the rising of the moon when they were near setting out and going to bid me adieu have you no commands madam said i for the good young man your tutor not a penny says she i cannot afford wages equivalent to servants of his quality how madam said i is my friend then detected but it was a very innocent and friendly fraud i assure you i should not have imposed him upon your ladyship did i not know you to be safer in his honorable hands than in those of any other  i then gave them an account of your family your vast fortune nor was i quite silent as to your merits my dear harry and i added that i was sensible you would be deeply afflicted at the departure of persons to whom you were so strongly attached there is no help for it replied my lady we have reasons of utmost import for not disclosing ourselves to him tell him however that we esteem him highly  affect him tenderly  shall think of him  shall pray for him  and  and  lastly  that you saw us drop a grateful tear to his remembrance  as i could extort no further intelligence from my friend mr de wit i parted in a half kind of chagrin and prepared to pursue my fugitives though i knew not what road to take nor where to turn me for the purpose at all adventures however i set out on the way to france as they appeared to be of that country as well by the elegance of their manners as by their fluency in the language  i was attended by eleven of as brave and faithful fellows as ever thrust themselves between their master and danger  on the fifth or sixth day as we got on the borders of french flanders in an open and desolate way with a forest far on the left a man rode toward us on the spur and approaching cried out help gentlemen for heavens sake help to rescue my dear ladies who are plundered and carried away by the banditti they have already killed twenty of my companions and i alone am left to cry out for relief  i bid him lead and we followed  in a few minutes we came where we saw a great number of the dead and dying covering the sand and thin herbage but our leader cried out stop not here my noble friends yonder they are yonder they are they have but just taken away all our horses luggage and coach and are now at the plunder i am weak through loss of blood but will help you the best i may  here he spurred again toward the enemy but his horse would not answer his courage i then looked about to observe if any advantage could be taken for i perceived that the ruffians were still very numerous about thirty who had survived the late combat but seeing that the country was quite open and that we had nothing but resolution and our god to help us i commended myself to him in so good a cause and putting my horse to speed i rode full at the foe confident of being well and gallantly seconded  when the banditti perceived us they instantly quitted the plunder and gathering into a group they prepared their carabines and discharged them full at us as we drew near  as i happened to be foremost i received the greatest damage one of their balls gave me this mark in my neck another passed through the flesh of my left shoulder and another through my hat and left this scar in my head  but when we came in upon them as the romans say comminus ense hand to hand had they doubled their numbers they would have been as nothing to us my faithful irishman levelled half a score of them with his own hand and in less than three minutes we had no opponent in the field i then rode up to the coach and perceived two ladies in it pale as death and sunk senseless to the bottom  immediately i ordered james my surgeons mate to take a little blood from them and on their recovery to follow me with all my people and all the horses baggage etc to the nearest inn then feeling my wounds begin to smart i took my surgeon with me and gallopped away  in about a league we came to a large house of entertainment and finding myself sick and qualmish through the great effusion of blood i had my wounds directly dressed and taking a draught of wine whey got into a warm bed  after a night of uneasy slumbers the curtain of my bed was gently drawn aside and awaking i heard a voice say in soft music ah my dear mamma it is he it is he himself  on lifting my feeble eyes i perceived a vision at my side of a female appearance but more wonderful and more lovely than any thing i had ever conceived of the inhabitants in bliss her eyes swam in glory and her whole form seemed a condensing or substantiation of harmony and light  while i gazed in silent astonishment i heard another voice say dont you know us my son my dear mr clinton dont you remember your pupils dont you remember your blind lame and tawny lewis he is now turned into that passable girl there whose honor and whose life you yesterday preserved at the great peril of your own  here seizing her hand i pressed it to my lips and cried am i then so blessed my honored madam as to have done some service to the two dearest objects of my hearts fixed affections soft says she none of these transports your surgeon tells us that repose is necessary for you mean time we will go and prepare the best regimen that the place can afford for your nourishment and after that i will send a dispatch to my lord and let him know how far how very deeply he and we and all his house are indebted to you  for that day and the following week as my fever grew something high i saw no more of the daughter and the mother staid no longer than to administer something to me or barely to enquire how i was at length i got a cool and began to recover when the former vision descended upon my ravished senses the vision of that louisa the sight of whom never failed to bring cheer to the eyes and delight to the hearts of all beholders  they sat down by my side and my lady taking my hand and looking tenderly at me what would you think said she smiling of my louy for a wife ah madam i exclaimed she would be too much of bliss too precious too glorious too overpowering for the heart and senses of any mortal dont tell me cries my lady in my eyes my harry you are full as amiable for a husband as she can be for a wife beside you have earned her my son she is your own dear purchase by a service of infinite value and at the price of your precious blood she has told me the story of your first love and the recollection of it never fails to bring tears from my eyes but i must hereafter hear the whole from your own mouth with all your other adventures the smallest incident will be very interesting to me i assure you o my dear my sweet fellow you are to a hair the very man i wish for my louisa the brave the tender gentle and generous heart just the thing i would have wished for myself when i was at the age of my louy  but my dearest my honored madam loved and honored next to heaven you have not yet told me how your louisa is inclined whereupon the bewitching creature archly smiling and blushing and reaching forth a polished hand of living alabaster here she cried i present you with this trifle in token that i dont hate you  very much  my clinton said my lady i have sent off my favorite servant gerard with my dispatches to my lord he is the only one that remains of all my retinue your surgeon has dressed his wound and pronounces it so slight as not to incommode him in his journey i chose him more particularly for the carrier of my purposes as he was the witness of your valor as he can testify to my lord with what intrepidity you rushed foremost into the thick of the assassins and with what unexampled bravery you defeated in a short time a body of four or five times your number these things i trust will have their due weight for though my lord is of a lofty and inflexible nature he is yet alive to the feelings of honor and justice so that our affairs have a hopeful and auspicious aspect but you are a little flushed my child we will not encroach further upon you till tomorrow  during the three following weeks though confined to my bed i was permitted to sit up and my wounds though not skinned were healing apace what happiness did i enjoy during that ecstatic interval the maternal and filial angels scarce ever left my side one morning when i just awoke from a terrifying dream they both entered with peace and comfort and healing in their countenances  what is the matter my harry said my lady your face does not seem composed to that fortitude and complacence which is seated in your heart ah madam i cried i have been all night tormented with the most alarming and horrible visions i ever had in my life three times i dreamed successively that my louisa and i were walking hand in hand through the fields of elysium or on the banks of meander or in the gardens of alcinous gazing and drinking in large draughts of love from each other when at one time a huge and tremendous dragon and again a sudden earthquake and again an impetuous hurricane came and caught and severed us far asunder  but my visions my honest friend said the heavenly smiling louisa have been of a very different nature i dreamed that while we were standing on the brink of a frightful precipice together your matilda descended all celestial and a thousand times more lovely than she appears in the lovely portrait that you carry about you at first i feared that she came to reclaim you to herself but instead of that she smiled upon me and began to caress me and taking my right hand she put it into yours then ascending in her brightness she hovered awhile on high and casting down upon me a look of fixed love she gave me a beck with her hand as it were to follow and was immediately lost in glory  o my dear children cried the marchioness for such she was might i but once see ye united how i should lift my head or rather how satisfied i should be to lay it down in peace having nothing further to care for on this side of eternity  that night i slept sounder than usual and did not awake till the day was something advanced on opening the curtain i saw james seated in a moody posture by the side of my bed how are the ladies james said i gone sir gone gone i cried out yes sir gone indeed but with very heavy hearts and both of them drowned in tears here has been a large body of the gens darmes sent for them so that there was no resisting poor gerard went on his knees to his lady to beg permission to throw himself at your honored feet as he said and to bid you adieu but she would not allow him mean time she charged me with this watch and ring and this letter for your honor  i catched at the letter and tearing it open read over and over a thousand times what will for ever be engraven in my memory and on my heart  we leave you we leave you most beloved of men and we are miserable in so doing but alas we are not our own mistresses my lord for this time has proved unjust and ungrateful and refuses your louisa as well to my prayers as to your infinite merits he has affianced her as it seems to a prince of the blood and his ambition has blinded him to all other considerations be not yet in despair we shall exert our very utmost to get this injurious sentence reversed and if your louisa inherits my blood or spirit not all the engines in france will ever compel her to give her hand to another in the mean time follow us not come not near us we beseech you should you be discovered you will inevitably be assassinated and we also should perish in your loss my son we are distracted by our fears for you and it is this fear that has prevented us from disclosing ourselves fully to you keep up your correspondence however with our friend de wit and through him you shall learn the first favorable turn that happens in our affairs i leave you my ring in token of your being the wedded of our heart and louisa leaves you her watch to remind you of time past and to look upon when at leisure and think of  your eloisa de  your louisa de     yes i cried ye precious relics ye delicious memorandums to my lips to my heart be ye the companions of my solirude the consolers of my affliction sooner shall this arm be torn off and time itself pass away than one or the other shall be divided from my custody  ah how useless are admonitions to the impatience of a lover fervent love can know no fears i was no sooner able to sit my horse than i set off directly for paris with this precaution only that my people would call me by my mothers maiden name of goodall  as we knew not the names or titles of those after whom we were in search our eyes became our only inquisitors and we daily ranged the town poreing into every carriage of distinction for a sight of the mother or daughter and even prying among the lacqueys and liveries for the face of our friend gerard  on a day as my valiant tirlah and i rode a broad reconnoitring the suburbs we heard a noise and a shout of distress that issued from a distant farmhouse and as we hastened up the tumult grew louder and the cry of help and murder was several times repeated  we instantly knocked at the door but were refused admittance when tirlah alighting ran against it and breaking through bars and all with his foot threw the door off its hinges  on entering we saw a man stretched on the broad of his back in the floor with four others about him who were going to use him very barbarously stay your hands i cried i will shoot the first man through the head who shall dare to proceed in this business  why sir said a young fellow rising this man wanted to be gracious with my pretty young wife i caught him in the very attempt and so i think it but fair and honest to spoil him at such sport for time to come ay but said i you might murder him and i cannot suffer that come my friend no harm appears to be done as yet and if he pays a handsome penance for the wickedness of his intention i would advise you to pass matters over for the present say how much do you demand five hundred louis dors said the fellow if he pays that he shall be quit for this turn  five hundred louis dors i exclaimed why all the clothes on his back are not worth the hundredth part of the sum true master said the peasant winking but his pockets may happen to be richer than his clothes well said i if he secures you in half the sum i think you may be satisfied why master since you have said it i will not go back whereupon the astonished prisoner was permitted to rise  what do you say you sad man you are you willing to pay this fellow the sum i agreed for in compensation of the injury you attempted to do him i am sir said he with many thanks for your mediation then hastily putting his hand to his pocket he took out a note on the customs which with some small matter of cash made up the money and we departed the house together  as i was just going to mount he came up and accosted me with elegance and dignity sir said he you have made me your debtor beyond expression beyond the power of princes to pay be pleased however to accept the little i have about me here are five thousand louis in this little notebook not a penny sir indeed i am by no means in want you must not refuse said he some token of my acknowledgment here is a stone valued at double the sum i offered you then taking from a pocket the diamond button of his hat he presented it to me you must excuse me sir said i i can accept of no consideration for doing an action of humanity and i rejoice to have preserved a person of your distinction and generosity i then turned my horse and though he called after me i rode away being neither desirous of knowing or being known  my researches hitherto being altogether fruitless i imagined i might with better likelihood meet my beloved in the public walks public theaters or rooms of distinguished resort  one night as i sat alone in a side box at the opera intently gazing and hungering around for some similitude of my louisa there entered one of the loveliest young fellows i ever beheld he carelessly threw himself beside me looked around withdrew his eyes and then looked at me with such a long and piercing inquisition as alarmed me and gave me cause to think i was discovered  though the french seldom hesitate he seemed at once backward and desirous of accosting me at length he entered upon converse touching the drama and the music and spoke with judgment and elegance superior to the matter while i answered him with due complacence but in a manner that partook of that regardlesness for trifles which then sat at my heart  between the acts he turned and cast his eye suddenly on me sir says he do you believe that there is such a thing as sympathy occasionally sir i think it may have its effect though i cannot credit all the wonders that are reported of it i am sorry for that said he as i ardently wish that your feelings were the same as mine at this instant i never saw you before sir i have no knowledge of you and yet i declare that were i to choose an advocate in love a second in combat or a friend in extremity you you are the very man upon whom i would pitch  i answered not but seized his hand and pressed it to my bosom i conceive sir continued he notwithstanding your fluency in the language that you are not a native my name is daubigny i live at such a place and if you will do me the pleasure of a single visit all the honors respects and services that our house can confer shall be yours without reserve sir said i i am of england my name is goodall and as soon as a certain affair allows me to admit of any acquaintance in paris you shall be the first elected of my arms and my heart  in a few nights after as tirlah and i were turning a corner of the rue de st jaques we saw three men with their backs to the wall attacked by nearly three times their number we did not hesitate a moment what part to take at the first pass i ran one of the assassins through the body tirlah levelled two more with his oaken staff and the rest took to flight  gentlemen said one of the three i thank you for this brave and seasonable assistance  roche run for a surgeon i am wounded i doubt dangerously  pierre lend me your arm  come gentlemen we have but a little way to my house  though the night was too dark for examining features i thought that the voice was not quite unknown to me within a few minutes we arrived at a palace that retired inward from the houses that were ranged on either hand on pulling the hanger of a bell the great door opened upon a sumptuous hall which led to a parlour enlightened by a silver sconce that hung from the vaulting  as we entered the master turned short upon me and looking full in my face and starting and lifting his hands in surprise great ruler of events he cried the very man i wished my brother and companion through life and this is the very man you have sent to my rescue  just then the surgeon arrived and i heard him hastily asking where the marquis was on entering he said i am sorry for your misfortune my lord but matters may be better than we apprehend and immediately he took out his case of instruments one of the ruffians said the marquis before i was aware came behind and ran me through the back  the surgeon then tipped open his lordships wastecoat and changed color on seeing his shirt drenched in blood but getting him quickly undressed and having probed his wound he struck his hands together and cried courage my friends it is only a fleshbusiness the weapon has passed clear of the ribs and vitals  as soon as the marquiss wound was dressed and that we had got him to bed i fancy sir said i to the surgeon i may have some small occasion for a cast of your office i feel a little smart in my sword arm  on stripping he found that a chance thrust had entered about half an inch into the muscle above my elbow and had ripped up some of the skin but he quickly applied the proper dressing and i was preparing to take my leave when the marquis cried out you must not think of parting my dear friend you are the master of the master here and lord of this house and of all that is in it  the surgeon then ordered his lordship to compose himself as soon as possible and having wished him a good night i sent tirlah to my lodgings to let my people know that i was well and in friendly hands i was then conducted by the domestics to a superb apartment where a bed was prepared and where a small supper of elegancies lay fuming on the sideboard  having swallowed a few bits with a glass or two of wine i rose and sauntered through the room musing on my louisa heavily sighing and nearly despairing of being ever able to find her  some time after i sat down to undress and get to bed when a number of the officers of justice silently entered my chamber seized my sword that i had put off and coming whisperingly to me commanded me to accompany them without making any noise  i saw that it was madness to resist and as i went with them i observed that two of the family liveries had joined themselves to the officers it then instantly occurred that i was in the house of my rival that the marquis was the very person to whom my louisa had been destined that i was somehow discovered and that they were conducting me to the bastile of which i had heard as many affrighting stories as are usually told of the inquisition  ah traitor said i to myself is it thus you serve the man who but now saved your life at the expense of his own blood let no one hereafter trust to the bleating of the lamb or the courting of the turtle the roaring of the lion and the pounces of the vulture may thus deceitfully lurk under the one and the other  after passing some streets they took me to a large house where dwelt one of their chief magistrates being also a member of their parliament having knocked respectfully at the gate and waited some time at length we were admitted and they took me to a kind of lobby where we staid while one of the posse went to advise the justiciary of my attendance at length he returned and accosting me in a tone of surly and discouraging authority friend says he my lord is engaged and not at leisure to night tomorrow perhaps he may hear what you have to plead in your own defense so saying he and his fellows thrust me into a waste room and locked and chained the door upon me and laughing bid me to warm or cool my heels at pleasure  fool fool that i was said i to quit the side of my brave and faithful companions how quickly should we have discomfited this magistrate and all his host but i must be a knight adventurer forsooth and draw my sword in the defense of every scoundrel who goes the street  i then went and felt the windows to try if i could force a passage for making my escape but finding that all were grated with strong and impassable bars of iron o i cried that this marquis this ungrateful daubigny were now in his fuilest strength and opposed to me point to point that i might reclaim from him in an instant the life i have given  i then traversed the room with an inconsistent pace now rashly resolving on furious events and again more sedately deliberating on what i had to do till having ruminated thus for the remainder of the night i at last became more at ease and resigned myself to the dispensations of alldisposing providence though i confess with a gloomy and reluctant kind of content  when the day appeared and was something advanced i heard my door unlocking and the chain taking away and i concluded that they came to summon me to my trial but instead of the officers of justice i saw near twenty men in the marquiss livery who silently bowed down before me and respectfully showed me with their hand the way out of my prison i followed them also in silence and getting into the street i wished to know if i was really free and turned from them down the way that led to my lodgings whereupon they cast themselves before me and in a supplicating posture besought me to go with them  finding then that i was still their prisoner i gave a longing look out for my valiant fellows but as they did not appear i suffered myself to be reconducted to the marquiss palace and followed my obsequious commanders into the proud apartment to which they had led me the preceding night and where bowing to the ground they all left me and retired  as i had been much fatigued in body and mind i threw myself on the bed leaving events to their issues and fell into a kind of starting and intermitting slumber when i heard a voice at my side shout out in once loved accents o my dearest mamma it is he indeed it is he it is he himself  on this i awoke and rouzed myself and lifting my languid eyes and fixing them on the object that stood before me and are you then i cried are you also louisa in the confederacy against me  say nothing you are not the louisa i once knew  i will arise i will go forth not all your gates and bars and bolts shall hold me i will tear my body and my soul too if possible from you for ever  go to your betrothed to your beloved and leave me to perish it is a matter of no import  i am yet pleased that i saved your chosen as it may one day serve to reproach you with the merits of the man whom he has so unworthily treated  i could no more a long silence on all sides ensued save the language that was uttered by heavings and sobbings when the marchioness coming and casting herself on her knees by my bed you have reason sir she exclaimed you have reason to reproach and to detest every branch of our ungrateful family for ever you saved myself you saved my daughter and yet the father and the husband proved averse to your deservings and turned your benefits into poison you have now saved our son the only one who can convey our name to posterity and yet from the beginning you have received nothing in return save wounds pains and sickness losses damages and disappointments and at this very day the most ignominious usage where you merited endless thanks and everlasting renown blame my louisa then and me but blame not my son sir for these unworthy events he is quite innocent of them he is shocked and distracted by them he respects and loves you more than ever jonathan loved the son of jesse but he will not he dare not see you till we have in some measure made his peace  how madam i cried  but no more of that posture it pains me past bearing  is it a fact can it be possible that the marquis daubigny should be your son is he not of the blood royal the very rival whom your letter rendered so formidable to me and was it not by his order that i was disgracefully confined in a dungeon all night  no no said my lady he would have suffered the rack first he is in despair quite inconsolable on that account let us go my dearest harry let us go and carry comfort to him of whom you are the beloved  ah no my mamma cried out louisa let us put no constraint on mr clinton i pray you there has been enough of confinement we leave him now to his liberty let him go even where and to whom he likes best once indeed we could have tied this allconquering champion with the spinning of a silkworm but now he tells us that neitheir gates bars not bolts shall hold him to us  here i threw myself precipitately at her feet pardon pardon my louisa i cried o pardon the misdeeming transports of your lover and pardon the faults that love alone could commit my enemies are foreign to me they and their injuries affect me not but you are regent within my louisa you sit throned in my heart and the presumption of an offense from you makes strange uproar in my soul well says she reaching her hand and smiling through tears since it is so poor soul here is the golden scepter for you i think i must take you to mercy  i caught her hand and impressed my very spirit on the wax and my lady casting her arms about us and kissing us both in turns requested that we should go and carry some consolation to her dear repining lewis  as we entered his chamber the marchioness cried out here he comes my son we have brought your beloved to you yet not your mr goodall as you thought but one who is at once both your good angel and our good angel even our own harry clinton the betrothed of our souls  i took my seat on the side of the marquiss bed and looking fondly upon him would have enquired of his health but my speech for the time was overpowered by my affections then taking my hand in his the power of this hand says he i have found to be great but has your heart the power to pardon the insults and outrage you have received in the house of him who is so deeply your debtor my lord said i i have already drank largely of lethe on that head nothing but my diffidence of your regard can offend me  you know not said my lady you know not yet my dear harry how this provoking business came about i will explain it in a few words  on our return to paris and on our remonstrances to my late lord of the inestimable services you had rendered to his family he enquired your character among the english and notwithstanding the report of the nobility of your birth and your yet nobler qualities hearing also that you had acquired part of your fortune in trade he conceived an utter contempt for you and took an utter aversion to you  some time after as he took notice that louisa and i wanted our watch and our ring i dreaded his displeasure and gave him room to think that the robbers had taken them from us in flanders and this report became current among our domestics  in the mean time my lord became importunate with our louisa respecting her marriage with the prince of c  who was then with the army and her prayers and tears hitherto had been the only artillery which she had used in her defense but when the couriers brought word that the prince was on his return my lord sent for louisa and gave her instant and absolute orders to prepare for her nuptials but she full as positively and peremptorily replied that her soul was already wedded that she would never prostitute her body where her heart was an alien and that all the tortures of the inquisition should not change her resolution her father thereupon rose to such ungovernable fury that with one blow of his hand he struck her senseless to his feet but when he saw my lamb my darling all pale and as dead before him the tide of nature returned and the conflict of his passions became so violent that an impostume broke in his stomach and falling he was suffocated and expired on the spot  soon after the prince arrived he had never seen my daughter but his ambition to possess a beauty of whom the grand monarch himself was said to have been enamoured had caused him to demand her in marriage for that purpose he also did us the honor of a visit louisa refused to appear and i told his highness with the best grace i could that she happened to be preengaged in a few days after he met my son in the thuilleries and accosted him to the same intent but my son had been previously prejudiced in your favor my harry and answered the prince with so cold or so haughty an air that further words ensued they both drew and his highness was slightly wounded but as company interposed the affair was hushed up and shortly after the prince was killed in a nightly broil upon the pont neuf we then wrote to our friend de wit to advertise you of these matters and to hasten you hither but you arrived my child you arrived before there could be any expectation of an answer  two days ago as i observed that my lambs spirits were something dejected i prevailed upon her to take an airing to our country villa on our return this morning we were struck half dead with the news that our lewis was wounded and dangerously ill in his bed we flew into his room and were still more alarmed to find him in a fury that is not to be imagined while jacome his old steward was on his knees all pale and quaking at a distance before him villain he cried what have you done with my friend what have you done with my champion the preserver of my life  please your lordship said he trembling i took him for a highwayman i saw my ladys ring and my young mistresss watch in his custody i will swear to the property before the parliament of paris and so i lodged him in prison  till  till   go wretch cried my son recall your information take all your fellows with you and instantly bring me back my friend or your ears shall be the forfeit but conduct him to his own chamber i cannot yet bear to see him i cannot bear the reproach that his eye must cast upon me  all afflicted and yet more astonished my louisa and i sat down by the side of my son casting looks of surprise and enquiring doubt on each other at length i said what is this that i hear of our ring and our watch alas he is no highwayman who took them from us they were our own free gift a mite in return for a million of services but do you know any thing of the possessor i know answered lewis that he is the loveliest of mankind the preserver of my life and that his name is goodall ah screamed out louisa there we are lost again this goodall must certainly have murdered our precious clinton and possessed himself of our gifts he would never have parted with them while he had life o my sister said my son when you see my friend goodall you will think nothing of your harry clinton why why were you so hasty so precipitate in your choice a robber a murderer no had i a thousand lives i would pawn them all for the probity that heaven has made apparent in the face of my preserver  it is with shame and great reluctance my dearest brother that at times i recite passages tending so much to my own praise and yet did i omit them i should do great injustice to the kind and amiable partiality of those who were so fondly my lovers and my beloved  but madam said i to the marchioness did you not hint something of his majestys being enamoured of my louisa ah such a rival would be a terrible business indeed especially in a country of unlimited power  there is no fear of that now said my lady the king has changed his fancy from young mistresses and old counselors to young counselors and old mistresses but what i mentioned was once very serious and alarming  my louisa was scarce turned of fourteen when the duchess de choisseul requested her company to marlay where the court then was the king fixed his eye on her and enquired who she was but took no further notice at that time missing her however at the next and again at the following drawing room he asked the marquis what became of his fair daughter said he had a place in his eye for her and desired in an accent of authority that he would send her to court  the marquis instantly took the alarm he was ever jealous of his honor and singularly nice in matters of female reputation he gave his majesty a sort of equivocal consent and hurrying home ordered me directly to prepare for carrying my daughter out of the french dominions the night was employed in hastening and packing we disguised our louisa in the manner as you saw her metamorphosed at rotterdam and set off for holland before day the rest you know my clinton as you were the principal mover in all our concerns  but tell me my lewis can you conjecture on what account those assassins set upon you  i declare madam said the marquis i cannot perhaps they mistook me for another or now i recollect it might be owing to some familiar chat which i had the other night with a pretty opera girl who is said to be in the keeping of a very great man but madam you forgot to tell my brother how my father was banished on account of louisa to his paternal seat in languedoc on the borders of the mediterranean very true said the marchioness and was not recalled till madame maintenon was taken into supreme favor  but i wonder what is become of our faithful gerard i thought that he would have been the first to come and to throw himself at the feet of his hero indeed my harry he would have tired any who loved you less with his praises and perpetual talking of you and your exploits  o here he comes  step in gerard is there any one in this company that you remember beside the family  gerard then advanced with a halffrantic aspect and kneeling and grappling at my hand seemed desirous of devouring it god be praised he cried god be praised my noble my glorious master that i see you once again and above all that i have the blessing of seeing you in a place where a throne of beaten gold should be raised to your honor o had i been here all sorts of respects and worships instead of indignities should have been paid to your deservings but i have provided for the hangdog jacome i have tied him neck and heels and tumbled him into the dark vault  ay said i but my good friend gerard i have not yet got my share of satisfaction upon him pray show me where he is i then followed gerard to the place where the deplorable wretch was cast and cutting all his cords i led him back to the company and warmly joined his petition for pardon and restoration  as soon as jacome and gerard were withdrawn ah my brother cried the marquis what new name shall we find for a man of your new character moreover what shall we do with you what shall we do for you you have quite overpowered us we sink we drown under the sense of our obligations we have nothing worth your acceptance save this simple wench and what is she in comparison of what we owe you ah i cried she is that without whom all things are nothing she is the living treasure the rachel of rachels seventy times seven years were too short a service for her i would not exchange this little pearly joint of this very little finger for all the gems that glow in the mines of india and so saying i pressed the precious finger with my lips while louisa turned upon me an eye of such ineffable satisfaction and melting acknowledgment as sunk upon my soul and wrapped it in elysium  ay but my harry said the marquis you ought not to prize your louy as much as me she did not fall in love with you at first sight as i did how do you know that honest friend cried louisa is there a necessity that our tongues as well as our blushes should be telltales are maidens to trumpet forth their thoughts like you broad fronted men whose ornament is your boldfacedness  thus happy above all styled happy upon earth we joyed and lived in each other continuing a mutual commerce of delightful sensibilities and love for love  alas our blissful junto was soon to be broken in upon in a few days one of the royal pages came and intimated to the marchioness that his majesty required her immediate presence at court and we remained in a kind of fearful and fluctuating suspense till her return  as she entered the consternation in her countenance instantly struck an alarm to all our hearts o my children my dear my dear children we must part she cried and that too speedily our hour of bliss is past our sunshine is over and the clouds gather thick upon us heavy laden with wretchedness alas my heart misgave me ever since that inauspicious encounter the other morning as we came from our villa a great funeral met us a bad omen as i have heard our carriage stopped to let them pass and the carriage of the duke of ne  rs drove up beside us as we remained within a few paces of each other he gazed at louisa with such an unmannerd intenseness as caused her to color and turn aside however he accosted us not nor enquired concerning us it seems our arms and livery were too sure an indication of our name and quality in short on my approaching the presence the king affected to smile very graciously upon me and said i have provided madam a noble and princely husband for your daughter it is the duke of ne  rs ah i cried bending my knee in a supplicating posture my daughter is already engaged by bands of the most endearing and indissoluble obligations to a man who has preserved the lives and honors of all our family to a man who i trust by his eminent courage and qualities will become the brightest jewel in your majestys crown madam said he severely you must withdraw your election i find i have ordered matters superior to your merits but my will is the law here and shall be obeyed i rose dejectedly curtsied and withdrew without reply  ah i exclaimed on what summit does this rival hold his abode i will instantly go and scale it and at once put an end to his life and his pretensions my lady then throwing her arms about my neck and pressing her lips to my cheek what romance says she is this my harry would you at once fight the duke and the king and the whole army of france no my child prudence reduces us to more salutary however deplorable measures we must part my harry we must part this very night and my louisa must depart with you my chaplain shall this minute unite you by ties that death alone can sunder alas my precious babes i little expected that your nuptials should be celebrated by tears and wailings but better these than no nuptials when you are once joined i shall care little for myself and if we meet no more here we may yet meet hereafter as happily as the barbarians who tear us asunder  the chaplain was then summoned and having performed his office no congratulations nor salutations ensued save a kiss and a sigh of mine on the hand of my angel the marquis then called me and drawing me down to him he pressed me ardently to his bosom cried o my harry o my harry burst into tears and dismissed me  mean while all was in bustle and hurry throughout the palace no festival was prepared no bridal bed laid horses arms and carriages were all the cry and the marchioness with an anguishing heart but amazing resolution issued her orders with a presence of mind that seemed serene in the midst of tempest  i then sent for my brave fellows with orders to double their arms and to double their ammunition they came accordingly it was now within three hours of day all was dispatched all in readiness the carriages were at the gate silence sat on every tongue and a tear on every cheek i threw myself at my mothers feet i clasped i clung to them she wept aloud over me but neither of us uttered a word when rending myself away i took my sobbing louisa under my arm seated her gently in her chariot placed myself to support her and away we drove  when we got clear of the town and were speeding on the way my louisa started and cried out o how fast how very fast they take me from you my mamma whither whither do they carry me perhaps never to return never to meet again i answered not but kissed her head and drew her gently to me and she seemed more at ease but after a while i felt her agitation at my bosom and she exclaimed from my birth to this hour of we my blessed mamma never was i from those dear arms of yours shall i ever shall i ever again behold those eyes that used to look with such fondness upon me  here i could no longer contain but taking her hands between mine and weeping upon them i said will you then my angel are you resolved upon breaking the heart of your harry o no says she no not for worlds upon worlds would i break that dear and feeling heart the heart of my heart the heart of which i became enamoured she then leaned her head fondly over and in awhile fell fast asleep while my arms gently encircled and my soul hovered over her as the wings of a turtle over her newbegotten  when she awoke and found herself so endearingly situated she gave me a look that overvalued the ransom of a monarch she kissed my hands in turns she kissed the skirts of my garments o she cried i will endeavor i will do my best to be more composed i know i ought not to repine i am too rich too happy i ought to wish for nothing more i ought to wish for no one more since my harry is so near me since i have him to myself  but  but  and here her lovely lips began again to work and the drops that trembled in her living brilliants could hardly be restrained from breaking prison  soon after the grief of her heart overweighed her spirits and she fell again asleep into my arms that opened of themselves to receive her  on setting up for the night i rejoiced to find that my louisa was something more alive and that her repose on the way had greatly deducted from the fatigue that i apprehended  when we had eaten a bit of supper she looked to me and from me with downcast lids and with changing looks and a faultring accent began to say will you will you permit me my love to be regent for a little time and in a very trifling matter allow me only to be governess for a few days and i promise that you shall be my supreme lord and sweet master all the rest of my life  i swear said i in a transport by that precious head that you are already queenregent of all my thoughts and actions and that during my existence you shall dispose of all that i have and all that i am at pleasure  o then said she my harry we must lie apart for some nights i would not have our chaste and blessed bridal stained by tears and dirges nay no hesitation you have sworn that i am ruler and i will be obeyed  i then cast myself at her knees and hiding my face in her lap cruel cruel louisa i cried i find you are not yet mine what shall i do to earn you but i will be patient if possible i would not for the world put the color of constraint on the love of my beloved and so i kissed her gown in token of due homage  arising i called her maids and desired that they would order their mistresss chamber to be prepared as also a bed for themselves in the same apartment i then secretly ordered that a pallet should be spread for myself before her outer door and laying myself down with my arms at my side i guarded like the dragon of old the precious fruit of my hesperia  at length we reached calais and immediately sent to the beach to engage a ship for wafting us over to the land of freedom and rights but the wind was contrary  mean while the day advanced toward evening and my louisa and i sat together in the arbor of a little pleasuregarden that lay behind the house when james came hastening to us and cried hide yourself madam for heavens sake hide yourself here is the duke de ne  rs with a large party of the kings light horse  poor louisa started up and attempted to fly but she trembled and grew faint and sunk down again on her seat  james said i stay and take care of your mistress then turning with hasty steps to the house i recommended my spirit in a short ejaculation and entered determined that the duke should accompany me in death his highness was in the parlour i advanced fiercely toward him so sir says he you have cost us a warm chase  heavens what do i see  and so crying out he threw himself back into an arm chair all panting and his aspect working with distraction and disappointment  cursed chance he again exclaimed are you the man clinton  ah i must not hurt you i ought not to injure you but what is then to be done  where have you put my louisa  but no matter let her not appear let me not see her i could not answer the consequence  i would be just if i could clinton  o love o honor how you do distract me  you refused my treasures and jewels clinton but then you have rent from me a gem more estimable than my dukedom  help saints help angels help me to wrestle with myself  honor virtue gratitude o compel me to be just  tear tear me away while there is strength to depart  adieu clinton you are recompensed should we happen to meet again i may assail you without reproach and so saying he rose suddenly and rushed out of the house  i then hastened to seek my love but had scarce entered the garden when i saw james on his knees before her endeavoring to oppose her way to the house but she cried away villain let me pass they are murdering my lord they are murdering my husband i will go and perish with him then breaking away from him she shot along like a lapwing till seeing me advancing she sprung upon my bosom crying o my harry o my harry are you safe are you safe and fainted away in my arms  the rest of my story my lord is no way material or entertaining the serene of heartfelt happiness has little of adventure in it and is only interesting to the possessors  having settled my affairs in london and carrying my eden along with me i passed into holland to settle and be quit of matters there also for the world that i wished was in my holding and all things else appeared either nugatory or encumbering  it was there that i met our meekly and taking a pleasant tour through the skirts of germany we entered france and leaving paris on the right hand we reached the marquiss country seat situate near twenty leagues beyond the metropolis  what a meeting what an interview my louisa sunk in tears for half an hour on the bosom of her mother and the marquis would put me from him and pull me to him again all panting with transport and insatiate of his caresses it was too much of joy it was pleasure to paining the domestics would no longer be estrained from their share of the felicity they rushed in and as though we had been ew descended divinities they dropped on their knees they fell prostrate and clung about us kissed our feet our hands our garments and broke forth into cries as though it had been the house of mourning and lamentation  on retiring they got my louisas gerard to themselves he now became a man of mighty importance among them they crowded about him and in a joint voice but a distraction of questions enquired after our travels our adventures our good and evil occurrences and all that concerned us  the marchioness then coming and casting her honored arms around me and weeping upon me cried aloud o harry my son my son i delivered my daughter to you even as edna committed her sarab of special trust to tobias and i see that you have entreated her very kindly my son my son  as my louisa now began to be apparently pregnant i earnestly pressed my precious mother and brother to accompany us to england the place where law was regent where there was no apprehension of inquisitions or bastiles and where the peasant was guarded as with a bulwark of adamant against every encroachment of arbitrary power they assented with joy and the marquis going to his escritoir brought forth bills to the amount of ten million of livres the produce of some concerns which he had disposed of for the purpose here my brother says he if i am not able to be grateful if i am not able to be generous i will at least be just here is the patrimony to which my lovely sister is entitled but i said to the marquis my louisa can admit of no accession of value keep your goods to yourself remember how esau said to jacob i have enough enough my brother these things can add nothing to the abundance of my blessings but then he cried you must accept them as a token of our loves and so he constrained and impelled them upon me  soon after we passed to london where we continued some months and where my louisa was delivered of my little eloisa who was said to be the beautiful likeness of her father  we then retired to my seat near stratford on the fatal avon the chief of the landed possessions that mr golding had bequeathed me where we remained something upward of five years happy i think above all that ever were happy upon earth for my louisa was perpetual festivity to our sight and to our hearts her eyes beamed with living and sentimental glory her attitudes were grace her movements were music and her smiles were fascination still varying yet exhibiting the same delight like the northern aurora she shone in all directions and she sported as though she had gone to heaven from time to time and borrowed all her plays from the kingdom of little children  but she needed not to go to heaven since heaven was ever in her and round about her and that she could no more move from it than she could move from herself she had been from her earliest years the beloved disciple of the celebrated madam guyon and the world with all its concerns its riches and respects had fallen off from her as the cloak fell away from the burning chariot of elijah she looked at nothing but her lord in all things she loved nothing but him in any thing she was the sweetest playfellow that ever lived for the babe of the manger of bethlehem and he was in her heart a pleasure passing sense as well as a peace that passed understanding even in conjugal endearment her manner refined and chastened the sense of possession and her pudicity awed me in the midst of transport  our friends now prevailed upon us to accompany them in our turn to france together with our prattling eloisa who was become the darling and inseparable companion of her grandmother and her uncle we again took london in our way i there renewed for a while my old acquaintance with my fellows in trade and they persuaded me to join them in a petition to his majesty for the restoration of some of the lapsed rights of their corporation as your lordship may remember  from calais we turned and by long but pleasant journeys at length arrived at the marquiss paternal seat in languedoc that opened a delightful prospect on the mediterranean and here we continued upward of five years more even as adam continued in paradise compassed in by bliss from the rest of the world  during this happy period i often pressed my dear marquis to marry but he would take me to his arms and say o my harry show me but the most distant resemblance of our louisa and i will marry and be blessed without delay  in the mean while my angel made me he joyful father of a little son who was also said to be the happier resemblance of his happy father then though i had long disregarded the world and all its concerns as i saw a family increasing upon me and also considered the poor as my appointed and special creditors i resolved once more to return and settle my long suspended accounts  as for the marchioness she protested that she could not think of parting with her little eloisa and that she should not be able to survive her absence ten days so my louisa and i and my little richard who was named after you my lord set out by sea and after a favorable voyage arrived in england comforted however with the promise that our friends would join us as soon as possible in britain  within the ten subsequent months we received the joyful tidings that our brother was married to the third daughter of the duke of alenson that they were all in the highest triumph and would speedily be with us in a joint jubilate on the banks of the avon  soon after as my louisa and i rode along the river pleasing ourselves with the prospect of a speedy union with persons so dear to us and talking and laughing away at the cares of the covetous and the ambition of the highminded a fowler inadvertently fired a shot behind us and my horse bounding aloft plunged with me into the current from whence however i was taken and unwillingly reserved to years of inexpressible misery of a misery that admitted not of a drop of consolation  mean while my love had fallen with a shriek from her horse and lay senseless on the sod some of my people flew back and bringing a carriage conveyed us gently home where my louisa was undressed and put into a bed from whence she never rose her fright had given such a shock to her blood and spirits as threw her into a violent fever  on the second day while i sat with the physicians by her side james put in his head and beckoned me forth ah my dearest master says he i pray god to give you the strength and patience of job you have great need of them for your calamities like his come all in a heap upon you here is a messenger dispatched from france with very heavy tidings that my sweet young lady your darling eloisa was cast away in a sloop upon a party of pleasure and that the good old marchioness did not outlive her five days then lifting my eyes to heaven strip strip me my god i cried to the skin to the bone leave leave but my louisa and i will bless thy dispensations  on the next day my little dickey was taken ill of a severe cold that he caught through want of due attention during the sickness of his mother as he was of a florid complexion his disorder fell suddenly in an inflammation on his lungs and in less than twentyfour hours he went to join his little brother and sisters in their eternity did i not feel these losses yes yes my friends they wrung they rent my vitals yet i still lifted my heart in an eager prayer and repeatedly cried take take all even the last mite leave leave me but my louisa and i will bless thee o my creator  alas what could this avail can an insect arrest the motion whereby the round universe continues its course on the fifth day i perceived that the eyes of my louisa the lamps of my life began to lose their luster the breath that was the balm of all my cares and concerns grew difficult and short the roses of my summer died away on her cheek all agonizing i felt and participated her changes and she expired while i dropped and lay senseless beside her  i knew not what our people did with her or me afterward for three weeks i lay in a kind of dosing but uneasy stupor neither do i recollect during that period when or whether i received any kind of sustenance  at length i awoke to the poignancy and bitterness of my situation i did not awake to life but rather to the blackest gloom of the regions of death and yet it was from this depth and enfolding of death alone that my soul could find or would accept an alleviation of its anguish  o earth i cried where is thy center how deeply am i sunk beneath it how are the worms exalted over me how much higher are the noxious reptiles that crawl upon earth i will not accuse thee thou great disposer i have had my day the sweetest that ever was allotted to man but o thy past blessings serve only to enhance my present miseries and to render me the most accursed of all thy creatures  i then rose and threw myself along the floor and my faithful and valiant companions immediately gathered to me but finding that i would not be removed they cast themselves around me  all light was shut out save the glimmering of a taper and for seven nights and seven days we dwelt in silence except the solemn interruptions of smothered sobs and wailings  at length my spirit reproved me what property said i to myself have these people in my sufferings or why should i burden those who love me with my afflictions i then constrained myself and went and took out a drawer here my friends i said here is something that may help hereafter to dry up your tears divide these thousands among ye neither these counters nor your services are now of further use fare ye well fare ye well my worthy and beloved brothers god will give you a more gracious master but  but  such another mistress ye never  never will find i then took each of them to my arms and kissed them in turns and the house was instantly filled with hearttearing lamentations  i now expected and wished to be left wholly alone but james and two domestics remained against my will i then endeavored to seem easy i even struggled to appear cheerful that i might communicate the less of grief to the voluntary sharers in my misery o world world i said to myself thou once pleasant world we have now bid a long an eternal adieu to each other from thee i am cut asunder thou art annihilated to me and we mutually reject every kind of future commerce  ah how much deeper was my death than that of those in the tomb where the wicked cease from troubling and where the weary are at rest while i was dead to every relish of light and of life i was wholly alive to all the gloom and horrors of the grave the rays of the sun became an offense to my soul the verdure of the fields the whole bloom of nature were blasted and blasting to my sight and i wished to sink yet deeper and to own a lower bottom to myself of darkness and distress  i no longer regarded what the world thought of me or what it did to me and i left my hairs and my nails even as those of nebuchadnezar to grow like eagles feathers and birds claws  my friend james in the mean time took a place for me in this town in order to remove me from scenes that could only serve to perpetuate or aggravate my misery by reminding me of the blessedness that i had once enjoyed  he was now become my controuler i was patient and passive to any thing to every thing and so he conducted me hither i neither knew nor cared how  in all this time though i panted after a state of insensibility even as a traveller in the burning desert thirsts after a cool and slaking stream i never attempted to lay a violating hand on the work of my creator i did not even wish an alleviation of my misery since my god had appointed that i should be so very miserable  at length my spirit rose from its blackness to a kind of calm twilight i called for a bible and since this world was incapable of a drop of consolation i wished to know if the next had any in store  as i read the whole of the letter and of the facts contained therein appeared as so many seals and veils that removed from before my eyes and discovered depths under depths and heavens above heavens to my amazed apprehension i had no vision no revelation of these matters but the conviction was impressed as strongly on my soul as though an angel or god himself had revealed them to me  how this came to pass i know not homer gives to his heroes a sight into futurity at the time that their spirits are breaking away from the shackles of flesh and blood and it is not unlikely that the eye of the soul when wholly turned from all carnal and earthly objects can penetrate with the greater scope and clarity into concerns that are merely celestial and divine  i have now told ye the whole of my dreary history my friends till i met with our harry and the rest our harry can tell  but harry was in no manner of vein at present for entertaining or receiving entertainment from any one his eyes were swelled with weeping his spirits totally depressed and getting up as with the burden of fourscore years on his shoulders he retired slowly and silently to his apartment  here mr meekly took the opportunity of our heros absence to apprise the company of what had passed respecting the fair aggy jessamin and why my dear meekly said the earl why would you baulk my boy i would rather than fifty thousand broad pieces get any offspring of my harry into my arms however little it might be legitimate or illegitimate he is a glorious fellow he cannot be debased by marrying a kitchen wench although his alliance would ennoble a princess what is your opinion brother indeed said mr clinton if the girl is virtuous as her countenance promises i have no objection  mr meekly instantly went with these indulgent tidings to harry but he shook his head and said no no my friend i will not abuse their goodness beside since i heard the story of my uncles louisa my passion is not quite so violent i have formed a perfect idea of the bride i would wish and if i get not some one answering to the image in my heart i will go unmarried to my tomb yet as i still ardently love the sweet girl i would not for the world risque the temptation of a meeting with her and i am willing to pay roundly for her removal be pleased then my dear friend to settle this matter with her father the stipulated sum shall be ready on demand to any amount that you please if they may serve to promote her happiness  on the next day mr meekly introduced to harry a tall and comely young man in a peasant dress but of an air and deportment much superior to his appearance my lord said meekly as he entered you must quit all further thoughts of the lovely miss jessamin i have here brought a prior claimant to whom i am confident the probity the generosity of your heart will give place  harry rose to receive him when the stranger looking earnestly and amazedly at him cried out ah no we must all give place here i find does she know him has aggy seen him i will then go and bury myself where my heart may break in despair of ever reclaiming her affections  no fear sir said harry reaching his hand give me but to know that you have entitled yourself to her regards and my own heart shall break in a thousand pieces rather than oppose or disturb the peace of two gentle lovers  i will give you our story my lord in a very few words mr jessamin and my father jessop served an apprenticeship to the same merchant and when that was expired they joined in trade to the levant but as my father was of the more adventurous temper they soon after broke partnership my father traded to turkey and the isles of the archipelago and mr jessamin confined himself to the italian coast  in one of his voyages to genoa he there married and begot the charming aggy and returning to london after a number of years he fitted out a ship of considerable force in order to convoy his wife and daughter with all his treasures to england  on their way home they were taken by a french privateer their ship and rich cargo were sent to toulon and mrs and miss jessamin with some other prisoners were taken on board the enemys vessel that proceeded on her cruise for further captures  i happened at the time to be on my return homeward in a ship called welcome enemies she had the appearance of a merchant but was actually better fitted for war than trade  the same privateer came up with us and bearing on us with confidence commanded us to strike but we answered them with an unexpected broadside and coming to close quarters we nearly cleared their deck by the discharge of our small arms soon after we grappled and boarded when hastening down to the cabin i there for the first time beheld my aggy in a fainting fit with her lovely head reclined on the lap of her mother  as i kneeled to give assistance toward her recovery she first opened the morning of her eyes upon me then turning them to her mother cried ah madam what new misfortune has been added to our misery i hope we have not fallen into the hands of the infidels no miss i said you are free you are free and you are freed by hands that offer themselves of their own accord to your shackles  when we came to port i divided the freight of our prize among the brave fellows who had seconded me so gallantly and having sold the vessel for three and twenty hundred pounds i compelled mrs jessamin to accept of it as some small compensation for the losses that her family had sustained  as soon as i had paid my duty to my father and that the warmth of his first caresses was over sir said i i have melancholy news to tell you i fear your old friend and partner mr jessamin is undone as to trade great part of his fortune has been seized by the french and that may prove a heavy loss to myself also he has but one daughter and might i prevail upon her to accept of my hand i should thereby become entitled to all her fathers possessions but sir i cried casting myself passionately at his feet if the happiness of your son is of any weight with you you will still assent to our union and thereby make me the most blessed of all human beings  everard said my father sedately you know i love you and i am willing to divide that love between your fancy and your fortune if jessamin lays down twenty thousand pounds in hand toward portioning your four sisters i will consent to your union and that is what i would not do with any other wench under double that sum  as i knew my fathers disposition to be as obstinate as it was affectionate i rose and retreated without reply i instantly went to mr jessamins i found my charmer alone i threw myself at her knees i solicited i urged her to an immediate marriage when blushing like the morning when it arises as ashamed of the brightness that it brings sir said she we owe you all things i never can refuse you any thing that virtue will allow me to grant ah how cold is that i cried i will not accept you as a debt my aggy if your heart is not a free will offering then let mine burst in sunder they can have no commerce together indeed says she giving her hand i never had an inclination for any other and i have in the world but the one objection to you what is that what is that  it is she cried with filling eyes that i fear to hurt you by a match so very much disproportioned to your merits  her parents entered and found me still at her feet i rose in much confusion and taking a seat i heartily told them what had passed between my father and me and urged the same petition to them that i had to their daughter when mr jessamin recollecting himself gave me an answer deserving of everlasting memorial  mr jessop says he had i a province to bestow along with my child you should have it as freely as i would give of my watercistern to a thirsty traveller but here it happens that the inestimable obligations which you have heaped upon my family are quite averse to the promotion of your present desires  in the first place as a man of probity if i wish one day to merit the happiness of your alliance i cannot consent to be a party in any clandestine matter again shall a heart full and bursting with gratitude be a partaker in bringing either damage or disgrace on the only one whom i account my benefactor and patron lastly shall a father who estimates the honor of his child as a pearl above the worlds purchase shall he subject her tender perhaps her melting gratitude to the temptation of yielding further than she ought or even to the temptation of binding her virtuous affections beyond the power of a retreat this would be too severe a tribute even for all that you have done for us do not exact it my son my heart wrings under the necessity of rejecting your suit you cannot be pained as i am by this refusal but it is inevitable you and my daughter must meet no more till these clouds are overpassed and that a new light of happier influence begins to dawn upon us  i answered not i wept where i sat for half an hour i was not unaccompanied and i then withdrew  but my lord i begin to grow tedious in spite of my intentions i returned to my father and requested him in order as i said to get rid of my present passion that he would dispatch me abroad upon another voyage  i had given him a very lucrative account of my last and that made him the less inquisitive respecting the prize we had taken  he assented with joy as he feared that my love might yet contend and prevail in the combat against duty and he took upon himself the care of equipping out my ship in a more gallant plight than ever  the day before i went on board i stepped to mr jessamins my aggy did not appear and i found her parents employed in preparing for a disconsolate retreat to the country i told them i came to take my leave and asked if they would send any venture by me the very worthy man then went to his desk and taking out the bills of the sale of the privateer here my everard says he i have nothing to adventure with you save your own free gift the remainder of the wreck of my fortune is little enough to supply us with very frugal accommodations in our desired exclusion from the world and its ways and here is a little note of the place of our retreat if ever my child if ever  if ever we shall happen to meet on this side of eternity o i cried kissing the bills if i do not bring you a good account of these ventures never indeed shall we meet till parting shall be no more  we then set about taking leave and having several times rushed alternately into the arms of each other we again sat down and wept till no tears were left when rending myself away from them and nearly blind to the way that i went i departed  within a year and a half i returned and in a storm put in at plymouth but notwithstanding the intrepidity and great affection of my companions though i had made death and success as matters equally indifferent and on one of which i was determined yet our high hopes and enterprizings had failed us on several occasions and i am come back with little more than ten thousand pounds for mr jessamin over the produce of the voyage which my father may exact from me  wherefore with post horses and a beating heart i have crossed the country in disguise impatient yet fearful to know how the heart of the nobly inexorable jessamin may be affected toward me and this morning as i skulked about the house this gentleman met me and having questioned me brought me directly to your lordship  here harry covered his eyes with his hand and musing for a time at length said i fear my friends it may be difficult to bring this matter about with propriety i would not willingly affront mr jessop here by a gift of the sum that is deficient to his happiness neither indeed would it be duly delicate in mr jessop to offer to his fatherinlaw a penny beyond what his venture so well supported by mr jessops bravery had acquired you therefore my dear mr meekly shall be the conduit of the expedient that i propose on the occasion i question if the war was proclaimed when jessamins ship was made prize but be that matter as it may i trust i have interest sufficient to procure a restoration the first treaty of peace do you therefore my friend get me an order from jessamin for l 0000 on the first of his effects in france with legal interest however and then take this key and deliver to our friends the very utmost of the sum required by the father of the darling fellow who is now before me  meekly then sprung up advanced in years as he was and catching and clinging about harry o my hero my scipio he cried you are the champion whom heaven delights to empower to subdue itself by violence go on till the wreath of triumph shall be bound to your head in all its prepared glories  mean while young jessop lay prostrate in the oppression and agony of gratitude at the feet of his younger patron but harry gently and affectionatly disengaging himself from them withdrew to his closet saying to his own heart now aggy adieu adieu aggy for ever  for three succeeding sundays our hero heard the bands of marriage published between everard jessop and agnes jessamin all which he bore with the firmness of a stoic or rather with the resignation of a christian who keeps a look forward to a more pearly hope  perhaps some may be curious to know how aggy stood affected in regard to our young lord let it suffice to be told that she made the worthiest of wives to the very worthy everard notwithstanding that he had the imprudence to tell her of harrys regard for her as also of the obligations by which he had bound them aggy therefore could not justly refuse harry a share in her friendship and there is something extremely tender in the friendship of a generous female  be that as it may in about three weeks after her marriage as she walked with two fair visitants in a pleasant field behind the town she saw our hero coming toward her attended by two servants and galantly mounted on a proud young steed whom he had undertaken to dress and was now gracefully riding to the manage  she felt a sudden alarm she knew not why and as harry approached she turned away that he might not recognize her but as soon as he had passed she gave one look after him and feeling herself discomposed by a little hysterical fit she sat down on the grass between her companions and wept till she was restored to her strength and spirits  in a few days after she set out for london where she became the daily idol of her fatherinlaw and saw our harry no more  on an evening after coffee as the earl stood fondly fooling with his harry as one child with another he turned to mr clinton and said how came it to pass my brother that jesus suffered near four thousand years to elapse before he became incarnate for the salvation of the world although it was by him alone that the world could be saved  we may as well demand of god said mr clinton why he suffered near four days of creation to lapse before he compacted yon glorious body of far beaming light for this matter was barely a type and the sun himself but a shadow of the christ that was to come but did the world want light before light became incorporated in its illustrious circumscription no my lord jesus who was from eternity the illumination of the dark immensity of nature jesus who alone is the living light of spirit soul and sentiment the perpetual fountain of the streams of beauty and truth he said let there be light and instantly through the darkness of a ruined world the internity of his ever living light kindled up an externity of corporeal irradiation that has its effluence from him and cannot beam but by him  now as a day is as a thousand years and a thousand years as a day in the sight of god you see that the fourth day of creation wherein the light of this outward world was compacted into the glorious body of the sun precisely answers to the four thousandth year wherein jesus the light of eternity was to become embodied and incarnate in christ the sun of righteousness  but as the world wanted not light before the sun opened his first morning in the east neither did it want the means of salvation before the blessed doctrine of messiah was promulged upon earth  all sorts of sectarians all persons of selfish and little minds would make a monopoly of the savior they would shut him up into a conventicle and say to their god thus far shall thou go and no further but he is not so to be confined the spirit of our jesus blows wide and where he lists and he is at once both the purifier and redeemer as well of all nations as also of all nature  accordingly we see that the turks who are wholly unblessed by true religion or liberty who live the slaves of slaves without a form of civil government temporally subjected to the will of a tyrant and spiritually to the worship of a sensual impostor yet want not the feelings of our jesus in their heart  even the wild indians who never listened to the toll of a bell nor ever were called into any court of civil judicature these want not their attachments their friendships their familyfeelings nor the sweet compunctions and emotions of the human heart by jesus forming to divine  the truth is that people live incomparably more by impulse and inclination than by reason and precept reason and precept are not always within our beck to have their due influence they require frequent inculcation and frequent recollection but impulse and inclination are more than at hand they are within us and from the citadel rule the outworks of man at pleasure  when the apostle speaking of christ affirms that there is no other name under heaven whereby a man may be saved and again when he affirms that those who have not received the law are a law unto themselves he intends one and the same thing he intends that christ from the fall of man is a principle of redemption in the bosoms of all living that he is not an outward but an inward redeemer working out our salvation by the change of our depraved nature that in and from him alone arise all the sentiments and sensibilities that warm the heart with love that expand it with honor that wring it with compunction or that heave it with the story of distant distress and that he alone can be qualified to be judge at the last day who from the first day to the last was internally a cooperator and witness of all that ever passed within the bosoms of all men  hence it is that although the christian countries have received the two tables of the laws of christ his external as well as internal revelation each witnessing to the other that the god of our gospel is the god of our nature the nations however who are strangers to his name yet acknowledge his influence they do not indeed hear but they feel the precepts of that light which lights every man who comes into the world  my dearest brother said the earl my conceptions are quite clear with respect to the omnipresence of christs divinity but as his body is circumscribed by external features and lineaments i can form no notion of its being in several places at once how then will it be i pray you at and after the last day will he be present to and approachable only by a select number of his saints or will he go certain journeys and circuits through the heavens blessing all in rotation with his beatific presence  is not the body of yonder sun circumscribed my lord most certainly  it is now said mr clinton at a distance of many millions of leagues from you and yet you see it as evidently and feel its influence as powerfully as if it were within your reach nay it is more than within your reach it is within your existence it supplies comfort and life to your animal body and life and you could not survive an hour without its influence and operations  now this is no other than the apt type and prefiguring promise of what christ will be to his newbegotten in the resurrection when corruption shall be swallowed up of glory and mortal of immortality the same blessed body which for the redemption of commiserated sinners went through the shameful and bloody process of scourges thorns spittings and buffettings which hung six agonizing hours on the cross which descended into the grave and thence opened the way through death into life and through time into eternity even this body shall then shine forth in ineffable beauty and beatitude in effentially communicative grace and glory through the height and through the depth through the length and through the breadth beaming wide beyond the universe from infinity to infinity  father son and holy spirit will then become coembodied in this divine body they will be the repletion of it they will operate all things by it to bring the creator nearer to his creatures the invisible godhead will then become visible the infinite circumscribed the unapproachable accessable and the incomprehensible comprehended within the humanity of our christ  then will his cross be exalted for an ensign to the circling bending and worshipping universe his wreath of thorns will kindle all nature with the dartings and castings forth of its corruscations and his reed of mockery will become the scepter of unlimited domination  from his five wounds shall be poured forth incessant floods of glory and wide diffusing blessedness upon all his redeemed adoring worlds in selfabjection shall strive to sink beneath the abjection that became their salvation these ever apparent ensigns of so dearly purchased benefits shall inevitably attract the wills of all creatures they shall cause all hearts and affections to rush and cleave to him as steel dust rushes to adamant and as spokes stick in the nave whereon they are centred there shall be no lapse thenceforward forward no falling away for ever but god in his christ and christ in his redeemed shall be a will and a wisdom and an action and a mightiness and a goodness and a graciousness and a glory rising on glory and a blessing rising on blessedness through an ever beginning to a never ending eternity  o brother brother brother exclaimed the earl i am enraptured i am entranced  i see it all i feel it all i am already with all my corruptions with all my transgressions desirous of being crushed to nothing under the foot of my redeemer but he comforts instead of crushing me o that i were this night this very moment to be dissolved and to be with my christ  that night the earl was quite happy and pleasant and affectionate even beyond his custom he said and did every thing that could be endearing to his harry and to his friends he caressed them at parting for bed he smilingly shook hands with all the domestics that approached him and in the morning was found dead without any notice or warning to the servants who attended and lay in the room  a sudden and grievous alarm was instantly given through the family and quickly reached the town and spread through the adjacent country  harry fell upon his fathers face and wept upon him and kissed him and wept aloud and kissed him again crying my father o my father  and they laid his remains in a plated coffin under escutcheons and a sable canopy of velvet and the house and the court was circled with mourners from all parts and they mourned for him fifty and nine days and on the sixtieth day he was deposited in his family tomb but mr clinton would not permit harry to attend the funeral of his father  our hero was now the master of millions approaching to the prime of youth glowing with health action and vigor of beauty incomparable beloved of all who knew him and the attraction and admiration of every eye where he passed yet all these advantages with all his higher accomplishments became as matters of no value they sunk and sickened to his sense while he felt a void in his bosom eager after he knew not what sighing he knew not why keen and craving in his desires yet pining and languid in the want of possession  what is the matter my love said mr clinton my dear brother died in a good old age such things should be expected we know that they must be and we ought not to grieve as persons who are without hope  true sir said harry and yet it is a very melancholy thing for a poor man to reflect how very rich he was a very little while ago i lately had a dear brother a dear mother and the dearest of fathers but where are they all now i look round the world and see nothing but yourself therein and  should you too  should you too  here harry could no more his uncle also broke into tears at the thoughts of parting with his darling harry though it were to join his louisa  my harry says he at last we have yet two precious treasures left upon earth if we did but know where to find them it is your cousin the countess of maitland and the brother of my louisa the marquis daubigny let us go in search of them my son next to my louisa they are the loveliest of all living they abound in all human and divine affections and will caress us with kindred and corresponding hearts  soon after they set out for france and by a roundabout tour of short but pleasant journeys arrived at paris where mr clinton ordered his large retinue to his ancient inn and taking only two footmen he and harry went in their postchaise to the marquiss palace  on the ringing of the bell and the opening of the gate a single domestic came forth mr clinton perceived that all was dark in the hall and this instantly gave an alarm to his ever ready feelings  he alighted however and stepping with his harry up the flight of marble where is your master says he where is my brother the marquis heaven bless us cried the fellow are you my masters brother i have heard a deal of and about your lordship though i never was so happy as to see your face before ho he continued and rung another bell come all of you attend the brother of your lord attend the present master and lord of your household  immediately the palace was in commotion the parlour and hall were lighted up and all seemed to have acquired a set of wings to their motions  mr clinton looked with eagerness at each of the domestics endeavoring to recollect the features of some old acquaintance but all the faces were strange to him pray tell me my friends says he where is your master where and how are he and his lady are they still in good health has he had any children by her  please your honor said an elderly man my masters first lady died of childbirth and her infant perished with her but he is since married to one of the loveliest women in the world he is gone a year since on an embassy into africa his lady would not be left behind we lately heard from them they are both in health and we expect that less than a month will bring them safe to us indeed the sum of our prayers is for their happy and speedy return  what said mr clinton are there none of my old friends not one of our ancient domestics to the fore  please your lordship jacome the white headed steward is still left but though in good health he is very little more than half alive  pray go and tell him that an old friend of his is here and would be very glad to see him but dont do things suddenly and be very tender and careful in bringing him to me  old jacome was wheeled in wrinkled pale and paralytic and all enfeebled as he sat reclining in an easy chair he seemed to recover life and new spirits as they brought him forward bring me to him bring me to him my eyes are wondrous dim bring me closer that i may know if it is my very master indeed bring me but once to know that it is his sweet pardoning face and then let me die with all my sins upon me i care not  mr clinton then took him very lovingly by the hand my good friend jacome says he we are both growing old i find i rejoice however to see you once more upon earth o cried the old man a well known and a sweet tuned voice is that voice it is you then it is you yourself my master alas for all your losses since last we parted i have got a salt rheum in my eyes of late and i never thought of you but it began to come down  here jacome sobbing aloud provoked the joint tears of his attending fellow servants though they had never been partakers in the foregone calamities farther than by the ear whence they were now recollected and carried home to their hearts  my lord says jacome at last i am not the only one that remains of your old servants your gerard too who blessings on his hands once tied me neck and heels gerard too is forthcoming and near at hand your honors wonderful bounty made a gentlemen of him at once and he is now in a high way with a wife and three children a hundred and a hundred times have we washed your remembrance with our tears and indeed i think your honor ought not to send for him lest he should suddenly die or run distracted at your sight  in the mean time one of the lacqueys had officiously gone and informed gerard of the arrival of his patron he came panting and rushed forward as it were to cast himself at the feet of his lord but stopping suddenly and drawing back some steps he nailed his eyes as it were on the face of mr clinton and spreading his hands cried  you live then my lord you still live my dearest master you survive all your deaths and sufferings and the weight of ten mountains has not been able to crush you  o the times the times my master never more to return  will there be such times in heaven think you  will there be such angels there as we once lived with upon earth  here he clapped his hands together and set up such a shout of bitter lamentation as was enough to split the heart of every hearer and in a manner to split the graves of the persons whom he deplored  as soon as mr clinton and his two old friends had parted for the night tell me my dear sir said harry are there different kinds of grief or is it merely that grief affects us in different manners  when i wept for my dear father my mother and brother my affliction was anguishing and altogether bitter without any species of alleviating sensation to compensate my misery but it was far otherwise with me to night when i grieved in the grief of your old and faithful domestics i felt my heart breaking but i was pleased that it should break i felt that it was my happiness so to grieve and i could wish a return of the same sweet sensations  the reason is this my love when you lamented your parents you lamented yourself in your private and personal losses your affliction was just it was natural it was laudable but still it was confined it participated but little of the emotion that is excited by the affliction of others and the anguish was the keener by being nearly limited to your own bosom and your own concerns  but in the griefs of my old and loving servants this night you became wholly expanded you went beyond you went out of yourself you felt without reflection how delightful it is to go forth with your god in his social generous noble and divine sensibilities and you delightfully felt my harry that such a house of mourning is more joyous to your soul than all the festivals that flesh and sense can open before you  and now my child i will finally and once for all lay open the very horrible and detestable nature of self in your soul  self appears to us as the whole of our existence as the sum total of all in which we are interested or concerned it is as a narcissus selfdelighted selfenamoured it desires it craves and claims as its right the loves attachments and respects of all mankind but does it acquire them my harry o never never self never was beloved never will be beloved never was honorable or respectable in the eye of any creature and the characters of the patriot the hero the friend and the lover are only so far amiable so far revereable as they are supposed to have gone forth from the confines of self  as mr clinton proposed to wait the return of the marquis he employed the mean season in endeavors to amuse his darling and to dispel the cloud of melancholy that continued to hang over him  for this purpose he went with him to versailles and to the many other elegant environs of paris he also showed him the thuilleries and other public walks where our hero became oppressed by his involuntary attraction of all eyes upon him  one night happening to go to the play without the company of his guardian as he came forth with the crowd a carriage was opened for him which he took to be his own and in he stepped and away he was taken  in the mean time mr clinton waited supper for him and began to grow uneasy when the clock struck twelve at last his carriage and servants returned with tidings that they staid for him above an hour at the theater after the play was over and had ever since been in search of him to no purpose  though mr clinton was by nature of an intrepid spirit and was still more assured by his reliance on providence he yet found himself agitated in a very alarming manner he therefore retired to his closet and there on his knees fervently commended his harry to the protection of his god  at length the clock struck three soon after the bell was heard from the hall and harry entering with a page in a rich livery flew like lightening up stairs and cast himself into the bosom of his patron  my father my father he cried i have been in sad pannics for you i knew the love that you bore to your good for nothing harry but indeed i could not help it i could not get to you till this instant i have been a prisoner sir and here is my dear deliverer  as soon as they were something composed and all seated harry proceeded to satisfy the impatience of his uncle  as i came out of the theater ruminating on a passage in one of racines tragedies i found a chariot in the spot where i had left my own and stepping heedlesly into it i was soon set down and hastening through the great hall flew up stairs to salute you but think how i was surprised when i suddenly found myself in the most sumptuous chamber perhaps in the universe it was wainscotted with mirrors of the most perfect polish whose plates were artfully buttoned and buckled together by diamonds and other gems of a most dazzling luster  all astonished i recoiled and was going to withdraw when i was met by a lady who followed and accosted me have you commands sir says she for any one in this house  a thousand pardons madam i perceive my error i really thought i was set down at my own lodgings  no great offense sir but now that i look at you again i think you ought to pay the forfeit of your intrusion by giving me one hour of your company at least  you must excuse me madam my guardian would be under the most terrifying alarms for me  a fig for guardians she cried you are now my prisoner and nothing less than my friend lewis with his army at his back shall be able to take you out of my hands  so saying she rung a bell and immediately a folding door of pannelled lookingglass flew open and showed us to another apartment where a supper composed of all the elegancies of the season was served up as by magic and lay fuming on the table  she then took me by the hand and having graciously seated me placed herself opposite a number of servants then vanished on the instant leaving a dumb waiter of silver behind them  sir said she we are not to have any further company you alone were expected you alone are desired all others are forbidden in short i have seen you often at the public walks and theaters you did more than strike my fancy you laid hold on my heart i enquired every thing about you i know your rank title and fortune i made use of this nights stratagem to decoy you to me and though there are few women in europe of equal opulence or dignity i think i cannot much demean myself by an alliance with a sweet fellow whom i so ardently love but come our supper cools  i gazed at her with admiration she was indeed the most finished beauty i ever beheld and i was inwardly flattered and in a manner attached to her by her partiality in my favor  after supper and some futile and insignificant chat she drew her chair nearer to me what say you my lord says she fondly am i to live or to perish  ah madam i cried love is as a little bird if you cage it it will beat itself to pieces against its prison not that i regard your late threats of confinement my own arm is at all times sufficient to deliver me from your thraldom but in truth i am partly become a willing prisoner to you and time may possibly reconcile me to your different customs  what customs i pray you why madam the ladies in my country use no paint except the rouge of natures blush and the paleness of chastity love also in england is a kind of warfare between the sexes just such as once happened between the parthians and old rome our ladies conquer by flying and our men are vanquished while they pursue  persons sir of a certain rank said she are dispensed with from conforming to little matters of decorum however if you will endeavor to adopt the manners of my country i will do my best on my part to conform to those of yours  so saying she looked languishingly at me and drew her chair quite close when by an involuntary motion i put mine further back dont be alarmed my lord says she women of my condition know always where to stop right madam said i but possibly you might not be quite so successful in teaching me where to be stopped  cold constitutioned boy she cried indignantly rising and coloring your bed lies yonder you may go to it if you like and ruminate till morning on the danger of slighting and insulting a princess so saying she swept haughtily out of the room and locked me in  during an hour after she had withdrawn while i walked about considering what i had to apprehend from the threats of this extraordinary woman i heard a great bustling in and about the falace but within another hour all was quiet and still again  i then conceived thoughts of attempting my escape but again i held it beneath me to be caught in the manner and so i resolved to wait till morning and then to force my passage through her guards in open day  in the mean time i imagined that a panel in the wainscot stirred and soon after it was removed and my young friend here entered my chamber on tiptoe he beckoned me to silence and taking me by the hand he led me through the way by which he came  we then descended a narrow pair of back stairs and groping along a dark entry he cautiously unbolted a door that opened into a garden and hurrying with me across he unlocked another door that opened to the street and out we got rejoicing  soon after we met a party of the guards who were patroling the streets and putting a few pieces into their hand i requested their safe convoy and they conducted us home  my lords said perre for that was the pages name it would be extremely dangerous for ye to remain another day or even till morning in paris the princess is the most intimate friend of madame maintenon and through her can do what she pleases with the king during my residence with her she grew tired of two handsome lovers in succession but they told no tales and no one can yet tell what became of them  mr clinton was quite of perres opinion he instantly sent for his people all was hurry pack and dispatch and toward dawning they set out on a road that led to the cantons but changing their course again for several successive mornings they arrived at calais by a long tour of near five weeks travel  mr clinton set up at his old inn and after dinner the host entered to pay his compliments have you any news landlord nothing at present my lord all is quiet again but here has been a fearful bustle about three weeks ago the kings army came down in pursuit of young englishman who ran away with a lady of quality from paris for my share continued he looking earnestly at harry i fear that you pretty english lads will hardly leave us a lovely wench in the nation harry looked quite secure being wholly innocent of any present design on the sex but poor little perre turned as pale as the table cloth  i remember continued our talkative host that just such another affair happened when i was a boy and servant in this house here came a young englishman just such another sweet fellow as this before me and he brought with him an angel of a creature the like of whom my eyes never did nor ever shall open upon till they close in death after him came one of our great dukes with a party of the kings army and terrible things were expected but they made it up in a manner i know not how and my lord anglois carried off his prize in triumph mr clinton stooped his head and dropped a silent tear but held no further converse with our landlord on the subject  that evening a gale sprung up and going on board they were safe anchored before morning in the bay of dover  they then mutually embraced and harry catching his beloved deliverer to his bosom we are now upon english ground says he welcome to my arms my dear perre no longer my page or servant but my friend and my brother you cannot conceive what pain your officiousness has hitherto cost me but there must be no more of this you shall hereafter be served and attended as i am nay i myself will gladly serve you to the utmost of my power and the extent of my fortune  ah my lord cried the lovely perre gently falling at the feet of his master if you deprive me of the pleasure of serving you you deprive me of all the pleasure that the world can afford me if you knew the delight i find in being always about you in watching your thoughts and motions in looking into your fine eyes and there reading your desires before they rise to expression you could not find in your heart to deprive me of such a blessing well then said harry raising him fondly in his arms our future contest shall be which of us shall serve the other with most affection and sedulity  after dinner the evening being calm and shiny harry took his perre with him along the shore that stretches under the stupendous cliffs of dover they had not walked far when getting out of the sight of people within the winding of a creek a man advanced toward them and taking out a pistol called to harry and ordered him to throw down his purse our hero did not regard his purse but thinking it an indignity to be robbed by one man he put his hand to his sword hereupon the villain cocked and levelled his pistol and the faithful perre observing that he was going to fire instantly jumped in between her master and danger and received the ball into her own lovely bosom  harry saw his darling drop and flying all enraged at the robber he ran him thrice through the body and pinned him to the ground then flying as swiftly back he threw himself by the side of his dying perre and gently raising her languishing head placed it fondly on his bosom  you are wounded my friend dangerously wounded i fear says harry yes my lord i am wounded just as i could wish and i would not exchange my preent blessed death for the longest and happiest life that the world could bestow  but it is time to undeceive and eveal a secret to you which nothing but death should ever have extorted from me  i am not what i seem my most beloved master  i am a foolish and fond girl who at the first glance conceived a passion for you  my name is maria de lausanne  i am niece to that bad woman whom you justly rejected  but what did i propose by this disguise first your deliverance my lord and that i effected  but did i further aspire to the honor of your hand far from it far from it  i felt my own unworthiness i did not think you could be mated by any thing less than an angel  but then to see you to hear you to serve to touch to be near you to fix my eyes on you unheeded and if possible to win your attention by the little offices of my fondness this was my happiness the whole of the heaven that i proposed upon earth  i have had it i have enjoyed it  and i ought to die content  but alas to part from you there is the pang of pangs  o if this day merits any thing by the offer of my own life for the preservation of my beloved  then cause my chaste clay to be kindly deposited in the tomb of your ancestors  that  when time shall come  my dust may be neigh boured  to your precious dust  and there sleep in peace  beside you  till we spring  together  from corruption  into glory and immortality  during these short sentences and difficult respirations harry could answer nothing  he was suffocated by his grief  but putting his speechless lips to the fading lips of his maria he drew her latest breath into his own affectionate bosom and angels instantly caught her spirit into the regions of purity of love and of faith unfailing  harry then plucking up strength from oppression and courage from despair pressed his lips to the pale and unfeeling lips of his true lover and cried yes my maria our dust shall be joined and i feel that our spirits too shall shortly be wedded  then raising her in his arms and pressing her to his bosom he bore her to the town while he poured upon her all the way the two fountains of his affection  when he got to the inn and came to is uncle here sir said he i present you with a very precious little burden a burden that lies much heavier on my heart than  did in my arms he then related to mr clinton the whole of what had passed then heavily sighing and shedding a tear mr clinton cried ah my harry i would to heaven that your maria had lived she exceeds your aggy jessamin all to nothing  harry ordered a carriage on purpose for himself and his beloved she was deposited in a coffin hurried up for the occasion and notwithstanding all the remonstrances and entreaties of his parent harry proved a rebel for the first time and would not be divided from his maria till they reached london  there our hero ordered a coffin of unallayed and beaten silver to be prepared for her reception and though near five days had passed since the departure of her spirit her chaste flesh remained as pure and untainted as that of a lamb newly slain  while they were putting her into her solemn repository ah sir said harry i pretend not to compare with you your losses i own have been greater than mine you are a man like your divine master wholly made up of sorrows and acquainted with killing griefs but still you must allow that for my little time i have had a competent share it matter not i am reconciled to them i begin to be pleased with them and indeed joy is become my utter aversion while i think on this loved creature who willingly bled and died for my sake  as harry thought it his duty so he thought it would be his delight to weep and lament his maria for ever but passions seldom are permanent and time though it may not wholly efface daily wears away an insensible portion of the deepest impressions  harry caused the coffin of his deliverer to be exalted on a cabinet in his bedchamber that it might be always in his sight but the familiarity of affecting objects daily lessens their force and harry week after week began to contemplate the repository of the loved remains of his maria with abating affliction  in the mean time mr clinton received a letter by the french mail in answer to one which he had left for his brotherinlaw at paris and this letter informed him under the marquiss hand that he had returned from his ambassy to the court of morocco and that he and his lady would be shortly in england and at the bottom he found written in a different character will it be any satisfaction to see them accompanied by your once loved  fanny goodall  we have found them my harry he cried we have found them our long and far sought friends the two treasures which our god had graciously laid in store for the comfort of us poor people who lost all beside but dont let us do them the disgrace my son of meeting and receiving them with tears and dirges let me then prevail upon you to permit your faithful perre to be conducted by some of our people with an honorable train of undertakers to enfield and there to be treasured up in your family vault where i shall speedily join her and whereto even my harry must finally adjourn  harry wiped his eye and said be it as you please my father  within the following fortnight as our hero stood with a single attendant in cheapside overagainst the devil tavern where the club called legion club was kept he was accosted by a glittering appearance who took him by the hand and said how are you master fenton  well sir i thank you lord bottom i presume  the same sir  and pray how are the worthy lord and lady mansfield as also your lovely sister the lady louisa  passable sir but what makes you in black i hope mr fenton is still in the land of the living  he is my lord but black is a cheap kind of wear it is a matter of frugality to kill a cousin once in a twelvemonth  well be that as it may i insist on your stepping over the way to take one glass with me  your lordship must excuse me i am going to the wharf to enquire concerning some friends whom i expect from france o i protest master fenton you shall not disappoint me i insist on renewing our old acquaintance  harry could hardly have found it in his heart to refuse the request of an avowed enemy much less could he think of rejecting an invitation that was made under a warm appearance of friendship  when lord bottom had seated his old enemy as he still supposed him to be in the midst of fourteen or fifteen bloods and bucks harry would gladly have retreated but rejected the thought lest they should think that he was intimidated  gentlemen cried lord bottom give me leave to introduce a phenomenon to you my friend yonder is a christian a christian cried one a christian cried another ay said lord bottom a christian of the right cast he literally conforms to the example of his master if you smite him on the one cheek he will turn the other to you and you cannot delight him more than by kickings spittings and spurnings  pray sir said one of the company are you actually a christian i hope so sir said harry and may i spit in your face sir said another without fear of chastisement you may sir said harry  i told ye so gentlemen i told ye so exclaimed lord bottom i have myself put the christianity of my friend there to the proof i have made him the but and the jest of all companies i have dubbed him with the title of fool i have pasted it on his back in capitals in the midst of the levee and in the presence of his majesty and yet he never showed the least instance of his being offended for example now and so saying he spit directly in harrys face  another then and then another and so on in a numerous succession spit full at our hero while he without the smallest apparent emotion barely took out his handkerchief and wiped the moisture from his face  at rength a lustylooking young man arore damn the rascal said he i will not demean myself by spitting at him i will piss upon the rascal which he accordingly prepared to do but harry perceiving his approach turned mildly and said i do not recollect sir that this was any of the indignities to which my lord and master submitted then without rising from his seat he gave him a knuckle in the temple which laid him asleep on the floor  sbl  d cried one of the company i fear jemmy bottom you have brought us into the wrong box you have certainly mistaken your man  he has indeed said harry calmly he calls me fenton but my name is not fenton my name is henry earl of moreland and you shall every man lie these twelve months in newgate for this days breach of privilege against a peer of the realm here is my star gentlemen i can put my riband on at pleasure  the whole legion were instantly struck with mute terror and astonishment they lifted up their hands or sunk to their knees in petitioning postures but harry said with a firm and alarming accent i desire your reformation gentlemen and i will endeavor to complete it i have hitherto only shown you the first part of christianity in the example of meek and lowly sufferance the second part remains it is to teach you abject wretches to suffer in your turn however i am not of a very vindictive nature and if all of you will be upon honor to give me your hands i will pardon what is past and dismiss you in succession  lord bottom and his friend rakely were the first who advanced lowly bowing to claim the proposed terms of peace when harry seizing bottoms hand with a strong and agile gripe crushed the bones and the grisles as it were into one mass and bottom giving a huge scream dropped roaring on the floor rakely then would have recoiled but harry catching at him sent him to join his brother in iniquity and affliction on the boards  well gentlemen said harry what keeps you in your seats why do ye not come and give me the honor of your hands as was agreed if you do not do it directly i will take each of you very quietly by the nose and kick you through the crowd of attendants down stairs  my lord cried one of the company i will not give you my hand neither shall any man living take me by the nose so saying he sprung up and catching at his sword which lay with others on a table he hastily drew it and stood on his defense  o fie sir said harry without moving from his seat you dont put yourself in a posture any man who was not a very good natured man might take you at an advantage and run you under the open that you give to your right flank but sir said harry rising i will only caution you by a little puncture in the sword arm i dont mean you much hurt and so saying he passed his sword through the flesh of his adversarys right arm and taking him to the door he wished him a good evening and turned him down stairs to seek for a surgeon  he then returned to the company and taking each of the intimidated wretches in succession by the nose he led them out and footed them down stairs through the midst of their own servants the waiters etc crying a kicking to all the infamous and scoundrel sons of belial who dare to spit at christianity  then calling two of the drawers here is something for yourselves my lads says he and here i leave you yonder swords and these two very fine gentlemen in pawn for your reckoning so saying he walked quite composedly away through the midst of two long ranges of bowing admirers who lined the stairs and the entry and thus harry dissolved the legion club  the next morning early before mr clinton was up while harry sat sipping a dish of tea dressed in a dark gray frock his hair slightly bound up after the footman fashion and his long staff of quarter cleft oak without knot or flaw standing polished beside him mr frank introduced a young man whom he recommended to his lordships service  harry measured him with a glance from top to toe and was instantly struck by the visible action power and energy of his proportions  sit down frank says harry while your friend and i treat what is your name my lad john sutton so please you and what wages do you desire from one pound to one hundred yearly  a great difference indeed john  why please your honor if i may not happen to like you i shall march without asking a single penny but if i should have the misfortune to love you as your countenance threatens i shall certainly deserve the whole of my demand by all that i shall do and dare to do in your service  can you wrestle jack  whenever your honor shall get a man through the shires of england who is able to fling me i will serve you the remainder of my life for nothing can you cudgel jack  i was born a fencer so please your lordship my father was a famous prizefighter and my mother could beat my father himself at the quarter staff  did you ever read the history of robin hood jack  i did sir  then you may remember that honest robin never took an abettor into pay save such a one as was able to cope with himself frank here shall sit and see fair play  harry then rose and taking two sticks gave one of them to his opponent then putting a brass helmet upon jacks head there is something said he to save you from hurt and now come at the thickness of my skull as fast as you can  to it they strait fell with equal confidence of ability but harry perceiving that jack intended to spare him cried come jack the best the very best that you can do or not a penny a single penny of wages i assure you  jack then exerted his utmost and put nearly the fullest powers of our hero to proof till harry dazzling his eyes by a sudden flourish gave him a smart stroke on his brazen headpiece and drove him stunned and staggering several paces backward till he rested against the wall that stood behind him  ha said jack recovering and casting his cap aside that indeed was a blow which neither my father nor mother ever taught me to fence  well my friend said our hero as soon as you are rested we must have a little turn or so at wrestling no no cried jack i would not advise your lordship to that there lies all my excellence the very best of my manhood well jack said harry a fling on this floor cannot hurt us a whit more than a fall on the downs  they closed they grappled they griped under and over at hip and at shoulder alternately lifting and lifted till they were nearly overbreathed then parting for a moment they rushed forward and seized each other by the breast when harry giving his adversary a sudden twist on one side and then an agile jerk and foot on the other cast him sidelong on the carpet  poor jack rose astonished and in utter abasement ashamed even to lift his eyes toward the eyes of his friend frank when harry took him by the hand and forceably seated him at the teatable come jack says he dont be discouraged you have put me harder to it than did the great roger of rosstown though i think i am much abler than i was at that day here frank order us something more substantial for breakfast while your friend and i endeavor to accommodate our differences  when breakfast was over harry looked fixedly at his late opponent and said i will give you jack a little matter above the extent of your demand i will give you one hundred a year for your cudgelling another hundred for your wrestling and as you say you can love i will lay another hundred in store for you till that promise is put to proof and here is twenty guineas as earnest of our agreement jack then threw himself prostrate before the feet of his new master keep your bounties keep your bounties for my executors he cried for i feel that when your service demands my life i shall not survive another minute  harry then rose and putting another quarterstaff into the hand of his new servant here is a horse for you jack says he in case you should tire for we have a long walk from palmall here to the customhouse wharf and back again  as they drew near the quay harry observed a great crowd all in motion and shouting as in the midst of an affray immediately he hastened up and making way through the mob perceived that they were kicking and wounding and dragging above twenty unhappy foreigners along the pavement while a lady who stood with her women on the stairs cried aloud five hundred a thousand five thousand pounds to any who will save my poor people  come jack says our hero let us try to deliver these abused strangers from the cruelty of our savage countrymen  on the word harry found himself well seconded by jack and in less than a minute above thirty of the assailants lay sprawling on the area while the wounded and bruised foreigners arose as well as they could or crawled and got in a group to the feet of their mistress  the mob thereupon rallied and gathering to the number of some hundreds advanced in a formidable body against our two champions but they had better have kept aloof for harry running upon them overturned the first he met with one end of his staff and laid a second at his feet with the revolution of the other end insomuch that at every motion as it were he dispatched two men  neither was jack unactive the crowd began to recoil when rushing into the midst they overthrew such as opposed them and whirling their staffs about their heads they quickly opened and cleared large room for themselves no one dared to abide within the wind of their weapons and the mob flying several ways left our hero quiet master of the field of battle  mean time the lady stood fixed in utter astonishment at the feats which she had seen when harry gracefully approaching i think myself happy madam says he in having done some small service to a lady of your fair and noble appearance of what country may i presume of england sir says she and i am ready to discharge my promise of five thousand pounds for the gallant rescue which you brought to me and my people  no madam said our hero i will not debase the little merit of my humanity by the acceptance of a bribe but i shall not be easy till i see you and your attendants out of the reach of these londonbarbarians they may return with different weapons and a larger reinforcement he then called to some porters and throwing them a parcel of silver ordered them to bring all the coaches they could muster and go you jack says he to the shipping enquire after the friends that i told you of and then follow me to the white cross tavern in cheapside  the coaches came and harry assisted his porters in carrying helping and gently stowing the maimed and the wounded into half a dozen of them he then handed in the lady and next coming to a blackamoor boy who had a coronet of diamonds inserted in his cap he offered to lift him in but the youth bending one knee to the dust and seizing on harrys hand eagerly and repeatedly kissed it crying out in french heavenly heavenly creature and then breaking into tears sprung into the coach and sat down by the lady  our hero then bestowed the four female attendants with such luggage as was brought on shore into the four remaining coaches then grasping his quarterstaff and ordering the porters to attend he guarded and escorted all safe to the white cross  the first thing he then did was to order private apartments for the lady and her attendants he next dispatched the waiters for all the surgeons in the neighborhood he then locked the room where he saw the luggage safe lodged ordered a sumptuous dinner to be prepared as soon as possible and lastly discharged the coaches and porters who poured their parting blessings upon his head and all this he did with wonderful dispatch for harry was now in the wide element of his beneficence as a whale in the ocean  four surgeons then came and our hero putting five guineas apiece into their hands desired them to examine and dress their patients and staid till he heard the delighting tidings that none of them were incurable he then sent up to the lady to desire permission to attend her she rose and met him as he entered child of heaven said she from which of the orders of angels have you descended i have heared as well as seen what you have wonderfully done for us madam said harry endeavoring to turn the discourse i would not advise you to remove your people for some time i have ordered beds and apartments for them in this house where those who are tolerably well may assist the doctors to attend their sick fellows till all shall be restored in the mean time i have sent to my fathers for his coach and chariot to convey you and this young gentleman and your women to our house where you can want for no servants since my father and i and all will be truly and tenderly your servants we are your property sir said the lady dispose of us as you please  but pray madam said our hero what could provoke the rabble to insult you and yours in the manner that they did this day i protest sir said she i cannot conceive except it be that as some one says in lear our countenances liked them not  in a little time after dinner was served up and harry happening to turn his head perceived the black youth by stealth kissing the hat and pressing the gloves to his bosom that he had laid on a table  whatever the darkness or deformity of any aspect or person may happen to be if the sentimental beauty of soul shall burst through the cloud upon us the dark becomes light the deformed quite comely and we begin to affect what was lately our aversion thus it was that harry found himself suddenly and inevitably attached by the two recent proofs that this outlandish youth had given of his affection  being all seated harry looked earnestly at the young moor and turning to the lady said i now perceive madam how ridiculous all sorts of prejudices are and find that time and observation may change our opinions to the reverse of what they were i once had an aversion to all sorts of blacks but i avow that there is something so amiable in the face of this youth and his eyes cast such a luster over the darkness of his countenance as is enough as shakespeare has it to make us in love with night and pay no more worship to the gaudy sun  the moor hereat smiled celestial sweetness and joy beamed from his eyes and throughout his dimpling aspect  but who can you be my sweet fellow said the lady who are the picture the image almost the thing itself that i was so sadly in love with five and thirty years ago why madam said our hero you could not have been born at that early day ah you flatterer says she i am turned of forty but pray madam who was he that was so happy as to attract your infant affections  his name was harry clinton  why madam harry clinton is my name  harry clinton harry clinton screamed out the lady and started up from her chair  yes madam i am son to the earl of moreland and i almost dare to hope that you were once the enchanting fanny goodall  yes my lovely kinsman i am indeed your fanny goodall  harry then sprung forward and seizing her hand kept it dwelling on his lips but disengaging it she opened her arms and clasped him to her bosom and wept over him as a mother would over a longlost son while the young moor ran and danced about the room like a mad thing clapping hands and springing like an antelope almost to the cieling  when they were something composed the moor caught the lady about the neck and kissing her cried joy joy my dearest madam the greatest of all joys then turning to our hero he took each of his hands in turns and pressed them to his lips while harry kissing his forehead cried my brother my brother  when they were again set to dinner jack entered my lord says he i have been all along the quays and the shipping but can learn no tidings of the marquis daubigny nor of any french family save that of the duchess bouillon who this morning came up the river with a numerous train  well says harry our happiness has been already quite sufficient to the day to morrow may crown our wishes with full success  no my love said the lady you cannot see the marquis for some time the truth is that you find in me your fanny goodall the marchioness daubigny and the duchess de bouillon but these matters shall be explaimed more clearly when i am blessed with the sight of your precious uncle  news was now brought that the carriages were at the door when taking a hasty bit or two they visited and left orders for the care of the sick and wounded and then set out in a hurry for pal mall  when they arrived the duchess hastened in enquiring for mr clinton and when she came where he was she cried out as she advanced and as he rose to receive her your fanny your fanny goodall my cousin and throwing herself into his arms dwelt there for a minute then recoiling awhile she looked fondly at him and cried your sister also my brother your sister daubigny the wife of the brother of your heavenly louisa then clasping him to her arms she broke into tears and again quitting him sat down to quiet her emotions  mr clinton having seated himself affectionately beside her said these are wondrous things that you tell me my precious sister by what miracle have these blessings been brought about  i am too much agitated at present says she let me have a little coffee and the matter shall be unravelled  as they were settling to the teatable give me leave sir said the duchess to introduce my little black companion to your notice he is a sweet fellow i assure you notwithstanding his complexion he is child to our royal friend the emperor of morocco who has entrusted him to our guardianship for his travel and education however he might have come by his sable outside his father the great abenamin is the least of the tawny of any man i saw in africa and his mother is one of the fairest and finest women that ever opened a pair of living diamonds to the light but she took fright while she was pregnant at the sudden sight of a blackamoor but my brother i shall more particularly recommend him to your regard by telling you that he is an exceedingly pious christian though as playful as lambs and as chuckling as infancy  she then turned and taking the little abenamin by the hand led him up and placed him before her brother when the youth suddenly dropping on his knees looked up to mr clinton with eyes that spoke love and reverential awe and besought his blessing  the old gentleman found himself surprizingly affected and lifting up his hands cried god be gracious to you my child and make your soul as bright as your countenance is sable and may the sun of righteousness shine with power upon you and soon disperse or illumine every shade that is about you the prince embraced his legs kissed his knees and arose  soon as the coffee was removed you may remember my dearest cousin said the duchess in what a hurry i last parted from you mr fairface with whom the bulk of my fortune was deposited went off with above a hundred thousand pounds of my substance beside four times that value entrusted to him by others  i traced him to paris and there he had the impudence to give me an interview but at the same time had the impudence to bid me defiance  immediately i commenced suit and sent dispatch to london for my papers and witnesses  on the opening of my cause in court i was summoned by the title of countess of maitland otherwise frances goodall on hearing the name a gentleman who was near me started and turning and coming up pray madam says he are you any way related to the honorable harry clinton who once went by that name in this city i am sir said i almost the nearest relation that he has upon earth  he is madam my dearest friend and brother pray speak to your advocates to postpone your suit for a few days till i am informed of the nature and merits of your cause  this was accordingly done he desired to know where i lodged and in less than an hour his chariot was at my door  except yourself my cousin the marquis had the most lovely and winning aspect and person that ever i beheld i soon convinced him of the equity of my demand and of the villainy of my trustee and made him perfect master of the whole affair but he still continued to visit and to stay with me a considerable part of every day under color of being better informed touching this and the other particular the remaining time was spent in soliciting for me  at length a hearing came on and after a short trial honest fairface was cast in principal and double costs he was instantly taken into custody and put under confinement till he discharged the whole amount of the judgment in my favor  no sooner was one suit over wherein i was plaintiff but another was commenced wherein i happened to prove but a very weak defendant the marquis now became solicitor for himself but with such a sweet timidity as seemed to doubt and greatly dread the success of his cause  i could not refuse my time to him who had devoted the whole of his time and assiduity to me we spent whole days together but o what floods of tears did that time at times cost both him and me while he pathetically and feelingly related your history from the place where you broke off to the death of your louisa and your precious infants  i believe my cousin that as grief is a greater softener so it is a greater cementer of hearts than any other passion i gave the marquis in my turn my little story and dwelt on every tender minuteness of my infant passion for you ah said he what a pity that a heart so susceptible of all divine and humane feelings should sit as a lonely turtle upon the housetop without a suitable mate  i took him for that mate my cousin and in a husband i found the truest and tenderest of lovers i became pregnant for the first time of my life and was delivered of a sweet and promising little fellow whom we left at nurse in our country seat while i attended my lord on his embassy to morocco  but here i must stop my brother i am under the positive interdiction of an imperial thing called a husband not to divulge a word further till he sees you face to face but i trust that he has blessed tidings for you my brother he says that he otherwise would not have dared to present himself before you after his loss of your eloisa  mr clinton smiled careless as at the impossibility of any consoling event upon earth again smiling archly i protest my sister said he you appear to me to grow younger for your years i see no manner of alteration save that you are something plumper and not quite so slender as when we parted o says she laughing there may be a reason in nature for that  i rejoice at heart to hear it said mr clinton but pray when may we expect my brother  in about two months at present he is engaged with the king who is extremely fond of him and lately created him a duke on account of the services which he rendered the state in africa we received your dear letter my dearest brother at paris but wondered who the sweet fellow could be who was said to accompany you  in the mean time our hero and the young prince were in close combination abenamin stepped about and about harry and toyed with him and twisted the curls of his careless locks around his fingers then turning and looking fondly up in his face ah how fair says he does this black visage of mine show in those fine eyes of yours it is in truth said harry so fair in my eyes that i would not exchange it for fifteen of the fairest female faces in britain the prince then caught his hand and pressed it to his bosom but what shall i call you says he you are a great lord in this country and in my own country i am greater than a lord but i hate the formality of titles between friends and i will call you my harry provided you promise to call me your abenamin a bargain says harry let us seal it with a kiss no no says the prince we never kiss lips in africa but i will kiss your head and your hands and your feet too with pleasure but tell me harry what makes you so mighty clever a fellow will you teach me to be a clever fellow also ay that i will says harry and to beat myself too provided you promise not to hit me over hard abenamin fell a laughing and aimed a little fist as though he meant to overturn him  as soon as harrys grief for his late maria would allow him to associate he had been to seek his old friend and tutor mr clement but he found only a single domestic at home who told him that the old gentleman had been some time dead and that the family were lately gone to take possession of a new seat that they had purchased in the country  however as harry found himself quite happy in the present society he sought no further acquaintance or amusement in london in less than three weeks the retinue of the prince and the duchess were well restored and they all set out for enfield there to await the wished arrival of the duke  they slept the first night at oxford and toward the noon of the third day they set up at the angel inn in coventry  it happened to be a season of festivity in the town over against the front windows a stage had been erected for a mountebank and his merry andrew and as soon as they had dismounted it became a stage for combatants two quarterstaffs and a pair of baskethilted cudgels lay thereon while an adjoining pole was hung with a variety of prizes destined to the conquerors  immediatley two champions mounted with two seconds appointed to see fair play but one of the combatants was quickly dismissed with a broken head another then succeeded and then another to the amount of half a score but the first hero still kept the field of battle while harry sat with his company looking out of the dining room windows at the diversion  at length jack came behind his lord and giving him a touch on the shoulder whisperingly begged his permission to claim the stage  harry assented jack was up in a twinkling and quickly dispatched the victor as he had served his predecessors a number of candidates then succeeded but with no better fortune and the prize was taking down to be delivered to our friend jack when an elderly looking man desired to be lifted on the stage  come says he to jack you seem to be a clever fellow let us quit this boys play and take up the quarterstaff when jack remembering a piece of an old ballad repeated accurssd be he earl piercy said by whom it is denied  they grasped their formidable weapons and each threw himself into an expert posture of defense then began the work to grow warm and these champions had twice traversed the whole round of the stage before a wound or bruise was received on either part  at the third bout the old stager made a feint at his adversarys left leg and in attempting to defend it the sconce of our friend jack was covered with blood and he sprung off the stage and instantly vanished  harry then stepped backward and ordered his servant to be called and laughing cried ah my poor jack i knew what would be your fate the moment i saw the face of your opponent you unfortunatley met with the famous oakum the old prizer of islington many and many a lesson have i got from him but you may happen to get some satisfaction ere long run and give yonder fool a crown for the loan of his patched coat for a few minutes  jack flew on his embassy while harry burned a stick at a back room fire with which he made to himself very formidable eyebrows and whiskers then hurrying on the fools coat he stepped forth and desired to be lifted on the stage  oakum little expected a second adversary but when he saw the merryandrew as he supposed he had like to be suffocated by a sudden fit of laughter while the crowd tore the elements to fritters with their clamor  harry then put himself in an awkward and peasantlike posture while oakum advancing carelessly made a slight but as he thought demolishing stroke at him but harry setting it aside with the one end of his staff gave oakum with the other end as it were a chance chuck under the chin and tossed him on the broad of his back along the stage  the shouts of the populace were then redoubled at length oakum arising fixed his eyes upon harry with an inquisitive astonishment as desirous of knowing how this business came about while harry with a grin of stupid amazement seemed equally to wonder at what he had done  again they set themselves in hostile opposition oakum then aimed a disabling stroke at harrys right shin but harry quick as thought slipping his leg backward gave the weapon room to pass and at the same time bestowing a sudden tip on the crown of his old master he cut him along the skull and gave him once more to measure his length upon the boards  the crowd stood awhile silent as scarce crediting what had passed before their eyes till oakum rising and staggering and again fastening his sight upon our hero cried aloud either you must be the devil or young harry fenton  harry then stepped up and put his mouth to the ear of his adversary oakum says he here are five guineas to help toward the cure of your broken head but remember that it is not honorable for the masters of our science to set themselves in competition against the ignorant oakum bowed and withdrew crying heaven be praised that it is no other than my own scholar who foils me  the clamours of the populace now became outrageous the prize of a silvered coronet interwoven with laurel was plucked down in a hurry and placed on the head of our hero all the townspeople then put their hands in their pockets and mustering their shillings and sixpences threw them in showers on the stage while the duchess mr clinton and the generous abenamin also emptied their pockets to reward the prowess of the man who had vindicated the quarrel of their favorite jack  all this profusion of money was faithfully gathered up by the two seconds and delivered in a hat full of silver to harry who bestowing a handful on each delivered the remainder to his man jack who stood by the stage  the crowd then ascended and laying violent hands on our hero bore him triumphantly away they then placed him in an armchair erected on long poles and hoising his carriage on their shoulders they carried him in the midst of peals of shouts up the street while an appointed herald went before them and cried o the fool the fool the brave the noble fool who beats the skill of the wise and the acts of the mighty to pieces at length harry growing tired of this parade put his hand on the head of one of his carriers vaulted lightly over instantly vanished from their sight and flew up stairs to his company  his friends now began to recognize their harry in the coat of the fool and broke into repeated fits of laughter abenamin then turned to his beloved friend and cried what is become of my handsome harry why he is turned to almost as ugly a fellow as myself then kissing his forehead and stroaking his cheeks he said o it was the cleverest and darlingest fool that ever i knew in the livelong days that i have passed upon earth  when the populace perceived their favorite fool seated in the midst of quality they all gathered to the inn and commenced their shouts anew but harry calling for his hat of silver as also for all the change that could be mustered in the house amounting to the value of about thirty guineas he threw his cash in handfulls on every side till he was nearly exhausted and that the crowd cried out enough enough your honor too much too much indeed o that all would equally learn to set bounds to their avarice  when dinner was over and that harry was restored to his former self our company again set out on their journey amidst the blessings and acclamations of the whole city who had ranged themselves on each side to behold and pay them obeisance as they passed  the next day as they stopped at a village to repair the fractured harness of an over mettled horse harry mean while took a walk with his abenamin along the road in their way they came to a long and waste cottage where they heared the confused clattering of junior voices harry stepped to the door and looking in perceived about forty or fifty boys ranged on benches of turf while a man of a pale aspect sat on a decayed chair instructing them in their lessons  your servant sir says harry pray what language do you teach  i can teach latin and greek too so please your honor but the people of this country choose to confine themselves to the language of old england  if i am not too free sir pray what is your name  longfield so please your honor  longfield longfield i have surely heared that name before pray were you ever acquainted with a man called hammel clement  hammel clement sir he was my dearest friend the friend whom i injured the friend of my heart  then cries harry you are the friend of my heart too my longfield and so saying he embraced and pressed him to his bosom  the poor man shrunk back in half wonder and half terror at what this might mean but the benevolent harry soon quieted his apprehensions your friend clement sayshe is come to great fortune and i dare answer for him would be nearly distracted with joy at your sight and would gladly divide his substance with you but if you please you shall be no encumbrance upon his growing family you shall instantly come with me and as pharaoh said to jacob regard not your stuff for the good of all my lands lies before you my longfield and i rejoice more in acquiring such a heart as yours than if i had acquired the possession of a province  harry then called a few of the neighbors in and giving them some guineas to be changed and divided among the children in order to enable them to see a new master he and abenamin took the threadbare longfield on each side under the arm and carried him away  when they came to the turn that led to the mansion house harry perceived with much pleasure that the two schoolhouses which he had put in hand before the death of his father were now completed they stood opposite to each other with the road between them their fronts were of hewn stone and a small cupola rose over each with bells to summon the children to meals and to lesson  here longfield says our hero is to be your province you are to superintend these schools at a salary of three hundred a year and i will soon send you with proper means throughout the country to muster me a hundred chosen children of each sex for i yearn to be a father longfield and to gather my family of little ones under my eye and my wing  as soon as they alighted mr clinton and his harry once more welcomed the duchess and her abenamin to their home and their hearts and the late house of mourning became a house of joy  above all abenamin inspired mirth and good humor throughout the family and melancholy fled before him wherever he turned he was daily inventive of new matters of entertainment he danced african dances for them with wonderful action and grace and he sung african songs that imitated and exceeded the wild and inarticulate warblings of the nightingale so that he became the darling and little idol of the whole household  harry had sent for the town tailor and got longfield fitted with three or four suits from his fathers wardrobe he then sent him on his commission in company with mr trustly the agent whom he ordered to show him the country to introduce him to the several families of the peasantry and to furnish him with whatever sums he should call for  in the mean time our hero and abenamin became inseparable he made the prince a present of his little dressed jennet and at times rode out with him and taught him the manage at other times they would run and wrestle and play a hundred gambols through the walks and the gardens  did you ever see the chase of the antelope harry  not i truly  you shall not be long so says the prince go gather me all the house man woman and child before the door here you shall be the huntsman and i will be the antelope and if any of your people can catch me in a miles running they shall have my cap for a kerchief  immediately the whole posse was summoned to the amount of about sixty persons male and female and mr clinton and the duchess hearing what they were about came laughing to the door to see the diversion  harry then gave his royal antelope about fifty yards law then cried away and instantly all heels and all voices were loosed after him  the prince then turned and bounded over an aha that was sunk on the right side of the avenue then clearing several other obstacles whereby he threw out the greatest number of his pursuers he at length reached the fields and shot away like an arrow  our friend jack headed about nine foreign and domestic footmen who still held the chase though at a distance while abenamin led them a round of above a mile then turning short homeward he came flying up the avenue with only jack and two followers puffing far behind at length reaching near the door the prince threw himself precipitately into the arms of his friend as it were for protection crying save me my harry save save your little antelope  mr clinton and the duchess then successively embraced the victor and wished him joy i protest harry cried mr clinton i will bet a thousand pieces with you on the head of my abenamin against your famous polly truck  that night as our hero sat with the prince in his apartment have you ever been in love my harry says he i confess said harry that i have had my twitches and tendencies that way  he then gave him a narrative of the struggles of his heart respecting the fair aggy jessamin and again he related to him the tragedy of his faithful maria which cost the prince the drenching of a handkerchief in tears  ah exclaimed the prince never never will i forgive your maria her death why was it not my lot by some severer doom to prove to you the superiority of my friendship and affection what cried harry would you not leave me a single companion upon earth when my abenamin quits the world i shall also bid it adieu  when tears were wiped away the prince took his friend by the hand and said i have a sister my brother a sister twinned with me in the womb and as fair as i am black all africa is pleased to hail her as the beauty of the universe but the truth is that i think but poorly of her the duke brought her with him to france and should he bring her to england beware of your heart my harry for though i am prejudiced against her she is the idol of all others who bow down to her as before a little divinity this has made her so excessively vain that she holds herself of a different species from the rest of mankind and thinks the homage of the world nothing less than her right and now my harry though i earnestly wish to be allied to you by a tie nearer if possible than that of friendship yet i would not wish my own happiness at the expense of your peace and so i give you timely warning against this dangerous and haughty girl  our company had now been upward of six weeks at the mansion house harry hitherto had never seen any part of the country or any part of his own estate above a mile from the house wherefore leaving his friend abenamin in bed in the presumption of his being tired with his last days fatigue he issued early forth accompanied only by jack and his agents runner who knew and was known every where  with their staffs in their hands they crossed and quartered the country at pleasure without let or obstacle  at length they came within prospect of a house sumptuously fronted and of a happy situation harry stopped here with pleasure comparing as he approached the acquirements of art with the advantages of nature when a servant issued forth and humbly besought him to walk in harry heard the voice of music what is your masters name says he fielding so please your honor and we are this day celebrating the nuptials of his son the young squire  the master of the family met our hero at the outward door harry recoiled at recognizing the face of the mr fielding whom he had seen at hamstead but taking no notice walked with him into the house  breakfast soon after was ushered in and mrs fielding and mr and mrs catharines and ned came with his blooming and blushing bride to the table  harry chuckled and rejoiced at heart but still took no note when after some cursory conversation ned looked at him with an eager disturbance and cried bless me my heart tells me that there is something in that face which is not quite unknown to me if i could think after my many and late enquiries that my patron was alive bating the difference of years i should verily believe that you were  your harry fenton cried our hero springing up your harry fenton my dear ned  harry then opened his arms to receive his friend while ned leaped and catched at him as the grapling iron of a corsair would catch at a ship from which great prize was expected  all the family then so highly as they had been obliged by our hero and his father struggled who should be foremost in their acknowledgments and caresses the holy catharines fondly taking him to his arms cried christ be gracious to you my child and may the god who has formed you as an angel upon earth make you also of the highest order of angels in heaven  after dinner harry rose and took his leave but they all got in a group and opposed his passage telling him he must be their prisoner for that night i consent only on this condition said harry that you promise to dine with me all tomorrow why pray sir where do you live says mr fielding at enfield with the young earl of moreland says harry but he has a great friendship for me and the house is as it were my own  much company arrived in the evening and the ball was opened and held till late but our hero declined dancing that his friend ned might stand forth peerless in the eyes of his bride  harry rose by the dawning and footed it in an hour to enfield he flew up stairs to salute the family but found no one save mr clinton from whom he received at once a warm blessing and embrace  where is the duchess sir and my friend abenamin gone harry says his uncle about breakfast time yesterday a courier arrived with the joyful tidings that my brother was on the road and so my sister and our abenamin hastened to meet him by this time i suppose they are all on their return and now take care of yourself my harry the duke brings with him the sister of our abenamin the fair princess abenaide the duchess tells me that a lovelier creature never beheld the light so that you must guard your heart with double bars against the power of this beauty  she is vain and disdainful sir excessively vain i am told so that her pride will prove an antidote against the poison of her charms however i will haste to meet and welcome your most noble brother  harry was mounted on a haughty charger that cost fifteen hundred guineas when a colt in mauritania he was white as new fallen snow save a black mane and tail one foot jet black to the joint of the fetlock and three large bloodlike spots on the far shoulder he was so perfectly instructed and subdued to the manage that he seemed to have no will save the will of his rider while harrys least motion like electricity informed every joint and member o that the wills of all men were equally subdued to the scepter of the prince of righteousness reigning and ruling within them  the princess came foremost in an open chariot drawn by six spotted arabians the chariot was plated all around in burnished gold emblazoned with gems of luster but if the eye could scarce bear the blaze of the vehicle much less could it support the brightness of the beauty who sat enthroned within it  harry bowed twice as he approached but she scare deigned a perceptible nod of acknowledgment to his salute  our hero felt himself piqued proud beauty thought he i thank you for your timely prevention of a passion that perhaps might have proved unhappy to me he then passed forward with affected carelessness to salute the duke  when he came up the coach stopped and harry flying from his saddle approached the window while his steed stood trembling but motionless behind him  my lord said harry seizing the dukes hand and respectfully kissing it if you were sensible of the joy that my heart receives from your presence i think it would make you nearly as happy as myself my sweet fellow said the duke i have often heard of you at paris as also by the letters of my love here my longing at last is gratified though my wonder is increased  but madam says harry what have you done with my little playfellow what is become of my abenamin o cried the duchess laughing he is forthcoming i warrant you but what has so bewitched you to him i think you could not be fonder if he were a mistress true madam answered harry sighing i never look to have a mistress that i shall love half as well but pray put me out of pain and let me know where he is be pacified said the smiling duke he is not far off and here is my hand and promise that you shall see him before night  our hero then turned and touching his left hand to the shoulder of his horse he rose perpendicular like a pyramid of fire and again descended on his seat as a flake of snow on a rosebud he then touched his white wand to the neck of his steed who instantly mounted the air like a winged pegasus while the duchess shouted out thinking her harry a gone man but he returned as composed as though he were seated on a bed of cotton  the coach now began to move and harry put his wand to the flank of his horse who turning his head to the carriage as of his own accord moved sidelong toward enfield with a proud but gentle prancing while the duke cried out look look o the boy o the boy the lovely glorious boy  as our hero attended the carriage of the duke the princess and her train had got to the house and alighted while harry opened the coach door and handed out the noble pair who alternately kissed and took him to their arms mr clinton then came forth and received them all with transport but harry under some pretense walked away ruminating in order to avoid the disdainful regards of the young lady  in the mean time our company rejoicing and caressing each other all the way had got slowly though very lovingly to the great mansion parlour the duke then respectfully taking the young lady by the hand permit me brother says he to recommend to you my lovely ward the fair princess of morocco the lady then gently bent one knee toward the ground while she received the cordial blessing and salute of the old gentleman  they then took their seats when mr clinton while he looked more earnestly on the princess grew suddenly affected and called out for a glass of fair water and hartshorn when he drank it be found himself in a measure restored and lifting his hands he cried i protest one would think that nature had copied this young and lovely creature from an image that has lain impressed upon my heart near these forty years  you are in the right my brother exclaimed the duke it is even as you surmize allow me then once more to introduce to you the counterpart of our once adorable louisa to introduce to you my niece and your own offspring my brother even the daughter of your still living and ever precious eloisa the princess then sprung forward and dropping precipitately at the feet of her grandfather she put her face between his knees and seizing both hands she bathed them with her tears crying my father o my father my dear my dearest father how inexpressibly blessed i think myself to be the offspring of such a father mr clinton then raising her and seating her fondly on his knee and grasping her to his bosom i will not ask he cried how these miracles came about it is enough that i feel the attraction which pulls you into my heart and so saying their tears flowed till they mingled on the flooring  go my angel said mr clinton and take yonder seat that i may view and delight my soul with your sight at leisure my eyes begin at these years to see best at a distance  at length the soft voice of our harry was heard in the hall and the duke whispering his brother requested him for a little time to take no notice of what had passed  our hero then entered bowing respectfully and gracefully but carelessly toward the side where the princess sat he then took his seat beside the duke and bending fondly to him and seizing a hand with both his hands he pressed it to his lips and cried welcome welcome my dearest lord to the house and the hearts of your truest lovers  then giving a glance to the side where the princess sat he caught a glimpse of her attractions and sighing said to himself o the pity the pity but no matter her pride shall never suffer a single charm to take place and so thinking he turned his eyes aside  mean time abenaide arose with as little noise as a hare from her seat and stealing round like a cat circumventing a mouse she came behind harrys chair and reaching and covering an eye with each of her hands she turned his head to her and made a sound with her lips as though she had kissed him harry opened his eyes in utter astonishment while in a twinkling standing before him she chuckled a laugh and cried ha ha he  my harry what have you forgot me dont you remember your old playfellow your little friend abenamin  harrys eyes were now opened in the midst of the hurry and agitation of his soul at a glimpse he took in the whole oppression of her beauties and casting himself quick as a glance of lightning at her feet he seized the hem of her robeing and glued it to his mouth  at length lifting up his eyes he cried ah what are all these wonders to me or my happiness unless my abenamin will also become my abenaide that replied the princess is not at my option there sits my lord and father at whose disposal i am  harry then rose and throwing himself at the feet of his revered patron embraced his legs in silence while mr clinton cried out yes my harry i understand you nothing shall ever be wanting to the happiness of my darling that the power of his tender parent and loving uncle can effect i can have nothing in heaven or earth that is not the property of my harry harry kissed his feet and sprung up  mr clinton then continued i aver i am still in a labyrinth did you not say my abenaide that you were also our abenamin i did my lord says she but i did not dare to avow myself ah what a painful struggle did that restriction cost me while i panted to catch and to cling to your honored feet while i used to look and gaze upon you unperceived while my heart swelled with affection and my eyes with restrained tears and while i kissed in secret the book that you read and the ground that you trod on  abenaide then sat down and harry lightly throwing himself on the ground beside her looked beseechingly around and cried my lord my dearest lady our still precious fanny goodall can you vouch can ye warrant that i am safe in this matter then looking up to the princess and drinking her in no he cried you cannot engage it i feel that i shall perish in the very ecstasy of the expectation of being united to her  just then mr meekly came in he had been long and far away upon many a blessed tour of doing good through the earth but as soon as he heared of the arrival of his beloved patron and young lord he rode post to embrace them  harry sprung from love to friendship and catching him in his arms cried o my meekly my dearest meekly how seasonably you come to temper by your advice the insufferable transports of my soul behold the regent of my heart behold the queen of all my wishes  meekly then fixed his eyes upon the princess and soon after exclaimed gracious father what do i see can the louisa be resuscitated and new raised from the dead o then it must be so she must be her descendent no one save my peerless patroness could produce the likeness of my patroness but how this blessing miracle was brought about is the question  that is my question too my dear meekly said mr clinton if my most noble brother would be so good as to solve it i will gratify you gentlemen said the duke in as few words as possible mean while the princess withdrew  on my embassy to the court of morocco i had several private interviews with the emperor before my credentials were opened in public i had the good fortune to be liked by him so that he suffered no day to pass without seeing me his name was abenamin he was accounted a great captain he exceeded all in his dominions for grace of person and beauty of aspect and that which rendered him still more singular was that he had given liberty to all the ladies of his seraglio and for many years had kept constant to the reigning sultana said to be the most exquisite beauty upon earth  as we grew more intimate in the exuberance of his affection for his empress he could not refrain from speaking of her to me and he promised that before i departed i should see and converse with her a grace he said never granted to any other man  at length the day being appointed for my public entry i rode through the city attended by a sumptuous train and alighting before the palace advanced to the hall of audience  the emperor was seated with his sultana at his right hand upon a throne of ivory as soon as i had approached the presence and began to open my commission the empress gave a great shriek and fell over in a swoon upon the bosom of her husband  the royal abenamin instantly turned pale as death tore off her veil with trembling hands to give her air and called me to his assistance as it is accounted profanation for any moor to touch the person of the empress but o heaven o my friend think what was my astonishment when in the pale face of the queen i beheld the loved features of our darling eloisa  the court broke up in confusion and her women came hurrying with drops and essences as soon as she recovered she opened her eyes upon me and reaching out her arms and catching me to her she cried o my uncle my dearest uncle am i so blessed then as to behold you before i expire  the monarch in the mean time looked upon me with a jealous eye and twice put his hand to the haft of his dagger but checked his rising indignation till he should have the mystery of his queens behavior explained the women then raised her up and bore her to her apartment while the emperor turning to me with no very friendly aspect ordered me to follow him  when i had attended a considerable time in the antichamber he came forth with a serene and joyous countenance and embracing me cried o my friend my dear kinsman how transported i am to find and acknowledge you for such the parent of my angel becomes a part of myself  he then led me by the hand into the bedchamber of my eloisa where we renewed our caresses without restraint but the monarch fearing that these emotions would be too much for her told me that he had something for my private ear till dinner and took me into an adjoining closet  there seating and taking me affectionately by the hand i will now tell you my uncle says he how i came by this inestimable treasure of your niece  i had fitted out a royal ship of my own not as a corsair but rather for trade in the mediterranean on their return from the coast of egypt as they past after a violent hurricane within sight of old carthage my people perceived at a distance a sloop stranded on a shoal of sand about a league from the shore immediately they sent out a boat and took the distressed company in consisting of my charmer two female companions and three servants in livery beside the boatmen  the intendants of my ship behaved themselves with all possible respect toward the young lady and her attendants and endeavored to quiet her terrors by assuring her that she was free and that their prince was a person of too much honor and humanity to derive any advantage from the disasters of the unfortunate  the moment that they brought her before me pale trembling and in tears while she dropped on her knees and lifted to me her fine eyes in a petitioning manner the gates of my soul opened to the sweetly affecting image and ever after closed of their own accord upon it  ah i cried heavenly creature calm calm your causeless fears i swear by our prophet and the god of our prophet that i would rather suffer the gaunch than put the smallest constraint on your person or inclinations you are free madam you shall ever be free save so far as i may bind you by my tender offices and affections  i raised her and she grew something better assured when bending a knee in my turn i kissed her robe and cried look not upon me as your tyrant look not on me as your lover but look upon me as your friend the tenderest and truest of friends who shall ever be ready to sacrifice his own happiness to yours  from that time i studied every amusement every diversion that might serve to dissipate the timid shrinkings of her remaining apprehensions while i conducted myself toward her with a distant though fond respect not even presuming to touch her ivory hand  in the mean time my soul sickend and grew cold to all other women if you were ever in love my dear daubigny you know that it is a chaste as well as a tender passion i languished indeed for her i longed and languishd to death but then it was rather for her heart than her person that i languished  one day as she heaved a heavy but half suppressed sigh ah my angel i cried i can have no joy but yours and yet you have griefs to which you keep your friend your abenamin a stranger true my lord says she tears breaking from her all your bounties have not been able to silence the calls of kindred or claims of nature within me ah my parents my dear parents i feel more for you than i feel even for myself in being torn from you  the weight of her affliction fell like a mountain on my soul and crushed me to her feet you would leave me then eloisa you wish to leave me but your generosity delays to tell me so for fear of breaking my heart  well be it so  go from me  you know i cannot survive you  but my death is of no consequence my eloisa shall be happy  i will go this instant i will dispatch my swiftest galley to languedoc  i will write word to your parents that you are safe that you are beloved and yet pure and untouched since respected as a deity  i will invite them to come and take possession of my treasures my dominions my heart but  should they reject my suit i again swear by alla to send you to them laden with wealth though i myself should drop dead at the instant of your departure  the noble soul of my eloisa became instantly affected she caught a hand between both of hers and bathing it with tears cried o now indeed you have bound me by chains infinitely stronger than all the shackles that fasten the slaves to the galleys of africa  i kept firm to my engagement and in a few weeks my winged messengers returned but o the tidings the very doleful tidings for my beloved they brought word that they found no creature save two ancient domestics in the great hotel as two ravens in the midst of a lonely forest  from these they learned that my eloisas mother and little brother were dead that her grandmother was dead her aunt the marchioness also dead and that the marquis had retired they knew not whither  she wept incessantly and i wept with her  at length she softly said you have conquered my lord you have conquered i am subdued by your weight of affection o that you could but conform to one article more that we might be united as one heart and one soul and one sentiment for ever  it was now for the first time that i dared to seize her hand i crushed it to my lips and thrust it into my soul what would you enjoin i cried i would do any thing dare any thing to be united to my eloisa in life and in death body to body and dust to dust never never to be sundered till her spirit should make the heaven of my spirit hereafter  ah she suddenly exclaimed that that is the very thing i so eagerly desire let the god of my heart be the god of your heart let the god of my spirit be the god of your spirit so shall we be united in him and jointly partake of his blessedness through eternity  ah i cried can i forego the divine precepts of our prophet your prophet says she preaches only to the eye and the ear and this is all that he does or can pretend to but christ my prophet preaches in the heart to the affections from him is every good motion divine or human he is the unknown god of your spirit my master my abenamin and you feel his precious power while you disavow his name  i was puzzled i was silenced i bent a knee in reverence kissed her hand and withdrew  i sent for the chief of the christian missionaries throughout the city and country i consulted each of them in private but received no satisfaction from them they all appeared equally zealous for my reformation but attempted it by different and even by opposite arguments  some would have persuaded me to be christian by showing the absurdity of every religion that was not christian others affirmed that my eternal salvation depended on my conformity to certain external rules and penances while the greatest number inveighed against the christians of every other denomination and would have thrust me wholly from christ if i did not consent to receive him within their stinted pale  i knew not what to do i was put to a stand and quite confused by this multiplicity of conflicting opinions at length a countryman of my own came to me from the desert he had been a great sinner but was converted by the sense of his sins and he was revered and resorted to by all the friendless and afflicted  i opened my soul to him with all its doubts and difficulties  my friend in christ said he with a gentle and still voice they have been leading you all astray quite away from the haven that stretches forth its arms for the reception of long toiled mariners whom storms have at length compelled to seek a final port  the god of your creation can alone be your redemption the god of your nature can alone be the salvation of the nature that he imparted but who shall convince you of this not all the angels in heaven nor all the doctors upon earth till the christ of your heart shall be pleased to convince you that you are as indeed you are however mighty a monarch a poor frail erring vile and despicable creature subjected to innumerable lapses and infirmities sickness passions and crosses griefs agonies and death when this is effectually done the whole of the business is done you will call for and catch at a savior in the sensibility of your want of him when you come thus laden with your sins to him he will in no wise cast you out but he will take you as noah took the wearied dove into the ark he will take you within the veil of his own temple of rest and all sects forms and ceremonies will be as the outward courts with which you shall have no manner of commerce or concern  my heart felt the weight and the fullness of conviction i took him to my arms and requested instant baptism my eloisa was called we locked ourselves in and i was washed by water and faith into christ while my kneeling angel wept a stream of delight beside me  it is said that possession cloys but i experienced my dear daubigny that love never cloys every day with my eloisa seemed to triumph in heartfelt happiness over my first bridal day but o what was the joy the exultation of my fond heart when she gave me to be the father of a little daughter of paradise  one day while we were toying and fooling with the smiling infant and throwing her as she crowed from the one to the other ah my husband cries eloisa how poor i was lately no parents no kindred nothing but my abenamin upon the whole earth and now god has been pleased to make my affliction to laugh and to give this babe for a further band a precious link of love between us  he was just in this part of his narration when the music sounded to the banquet we instantly rose and joined our eloisa  when the collation was removed madam said i to the empress have you ever heard of a relation of yours christened by the name of fanny goodall and lately countess of maitland i have said she often heard my fond father speak of her with filling eyes she is in this city madam she is no longer countess of maitland she is now doubly your relation your aunt as well as your cousin and goes by the title of the marchioness daubigny with the good leave of my lord here i will bring her to you directly  i went to the palace appointed for my residence i there gave my fanny a few heads of the story of our eloisa and took her hastily to the presence  the ladies looked at each other in long and silent admiration then opening their arms and rushing together they continued some minutes locked in mutual embraces  madam said the emperor smiling i think i ought to be allowed the same liberties with my aunt that your husband took with his niece whereon he welcomed and caressed her with an affectionate fervor  o exclaimed the royal fair how very poor and how very rich our god can suddenly make us but then lord of my life to think of parting of parting with these dear friends again perhaps never to see them more that is what sinks and wrings my heart in the very midst of exultation  that my love said the emperor is the very important article on which i wish to consult with you and our friends here our dear kindred in christ but i must first show them their young relation my little enchantress my priceless pearl my eye delighting abenaide  he then stepped forth and after a while led in a gracefully moving creature but veiled from the head to the waist throw up your veil my love says he here are none but your friends your very dear relations your lovely aunt and your uncle the marquis and marchioness daubigny  she did as she was ordered and instantly broke upon my sight like a new glory arisen upon midday  my fanny seized upon her as desirous of devouring her and i in turn took her to me with tearfull eyes as almost persuaded that i embraced the newly revived person of my dearest sister louisa so perfect was the resemblance in every grace and feature  when we had nearly oppressed the celestial looking maid with our insatiate caresses she seized our hands and kissing them cried what a blessed day is this that enriches abenaide with two parents more another precious father and another lovely mother happy happy abenaide  her royal father then gave a beck and she instantly vanished while her absence seemed to cast a shade throughout the room  the monarch then deeply musing and heavily sighing began  i am now my dearest friends friends beloved above the world and all that it contains i am now to open to you my inmost heart and to reveal a purpose whereon i have been ruminating these many months but could not hit on an expedient for bringing it to pass how opportune has our jesus sent you to us on this occasion  i have but the two children living my abenaide and a son by a former woman of my seraglio his name is abencorrage he is a youth renowned in the field but of a proud and impetuous demeanor he had long conceived an illicit passion for his young and lovely sister at length the fire broke forth and he lately attempted her honor  i would instantly have put him to death had i any other heir to succeed to my dominions i therefore contented myself with banishing him my court and my presence though i am sensible that this has not availed for the extinguishing his horrid flame  now my friends should i die or should this violent boy break into rebellion for he is the favorite of the licentious soldiery i tremble to think what would become of my bright eyed dove within the talons of such a vulture  this together with my eager desire of quitting a kingdom of infidels and of joining with the blessed society and communion of saints has after some struggles determined me to abdicate my throne as soon as i can amass and transmit a fund sufficient for supporting my eloisa and myself with becoming dignity in her native country  ah my lord i cried clasping him passionately in my arms regard not your treasures delay not a moment for that your eloisas relations both by father and mother are possessed of princely fortunes and they will all be freely at the disposal of your majesty  ah my daubigny said he i am not yet so duly mortified a christian as needlessly to elect a state of dependence or willingly to descend at once from the king to the beggar i have however been preparing i have already converted a large part of my effects into bills and jewels of high value but light portage to the amount as i think of about sixty million of french money this i will transmit by you and as soon as i shall have compassed an equal sum i will stay no longer in africa i will fly to your bosoms my precious friends  in the mean time this violent and lustful boy gives no rest to my apprehensions it is therefore necessary that i commit my abenaide to your trust it is necessary i say that i tear away my choicest limb the dearest part of my vitals support me christ in the trial but it must be gone through  this however must be done with all possible privacy i am persuaded that my young villain has his spies in and about my palace i shall therefore request my dear aunt to disguise my little girl in boys apparel and to blacken every part of her visible complexion that she may pass unnoticed as your page through the midst of my attendants as also that it may prove during the travels of my darling a preservative against the lust of the eye and any further attempt tending to violation  at length the time approached and pressed for my departure but how to part was the question all attendants were ordered to avoid the presence far away our metamorphosed abenaide stood weeping beside us while her father and mother crushed us successively to their bosoms all was passion a gush of tears but not a word was uttered on any part  o my daubigny cried the emperor at length friend brother of my heart can you conceive what i feel at this instant i regard not the world nor the things of the world omit such necessary accommodations as are common to us with brutes and all belonging to the immortal and divine humanity of man is magnetism is fellowship the feeling as of steel to adamant and of adamant to steel there is the friendship the endearment the love passing love and surpassing all other enjoyment if we meet again my daubigny i shall anticipate my heaven  again he embraced his little angel and again he embraced his queen and besought her to be comforted we then took leave as for the last and again they called us back and embraced and took leave again till seeing no end i suddenly broke away hurrying with us our abenaide for fear of observation i forgot however to tell you that the day before our departure the royal abenamin had enjoined me to set apart twenty million of livres for the portion of his child in case she should be married to any great prince or potentate requesting me at the same time not to put any constraint on the inclinations of his lamb  i have little further to say my brother we arrived safe at paris where we received your letter and impatient to make you happy i dispatched my fanny with her train and your abenaide before me enjoining them however not to reveal our secret till my arrival for as i had charged myself with the loss of your eloisa i deemed myself best entitled to make you reparation in person but i ought not to omit that before i left paris i received a further remittance of twenty million from your soninlaw so that we may speedily look to have the royal pair in england  soon after a post chaise whirled into the court and harry flying out caught clement and arabella into his strict embrace he then hurried them in where mr clinton received and caressed and introduced them to the duke and duchess as persons of great merit and his highly valued friends he then presented to them his abenaide who accordingly saluted clement and embraced arabella with an affectionate familiarity  o sir cried our hero kissing his uncles hand am i to be the last person in the world whom you will honor with a salute from your bewitching daughter i ask your pardon my lord said mr clinton solemnly allow me then at length to repair my omission by presenting to your earlship her little highness abenaide  the duke and duchess and meekly laughed but harry was not a whit the slower in laying hold of his advantage he kissed her forehead her eyes her cheeks and lastly dwelt upon her lips as though he would have infused his soul between them harry harry cried mr clinton i will never introduce you to my girl again unless you promise not to kiss so hard and bring so much blood into her face  just then a footman entered my lord says he to harry here are three carriages and several horsemen waiting without the gate they enquire for one master fenton who they say lives with the earl of moreland but i assured them there was no such person in the house o sir said harry these are our old friends the fieldings and out he flew  as he approached the carriages the company gave a shout of joy why sir said mr fielding a servant denied you to us and said that no one of the name of fenton lived here o says harry dont heed the puppy he is but a new comer  he then opened the doors of the carriages and handed and kissed them in turns as they came out mr and mrs fielding the reverend mr catharines and his sainted phaebe and ned and his blooming bride  mr clinton received them at the door with the joy of his heart apparent in his countenance he then introduced them to his most noble brother and sister to his friend meekly and lastly he presented his abenaide to them on whom they all gazed in mute and reverential astonishment  harry then observing that his uncle had not equally presented his daughter to ned sir says he i apprehend that this is not quite fair i have already kissed the fair bride of my friend with all my heart and it is but honest that he should be favored with a salute from mine in turn  harry then took ned by the hand and presented him to his beloved while ned bent the knee and touching her hand tremblingly looked awfully to her face and said yes bride of eden lovely extract of every beauty you alone can reward you alone can deserve him you alone are fitted to be the mate of my incomparable lord and master my patron and preserver so saying he lightly touched his lips to the polished hand but the praises of her harry had gone with a pleasant trickling to the heart of abenaide and gently raising ned she affectionately saluted him with a glistening eye  pray sir said mr fielding whisperingly to mr clinton is the earl of moreland in company  that is he sir pointing to harry  o then cried fielding he is titled below his merits it was for an emperor that nature intended him  dinner was then served  during the repast the duke said let us not my brother keep our harry in pain why should we delay the happiness of children so very dear to us with regard to your childs marriage to some mighty prince as your soninlaw hinted i think her more ennobled and more illustrious by her marriage with our hero here who purchased her at his peril than if she were mated to the greatest potentate on earth  you must excuse me my noble brother said mr clinton i will have no clandestine doings in this business my girl shall be married in the face and witnessing of thousands left hereafter this young rogue should have the effrontery to deny her what day of the week is this thursday i think let monday sennight be the day  harry rose and pressed and kissed the hand of the duke with rapture and then kissed the hand of his patron in silent submission  they kept the fieldings with them for three days but harry would not part with his clement nor abenaide with arabella till the marriage should be over harry in the presence of these two friends attempted to take some little accustomed liberties under her name of abenamin but the proprietor of his heart sweetly repulsed him and cried no no honest friend i will box with you whenever and as often as you please but no more wrestling my harry  in the mean time all preparations were pushed into forwardness by mr clinton the many shops of the many towns within many miles around were emptied of their boards and sheeting their knives and forks etc thousands of tables and forms were framed thousands of tents were erected proclamation was made in every village and all people within thirty miles invited to the wedding  when the day approached one hundred oxen were slain five hundred sheep three hundred swine with fifty fat deer etc etc the spits fried and the cauldrons smoaked over the fires of many a field  at length the auspicious morning rose and harry and his bride were already up and dressed in their respective apartments harry wore a jacket and drawers of white satin his locks flowed through a knot of oriental pearl and a mantle of purple velvet embroidered with needle wrought flowers of gold hung over his left shoulder and came under the right arm in floating skirts joined at the ends by a buckle of carbuncles  the princess was habited after the persian fashion in a vest of silver brocading scollopd over a petticoat of the same fabric that flowed in a train behind a scarf of cerulean tint flew between her right shoulder and her left hip being buttoned at each end by a rose of rubies her shining tresses of jetty black bound together at her neck beneath a huge amethyst fell down in luxuriant ringlets and shaded and revealed by turns the fine bend of her tapering waist a coronet of diamonds through which there waved a white branch of the feathers of the estrich was inserted on the left decline of her lovely head and a stomacher of inestimable brilliants rose beneath her dazzling bosom and by a fluctuating blaze of unremitted glory checked and turned the eye away from too presumptuous a gaze  our hero coming forth beheld her as a pillar of fire just issuing from her antichamber he stepped back as she advanced and fixed his eyes upon her in mute astonishment then springing forward he fell prostrate and kissed the hem of her robeing again rising on one knee he lifted his hands toward heaven and his eyes to her glowing countenance oppressive power of beauty he cried o may every day rise like this on my soulenrapturing abenaide encircling her with friendship love and joy and the knee of admiring thousands  arabella attended her royal friend and clement his noble pupil just as longfield entered to give an account of his expedition but he had scarce begun his detail when catching the image that had long since made an impression on his heart he started and turned pale and breaking off he cried bless me my lord mrs clement i think yes my longfield said harry and here too is your old and fast friend hammel clement clement would not have known longfield in his present genteel plight but hearing his name and recollecting him at a glance he flew and seized upon him with a strenuous embrace arabella then advanced to welcome her old friend but poor longfield respectfully bowed and shrunk back  you shall not escape me so my dear mr longfield says she i cannot forget what i owe you even my life and reputation and i bless the father of mercies who has put it in our power to pay part of our debt and so saying she embraced him with freedom and cordiality yes my dear longfield cried hammel yours is the half of our fortunes and more than the half of our hearts your heart sir said longfield will ever be most valuable but as to any thing additional the bounty of my young master has rendered all further fortune quite superfluous to me  longfield then beckoned his lord forth that he might relate to his eye rather than to his ear the success of his commission they hastened to a long barn where he showed harry two ranges of beautiful children one of a hundred chosen girls another of a hundred chosen boys all dressed in a clean and elegant uniform harry walked between the ranks his heart exulting in the sense of its own divine humanity then embracing his agent yes my longfield he cried these shall be indeed my children and i will prove a true and affectionate father to them but let us hasten to bestow upon them a tender mother too i trust  he flew back as a glimpse of lightening and seizing and half devouring the hand of his bride will you pardon me my beloved says he some matters that happened before our union i have collected all the children i ever had before marriage i scorn any thing that is clandestine they wait for your inspection and i hope that you will not prove a hard stepmother to them you are a rogue says she archly smiling and giving him a pat on the cheek but come along and so saying away they tripped  the princess walked with a silent and musing attention up and down the ranges her heart grew strongly affected and taking out her handkerchief she wiped away the dropping tear and has my lord says she to longfield has he indeed taken upon him to be a father to all this pretty host of little ones he has so please your highness says longfield and has accordingly clothed and provided for them o she cried under the father which is in heaven he is the dearest and sweetest father that ever was upon earth so exclaiming she sprung at harry and notwithstanding her late coyness scarce vouchsafing a hand to his lips she now grappled about his neck half smothering him with the repetition of her kisses and caresses and then thrusting her face into his bosom she vented her passion in tears  on their return they perceived mr clinton the duke and duchess all standing in the great folding door and flying up the marble steps they both bent the knee and received the joint blessings and successive caresses of their three exulting parents  just then harry spied goodman dobson and his dame coming diffidently but puffingly up the avenue instantly he caught his angel by the hand and hastened to meet them he took them successively in his arms and kissed them with warm affection while with yearning hearts and bowels they wished him joy upon joy they then kneeled down on each side of the princess kissing her hands and garments and blessing her for bestowing such a heaven of beauty upon their harry but as soon as harry told her that they were his fosterers his very dear daddy and mammy she raised and kissed them in turns with her arms about their necks and besought them to be her daddy and mammy also for alas says she my daddy and mammy are far away harry then gave them into the hands of his man jack with orders to take them to the larder  the multitude before this began to thicken apace and the youth had got together in the great lawn casting the coit and the sledge and leaping over a cord that was raised between two posts  my lovely harry cried the duke i have heard things almost incredible of your prowess and action but never saw any sample save the mounting of your bucephealus will you be so good to give me some instance of your excellence among yonder young competitors whom i suppose to be the most eminent that the shire can exhibit do my harry said mr clinton clasping and kissing him indulge my dearest brother on this our day of jubilee  harry bowed and ordered jack to bring him his quarterstaff and dispatched another for a cord and two long poles he then walked down the avenue attended by the males and females of the whole family  as they approached the lawn a youth of uncommon vigor had cleared the former cord though raised to something upward of five feet in height but all who attempted to follow either recoiled or pitched over  harry then caused his two poles to be erected to an elevation of ten feet with a cord reaching from top to top the multitude came down in thousands to see what they were about when harry having cleared the contested cord with a standing hop went backward from his lofty poles about the distance of thirty paces then rushing forward he advanced one end of his staff to the ground and springing and raising and rising upon the opposite end he pitched himself over the elevated string while the multitude beheld him as a new risen phoenix suspended and glittering in the air and then alighting as winged on the other side  the elements were rent by a universal shout which followed and undulated after our company till they sheltered themselves within the house  the fieldings then arrived with the reverable mr catharines who was appointed to join the angelic pair  after breakfast the carriages were ordered out first mr clinton and his meekly moved away in mr clintons coach and six to the church the family of the fieldings then followed in a coach and six and two chariots next went clement and his arabella in their post chaise and four the duke and duchess then succeeded in a sumptuous coach proudly drawn by six german greys attended by a long retinue of french liveries and the dutchesss women in a coach and four last advanced the princesss four faithful moors mounted on fiery coursers and all glistering in barbaric gems and adornments and last of all came our hero and his abenaide enthroned in her open chariot as two pearls of the orient in a case of burnished gold her six spotted arabians restraining their impatience beat measures with their feet scarce seeming to advance the pace of a tortoise never will any sight so glorious be exhibited till the heavenly jerusalem shall descend upon earth  harrys jack closed the rear mounted on his lords rhone charger who stepped foaming behind the chariot and the long cavalcade nearly reached from the great hotel to the entrance of the town  the crowd however extended wide and far beyond the cavalcade they bowed respectfully and paid obeisance to mr clinton the duke etc as they passed but as soon as they got a glimpse of the chariot of their young phaeton their acclamations became unremitted and almost insufferable to the ear like the shouts of a persian army at the rising of the sun  slowly as our harry moved the multitude strove to retard him by throwing themselves in his way that they might satiate their eyes and souls with the fullness of beauty bended knees and lifted hands prayers blessings and exclamations were heard and seen on all sides and all the way as they went thousands upon tens of thousands shouted forth the hymeneal of the celestial pair  the end
