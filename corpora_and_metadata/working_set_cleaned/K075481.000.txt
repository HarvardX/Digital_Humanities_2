adviser houses   houses and lodgings in london are let either furnished or unfurnished and their prices are according to their size their situation and their manner of fitting up in the central parts of london and westminster such as the neighborhood of st jamess charing cross the squares covent garden the theaters st pauls churchyard cheapside the royal exchange etc they are high rented in more distant parts they are cheaper and in bystreets courts lanes alleys and such obscure places cheaper still  a private house    feet in front and about seventy deep two or three rooms on a floor unfurnished in the best streets will let from  00 guineas a year to   0 such a house in other places may be had from  0 to  00 guineas unfurnished lodgings in such houses are seldom to be met with  in less central places but in good streets unfurnished houses of twenty feet in front two rooms and a light closet on a floor may be had for sixty or seventy guineas a year and houses of eighteen feet in front for forty or thirty guineas according to the situation and conveniences unfurnished lodgings in such houses let proportionably the first floor generally goes at half the net rent of the house without taxes the parlour floor or second floor at one fourth    houses about twentyone feet in front will let from four guineas a week furnished to eight guineas according to the season of the year and the time they are engaged for the dearest season is from christmas to june when families are in town and the parliament sitting the cheapest when families are out of town and the parliament prorogued in the winter season such a house as i have mentioned taken for four or five months may possibly be had for seven guineas aweek thus taken the tenant pays no taxes the goods are delivered on inventory and whatever is destroyed is paid for furnished lodgings that is the first floor with a servants room etc in such a house will let for from two guineas aweek to three and a half in proportion to the goodness of the furniture the conveniences wanted the trouble given the time they are engaged for and the season of the year  houses of fifty guineas a year rent will let furnished for from two guineas weekly to five and the first floor furnished will let for from one guinea a week to two guineas second floors two thirds of the rent of first floors and parlour floors at the price of second floors    it is generally estimated that in lodginghouses the rent of the first floor furnished with other conveniences such as kitchen cellars garret etc shall pay the rent and taxes of the whole house unfurnished    shops when let separate will fetch from  0 l a year to  0 l free of taxes according to their size situation trade of the street and show of window    landlords have now got into a method of making tenants pay guineas for rent instead of pounds and also land tax and repairs but all these outgoings should be considered when the agreement is made as well as the taxes on the house for in some parishes the poorrates and land tax are lower than in others persons who have money may often get the remnant of a lease cheap provided they will pay down a certain sum of money for such lease for there are always distressed housekeepers in london trying to procure money by every possible means for which reason such as purchase a lease should examine the covenants of that lease and the state of the building and particularly take care that the rent and taxes are paid up to the time they take possession of it and also the groundrent by seeing the receipts otherwise the tenant may have the arrears of such rent or taxes to pay and the seller of the lease may not be found or if found not able to repay    the general conditions of a lease are to leave such fixtures at the end of the term as are given in with the lease on schedule and to leave it in such a state as it was in when taken the wear from time only excepted to pay the rent halfyearly under a forfeiture of the lease but with a liberty of assigning it during the term    if a tenant purchases or takes a lease of another tenant during its term by assignment he is no longer bound for the rent than whilst it is in his possession he may assign it to another and this done is no longer answerable for the rent but the first tenant assigning it without the consent of his landlord is held bound for the rent during the whole term if the occupier does not pay it    table showing how many years purchase an annuity or lease is worth so as to make         or   per cent of money y m d years months days  y p

it is often expected that the purchaser should also buy the fixtures at a fair appraisement in doing this he should examine the lease and see that he does not give money for those fixtures which belong to the house for landlords will often fit up a house with every necessary fixture and put the tenant to no expense in this matter but if the fixtures have been put up by the tenant he has a liberty to remove or sell all such as are not fixed to the freehold  fixtures removeable are locks bells cisterns grates fixed coppers dressers shelves counters etc paper pasted to the wall buildings erected new windows chimneypieces etc or things to beautify the house etc and fixed to the freehold must go with the house at the end of the term and cannot be removed  when goods or fixtures are appraised the seller and the buyer each appoints one appraiser and the price is fixed between them if they cannot agree a third is called in by the other two and his decision is final  if six or eight hours is taken up in this business each appraiser expects a guinea for his trouble if a few fixtures only are to be appraised the appraiser will expect only halfaguinea however if you employ him in removing your furniture repairing it etc and you make a prior agreement with him he will probably not charge you for the appraising of a few fixtures be careful to have an honest man for an appraiser for his voice has been known to have been bought over on the other side when goods are appraised to a buyer a greater value is put upon them than they would fetch at a sale and if immediately sold

clothes  0 l books  0 l furniture   0 l plate  0 l etc and though you were to insure to the amount of  000 l they never pay more than you can make appear you have lost if insuring as above you have lost  00 l of clothes they will pay no more than  0 l the sum insured and the same in other articles it is folly therefore to insure beyond the value of your real property if your property increases at any ture time and you wish to insure more you can have a new policy for   s   d     in case of removal the same policy will do with the addition of an indorsement for which they charge one shilling     all these offices pay for the removal of goods in case of an adjoining fire  cautions against fire    to guard against fire every master or mistress of a family should be particularly attentive that servants put every fire out before they go to bed and that they put out the candles in their own room for if a fire does not begin in your own house as watchmen are always about to give notice there is sufficient time to escape but if families should be so unfortunate as to be surprised by fire and cannot escape at the door they should by all means endeavor to be cool and not be too much alarmed  fear overcomes reason and will prevent studying our safety if there be no way out at the top of the house from the first floor windows or even from the second a person might escape by tying the blankets and sheets together fastening one end to a chair with the window half down and throwing the other end out and lowering himself down by the blankets etc the window will prevent the chair following you     the law enjoins that the parishofficers shall pay as a reward to the turncock whose water first reaches the place where any fire breaks out a sum not exceeding ten shillings to the first engine brought complete a sum not exceeding thirty shillings to the second a sum not exceeding twenty shillings and to the third a sum not exceeding ten shillings and to make persons careful of fire whenever a chimney takes fire and the house is not burnt or wherever any mischief is done to a house by fire beginning in a chimney and the parishofficers pay the rewards as above the tenant or lodger whose chimney is thus set on fire shall repay the churchwardens the said sums or such part of them as a justice shall direct if the matter is referred to him    geo   c        but as a preservative against fires every parish is furnished with long ladders these are kept at certain places and every family should know where they are kept and write it down and fix the writing n some conspicuous part of the house as also in what tuation the fireplugs are by doing this people can lways have recourse to them     if families have any thing to preserve more than ordinary for example shopbooks books of account writings banknotes cash etc as these things take but little room it would be advisable for those who have no other secure place to put them every night into a bag and place them in their chamber by their clothes they can thus be readily carried off     some families have stoneclosets others have iron chests but the above method would be almost equally as secure     tradesmen would do well to keep duplicates of their books and lodge one set in the house of a friend the occurrences of a week might be transcribed at the weeks end     those who have banknotes should always enter the number date and sum of each note in a book as soon as received in which case if destroyed on giving the bank security to repay the money in case the note ever appears against them they will give the loser the cash if they receive them of bankers and can remember where they received them and on whose account such bankers will furnish them with the particulars as they always enter them in their books   0 if a neighboring house is on fire preserve your temper be cool and wary dont be in haste to open your doors and let in the rabble be they as impatient as they may for in fires thieves are always ready to plunder a house and you may lose more that way than any other the insuranceoffices always retain in their service a number of men to attend at fires these may be known by their dress and badge and if you admit any into your house to assist you in removing your property let these be the only people the master of the house should stand at the door himself for that purpose and the goods as removed should be carried to the house of some friend in the neighborhood on the opposite side of the street     the taxes of a house in london are nearly half the rent and are as follow    land tax a tax on the ground paid by the tenant halfyearly but generally allowed by the landlord in the rent if no agreement to the contrary  this is generally four shillings in the pound but in some parishes less than others    a housetax paid to government by the tenant of sixpence ninepence or one shilling in the pound according to the rent the rent in this tax is rated to the full see houses       if the house has a retailshop belonging to it it pays an additional tax of from four shillings to two shillings in the pound according to the rent of the house this to be paid also by the tenant see houses       the poorsrate is another tax but a parochial one paid by the tenant to the overseers of the parish for the maintenance of the poor this is collected every halfyear and the assessment is from one to six shillings in the pound or more according to the number of poor in the parish this assessment is made by the parish officers and ratified by a bench of justices the book with this ratification and the sums each housekeeper is to pay is brought round to every house when the money is collected and each inhabitant may see how much others pay then or at any other time on paying sixpence or a shilling the rent of each house is generally estimated in the parishbook at twothirds of the real rent paid and if any person finds that he pays more in proportion than the rest of the parish he may obtain redress by an application to the quarter sessions at a very little expense  any person occupying any house etc out of which any other person

for repairing the church the countyrate is generally collected with it this is only collected occasionally and may be from threepence in the pound to two or three shillings according to the exigencies required    another rate or assessment is the pavingtax for repairing cleaning and lighting the streets this is one shilling and sixpence in the pound of twothirds of the rent or value    another is for watching them but this is a trifle   0 there is a further call on every householder for easterofferings for the rector or vicar of the parish this is fourpence ahead for every one in each family capable of receiving the sacrament paid once a year at easter but this seldom is collected it is generally lest to each family to give what they please but it is always expected that they give something perhaps a few shillings  once or twice a year the churchwardens generally bring round a book to make a collection for the lecturer or afternoon preacher at this time a housekeeper generally gives a few shillings but this is optional  in some parishes twenty or thirty shillings a year more or less are paid by housekeepers in proportion to their rent in lieu of tithes     a further expense to the inhabitants is the river water with which each house is served from about twentyfour to thirty shillings a year according to the time of serving whether every day or three times a week    the london bridge waterworks supply the city and the greatest part of its liberties with thames water at the rate of from twentyfour to thirty shillings paid halfyearly according to the distance from london bridge the pipes of this company spread all over the city to tower hill snowhill shoreditch and st dunstanschurch fleet street office at london bridge    the yorkbuilding waterworks office in villiersstreet attendance from three in the afternoon till seven supplies westminster and the west end of the town as far as holborn with thames water and will convey the water if desired to the upperstories of a house the second or third story according to their situation the higher the house stands from the water side the less height can they convey the water the prices of the water is the same with the london bridge waterworks only if the water is to be conveyed to the second or third story more money is paid annually from thirty shillings to five pounds the thames water is reckoned softer than that of the new river  if a fire happens in the night application for water from this company and that of london bridge must be made at the respective offices and it will be some time half an hour or more before they can get their engines to work    the newriver company office in dorsetstreet fleet street supplies all london on the north side of the thames from mileend turnpike to hydepark corner with water brought twenty miles from london to a reservoir at islington the terms of this company are rather higher than those of other watercompanies but the water is generally clearer and better they serve families from twentyfour shillings a year to five pounds according to the quantity of water they require which is settled by the collector of the district whose name may be known by applying at the office in dorsetstreet this collector also will furnish families with the names of the turncocks in his district printed on paper to whom application is to be made in cases of fire and in the collectors receipts will be found the place to apply to in want of water and other complaints this company conveys the water to upper stories of houses without any additional expense than the lead pipes which are the property of and must be fixed by the tenant the nearer a house stands to the thames side that is the lower it is from the reservoirs the higher in the houses the water can be conveyed in the new river waterworks the water runs from an eminence in the london bridge and york company it is forced up by fire of course the higher it is conveyed the more money annually is required    there are other waterworks those of chelsea hampstead bayswater shadwell lambeth etc that supply other parts of the town and the borough of southwark with soft water and on nearly the same terms thrales waterworks that supply part of southwark serve so low as  0 s a year    the lead pipes from the main that is from the middle of the street are considered as belonging to the house and must be paid for and kept in repair by the tenant other repairs and expenses are paid by the several companies    attendance is always given at the respective offices from morning till night and complaints immediately redressed it is proper to send to these offices immediately on a fire breaking out especially those that supply the thames water    it is advisable for every housekeeper on first coming to london to apply to the offices for the names of the turncocks and where they live and also to fireoffices for the places where the fireengines are also to the vestryclerks of the different parishes for the places where the ladders are kept and from year to year who are the constables and other parishofficers and to write these down and stick them up in the kitchen or other part of the house that the earliest application in case of fire may be made for every necessary assistance    in frosty weather to secure water to the house is the care and business of the tenant for this purpose fresh horsedung should be laid over the pavement under which the lead pipes pass and some should be wound round the pipe as it crosses the area dung can be had at any of the stables for a trifle and the expense of fetching it in a cart is not much  bakers bread and milk   every peck loaf shall weigh    lb   oz averdupois weight every half peck   lb    oz and every

or two by the way and put the money into their own pockets telling their masters that they left them at such houses the master of course charges the customer for bread he never had and when the bill comes to be paid it perhaps occasions a dispute and the buyer finds himself obliged to pay for it after all to avoid this the best method is never to run a bill with a baker but pay for the bread as it is left or if this be inconvenient order the bill in every monday morning while the occurrences of the week are in the memory these bills examined and filed will prevent your being cheated bakers like milkwomen will sometimes leave tallies on which they daily chalk what is left but a mark is easily added while the servant is inattentive which robs you of the price of a loaf or a pint of milk these marks are sometimes made on the doorpost oftener without the door than within of course an addition can be made unknown to your servant as the baker or milkwoman passes the door or they may be wholly rubbed out by wanton boys or others as is frequently the case and when the score is gone the baker or milkwoman may charge what they please and as they can sell a loaf or a pint of milk to those who pay ready money and secret that money to conceal this fraud from their masters they will score it up to their customers on credit    with respect to milk though sold at   d a quart it is always mixed with water there are cows that are driven into the streets about the west end of the town from which you may have your milk and see it milked at   d a quart but the milk of these is not very good as the cows are driven about all the day yet it is better than what is brought by milkwomen  butchers and meat   it is by no means advisable to deal with one butcher unless you can agree to have all your meat viz beef mutton veal lamb and pork weighed in at one and the same price all the year round which some butchers will do at   d a pound and occasionally give you at the same price a quarter of houselamb if you enter into such an agreement take care to have a bill of the weight always sent home with the meat and order it to be weighed by your own people  if you make no such agreement and deal regularly with one butcher you will frequently be charged for a joint you never had and for half a pound or a quarter of a pound more than the joint weighs and you will always pay a halfpenny or a farthing more per pound than was you to go to market and cheapen it yourself in buying a joint at market of seven pounds and an half you may often deduct the half pound but when sent home by a butcher who credits you never this conduct in a family will occasion a great saving at the years end if you pay your butcher but once a quarter be sure to have a bill of the weight and price sent in with your meat and a regular bill of the weeks meat every monday morning in this case you will see what you are about and not be liable to be imposed upon    good meat should not look lean dry or shrivelled the fleshy part should be of a bright red and the fat of a clear white when the flesh looks pale and the fat yellow the meat is not good cow beef is worth a penny a pound less than ox beef except it be the meat of a maiden heiser in a buttock you may know it by the udder    the average price of beef is from  d a pound to  d the prime boiling parts are the rump buttock edgebone

for  d halfpenny if a boilling piece alone  d if roasting alone  d  if you want rumpsteaks in any quantity it is cheaper to give  d a pound without bone than  d halfpenny for the whole rump a buttock is the cheapest joint as it is free from bone for if you wish it the butcher will sell it you without the marrowbone which is worth its weight for the marrow  in buying a buttock of beef be careful you do not buy the mousebuttock for the prime one the difference is easily known the prime buttock is first cut off the leg and is the thickest the mousebuttock is thinner and cut off the legs between the buttock and the leg bone is coarse meat and not worth so much by one penny a pound  a bullocks tongue will sell from  s to  s  d according to its size and goodness a good tongue should look plump clear and bright not of a blackish hue    the flesh of mutton should be of a bright red and its fat of a clear white and unless it is very fat it is worth little ewe mutton is not worth so much as

butcher sends you any tainted meat he may be fined by complaining to a magistrate but the readiest and least troublesome method of redress is  put up with a trifling loss and deal with such a butche

for epping butter and cream cheese  poultry   poultry of all sorts may be purchased cheape of the higlers at the several markets than at the poulterers shops but of the higlers you must take care what you buy fowls and chickens should be fat plump and white particularly white legged chicken may be known by their size and fowls are young if they have no spurs  by the same marks you may judge of turkeys a large cockturkey at christmas cannot be bought for less than  s or  s at other times  s a hen turkey from  s to  s  d fat crammed chickens about ten weeks old on or about lady day are worth

customers to deal with one man regularly and pay him once or twice a year is as bad as dealing with butchers in the same way a fishmonger near the squares will charge   s   d for a mackrell which may be bought for half the money at charing cross and for onethird of the money from those who cry them about  to such as live convenient billingsgate is the place to buy seafish at whether you want little or much  marketdays there are mondays wednesdays and fridays but marketdays are the dearest days  you may often buy them fresh and forty per cent cheaper on the intermediate days by purchasing at billingsgate you may buy at onethird of the price which fishmongers charge and if you lay out a few shillings it will pay for a person to carry them home fishmongers at this market purchase at break of day and when the market is not glutted they will at those times buy up all the largest fish but there is always sufficient lest to serve private families there is an act of parliament to oblige fishmongers to sell brill bret or mall turbot not exceeding    inches from eye to tail for   d a pound under a penalty of  0 s to the informer for asking more or refusing to weigh or measure it any person may seize the fishmonger and deliver him to a constable to carry him before a justice who will not only fine him but make him return the money    geo   c    but when turbit is in season as

quarter of a hundred for   d or   d a piece mackrell and herrings if fresh will look bright their gills red and their eyes clear mackrell are reckoned cheap at   d or   d each if fish is firm not flabby or slimy the gills ruddy or bleeding and the eyes bright you may depend on it it is fresh but if otherwise not so salmon when cut should look red and bleeding fresh  but put your nose to the gills and you will soon find if it is stale  thames salmon is always double the price of other salmon not that it is better tasted but being later out of the water it can be crimped which gives it a firmness the price of seasalmon is from   d to   s a pound  lobsters and crabs should always be bought alive  those of the middling size are always the best no overgrown animal food is delicious  the

fresh in london twice a week and is within one penny or a halfpenny a pound as dear as fresh but the best way for a family is to buy a half firkin which weighs    lb of the best yorkshire butter  this may be bought for    s or    s the half firkin less than   d a pound and may be bought agreeable to the palate of the buyer but when you taste it taste a piece on the outside next the tub if this is good and free from any rankness you may be certain the middle is but the middle shall often be sweet when the outsides are rank and buttermen knowing this always give a taste out of the middle the dorsetshire butter in tubs with broad hoops weight about  0 lb rather fetches the best price but for keeping it is the best butter    bad butter is not to be mixed with good on pain of forfeiting double the value buyers of butter should set their mark on the tub etc and if the sellers open the tubs or put in other butter after the tubs are thus marked they are liable to a penalty of  0 s for

three years provided it be kept dry families who like good old cheese should buy it one year under another as they do their wine etc old cheese good for any thing can seldom be met with and if it is cheesemongers ask a large price for it cheese a year and a half old of the best dairies and the best is always the most delicious and in the end the cheapest can be bought from   d halfpenny a pound

choice of servants a housekeeper cannot be too particular london is so much the sink of vice that the lower class of people are very much corrupted those brought from the country are soon infected with the dissolute manners of townservants and become equally bad with them to expect attachment from a servant is idle and betrays an ignorance of the world servants will now and then affect it in order to gain the confidence of their employers and thus forward their own interest but if we suppose them in our interest it is because we do not thoroughly know them economy in a family servants do not like the more extravagant a master or mistress is the better they live and the more they can purloin and should what they call a generous master or mistress fail in the world owing to a waste or an inattention to domestic concerns they will cry to their fellow servants it is a pity he was a goodnatured generous man  come let us go look for another place this being considered we are to expect nothing from them but a performance of their duty keep them whilst they do it and discharge them when they neglect it    the first thing then is to endeavor to get good ones if we do not bring them out of the country with us there are in different parts of the town registeroffices or places where servants of all denominations attend at certain hours and where a master may see them at the expense of one shilling and hire them or by sending a shilling to the keepers of such offices and a description of the servant wanted they will send you one day after day till you are suited but as it is the refuse of servants in general that apply to these offices you must not take the recommendation of the officekeeper who is paid also by the servant for procuring the place nor any written character for such things in london are procured from friends and often orged nay servants of bad character will often go further they will refer you to persons seemingly of credit who perhaps know little of them it is proper therefore that the master or mistress should apply for the character themselves make some enquiry concerning the person they apply to and ask all those questions they think necessary there are few servantmaids in london or indeed in the country but what are whores it is perhaps an uncharitable supposition but it is nevertheless true to expect therefore to meet with an innocent virtuous girl is next to impossible it is sufficient if she is orderly and conducts herself with decorum if a housekeeper cannot get a servant recommended by a friend or some tradesman with whom he deals such as the baker butcher poulterer greengrocer tallowchandler publican or the like i would recommend papers describing the servant wanted and where to apply being sent or left at the chandlers shops in the neighborhood which seldom fails of success others will have recourse to advertisements in the public newspapers an insertion for which once costs   s   d if this mode is adopted the best paper to advertise in is the daily advertiser in fleet street which is taken in by almost all the publicans in london such an advertisement will bring you scores of servants and here you must be very careful in your choice and particular as to character for an advertisement will bring with the good a number of disreputable people    the general wages of servants are as follow  steward valet butler  0 l a year womencooks   l ladysmaids from    l to  0 l inferior women servants from   l to   l footmen    l and a livery womenservants to provide their own tea and sugar  boardwages of an upper servant  0 s   d a week with fire and candle and   s a week to an underservant    they generally agree for a months wages or a months warning which is a bad method as there are few servants when warning is given but will be very impertinent and untractable it is far the best when you mean to part with them to get rid of them at once be it ever so inconvenient by enquiry an honest chairwoman to supply the place of a womanservant may be procured for   s a day if such are hired to wash their wages are larger   s   d with tea and a dram twice a day and strong beer at dinner and supper but for this they slave hard will begin work at two in the morning and continue it till nine the next evening if such a person is wanted employ none of your own servants recommending but apply for their character to those housekeepers who have employed them and on whom you can better rely    women cooks and servants of all work when they hire themselves will endeavor to get the kitchenstuff allowed them as a perquisite if you would not be robbed never comply with this nor allow your coachman the old wheels for as the one will to serve herself strip your meat of its fat melt more butter than necessary and convey the ends of candles etc into the greasepot to increase its weight so will the other often injure the wheels if they are likely to last too long    if you deliver into the custody of servants plate china linen etc to keep and tell them before witness they must be responsible for it if they lose any part of it the law will oblige them as far as they are able to make it good but not else to enable them therefore to pay for any thing missing it is advisable to keep part of their wages in hand as they are hired by the year they should always be paid one half year under another reserving halfayear in hand as to breaking of china etc you cannot compel a servant to pay for it unless it was so agreed on the hiring or done designedly    to avoid disputes respecting wages it is prudent to have the agreement in writing and a receipt for what you pay for sorry am i to say it this class of people make as little ceremony of taking a false oath where there is no proof to the contrary as of telling a lie  disputes with servants about wages under 0 l and other things if they cannot amicably be settled should be referred to a neighboring magistrate who is authorized to hear the complaint and redress it the expense but trifling but the wages of coachmen grooms and the like magistrates can take no cognizance of    where servants are hired for a year they cannot be put away before the expiration of that term without some reasonable cause to be allowed by one justice nor after the end of the term without a quarters warning given before witness if a master discharges a servant otherwise he is liable to a penalty of  0 s    eliz c    if a servant refuse to serve his term he may be committed till he give security to serve the time or he may be sent to the house of correction and punished there as a disorderly person   eliz c     jac c    a yearly servant is not to be discharged by reason of sickness or any other disability by the act of god not may his wages for those causes be abated dalt     all hiring without stipulation of time is strictly speaking hiring for a year and the law so construes it  both master and servant may however part by mutual consent and then the allowance of the cause by a justice of peace is not necessary a masters detaining wages or not allowing sufficient meat drink etc is good cause for a servants departure but it must be allowed by a justice dalt  if a servant hired for a term quits his service before the end of his term he loses all his wages but if the master puts him away he shall be paid to the time he served  a womanservant who marries is obliged to serve out her time and if both man and wife agree to serve they must perform the agreement dalt     if a servant be retained for a year according to the statute   eliz c   and the master die within that time the executor must pay the wages but not so if the retainer was not for a year  a servant hired at a months wages or a months warning cannot quit his place nor be discharged a day before the expiration of the month without the whole months wages be paid unless by the authority of a justice for some reasonable complaint if a servant after warning given is insolent or refuses to do his duty a magistrate on complaint will commit him to prison for the time he has to serve but the master will be ordered to pay him his wages whilst there    if a servant or workman assault his master or mistress or any other having charge over them he may be bound to his good behavior or be committed for a year or less at the discretion of two magistrates   eliz c   s      0 if any servant shall purloin or make away with his masters goods to the value of  0 s it is felony     ann c       should a woman with child procure herself to be retained with a master for a term who knows nothing thereof this is good cause to discharge her from her service if she prove with child during her service it is the same but if he does not discharge her before a magistrate when he knows of it and keeps her on he must provide for her till her delivery and one month after and then she is to be sent to her place of settlement dalt     a servant setting fire

or shall assign some other substantial cause satisfactory to the commissioners ibid s     all masters or mistresses must accompany their lists with a declaration whether they mean to pay for any and how many servants in any other place or parish and to specify in what place or places s     as this is an annual tax if a person keeps at any one time two servants for example and enters these two

court of kings bench as in the act on windows which see s           if you never deal with tradesmen upon credit should your servants to whom you give money to purchase things put the money in their pockets and order them to be set down to you you are not obliged to pay for them but if you sometimes send money and sometimes deal upon credit though you should send the money for any article if your servant does not pay it you will be obliged to pay it again for your tradesman cannot be supposed to know whether the money was sent or not     if you would avoid being robbed never suffer your servants to take acquaintances down into the kitchen with them many instances have occurred where villains have made acquaintance with incautious servants purposely to find a method of breaking into the house and learning what there is worth coming for     to save trouble to the master and servants where many are not kept it is a good method to have in your sitting room near the bell a paper posted with the necessary articles on it in divisions that are chiefly wanted such as coals candles beer water broom lay the cloth go to the door etc with a pin to which a line is fixed with a lead going down into the kitchen to a similar paper fixed there then by fixing this pin in a hole in either of the divisions above the weight will drop or rise to the same division below do this before you ring your bell and order your servant to look at the index she will then know what is wanted before she comes and bring it with her the expense of this index is trifling     it may also in some families be worth while to have a line from the parlour to the street door to open it without going out of the parlour this where there is but one servant saves a great deal of trouble  a table to

and attend to the names of the streets and courts which are always painted on a board against the houses at the corner of each street or court    if you wish to walk safe never pass under any goods etc that are drawing up to the top of a house by a crane nor pass a house where the bricklayers are at work lest any thing should fall on your head it is advisable on such occasions to cross the way and if you would save your clothes never pass under a lamp whilst the lamplighter is triming it nor go near any rails etc fresh painted or contest the way with a baker barber chimneysweeper barrowwoman etc    if the wall or houses are on your right hand keep the wall and you will have no interruption every one will give way    but dont dispute the wall with a cart or carriage lest you should be crushed    never stop in a crowd or to look at the windows of a printshop or shewglass if you would not have your pocket picked    do not walk under a penthouse lest persons watering flowerpots or other slops should drop upon your head    be careful if you meet a porter carrying a load upon his head that you do not get a blow that may be fatal    if you walk with an umbrella and meet a similar machine lower yours in time lest you either break it or get entangled with the other    one side of the way is generally shady it is not necessary perhaps to recommend crossing to the shady side in sultry weather or keeping to windward when the dust flies   0 in wet weather look where you step if you would not be splashed dont tread on a loose stone     dont hastily cross a street when a coach is coming up lest your foot should slip and you be run over     in frosty weather it is advisable to walk in the coachways which are not so slippery as the footpaths and to bind a piece of clothlist round one of your shoes it will save you many a fall     it is very dangerous walking in a thick fog as you cannot see the danger before you people who walk in london should always look before them both above and below     it would be prudent for the men to have their coatpockets open in the lining within this will often prevent them from being picked at least every one should attend

impositions and insults   persons traveling to or from london should be careful not to take too much money with them bank postbills made payable to the holder or order is the safest conveyance for these are of no value till indorsed by the person they are made payable to and if lost as the bank does not pay them till seven days after sight there is time to give notice of the loss    trunks etc should not be fastened behind carriages unless with chains or unless servants ride behind and will attend to them till they are ten or twelve miles from the metropolis for there are thieves frequently waiting at the outskirts of the town particularly in the evening to cut such luggage from behind    if trunks boxes or packages are to be sent by coaches or wagons into the country it is prudent to let some person be present at the packing up as a witness of the contents and to take a list of what the trunk etc contains this person should then take it to the warehouse of the coach or wagon himself and deliver it to the bookkeeper see it booked and pay for the booking which is   d in this case if it be lost you will be able to prove the contents and recover the value from the owner of the coach or wagon see stagecoaches      but let your servant be very careful not to leave the trunk etc with any person standing at the door of the inn or in the innyard but to enquire for the bookkeeper and not part with his load till he can deliver it into the custody of the bookkeeper and see it booked on this account the porter should be able to read writing to know what he is about rogues are very often about innyards to case such messengers of their loads    such persons as you send with parcels from one part of the town to another should be cautioned not to be led into a public house by the way to drink with any supposed countryman nor to suffer any goodnatured person in the street to give them a hand and help them on the way with their bundle or load for there are many of these obliging people in london streets that when they get possession of the bundle etc will run away with it    if you hire a basketwoman at market or a porter to carry any thing for you home which you may have bought tell such person where they are to carry it and make them walk before you all the way your eye will then be upon them and if they slip away from you it will he your own fault if it be inconvenient to attend them employ no such person but whom you know or is known to the person with whom you deal but if you buy of a shopkeeper they will always send the goods home    never stop in a crowd in the streets to see what occasions it if you do it is two to one but you either lose your watch or your pockethandkerchief there are fellows who create disturbances for this purpose    never carry any banknotes or bills about you without first entering in some book at home the number and date and particulars of such notes that in case you lose them or your pocket is picked of your book you stand some chance of recovering them or stop the payment    also enter in some book at home the number makers name etc and description of your watch and whatever else of value you carry about you that you may know how to describe it if lost   0 never part with such articles out of your hands to persons you are unacquainted with     if you would walk safe you would always avoid crowds stopping to look at the pictures in a printshop etc see p     no          if by chance you should drop any thing of value in the street whilst you are looking for it you will have many ask you what you have lost and offer to assist you in the search tell them it is nothing of any consequence if you acquaint them you are likely never to find it as they will probably find it for you and keep it     give directions to your servants on no condition to deliver any thing from your house to a stranger under a pretense of your having sent for it for instance a great coat or any other thing there are always villains ready to take advantage of their ignorance     for the same reason never let them take in a parcel for you under an idea that it came by such a carriage if they are to pay any thing for it for such packages have been sound to contain nothing but brickbats etc in short never let them pay any thing without your knowledge or order so to do to any one persons bringing things will often take the money before hand and ask for it again at the house they carry it to     before you get into a hackneycoach or chair always take the number as if you leave any thing therein you may then by summoning the coachman or chairman to the hackneycoach office probably recover it they may say they never saw it and possibly their next fare might find it and take it possibly so this is a lie for they always look when they set down a fare before they shut the door to be truly safe in this matter every one should look round the coach or chair before they quit it     thieves have lately made a practice of knocking at doors in an evening under a pretense of delivering a letter and when the door is open if in a retired place have rushed in in numbers and robbed the family to avoid this a chain should be always put across the door within so as to admit the door to open a little way before dusk and the door not opened to a stranger but the letter if any taken in     if you do not sit in your frontparlour in an evening take care the windows are fastened down for men have been known to enter a house this way secret themselves till the family is asleep and then rob the house or they have robbed that room only while the family have been backwards and decamped the same way     if the house next door to you is empty be cauous and fasten your backdoors and insideshutters of the upper windows for villains will now and then secret themselves in such empty houses and in the night get into the adjoining house by the backdoors or windows or from the leads your garretwindows therefore should always be secured and trapdoors opening to the leads well bolted     before you come out of any playhouse or place of public entertainment take care to secure your watch and your pockets for pickpockets are always about at such places   0 never suffer any beggars to be begging at your door particularly if you live in any retired place for under a pretense of begging if they see no one in the way they will be sure to rob you of something     do not suffer yourself to be imposed on by beggars in the streets for they have all their arts and will affect distress to excite your humanity if you have any thing to give it would be best bestowed to poor distressed families it is a mistaken charity to give to beggars in the streets whom the laws have provided for     auctions in great thoroughfares in the daytime where men stand at the door and invite passengers are great impositions slight illmade goods are made up for such auctions and if you buy it is ten to one but you are cheated and give twice the value of the article purchased never buy at an auction but where the auctioneer is known to be a reputable man at auctions of linendrapery they will put perhaps sufficient painted muslin for a gown and a piece of dowlas worth   d a yard and sell the two at one price per yard from an opinion that there may not be above thirty yards of dowlas you bid accordingly but when measured there shall be sixty of course you are deceived and cheated     for the same reason never buy at a pawnbrokers such articles as they display at their windows for a notion of buying things cheap has drawn many to buy at these places and this has led the pawnbrokers to get things made up purposely for sale in a slight manner half the things at their windows are new and sold as secondhand     indeed in purchasing it will be always sound best to purchase of and employ people of credit though you pay rather a greater price for they have a character at stake and will use you well in hopes of having your custom in future but if you buy in general of those who undersell the fair trader and advertise things at a very low price depend upon it unless you are a very good judge of the articles you buy and take especial care you will be taken in     people in distress are always wanting to borrow money and hold out advantageous terms in advertisements to lenders be ever on your guard in this matter and also against those who publicly by advertisement offer to raise money on securities they will get the securities into their hands such as bonds notes etc and will frequently shuffle you out of them to these the public have given the denomination of swindlers if you are in trade be cautious how you are taken in by customers you are a stranger to there are a number of people in town who live by getting goods on credit and taking in the incautious shopkeeper     be very circumspect and cautious of having any thing to do with notes of hand or accepted drafts drawn by people you are unacquainted with for it is by such modes that the unwary are duped and robbed of their property     if you keep an open shop never suffer a stranger to leave a parcel in your shop under a pretense of having further to go and wishing it to be taken care of till his return unless you know the contents of the parcel men have been known to leave contraband goods in this manner and go and inform against the shopkeeper in order to get the penalty in like manner a sack of unroasted coffee has been left at a grocers and he has been exchequered in consequence of it     never step in between persons quarrelling in the street unless you choose to have your pocket picked these are often shamquarrels to collect people together for the opportunity of plundering them     any one may arrest a felon even without a warrant   0 where persons by fraud in gaming win above  0 l they shall forfeit five times the value and suffer such corporal punishment as in cases of wilful perjury   ann c        shopkeepers should be on their guard against persons coming in and looking over a great quantity of goods without purchasing sharpers often making a genteel appearance will take an opportunity on these occasions when the shopkeepers back is turned to pilser and purloin     in return buyers should always be careful that they are not imposed on by shopkeepers for they will often survey you from head to foot and ask a price according to their customer they will often ask  0 s for an article at a coachside which they will sell for to a person on foot for half the money     shopkeepers who have the reputation of selling cheap will evidently do so in some small articles the price of which every buyer is acquainted with but they take care to bring up the leeway as the seamans phrase is and make you pay handsomely in other things in short every tradesman must live and there are such numbers of the same profession in london that they are obliged to make use of a variety of artifices to get custom and the buyer with all his cleverness and care shall not often be able to avoid being taken in     it often happens that if a parcel is sent in from the country by a wagon and ordered to be left till called for and you send for it that they will tell you no such thing is brought and then the porter of the inn will bring it in order to get a shilling or two in this case give him nothing but before you give him to understand so take possession of it otherwise he will take it back again should this fellow by way of revenge if any game is sent you and not ordered to be delivered not bring it and it spoils and the master of the wagon does not discharge him summon the master to the court of conscience for the value of the thing spoilt and you will be never served so again porters of inns are in general very exorbitant in their demands and very insolent if they ask too much for bringing a thing never pay it but tell them they may take it back again and you will send for it     persons would do well to be careful of their hats in public companies for want of such care many a person has brought home an old hat for a new one there are welllooking men who will take an opportunity to exchange with you i knew a gentleman who always preserved his hat by pasting a paper n the inside the crown on which he wrote his name and the words stolen from over it canes and great coats are at times in similar danger  see tailors page    and walking london streets page     if the reader is desirous of a farther insight into the arts deceptions and frauds of the different professions he cannot read a more useful work for this purpose than a novel in three volumes lately published under the patronage of the literary society called modern times or the

great humor and by one who has apparently a thorough knowledge of life   there is a society of tradesmen etc instituted in      for the protection of their property against the inroads of felons forgers cheats etc and to save the charges of prosecutions rewards and advertisements which are paid out of the public stock raised annually at five shillings each member which subscription though small has not only been found sufficient for the purposes intended but has enabled the society to vest a sum in the funds besides leaving a considerable balance in the treasurers hands  the intent of this society is to prevent as far as possible the losses which tradesmen and others frequently suffer from the depredations of those miscreants who get their infamous livelihoods by robbing plundering and defrauding the honest and industrious part of mankind and to pursue the most vigorous and effectual methods to bring such offenders to justice as they frequently escape the punishment their crimes deserve through the inability timidity avarice or indolence of those they injure which encourages them to continue their malpractices although such persons ought in duty to themselves and the public in general to use their utmost endeavors to put a stop to the career of such villains as otherwise they are in some measure by their omission the cause of the next robbery or fraud they commit  the secretary who is a mr j leigh of shepherdscourt upper brookstreet grosvenorsquare is empowered to receive subscriptions  where there are two or more partners in trade if five shillings only be subscribed they are entitled to the benefit of this society when goods the joint property of the partners are stolen or obtained from them by fraud but not in cases of robbery on the highway or other robberies of their separate private property unless each partner subscribes five shillings  when any of the society is robbed or defrauded he is immediately to apply to one of the committee whose names are given in a printed list and who will take such steps to pursue advertise or otherwise as shall be thought proper on the occasion  courts of conscience are established in different parts of

issues and when the time elapses in which the whole debt is paid the plaintiff applies to the court for his money and receives it on paying a few pence     the plaintiffs and defendants in these courts are in general people so very low that a gentleman would sooner lose  0 s than attend them if he is a defendant it is best to get some person to attend for him if plaintiff and can prove his demand he may even then get some person to apply for him but if he cannot prove his debt otherwise than by his own oath he should attend himself for if he has no other proof the plaintiffs oath is always sufficient of course it is better in these courts to be plaintiff than defendant for if the plaintiff swears to his debt no oath of the defendant will avail him     in order to recover in these

court are paid always in advance as the process goes on  the verge of the court is that ground about white hall and st jamess which belongs to the crown and which is privileged from arrests this privileged place includes charing cross on the north side of the way from the corner of st martinslane to hedgelane and both the kings meuses on the south side from the street leading into springgardens to the public house beyond the treasury and all springgardens on the opposite side of the way from northumberlandhouse to the end of privygarden in parliamentstreet taking in all scotlandyard whitehall and privygarden it further includes all the parks the stableyard st jamess clevelandcourt and all hydepark except the mere crossing from the greenpark to hydepark most houses in the verge let lodgings and i knew an artful fellow once that eluded all his creditors by residing there if he wanted to go out of it he took water at whitehallstairs which place is privileged and as no writ can be served on the water without a waterbailiffs warrant which cannot be immediately procured he would land safely in the city or on the surry side for a middlesex writ loses its force in the city and in surry unless backed by a city or surry magistrate which requires time and preparation to get done so that if he landed in surry he might take his horse and ride to the landsend or he would occasionally walk through the parks and order his horse to wait for him on the opposite side by this means he constantly eluded the sheriffs officers who could not be in every place or eternally watching him    to prevent this in some measure the board of green cloth who has the control of the verge will on application to them at st jamesspalace summon the debtor to meet the plaintiff before them and the gentlemen there presiding will examine into the nature of the complaint enquire of the person then summoned what prospect he has of paying the debt and if his proposals of discharging it by instalments or in a limited period be approved they will suffer him to continue in the verge but if they find him disposed to act fraudulently they will tell him that the verge shall not shelter him and if he does not immediately quit it they will order him to be arrested by their own officer but let the case be as it will they always give him notice to quit the place and give him a reasonable time to do it in but if he can make interest with any of the gentlemen of the board he meets with favor there as a man does in all situations of life    a sheriffsofficer arresting a man in the verge will be punished by an application to the board of green cloth and the person arrested will be discharged the board or those who discharge the office of that board sit two or three times a

where you may be rather better accommodated than at the inns in and about london but at a much greater expense the inns and many coffeehouses for all the coffeehouses are now lodginghouses and taverns will let you a lodging at one shilling or eighteenpence a night whereas these hotels charge   s   d or   s a night according to the goodness of the apartment and   s a day for the use of a parlour or dining room two shillings a day for fire   s ahead for breakfast and for your dinner according to what you order as dear as at the most expensive tavern here indeed a gentleman may take his family for a few days till he can procure a lodging which he cannot do at a coffeehouse nor so well at an inn for want of proper accommodations and the servants of all these houses are very extravagant in their expectations which you must accordingly gratify if you wish to be well attended  hairdressers at these hotels charge   s each time of dressing out of which the master of the hotel has a profit whereas at inns and coffeehouses they will dress for   d  foreigners and strangers should be aware how they employ tailors or other tradesmen recommended by masters of hotels for they have a feeling in every
