right honorable george henry earl of litchfield my lord addresses of this nature which are too often fulsom offerings to vanity or servile applications to power when made to persons of real worth and honor are at the same time compliments artfully paid by authors to themselves while the writer is descanting upon the high birth inflexible probity patriot spirit humane disposition and the polite and literary accomplishments of his patron he insinuates himself into the good opinion of his reader as one favored with the acquaintance and honored by the countenance and regard of a person thus amiable and illustrious i shall not pretend my lord wholly to disclaim all views of this kind in the present address i have the honor to make to you and accordingly should take a particular pleasure in enlarging upon the above and other shining qualities in your lordships character did i not recollect that i have no right to gratify the public or myself at the expense of your lordships private and personal satisfaction  indeed it is my present interest rather to engage your lordships favorable opinion of the following performances and i know nothing more likly to do this than an assurance that i have aimed by a suitable variety to adapt myself to almost all sorts of readers but immoral ones that in some pieces i have attempted to render the graces of numbers and the embellishments of poetry subservient to the interests of virtue and religion that in others i have offered such critical disquisitions as i hope will afford at least a rational entertainment to men of taste in polite literature and that in them all i have endeavored occasionally to express myself with dignity elegance and ease which by the way are not more the characteristics of good writing than of the air manner and conversation of a certain nobleman i have the honor to be known to i look upon myself as apologizing to the public when i am speaking to your lordship and therefore have said thus much from a perfect sense of the consequence it must be to me as an author to secure your lordships approbation of my writings  the dedication of these to your lordship will after all i fear be thought a trifling proof of my respect and therefore i desire it may however be considered as a sincere testimony of my gratitude for the many favors you have been pleased to confer on me the most material of which have been attended with this circumstance of credit and satisfaction that they are to be attributed to your lordships free and unsolicited kindness and condescension  the obligations i am under to your lordship are not of a nature to be mentioned here but this opportunity of expressing a due acknowledgment of them in the most ample and public manner is with the greatest pleasure taken by  my lord your lordships much obliged most respectful and obedient servant w hawkins  the thimble  an heroicomical poem in five cantos  illustrated with notes critical and explanatory by scriblerus secundus  virginibus puerisque canto hor the third edition corrected and enlarged  to miss anna maria woodford madam as the subject of the following poem naturally led me to inscribe it to one of your sex i could not but hope that the justness of the present address from one who has not the happiness to be personally known to you would be a sufficient apology for the presumption of it but though i may have the misfortune to incur your displeasure by offending your humility i shall even under the sense of your disapprobation have the satisfaction to reflect that i have been guilty of a very artful piece of impertinence since by placing your name before my performance i have taken the most effectual method to recommend it to the public  your example madam is a reproach to the present indolent generation your glory is not established upon the personal advantages you possess in so eminent a manner which great as they are your good sense assures you are at the best but the subjects of present admiration and can never be the basis of a lasting fame  your handiwork madam which has very justly a place among the curiosities of that famous university of which i have the honor and happiness to be an inconsiderable member has rendered your name immortal and your nice management of the needle that little but important implement of economy has entitled you to the reputation of the compleatest housewife in europe a character to which all virgins and wives should aspire  you have taught us to acknowledge that the most minute utensil of art may by an ingenious application of it be made subservient in the highest degree to the honor of the artist a pin or a needle in your hands are instruments as effectual for that purpose as the poets pen or the heros sword  i am at present madam in a very perplexed situation of mind i have the pleasure to consider that i am now upon a subject that must be agreeable to all my readers and at the same time have the mortification to recollect that it is distasteful to yourself  though therefore all i could say in commendation of your merit the world would think too little yet as what i have said you will think too much i find myself under a necessity of desiring your pardon for this liberty i have taken and for another in the fourth canto of this poem wherein i have presumed to put a short prediction relating to your amiable character into the mouth of the queen of love this i need not otherwise have intimated since every one must at first sight perceive that this prediction is properly applicable to none but yourself  after what i have said madam may i venture to hope you have some patience in reserve for the poem twas designed for your amusement and if that design be answered my ambition is satisfied and indeed to say truth i have so thorough a confidence in your good nature that i am persuaded you will look with a favorable eye upon the following performance though not in justice yet in pity to  your unknown humble servant the author  the preface i have always considered a preface as an authors apology for his performance in which he has an undoubted liberty of saying as much as he pleases in favor of himself as i cannot therefore but be apprehensive of the success of the following piece i must beg leave to take this comfortable privilege as well as my poetical brethren the principal circumstances i have to urge in my own behalf are that this poem is the first production of a young and unexperienced author excepting a few trifling pieces in the magazines and that i am so far from bidding defiance to the critics that i address myself to them in the modest and submissive terms of by your leave  gentlemen  as to the poem itself i have endeavored in some particular passages to imitate the manner of mr popes rape of the lock upon a presumption that such imitation would be deemed meritorious in so young a writer as myself i ought likewise to acknowledge that i had in view the episode of the patten in mr gays trivia how far i have reached the spirit required in this kind of poetry must be left to the reader to whose candor and judgment i submit the following poem  the thimble the thimble etc the author by this simple title of his poem has very judiciously escaped the censure which most modern poets have incured by their affectation of antiquity in their titlepages this excellent poem might with as much propriety have been called the thimblead or the thimbleiad as mr popes was entitled the dunciad but such imitation appeared trifling and obvious to our author and at best had been malapropos and nothing to the point  of a needle  i wish however i could as well account for his calling it an heroicomical poem rather than an heroic one which i take it indisputably to be it has its action its fable its manners its sentiment and its diction which are the constituent parts of the epic poem and though in respect of all these it may in some instances differ from the plan of the ancients and the doctrine of aristotle i cannot think it thereby degraded into a different and lower species of poetry mr addison himself allows aristotles rules for epic poetry which he has drawn from his reflections upon homer cannot be supposed to quadrate exactly with the heroic poems which have been or may be made since his time see spec no     for this reason it would be ridiculous to object to the action of this poem its deficiency in point of greatness or importance  a supposed necessary qualification in the action of the epopee and indeed admitting it so to be the objection is founded in false and improper ideas of greatness and importance and in the wrong impressions made upon minds of a romantic turn by the exploits of ancient heroes and the manners and customs of barbarous and uncivilized nations because what was a proper subject for epic poetry in the days of homer or virgil would be shocking and absurd in so refined and delicate an age as this the action of this poem is abundantly important for these times of genteel indolence and superb tranquillity and the author all the while instead of dropping his acquaintance with the ancients artfully makes use of it upon many occasions without a possibility of giving offense to any fine lady or gentleman by such robust and indelicate imagery as that with which the old epic abounds  we shall occasionally show in the course of our criticisms that he rarely in any respect deviates from the ancient plan without improving it  what has been already advanced will justify likewise his making a lady the principal personage in the poem  if female characters are respectable even in the writings of homer and virgil decency sure propriety and complaisance required they should have the first place in the poem before us  thus much we thought necessary to premise in general we shall proceed to farther remarks as they are suggested by the poem itself  canto i what art divine what art divine etc the moral of an epic poem may be either positively laid down or virtually couched in what the critics call the exordium that of the iliad of homer is clearly expressed in the proposition of the action of the poem those of the odyssey and of the aeneid are implicitly contained in their respective exordiums the plan of the thimble which in its moral is inferior to neither of them is formed upon industry and its rewards as is sufficiently intimated in these first lines of the poem the shining thimble found to shield the finger militant around now first my verse reveals ye virgins hear attend ye matrons and ye belles give ear for you the infant muse essays to sing for you she flutters on her tender wing to you the tributary strains belong then popes new dunciad line   take at once the poet and the song when womans chief concerns were love and play and trifling was the business of the day when few one hour of precious time could spare to mend an apron or to say a prayer fannia the fairest of the female train that shone at court or blessed the rural plain in the nice toils of industry was skilled and knew with art the needle spear to wield whether she worked the gaylyblooming flower or drew in ductile silk the verdant bower here glowed the spangled firmament on high and all the glories of the azure sky here wide expanded blazed the bright abodes and jove enthroned etc as this is the first place where the name of a superior being occurs in this work it may be proper to obviate the exceptions or rather the cavils which a few superstitious or illnatured judges may be apt to make to the machinery of the poem which consists of the gods and goddesses of the old pagan theology it might be sufficient to stop the mouths of such to observe that poets are of no religion and that by virtue of the prerogative poetical the poetica licentia an author may adopt what system he pleases it is true mr addison banishes the heathen deities from all modern poetry except the mockheroic spec no     but then he passed this sentence at a time when christianity was generally we may presume practiced as well as formally established among us a sentence therefore that by no means affects our author as things are now happily circumstanced our bard will certainly pass for a good protestant with the beaumonde and need not fear offending the religion of his country as that great critic expresses it spec no     and indeed i cannot see why his pagan system should not be universally received as it not only stands clear of all popish errors but likewise has in some respects reformed the old theology of homer himself which we shall have an opportunity to show and jove enthroned above his vassal gods for pallas self had deigned to assist the fair and more than human workmanship was there sometimes she copied from the earth below the spotted lapdog or the flaming beau or formed the bird or shaped the slender tree a whole creation in epitome imitations envy itself was dumb etc envy itself is dumb in wonder lost and factions strive which shall applaud em most mr addisons campaign  envy itself was dumb in wonder lost and ladies strove which should applaud her most each morn she worked but worked with nicest care to save her finger from the fatal scar for yet no armor cased the flesh around but plaits of silk or sevnfold paper bound unhappy fannia that was wont to wield the pointed spear without the bossy shield thrice happy fannia in the gift bestowed the thimble shield the labor of a god but now her charms had swelled the trump of fame and spread to distant teatables her name each cringing fop around her smiles implored admired her genius but her face adored each sighed and wept and vowed her love to gain but each had sighed and wept and vowed in vain for fannia triumphed in her beautys arts and viewed with scorn whole hecatombs of hearts yet most respected etc the character of fannia the heroine of the poem having been before sufficiently displayed to the reader in the picture of an industrious coquet the author next proceeds in a most lively manner to particularize that of her favorite cynthio the second person in the thimble  both these characters are truly epic in the laying down which the poet as mr pope well observes of homer rather studied nature than perfection see the note at v     of popes iliad b i the characters of a fine gentleman and lady though they be not morally beautiful as the same excellent writer observes in regard to the character of homers hero are still poetically perfect yet most respected was a wellbred lord and most respected as he best adored his soft address the coldest dame might move smooth were his words for every word was love loaded with lace and decked in silken state he strutted insignificantly great affected pomp and equipage and show and all the nothings that compound a beau he danced and sung took snuff and cracked a fan and at the best but bordered upon man flambeaux perfumed wide blazed his gay approach and wanton cupids breathed upon his coach imitations o liberty thou goddess heavenly bright profuse of bliss and pregnant with delight eternal pleasures in thy presence reign and smiling plenty leads thy wanton train eased of her load subjection grows more light and poverty looks cheerful in thy sight thou make the gloomy face of nature gay givst beauty to the sun and pleasure to the day  o vanity thou gaudy tinsel queen in courts in cities and in country seen eternal foppries in thy presence reign and grinning folly leads thy wanton train eased of it is load even dullness grows more light and ignorance looks cheerful in thy sight thou make the unmeaning face with pride to glow givst brightness to the fool and beauty to the beau gay cynthio daily kneeled at venus shrine and burnt sweet incense to the power benign often too he craved apollos rhyming art for tuneful numbers melt the hardest heart the godhead halfconsented to his prayer the rest the winds dispersed through fields of air and gave him wit enough  to please the fair and now the enamored bard half wit half fool wooes in lovesongs melodiously dull his sweettund strains the fair ones praise rehearse and crowd all natures beauties in his verse does fannia smile the sun breaks forth to view does fannia weep it is mornings pearly dew whenever she breathes the fanning zephyrs blow and for her breast the alps sustain their snow compared with here is the finest tinctures fail the lilly reddens and the rose turns pale thus his warm suit the beau with art addressed and proudly triumphed to be slighted least twas rapture but to gain one balmy kiss and fondly flutter round the brink of bliss full of herself his wishes she denied a womans ruling passion is her pride enough impartial favors to bestow on her loved lapdog etc the third earthly personage mentioned in the poem is a lapdog in respect of which creature and the parrot etc etc it will be doing justice to our author to remark once for all that as the subject of his poem would not on account chiefly of the shortness of the action admit of a considerable variety of human characters he was under a necessity of introducing some persons not strictly epic mr addison has observed that none of the critics either ancient or modern have laid down rules to circumscribe the action of an epic poem with any determined number of years days or hours spec no      milton labored under a like difficulty and found means to extricate himself by bringing into his poem actors of a nature purely fictitious and allegorical and surely if sin and death have been by the critics esteemed proper personages in that poem dogs and kittens which are real though subordinate personages may be allowed a place in the company of gentlemen and ladies with a proviso that they do not interrupt conversation  after all the apology may be needless for the present state of the epopee agreeably to the above representation of it requires the assistance of these animals as much as the ancient did that of horses etc etc on her loved lapdog and her favorite beau thus blessed with every joy this life can boast the ladies wonder and the coxcombs toast what could the fair ones peace of mind annoy what could such solid happiness destroy but ah no human pleasures are sincere is there an eye that never shed a tear fate rules over all at whose severe decree over the rich gown flow deluges of tea fate hurls the mighty down to deep disgrace and plows with lasting scars the smoothest face over all things mortal acts with lawless will and fannia was alas but mortal still when now the morn etc here the action of the poem properly commences which takes up but two entire days in which space of time however are comprised a number of striking and interesting incidents when now the morn had chased the shades away o fatal morn and inauspicious day fannia arose and hailed the grateful light shocked at the horrid visions of the night yet still strange terrors all her thoughts molest and apprehension labored in her breast then betty with dejected look she cried three times on betty called and three times sighed some sad mischance awaits me ever the sun once more his course from east to west shall run fantastic slumbers etc  fantastic slumbers have disturbed my brain and racked my senses with a wakeful pain and mystic dreams as bearded matrons show are good prognostics or the types of woe sure at this hour some baleful planet reigns did thou not mark etc the religious of all ages have laid a great stress on omens and presignifications of future events by dreams flights of birds etc in compliance with which ancient and rational notion our author represents his heroine alarmed and terrified by very affecting and infallible though modern appearances did thou not mark last night the coffee grains methought the tapers flame was tinged with blue and coals strangeshapen from the embers flew late as i wandered in a lonely grove ever yet my thoughts began to teem with love a withered gypsy whispered in my ear misfortune shall befall thy twentieth year that fatal period of my life is come and every hour swells big with fannias doom yet o ye powers preserve me from disgrace let me still keep my virtue  and my face o make my bosom proof to loves alarms protect my youth and shelter all my charms fantastic slumbers etc  while thus the maid presaged disaster nigh great jove convened the senate of the sky and round assembled the celestial clan he strokd his mustachoes and thus began ethereal powers behold in doleful state our bestlovd fannia moans approaching fate see how she views yon glittering needle round nor deems her woe long destined in a wound shall we avert the fair ones doom today or shall we give the spleenful fates their way while thus the maid etc  great jove convened etc though a superficial reader might infer from a preceding passage in this canto relating to fate that all events are predetermined by necessity it is plain from jupiters design in convening this council in which he appears willing to interpose his superior power in favor of fannia that fate itself is by our author supposed to be subject to his control and superintendency jupiter in homer acts the same part in the cases of sarpedon and hector this deity we may here observe appears in the greek poet and his latin imitator to great disadvantage if compared with the figure he makes in this incomparable poem  in the first place jupiter himself betrays great weakness and infirmity see b xxii of the iliad by his almost unmanly but surely ungodly lamentation over the fate of hector  in the next place the eyebrows and the hair mentioned by homer upon another occasion but omitted by virgil those chief pieces of imagery from whence mr pope tells us phidis took the idea of a countenance proper for the king of gods and men are evidently inferior in point of majesty and respectableness to the mustachoes of our author  again the juno of homer the goddess of marriage is an eternal billingsgate and has entailed from that blind poets days contempt and reproach upon the state of wedlock which our author in the ensuing allegory of which more byandby laudably attempts to remove  of all the damsels on yon earthly sphere like fannia none our deities revere daily the maid renews her pious toil and heaven regales with steams of fattest oil while yearly as the solemn etc  two milkwhite kittens etc a much genteeler sacrifice and consequently more grateful to the deities than those of oxen etc offered by the awkward and nasty heroes of homer and virgil  for proof of this we might transcribe the account of the sacrifice in the first book of the iliad but forbear to do it in pure tenderness to polite ears  we will venture however to subjoin mr popes translation who was a very clean writer and upon this as well as many other occasions has greatly softened the indelicacy of the original  the limbs they sever from the enclosing hide the thighs selected to the gods divide on these in double cawls involved with art the choicest morsels lay from every part b i l  0  the thighs thus sacrificed and entrails dressed the assistants part transfix and roast the rest what gross ideas does this description convey our author wisely thought it sufficient to inform us that his heroine yearly offered a kitten to the gods without officiously entering into the particulars of the dissection or of the throwing the fat in the fire etc  such is his regard to decency   while yearly as the solemn rites succeed two milkwhite kittens on our altars bleed so spoke the sire of men and gods above and smiling thus rejoined the queen of love father it is just this pity to the fair a helpless maid is joves peculiar care bright fannia shines the first of human race in winning sweetness and in bloom of face since my famed favorite helens powerful charms roused heaven and earth to dreadful deeds of arms for such a maid shall fate distress ordain and spoil such features with the rage of pain to whom the goddess with the silver bow sister thy arts by endless proof we know by thee seduced the fairest nymphs among my huntress train have left the virgin throng fannia my votry late and chief delight whose thought by day was chaste and dream by night soon i foresee will fall thy victim sure i mark her bosom heave with sighs impure when cynthio twines her hair or twirls her fan for there is contagion in the touch of man let not great jove his own decrees abate but leave the abandoned virgin to her fate then slow uprose the gods majestic queen unjust she cried diana is thy spleen nor venus claim thy softer arts applause let love be subject to connubial laws so fannia still may shine supremely fair beloved of gods and heavens peculiar care and jove the horrors of her present fate may or remove or kindly mitigate next the great pallas blueeyd goddess rose not like the pallas thundering midst her foes when allbesmeard with dust and sweat and gore she bids the furious voice of battle roar a mild and graceful air her looks assume as when presiding over the peaceful loom twas reasoned well she cried and i beseech thanks may be paid to juno for her speech fate will have way and who shall stem its tide great jove opposed not when his hector died the wound the beauteous artist must endure though cruel fate inflicts the gods may cure venus implored shall due compassion take as well for cynthios as for fannias sake and vulcans art a target shall prepare henceforth to shield the finger of the fair thus shall the perils of the needle cease and hymen s bands etc it has been observed of the allegories of homer that many of them are forced and scarce reconcilable to truth and morality  in this respect the author of the thimble has much the advantage of his predecessor  in the allegory before us we have a tacit but lively reproof of unlawful love a display of the benefits and advantages of matrimony and a declaration of the wisdom of its institution and hymens bands shall tie the knot of peace so be it if so wills jove  the parent god shook his ambrosial locks and gave the nod now sip the immortals their celestial tea and quaff nectareous draughts of ratifia apollo sung a ballad and the nine with tabor and with pipe in concert join young ganimede etc the conclusion of this canto is a happy imitation and improvement of that of the first book of the iliad  whether the spruce young ganymede is not a much more proper waiter for the female deities than an old limping blacksmith let the ladies the best judges in this case determine young ganymede his office dextrous plies and all applaud the footboy of the skies end of the first canto canto ii no sweetlyflowing tale i now rehearse but scratches wounds and bloodshed stain the verse ye vetran band of milliners give ear and every sempstress drop a pitying tear o listen to the melancholy lay while i recount the horrors of the day o for his numbers etc both homer and virgil as our author here in conformity to their practice renew their invocation of the muse at particular periods and proper intervals of their poems  tu vatem tu diva moan  aeneid lib vii l     major rerum mihi nascitur ordo majus opus moveo  o for his numbers that described the shield of great pelides issuing to the field or clad in arms terrific from afar or rushing dreadful through the ranks of war the virgin sat deep sunk in pensive thought betty my work she cried and betty brought often have my morning labors soothed my grief what wretch ever found in idleness relief how blind are mortals in this hapless state we rush to ruin and embrace our fate six needles etc there is a beautiful cast of antiquity in this passage which we only hint to the judicious reader desiring him to take this hint along with him throughout the poem six needles in tremendous range appear each a dire emblem of the warriours spear a while she viewed them all with careful eyes then grasped a javelin of enormous size next as impatient for the toil she grew her shining scissars from the sheath she drew her granddames gift as ancient memoirs say a just reward for many a wellworkd day with active haste her nimble fingers move curl the gay vine and form the mimic grove but as her finger with resistless force through double plaits pursued its rapid course the treacherous needle broke  the headless dart deepgord her flesh and pierced her  to the heart the purple blood distained her arm around and half her soul came rushing through the wound then as her bosom glowed with sudden fire she spurned her lapdog in her peevish ire across the room with furious speed she flew and tables chairs and cabinets oerthrew her hideous cries the vocal walls resound imitations air blackened roared the thunder groaned the ground drydens fables  poll chatterd screamd the kitten shook the ground so when the diomed see the fifth book of the iliad line     etc greek that with immortals strove wounded in impious rage the queen of love to heavens high roof the goddess raised her cries and the harsh shriek run thrilling through the skies here lay the ruins of an ample bowl the pride and comfort of her grandsires soul this often inspired the loudlysounding jest and crowned with jollity the nuptial feast unhurt by midnight broils uncrackd by age it fell the wreck of fannias heedless rage at length fatigued with anger she surveyed the fatal massacre herself had made then as she sat all pensive and alone in secret grief she made her piteous moan so shuns a wounded bird the feathered race and mournful in some solitary place to woods and rocks he tunes the plaintive lay and echoes waft the gentle sounds away and oh she cried is this the dreadful stroke which omens threatened and which visions spoke ah how have i incensed the powers above what crime provokes the wrath of angry jove yearly my loaded altars blaze in vain with plenteous fat of purring victims slain doomed as i am to pangs of endless pain pale meagre ghostlike how shall i appear in bright assemblies of the gay and fair old maids will triumph with insulting voice and over their flowing cups etc justice to the fair sex requires us to suppose the author by cups here means teacups and over their flowing cups the belles rejoice a sad recluse no longer must i roam but spin a tedious length of days at home even cynthio cruel cynthio spreads my shame adieu to love to conquest and to fame did i for this my blooming beauties grace and heighten all the luster of my face for this before my glass whole hours beguile and heave my breast and force the killing smile or bid my cheeks with artful blushes glow or teach the wanton tresses where to flow could i not tasks less dangerous undertake refine the jelly or compose the cake or mould the pliant paste with nicest art and with high ramparts fortify the tart o blast that day ye powers with plagues severe when first my fingers poised the pointed spear then may no joyful sounds invade the skies but ravished maids complaints and widows cries then be untuned the music of the spheres then may no fiddle glad the dancers ears no ballad then be sung with screaming note nor soft airs warbld in the eunuchs throat then may the sun withdraw his cheerful light nor pendent lustres gild the face of night this said with silk her bleeding flesh she bound while every thought hung brooding over the wound on poll she cast a sad desponding look and patted daphne with a feeble stroke but now bright lamps began the midnight day and blazing flambeaux drove the stars away the fair expects her beau with anxious fears when at his wonted hour the fop appears with conscious shame her finger she withdrew nor durst expose the fatal wound to view long he surveyed for love takes all alarms with deep surprise her disconcerted charms then sweet and tuneful as the dying swan in soft condoling words he thus began what sad mischance what unfeard danger nigh flushes that cheek and dims that sparkling eye lies some near friend upon his dying bed or has the lightning struck thy monkey dead has the fell mercer just produced his score and having trusted long will trust no more or did thou mark last evening at the play a richer virgin or a nymph more gay say does my fair for brighter gems repine each indias choicest diamonds shall be thine for thee the east its treasures shall unfold and earth unbosom all her hoards of gold o name thy wants and tell me thy distress care shall remove or pity make it less this said and sure his lordship said enough with elegance he took a pinch of snuff then she no language can my grief remove nor all the powers of hartshorn and of jove cynthio thy truth alone can give me aid and skreen from sad reproach a wretched maid if in each deepfetchd sigh each falling tear each solemn vow thy heart has been sincere by secrecy thy fair affection prove for silence is the noblest mark of love even fannia sues this favor to obtain fannia that never sud to man in vain she said and fixed her eyes upon the ground and with a blush disclosed the reeking wound shocked at the sight of blood replied the peer it is done and this was cynthios greatest fear often have i seen thy bright embroidry shine often have i cursed the perilous design thou born to flourish in the pride of state idly secure and indolently great had naught to do with dangerous feats of arms such conflicts suit not with a ladys charms domestic toils the servile female grace enough for thee to glory in a face how rash was she that grasped the needle first pernicious weapon instrument accursed twas alluding to the monument in westminster abbey of a lady whose death is said to have been occasioned by the prick of a needle this that once destroyed a british maid her needles point to lingering death betrayed in those sad vaults where horror spreads her wings where rest the bones of poets and of kings the hapless fair in marble record stands the victim of her own industrious hands o call to mind her life and beauty lost dread all edged tools but dread the needle most why down thy cheek descends the pearly rill fannia is wounded but is fannia still the sad disgrace with patient heart endure nor cynthio shall divulge but wait the cure this night my soul shall breathe a fervent prayer and deprecate the horrors of the scar thy wounded finger venus shall restore but venurous beauty trust to steel no more so spoke the peer to sooth the drooping maid and his vast stores of eloquence displayed lulled by his melting words her terrors cease and the soft sounds restored her wonted peace at length the mighty theme exhausts his art and emptied all the nonsense of his heart but now the tea removed the prattle over and all the scandal of the day before the baron took his leave and left the fair and his gilt chariot rattled over the square fannia at length in slumbers closed her eyes and men and monkies in delusion rise end of the second canto canto iii now all lay hushed now all lay hushed etc the poets are fond of giving us descriptions of the morning or the night  this excellent nightpiece of our author we think equal to any thing of its kind in ancient or modern poetry in solitary night and distant stars diffused a solemn light the world appeared a desert silent scene and all around was dreadfully serene now ghastly stalked a melancholy train by knife by halter and by poison slain whose woeful memries grubstreet bards prolong in dismal story or in doleful song nor schoolboys shout was heard nor carmans roar even winds were still and women spoke no more the sons of men dissolved in slumbers lay and slaves and kings forgot the toils of day but wakeful cares disturbed the barons brain and wearied nature called for rest in vain anxious to ease the sadlywounded fair to venus he addressed his midnight prayer great paphian queen bright deity of love whom all below confess and all above if ever with gifts thy altars i have crowned or decked with flowery wreaths thy shrine around if i have taught my tender soul to own no powers but thee and thy allconquring son if by thy aid i ken loves secret fire each budding wish and every fond desire read in the virgins eyes her inward smart and know each symptom of a lovesick heart renew thy favors often bestowed before and hear me now or never hear me more behold my fannia late a virgin bright as love can fancy or as verse can write now see her sad dejected and forlorn that once was cheerful as the rising morn with allconsuming grief she wastes away even she the fair the witty and the gay pensive she moans her wounded fingers smart and sinks from all her loftiness of heart o grant my boon and ease the virgins pain ease it to bless mankind and me again with sovereign balm the shameful scar remove and teach o teach her to relent to love so shall each beau with spleen and envy see the mistress of the world subdued by me the yielding fair shall every charm resign and hymen shall our hearts in lasting union join thus far with wakeful zeal the baron said slumbers ensued and nods the heavy head venus with pity heard the beaus request and thus the stripling god of love addressed my son thy bow and keenest shafts prepare it is thine to humble this imperious fair enough the maid has seen with high disdain the coxcombs anguish and the foplings pain at length herself shall own loves powerful sway for all must once the laws of love obey and slighted beaux shall bless the vengeance of this day cynthio the bright that yonder sleeping lies whose fires perpetual on my altars rise in vain the force of every pleasing art has tried to soften that obdurate heart to him the fair her beauties shall resign his be the glorious prize the conquest thine but first some sovereign medicine must be found to ease the torments of the fatal wound and see within this crystal are contained drops which from wholesome herbs

side wrapped in a sable cloud they took their way like lightning darting through the realms of day swift as they past perfumes divine they shed and now hung hovering over the virgins bed over the wide

here bright diana seemed to urge the chase panting behind her came her virgin train and the huge boar ran foaming over the plain here daphne sought the shelter of the wood and here with eager steps the god pursued pleased venus saw etc the author in this passage had his eye upon virgil see aeneid b i l     etc  se quoque principibus permixtum agnovit achivis etc  pleased venus saw at length herself surveyed fondly lamenting over adonis dead at that sad scene her tears began to flow and her breast labored with the former woe she turned aside new objects to explore nor durst behold the fatal image more here a rich structures stately bulk was set whose golden figures blazed on plains of jet from indias farthest coast the fabric came a lovers offering to the haughty dame imitations  hic illius arma hic currus fuit aeneid b i l  0  here the rich vest and sparkling diamond lay all beautys pleasing terrible array the spacious top whole groups of china grace of men and beasts a vast promiscuous race two rampant lions at each corner stood the dreadful guardians of the sacred wood sullen the brittle savages looked down and the terrific china seemed to frown the immortals next the wellwrought bed surveyed where lay dissolved in sleep the lovely maid wrapped in sweet dreams of conquest love and play pleased she renewed the triumphs of the day disdainful imitations soothed with the sound the king grew vain fought all his battles over again and thrice he routed all his foes and thrice he slew the slain drydens ode for st cecilias day  even in slumbers she grew vain and practiced all her conquests over again and thrice she vanquished all her beaux and thrice she slew the slain her watch of gold hung pendent over her head and decked with glittering pomp the lofty bed it strikes as every rapid hour glides round it strikes mortality is in the sound oh did the belles while yet in beautys prime take warning from these records of their time think every year may steal away a grace and prey unheeded on the fairest face conscious of fading charms they would lay aside each art coquetish and each air of pride nor blast their lovers hopes by long delay but yield those beauties which must soon decay venus at length a golden quill espied that once adorned a gaudy peacocks side this penned the fair ones thoughts with wondrous art and told the soft emotions of her heart described her inmost soul without disguise and truths denied to mans unhallowed eyes lo in the sacred drops the shining plume she dies and heavenly odours fill the room with this she gently bathed the swelling wound it healed it closed and all the part was sound cupid beheld and be that glory thine he cried but now behold a work of mine coy maids and haughty belles revere me all beauty must yield and womans pride must fall for now an inward pang the fair shall feel not all the powers of heaven and earth can heal he said he bit his lip and drew his bow and viewed exulting the defenseless foe then with malicious zeal he shot the dart that fatal lodged deep sunk in fannias heart then thrice was heard the wounded virgins groan and thrice the parrot screamd his hideous moan thrice barked the lapdog from his downy bed and thrice the kitten reared her drowsy head alas how shortlived is all human power the pride of years is blasted in an hour all the gay plans of conquest all the schemes the maid had formed are fled like morning dreams the baron shall possess her beautys store and fanny must insult mankind no more then venus thus addressed the sleeping fair o thou thrice blessed in heavens peculiar care thou that can all the gifts of nature boast charge of immortals and the mortals toast revere the counsels of the powers above forego thy empire and submit to love here cease the triumphs of thy conquering charms decreed by fate to cynthios faithful arms nor with reluctance yield for thou bright maid enough have ruled and man enough obeyed bless this auspicious night nor henceforth fear to lift with artful hand the pointed spear safely the dangerous weapon shall thou wield thy finger guarded by a sacred shield vulcan himself the target shall prepare that arms for fight the gallant god of war so shall thy needle still extend thy fame and ages yet to come admire thy name the pleasing tale shall dwell on every tongue and grace the numbers of some poets song and each bright virgin each industrious fair hereafter fearless of the fatal scar my name shall highextol with grateful praise while purrs the kitten and the lapdog bays while winds

where vulcans everlasting forges roar she said and straight they glided on unseen swift as the filmy mists that skim the green canto iv where fabled aetnas where fabled aetnas etc the subterraneous apartment assigned here by the poet to vulcan is we think more suitable to his trade than his heavenly mansion in the latter part of the eighteenth book of the iliad with which the reader will do well to compare this canto  the shield of fannia could not possibly admit of so copious or so pompous a description as that which homer gives of the shield of achilles  in all other respects the english happily rivals the grecian poet dreadful summits rise whose fiery womb with sulphur taints the skies deep in the cave lies vulcans dark abode the dwelling of the great mechanic god scarce can the distant suns enlivening ray pierce the thick gloom and shed a doubtful day in this dire vault he toils with panting breath reddens the bolt and shapes the missive death that from the hand of jove in

regions of eternal night the mighty powers of love direct their flight ambrosial zephyrs all around them play and gently fan the unwholesome fogs away soon as they entered all the swarthy band drop their unfinished labors from their hand the heavenly form they viewed with wondering eyes and in a silent grin confessed surprise at length elate exclaims the limping god what drew my fair one from her blessed abode why have thou left the peaceful realms above why to these dreary mansions do thou rove where foul contagion hovers in the air and sultry vapors blast the blooming year name it whatever it be o name thy boon nor thou can ask nor i can grant too soon then thus began the beauteous queen of love o thou that formst the forked bolts of jove whose art can teach the stubborn brass to yield point in the spear or widen in the shield thou that did clad in steel my aeneas see the eighth book of the aeneid line    favorite boy that bravely led the poor remains of troy an equal task

shield the finger in the toils of war the gift to fannia shall relief impart the first in beauty as the first in art wounded she pines nor dares again to wield the instrument of blood without a shield this shall secure the fair from future pain and bless for ever all the female train then when some nymph however that nymph be named for the nice conduct of the needle famed like fannia now the pride

emulation strove impatient to oblige the queen of love with sudden rage the roaring forges glow and anvils thunder underneath the blow the god quick deals his arms the clangs rebound and the wide vaults rebellow to the sound the pliant steel in various forms they twine and elegantly shape the work divine then vulcan thus the animated steel the deep impression of your tools must feel here let myself and here let venus stand the newmade armor blazing in her hand here let the virgins implements of war the ponderous scissars and the needle spear and all the bright artillery appear let fame above the glorious work resound and bands of flowers adorn the border round soon at their touch the expressive figures rise and breathe and glitter to the distant skies behold he cried the bright original this future ages shall the thimble call happy thrice happy she the mortal fair whose finger first the sacred shield shall wear then with a limping step and awkward mien he gave the shining present to his queen enamored he beheld her pleasing charms and gently clasped her in his sooty arms averse the goddess turned aside her face and with reluctance met the foul embrace then from the dreary cave they mount to day and to the barons house direct their way lost in a pleasing dream the beau was laid and thus the bright celestial vision said cynthio awake and seize thy fannias charms take her for ever to thy faithful arms her outward cured she feels an inward pain and love impetuous glows in every vein give her this target made by vulcans art to guard her finger from the needles dart secured by this undaunted she may rear and fearless shake the long tremendous spear so shall far distant times admire her name and crown her labors with eternal fame she said and left the shield the gift bestowed and with her son pursued the heavenly road but now the morn shot forth a feeble ray and tinged the mountains with the blush of day uprose the joyful baron straight he spies the thimble shield and grasps the shining prize the work divine with wonder he surveyed and homage due to cytherea paid with care he decked his person out that day artfully fine deliberately gay adorned with gold that shone with gaudy show he traverses the room a finished beau then eager to embrace his muchloved fair in stately pomp he mounts his gilded car soft on her downy couch the nymph was laid the midnight dream revolving in her head her blooming cheeks with conscious blushes glow and her heart fluttered for her charming beau when lo he comes love flashes from his eyes unusual raptures in her bosom rise then to the fair he gave the gift bestowed the sacred shield the labor of a god joyful she viewed the workmanship around healed of her last and safe from future wound twas in that hour the beau his passion pressed twas in that hour the fair his passion blessed cynthio she cried o long in heart adored my faithful lover and my destined lord fannia the powers immortal shall repay with grateful honors for this glorious day let the glad tidings etc the games of our author which constitute a very entertaining if not necessary part of the epic poem seem to be introduced much more judiciously than those of homer or virgil for notwithstanding the customs of antiquity which may be thought to warrant those authors sports surely of all kinds more properly and naturally precede a wedding than they succeed a funeral of the games themselves more in their place let the glad tidings spread proclaim about this afternoon we hold a solemn route summon the belles the damsels and the dames the beaux and foplings to the nuptial games in yon buffet be placed before their eyes each combats due reward and glittering prize she said and fame her loudest trumpet blows and in gay clusters crowd the belles and beaux thus have i seen etc although the poet has been hitherto sparing of his similies the great figures as mr pope calls them we shall find him for the future displaying his genius in a variety of beautiful and apt comparisons  in these he seems to be excelled by none not even homer himself at least our authors are all original and not translated like virgils from his greek predecessor thus have i seen in summer to the clang of beaten pot or shining warmingpan soothed and delighted by the powerful charm with cheerful hum the insect nations swarm canto v high on a rich settee the future bride sat with the curled cynthio by her side aloft with luster graced divinely bright the thimble shines conspicuous to the sight in comely rank was ranged each brilliant guest and big ambition swells in every breast the burnished kettle on a tripod stands and the plumed moor expects the fairs commands here piles of snowcapt cakes are seen and here vast pyramids of well built toasts appear the rites of tea begin and first they pour to mighty jove libations on the floor two basins of bohea whose fragrant steam scents the wide hall and next two pots of cream then belles and beaux the rich repast partake in ruin sinks the edifice of cake all over their smoking cups reclining sit and briskly circles sugar round  and wit by turns they sip their drink by turns they prate now stir a teadish now reform the state so in a lowering eve the ducks and drakes on the green pool renew their clamorous wakes now dip their sportive beaks the quacking race now undistinguished chattring fills the place  at length the rage of appetite allayed thus to the route began the lovely maid o ye whose bosoms etc the following particulars relating to the ensuing games of our author are observable  first that they are exhibited by the heroine of the poem as those of homer and virgil are by their respective heroes  secondly that they are of so inoffensive though interesting a nature that ladies and gentlemen equally appear as competitors for the several prizes a circumstance which renders them perfectly agreeable to the present system of the epopee and gives them a manifest advantage in point of variety and novelty over the sports of the ancient poets  thirdly that notwithstanding this deviation from antiquity the author has taken care to infuse the spirit of homer and virgil even into these genteel or gentle exercises as will appear from many passages the most remarkable of which we will occasionally take notice of o ye whose bosoms beat for fame draw near beaux belles fops foplings chiefs and chieflings hear and first they pour  to mighty jove etc this is a polite improvement of the following libation in virgil  hic duo rite mero libans carchesia baccho fundit humi duo lacte novo    hear what the happiest of her sex proclaims and joyful celebrate the nuptial games you first whose limbs etc the first game the footrace is the only one the author has taken from homer and virgil which yet is a proof how willing he was to borrow from those great poets as far as was consistent with his own more comprehensive plan you first whose limbs excel in active race three times round yon canal pursue the chase who measures with most speed the destined spot or his or hers shall be this coffeepot a massy gift by artists richly wrought that my great grandsires widefamd bounty bought what time my fathers eager hopes were sped and my chaste mother climbed the bridal bed the second chief in this pedestrian war shall bear in triumph home yon chinajar and to the third due honors we decree this muff of pheasants down once worn by me scarce had she spoke when foremost of the beaux the gay fribillio smoothcheeckd youth arose him cloe followed next swiftfooted maid then spruce myrtillo that implored the aid of the nymphchasing pan along they past and dapperwit and caelia come the last now warm with hopes etc with this the reader is desired to compare the following account of virgil  intenti expectant signum exultantia que haurit corda pavor pulsans laudumque arrecta cupido inde ubi clara dedit sonitum tuba finibus omnes hand mora prosiluere suis aeneid b v l     non tam praecipites bijugo certamine campum corripuere ruuntque effusi carcere currus nec sic immissis aurigae undantia lora concussere jugis pronique in verbera pendent l      now warm with hopes in order ranged they stand and wait impatient of the wished command then at the signal of a loudcrackd fan all from their station in an instant ran the floodgates thus uplifted with full force rush out at once the streams impetuous in their course before the rest the nimble cloe flies fribillio follows eager for the prize next the swift caelia scuds it over the green myrtillo last and dapperwit were seen now twice the compass of the allotted ground the heroes and the heroines circled round when caelia virgin of a subtle heart thus to herself  my fate depends on art   so spoke and pressing by fribillios side headlong she plunged him in the miry tide whelmed and amazed etc thus virgil describes the unfortunate situation of menaetes  at gravis ut fundo vix tandem redditus imo est jam senior madidaque fluens in vest maenetes summa petit scopuli siccaque in rupe resedit illum et labentem teucri et risere natantem et salsos rident revomentem pectore fluctus aeneid b v l      whelmed and amazed awhile the hero lay gasping and sputtring in the watery way dropping and faint at length he crawled to shore and the skies burst with universal roar caelia exulting in the second place bounds over the lawn and pushes for the race myrtillo close pursued the panting fair and to his god preferred the secret prayer give me at least etc thus mnestheus in virgil  non jam prima peto mnestheus neque vincere certo quanquam o sed superent quibus hoc neptune dedisti extremos pudeat rediisse hoc vincite cives et prohibete nefas l     etc so likewise ulysses in homer succeeds upon his application to pallas  assist o goddess thus in thought he prayed and present at his thought descends the maid see popes homer b xxiii l     etc give me at least this damsel to outspeed and a young greyhound at thy shrine shall bleed the god propitious heard for sad to tell prone to the earth the heedless caelia fell loud shout the beaux the frighted virgins cry myrtillo first then dapperwit goes by the goal now reached the victors bear away the wellcontested honors of the day now to the hall for so ordained the fair again the sprightly company repair when thus the maid  is there a belle whose might dares meet a gallant beau in single fight such sure there is or fannias hopes are vain quick let the warriors take the marble plain and till we wake the voice of yonder clock contend at battledoor and shuttlecock the glorious victor in the hardy fray this deepeard lapdog nobly shall repay long has he friskd it in my chamber tame never yet polluted with the blood of game the vanquished too shall thank our generous care blessed with this ivory case and toothpicker she said and light upsprang etc this gentleman makes as brave a figure here as epeus in homer or dares in virgil  talis prima dares caput altum in praelia tollit ostenditque humeros latos alternaque jactat brachia protendens et verberat ictibus auras see aeneid b v l      she said and light upsprang cosmelius gay trim as the painted butterfly of may with head and heart erect he stalks the floor and proudly brandishes his battledoor flyrtilla saw and grant me gods she cried to humble to the ground this coxcombs pride then on the spacious plain she takes her stand and poises the huge engine in her hand the sounded battledoors for fight prepare at once the drums and weapons of the war each now the arm with dextrous vigor plies aloft the feathered cork in eddies flies with quickrepeated strokes the drums rebound and the arched roof returns a hollow sound now in high curves they deal the wary blow now whirls the giddy shuttlecock below thus over the verdant surface of the mead the lightwingd swallows try their rapid speed now skim the ground now higher flights prepare and in a thousand mazes cut the air long time the chiefs with equal skill engage and glows the battle with a dubious rage the gods with wonder the dread fight surveyed and some the youth inspire and some the maid at length nice poised etc this circumstance is happily borrowed from the greek and the latin poet see popes homer b xxii l     see virgils aeneid b xii l     at length nice poised jove holds his golden scales down sinks the beaus the virgins fate prevails for lo unseen and in the heros way the treacherous fragment of an orange lay and as he stretched him with exerted might at one swift stroke to end the tedious fight slipped his unstable foot flat on the floor he fell the high arch rings with various roar and the white pavement etc as this is the only indelicate or shocking image in the whole poem it may be expected some apology should be offered for it it will be sufficient to observe that as accidents of this nature are really inseparable from such exercises so there was a necessity of painting this in the striking colors of poetry it had conveyed the very same idea but yet would have been below the dignity of the epic style had the poet told us  the heros nose bled and the white pavement floats with spouting gore quick to his aid etc we have here a more lively picture of this unfortunate combatant than the original one of dares or of euryalus  ast illum fidi aequales genua aegra trahentem jactantemque utroque caput crassumque cruorem ore rejectantem mixtosque in sanguine dentes ducunt ad naves see aeneid b v  quick to his aid the flippant fops repair uplift his head and yield him purer air his fluttering soul with gentle speech compose with vivifying drops regale his nose then pale and bloody from the field conveyed and softly placed him on the silken bed flyrtilla mistress of the glorious fray bears in her arms the muchloved prize away then fannia to the throng  once more attend my voice with heed not here our games shall end you that have strength and active slight enough enter the spacious lists of blindmansbuff let thrice six belles and beaux a goodly show their separate lots in this silk bonnet throw and as their several fortunes shall decide of either sex three chiefs in turn shall hide the chief that soonest shall with hoodwinked eyes seize in the hot pursuit and name the prize shall wear this snuff box etc a happy expression for though the snuff box be not an essential part of dress it is with the beaumonde a proper adjunct to it shall wear this snuff box turned with curious art in form resemblant of the human heart who shines conspicuous in the second place joyful shall own this studded tweezercase to the third worthy in the hardy strife last we assign this silverhafted knife she spoke  the lots are thrown  the chances fall to shortleggd damon altamont the tall to dimpled daphne to vanessa fair beau sprig and cloris with the golden hair in row twelve judges of the combat stand each with a watch accordant in his hand damon advances first his eyes are bound and like a top etc this simile of the top is introduced more successfully we presume than that in virgil animadverted upon by mr addison and like a top they twirl him five times round the rapid motion turns his ringing head he calls the foe  the tittring foe is fled long time with hopeless chase and labor vain ducklike he waddled over the stony plain at length with grief and shame constrained to yield to others he resigned the toilsome field next altamont chief bony lank and tall proceeds like polypheme he strides the hall wide grope his sprawling hands in search of prey the frighted hosts on tiptoes slip away so the lean hungry pike in quest of food darts his vast length across the silver flood ten thousand panicks seize the finny race and in thick shoals they scud from place to place but now the chieftain grasped clarindas waste her wellknown shriek the captive fair confessed clarinda loud the beau exulting cried clarinda loud the vocal walls replied the judges note the time  next daphne came a nymph alert and studious of the game now here now there like quicksilver she flies elastic round and every corner tries but for hard fate the nymph a prize had gained for in a sudden whirl her ancle spraind and now with watery eyes and limping pace daphne reluctant quits the noble chase vanessa next the fate of combat proves the fair vanessa darling of the loves swift speeds the maid swift scuttle the pursued wheel as she wheels and all her arts elude till hapless flash a fopling of high note trippd at lucindas trailing petticoat vanessa caught the alarm the fop she strains hard in her grasp a solemn silence reigns beau flash i know him by his rich perfume she cried and acclamations shake the room then gentle sprig fair fannia thus addressed me love forbids with cloris to contest so please the mistress of this glorious day let the late victors bear their gifts away for me to save the toil of farther strife to cloris i resign the silverhafted knife the fair approved  the prizes all decree first to the beau vanessa next to thee and tender cloris pleased to end the strife joyful receives the silverhafted knife the games now done the evening they prolong with strains of music and the voice of song the sprightly tribes the sumptuous banquet share at length fatigued to needful rest repair alike expectant of the coming day cynthio and fannia allimpatient lay the day appears with mutual joy they wed and genial hymen etc at length the action of this poem is brought to a happy catastrophe and upon the whole we must do the author the justice to acknowledge that he has produced what we have long been encouraged to expect from another quarter viz a modern epic poem written upon the model of the ancients and genial hymen blessed the nuptial bed the end henry and rosamond  a tragedy  omne animi vitium tanto conspectius in se crimen habet quanto major qui peccat habetur juven the second edition corrected  to sir john philipps bart sir though i am happy in your permission to shelter under your name a performance which stands in much need of your favor and protection especially as it comes into the world with some disadvantage yet i hope you will do me the justice to believe me actuated by a nobler principle than that of a selfishness common to all authors in my choice of a patron upon the present occasion  for sir the following sheets are with a particular propriety yours whether you are considered as a person sincerely attached to the university of oxford or affectionately interesting yourself in the welfare of pembrokecollege to the regard and best wishes of which society you have a double claim both as an ornament and a benefactor  the common topics of panegyric are obvious and i have here a fair and agreeable opportunity of taking notice of those many amiable qualities which adorn you in public and private life and for which you are so justly beloved and esteemed but my inclination is corrected by a seasonable thought that most writers of the present age have in this respect a considerable advantage over me as it is much more easy to make a character than to describe one  besides it would be needless to enter into a detail of those praises which are already in the mouth of every wellwisher to his country and therefore i will only indulge the impulse of gratitude which points to that part of your character which more immediately affects me your goodnature and condescension to which i am indebted for the honor of your acquaintance and friendship and for your favorable acceptance of the following poem  give me leave to assure you sir that i am principally anxious for the reputation of this tragedy from an earnest desire of transmitting to posterity a monument of the regard and veneration i have for the person and character of sir john philipps i am  sir your much obliged and most humble servant william hawkins pembrokecollege oxon march         advertisement the most material objection to this tragedy made by mr garrick was that it is rather a poem than a play  a consolatory octjection at least as it is founded only in the authors acknowleged transgression of the mechanical laws of the drama but however reasonable the objection might be to the representation of this tragedy upon the stage it was by no means thought a sufficient one to its original publication nor consequently it is presumed will be esteemed such against its having a place in the present collection  those who are offended at the liberties taken in it may if they please call it an historical play and then all exceptions of this nature vanish of course  after all the objection will perhaps have less weight with the candid and judicious reader when he has favored with his perusal the essay on the ancient and modern drama though he is not to look upon that essay as written with a view to the defense of this particular play

which makes it is first appearance in the world in this manner  he is to know then that the siege of aleppo having been refused by the managers of both theaters to one of which viz mr garrick it was strongly recommended by lady caroline burdet who is thereby entitled to my present grateful acknowlegements would not have been offered to the public had it not been honored with the approbation of several persons of the first note in the republic of polite literature whom i am not at liberty to mention  i am obliged to declare this in order to do common justice to myself and to obviate the prejudices which might be conceived against a performance that has not had the credit and advantage of a theatrical representation  but the play must now speak for itself of which i shall say no more than just to premise that the fable and whole construction of it excepting the reality of the siege is purely fictitious that the incidents were designed to be natural though unexpected not arising from commonplace exigencies or forced expedients which is too frequently the case but from the predominant principles of the characters themselves and that for this purpose i have endeavored to give a new and something of an original cast to the principal characters particularly to those of theodore sophronius and ormelia  dramatis personae men manuel governor of aleppo theodore a christian chief othman general of the saracens sophronius son to manuel leon friend to sophronius romanus lieutenant to theodore izrail an officer mervan secretary to the governor women ormelia daughter to theodore eusebia daughter to manuel officers soldiers attendants etc  scene aleppo  the siege of aleppo act i scene i scene a piazza after several shouts of to arms to arms etc enter sophronius and leon meeting leon sophronius welcome are our messengers returned from yonder camp  soph even now my friend  leon i ask not the success  soph those shouts may tell you our overtures of peace were all received with scorn and pride peculiar to these spoilers they know no style but that of conquerours and in the fullness of their hearts declare the faithful never take but give conditions  leon perhaps not yet  i prythee good sophronius what terms do these victorious vagrants offer  soph first they invite us to embrace their faith and draw our swords beneath the prophets banner no more their foes but brethren of the war if wedded to our errors we reject this friendly proposition such they call it the next alternative is briefly this that we confess the prowess of their arms by paying yearly tribute to the caliph  leon and it was this provoked that glorious uproar  soph the universal voice is now for war soon as the impatient rabble caught the news a thousand hearts were kindled in an instant and in the wildness of new zeal to arms to arms they cried with such a clamorous shout as tore the expanse of heaven and sure must strike even yon barbarian troops with sudden dread though long inured to terrors  leon thou have warmed me these martial transports promise well sophronius perhaps the wrath divine that long has scourged our follies vices and corrupted faith with iron rod of war at length relents nor farther will permit this vile imposture to make its way with death and desolation and like a deluge whelm the eastern world  soph alas my friend we seem unfit for mercy the seeds of jealousy are sown among us and should they spread and ripen to a crop yon greedy mussulmen will reap the harvest  our passions leon fight for mahomet  union alone can save a sinking land and concord is the strongest nerve of war  leon some distant hints of this have reached mine ear it is said the baleful breath of whisperers has undermined the worth of theodore and shook his credit with your father manuel are these suggestions true  soph too true  my father whose piety and even paternal care still anxious for the welfare of his people raises him high in all affections has yet the leavn of old age within him with reverence let me speak in his dispraise leon that sigh declares too well thou see his eager warmth his frowardness of temper impatient of control and fixed as death in all resolves  to this credulity too often unlocks his ear and gives access to a wellgarnishd tale  leon proceed  soph thou know some moons have shed their beams since theodore lodged in our town his hardy band of syrians a voluntary aid  the saracens were then upon their march and manuel gave the honors of our chief command to him trained from his active youth a son of war he is no nice observer of the forms the ceremonious defrence and the duties preeminence expects from all beneath her the desperate fight that yesterday he pushed unauthorisd by manuel some dark foe has swelled into a dangerous crime of state  leon it looks not well  the gallant theodore no doubt has noble worth  sure that presumption was but the effect of valors confidence  yet i have lately noted our aleppians like not the headstrong fierceness of his nature that wants more tincture of humanity necessity they say unsheathed the sword but hotbrained theodore enjoys their dangers and revels savage in a field of blood  soph true  but a breach might be pernicious now  and yet sophronius has another fear  leon how frail at best is mortal man this compound of divinity and passion for oh believe me midst this general horror while war with hideous strides stalks round our walls legions of evils gathering in his train my weakness robs my country of my thoughts and half my breast admits a private care  leon alas i know that care  you woo ormelia the daughter of the valiant theodore  his other joy and what he loves next war  soph ay friend for should this cloud of discontent once gather to a storm will it not blast our growing spring of love love did i say it is true my secret suit seemed not ungrateful but know that glorious maid adores her father nor marvel she is the daughter of his soul his spirit fierceness and his pride of virtue all glow within her breast refined and cast into a softer mould  hence spring my fears  leon there is resemblance in our lots sophronius thou know thy gentle sister fair eusebia smiles on my honest passion  yet thy father vows he will never sanctify her choice  it is true my ruined fortunes   soph prythee peace thy birth is noble and thy virtue godlike these give thee ample title to eusebia o could i call thee brother  soothing wish  and yet you are more already  you are my friend embrace wait we the will supreme  but see  my sister  enter eusebia eus brother the chiefs are summoned all to council i heard enquiry made for you and leon  soph i shall attend them  leon you will follow exit sophronius  leon let me first pay more pleasing duty here why sighs my fair our hearts are sure our own those manuel cannot part  oh why that tear i know it falls for leon  cruel fortune why was i born to spoil eusebias peace  eus i fear we have indulged our loves too far  as children venture in a calm to sea regardless of the cloud slowsweeping cross the vault of heaven and big with future ruin  leon yet let us not despair  heaven often afflicts for trial not destruction  time may come when my hearts truth my service in the war and all the virtuous labors of a life devoted to my country and to thee will melt thy fathers soul then shall he bless my toils and overpay me with thy beauties  eus could he but view thee with eusebias eyes  yet something whispers me weave done amiss why was our love first made a mystery why covered from the day and from my father who gave me right to fix my heart on thee twas folly if not worse  and manuels anger perhaps is providential  for till now his fondness still prevented my desires  leon that fondness was but humor  while he pleased thy tender age he but indulged himself thou never had a boon to ask till now   eus hah leon have a care i love thy virtue  that raised and that must justify my passion urge not a thought to shake my filial duty  i always held the name of father sacred  leon this rigor which i know not how to blame may crush the hope that yet supports my being i tremble while i speak  perhaps thy father means to compel thy virgin heart  if so  where will thy duty be or where thy love  eus those fears are vain  i cannot love another virtue itself forbids it and my heart flutters and tells me it is impossible my vows are thine oh spare a maidens blushes my every joy my every care is thine   leon o how shall i requite this wondrous goodness  eus once more i will essay my fathers temper  if he relents  it is all the happiness i wish on earth  if not  support me heaven  leon he must he must  or pitys fled from man who could behold unmoved such weeping beauty thou fairer than the mornings cloudless dawn thou sweeter than the vernal bloom that decks   eus away  i am a woman and a christian cease then these strains of ordinary lovers that wound our reason while they sooth our pride nor suits thy fondness with these times of danger courtship and dalliance are mere treason now thy country calls thee   leon i obey the call yet beauty is the just reward of valor  eus but

the fiery theodore my friend my patron and  my destined tool rage taunts reproaches discord broils ensue and ruin sure is made of such materials off then dependence  thou art burdensome a soul like mine disdains to live on alms it is well  and shall i pine with fond desire i love ormelia still  as nature prompts  sophronius loves her too  she slights my vows for the pert lispings of that downcheekd boy should this  but hold  the secretarys here  enter mervan mer what deep in thought lieutenant clear thy brow perhaps the wished for hour of vengeance comes to clip the towering wing of theodore  romans give me thy hand my mervan my best friend my souls true counterpart  i knew the business would thrive beneath thy wisdom  prythee tell me how did the shallow manuel take thy tale  mer you would laugh to see the old man chafe romanus sound but the name of theodore he frets like a galled jade he blames his sightless folly that never discerned how much the officious zeal of yesterday which cost us so much blood is puffed with pride and scorns to own a master  romans well said  my soul foresees much good from this  mer soon as i found that prejudice take root i scattered hints as was agreed between us that theodore in letters to our emperor had often complained of manuels government and thrown much blame upon his wayward age  romans i hope you touched that point but tenderly it surely was a task for all thy skill  mer do i not practice cunning under thee i spoke it not my friend as fit foundation to raise a certain proof upon but what prudent suspicion guessed and therefore wished him henceforth in judgment to compare this notice with theodores demeanor  romans thanks good mervan why what a ready instrument is manuel for knavery to work withal  merv why knavery we mean no ill to him or to our country  but sir my wrongs cry loudly for revenge  i have been abused by theodore  because i deal not in his boisterous trade of war he deems me but a beast that will be tame and patient of his burden  curses on him  sure i can feel a smart as well as he and vengeance has more shapes than one romanus  romans which he shall prove shortly i hope to see this fierce this blustering this allconquring hero that has refused us both his bauble daughter with vile contempt with insolence refused her hurled from his airy pinnacle of pride turned from his post disgraced marked for a traitor and hooted like a nuisance through aleppo  mer let me but see that day my souls at ease  romans so is not mine  thou know not half my purpose aside then when the pinching shame shall gripe him close and more than madness festers at his heart if thou should humbly ask him for his daughter let him contract his angry brow and tell thee he scorns alliance with a paltry scribe  mer it was his very answer to my suit  romans i found a like repulse  at least it is fit you think so aside  yet believe me my resentments burn not so strongly for myself as thee mine is a common destiny  it seems we petty men of war are slaves by office  mer but not by nature  romans thou art right my mervan and therefore to our work is it not better thus wisely to employ our active powers and set the secret springs of mischief going than to bedew our beards with childish tears and whimper in a corner for a toy  mer romanus i must ever thank thy goodness that saw me drooping with unmanly sorrow taught me revenge and weaned me from my follies  romans thy firmness charms me  prythee honest when does the council sit mervan  mer i guess ere now  romans then let us hence  this morning may afford some kind event to bless our utmost wishes ex  scene iii the back scene opens and discovers the council sitting manuel theodore sophronius izrail leon and other officers in council man indeed the progress of their arms is wondrous how has their hungry war devoured our land and like the dreadful rage of pestilence left a sad track of ruin in its course whole provinces are bent beneath the yoke and syrias better half is ababekers  soph yet may we hope my chiefs to save the other our men are high in blood and hot for action thanks to the foe for this nay all aleppo breathes

christian lives in his oerfevrish zeal to dictate now to men of cooler heads and sounder judgments  the hah what did manuel say  by all   iz nay hold for this may go too far  man izrail take heed his spleen may choke him else  the now in the name of honor and of arms what means this treatment am i reproached because i would have led thy dastard troops the nearest way to fame and taught them how to snatch a noble conquest glorys the soldiers mistress to be wooed where death has planted all his terrors round her or never to be won  had thy aleppians kept firm their ranks yon camp had smoked to

brought me hither not thy command but glorious thirst of honor and zeal highbeating in my countrys cause i came thy friend not vassal and as such was first received by this ungrateful city have thou forgot old manuel with what shouts of general joy what thundering peals of transport thy vile aleppians welcomed my arrival and hailed me like the genius of the land  man no more  i hold not confrence with a traitor  know henceforth i renounce thy vaunted friendship and from this moment ceases thy command we want no stranger sir to fight our battles my son the charge of our aleppian troops we do

immortal spirits of my brave ancestors whose laurelld deeds have swelled the golden trumpet of loud fame and ranked you with the caesars of the world was it for this i taught my soul to pant for high renown and burn with all your fires to be supplanted by a silken stripling a boy that trembles if his finger bleeds o blot accursed upon the name of soldier  soph sir i well know your merit and admire

cried all hail lord general hail great theodore  while the wise citizens still fond of change blessed the conceit and grinnd their approbation  i met the vile procession and although prudence had locked the organ of my speech sure they must see a lion in my eyes  the ungrateful senseless and inhuman villains what have i faced the rage of seasons round the dogstars beam and winters frozen

ruin and aleppos fate ex om  the end cymbeline  a tragedy altered from shakespeare  as it is performed at the theater royal in covent garden  by william hawkins m a late fellow of pembroke college and professor of poetry in the university of oxford  london printed for james rivington and james fletcher at the oxford theater in paternoster row mdcclix  price one shilling and sixpence  to the right honorable the countess of litchfield madam i have the honor of your ladyships permission to present to you a tragedy which though it met with numerous and unprecedented difficulties and discouragements in the theater will i hope be thought not altogether unworthy your protection in the world  indeed if the unpopularity of its late situation could in the least affect that degree of merit which your ladyships candor or the indulgence of the town may allow it to have it would ill become me to recommend it to my readers under the sanction of so polite and illustrious a name  but your ladyship has too much good sense as well as generosity to judge of this performance by mere appearances and accidental or unlucky circumstances and therefore though it will stand as a kind of memorial of the bad fortune and worse treatment of its author it may at the same time be a proper testimony of the high respect with which i am  madam your ladyships most obliged and most obedient servant william hawkins feb         preface the tragedy of cymbeline is in the whole economy of it one of the most irregular productions of shakespeare its defects however or rather its superfluities are more than equalled by beauties and excellencies of various kinds there is at the same time something so pleasingly romantic and likewise truly british in the subject of it that i flatter myself an attempt to reduce it as near as possible to the regular standard of the drama will be favorably received by all who are admirers of novelty when propriety is its foundation i have accordingly endeavored to newconstruct this tragedy almost upon the plan of aristotle himself in respect of the unity of time with so thorough a veneration however for the great father of the english stage that even while i have presumed to regulate and modernize his design i have thought it an honor to tread in his steps and to imitate his style with the humility and reverence of a son with this view i have retained in many places the very language of the original author and in all others endeavored to supply it with a diction similar thereunto so that as an unknown friend of mine has observed the present attempt is entirely new whether it be considered as an alteration from or an imitation of shakespeare   the difficulty of such an attempt as rational as it may be has a kind of claim i presume to the indulgence of the public especially as it has been attended likewise with disadvantages  for i found myself necessitated by my plan to drop some characters to contract others and to omit some scenes and incidents of an interesting nature  or rather to bring the substance and purport of them within the compass of a few short narrations  a loss irreparable this but that conveniences are likewise to be thrown into the opposite scale for as i hope i have not injured any characters by contracting them but have left them to all intents and in point of importance the same so i have had an opportunity of enlarging and improving some of the original parts those particularly of palador and philario the pisanio of shakespeare and by varying certain incidents and circumstances of giving a new cast to the whole drama  after all i am very far from meaning to detract from the merit of shakespeare or from insinuating that the plays of so exalted a genius require such newmodelling as the present in order to the rendering them useful or entertaining  i have ventured publicly to defend this great dramatic poet in the liberties he has taken but still shakespeare himself needs not be ashamed to wear a modern dress provided it can be made tolerably to fit him  the only question then will be whether the present alteration be a judicious one  and this with all due deference is left to the candor and justice of the public  it will be proper to acquaint the reader that this play was recommended some time since by a person of the first distinction to the manager of the other theater who declared that he had the very same altered play in his possession and that it was designed for representation on his stage our cymbeline therefore was obliged to take up his head quarters at covent garden where he has contended not only with the usual difficulties but also with others of an extraordinary nature  mrs bellamys declining the part of imogen has done the play incredible prejudice and convinces me of the vanity of striving against the stream of popularity in general or the weight of particular disadvantages  however i am under obligations to many of the performers for their best endeavors to do justice to my piece and for their zeal for its success to some i am indebted for real service whose names as comparisons are invidious i leave it to the judgment of the reader to supply  upon the whole i am at a loss to balance the account between myself and my fortune in this whimsical situation the kind assistance and i hope not extremely partial approbation of some adds as much to my credit and satisfaction as the delicacy or ill nature etc of others has deducted from my advantages  to my friends i return my sincere acknowledgments and best wishes to my enemies i shall say nothing till they are candid and sagacious enough to speak more plainly than they have hitherto done  and more to the purpose  prologue spoken by mr ross  britons the daring author of tonight attempts in shakespeares manly style to write he strives to copy from that mighty mind the glowing vein  the spirit unconfined  the figured diction that disdained control  and the full vigor of the poets soul  happy the varied phrase if none shall call this imitation that original  for other points our new adventrer tries the bards luxuriant plan to modernize and by the rules of ancient art refine the same eventful pleasing bold design our scenes awake not now the amorous flame nor teach soft swains to woo the tender dame content for bright examples sake to show a wife distressed and innocence in woe  for what remains the poet bids you see from an old tale what britons ought to be and in these restless days of wars alarms not melts the soul to love but fires the blood to arms your great forefathers scorned the foreign chain rome might invade and caesars rage in vain  those glorious patterns with bold hearts pursue to king to country and to honor true  oh then with candor and good will attend applaud the author in the cordial friend remember when his failings most appear it ill becomes the brave to be severe  look ages back and think you hear tonight an ancient poet still your chief delight due to a great attempt compassion take and spare the modern bard for shakespeares sake epilogue spoken by mrs vincent  well sirs  the business of the day is over and i am a princess and a wife no more  this bard of ours with shakespeare in his head may be welltaught but surely is illbred spouse gone coast clear wife handsome and what not we might have had a much genteeler plot what madness equals true poetic rage fine stuff a lady in a hermitage a pretty mansion for the blooming fair  no tea no scandal  no intriguing there   the gay beaumonde such hideous scenes must damn  what nothing modish but one cordial dram  yet after all the poet bids me say for your own credits sake approve the play you cannot for shame condemn old british wit i hope

on genius  an essay on genius inquire dispute reply and all you can say what is genius but the soul of man beam of that light which animates our frame alike in many but in none the same it is with our minds as with our bodies none in essence differ yet each knows his own marks of specific character we see that stamp on every mortal this is he nor varies more our present outward shape this man halfangel and the next halfape than do the mental powers what odds we find between a  s and a newtons mind ask you the cause first take it for a rule whatever the man the soul is not a fool she came in due perfection from the skies and all defect in grosser body lies body and soul at best but ill agree it is spirit wedded to infirmity a disproportioned match from whence proceeds the souls inaction through the bodys needs this truth once stated and the soul it is plain much on the filmy texture of the brain much on formations that escape our eyes on nice connections and coherencies and on corporeal organs must depend for her own functions exercise and end hence then the cause of all defects is seen for one wrong movement spoils the whole machine it is hence the several passions take their rise the seeds of virtue and the roots of vice hence notes peculiar or to young or old phlegmatic sanguine amorous or cold and hence from constitution such or such wit may take modes and genius oprate much the youthful bard a sprightly sanguine swain like ovid warbles in a lovesick strain with weaker passions but with sense more strong the melancholy young pursues his song mixture of humors motley genius shows it is seen methinks in herveys dancing prose why wonder then to mark the sons of rhyme gay serious turgid easy or sublime the soul and body closely thus allied vile is the folly as the sin of pride and one great truth the first of men will fit that nothing more precarious is than wit behold yon wretch that over the parish strays a babyman a drivler all his days with tongue outlolling and roundrolling eyes he grins against the sun and catches flies but for some secret flaws we cannot read that check her motions and her flights impede his soul perchance enriched with happiest thought had spoke like tully or like virgil wrote alas all souls are subject to like fate all sympathizing with the bodys state let the fierce fever burn through every vein and drive the madding fury to the brain naught can the fervor of his frenzy cool but aristotles selfs a parish fool nay in proportion lighter ails control the mental virtue and infect the soul ease is best convoy in our voyage to truth what man ere reasoned with a raging tooth a poet with a genius and without are the same creatures in the pangs of gout hence then we guess nor vain is the surmise why some are fools and none are always wise why genius differs in lifes every stage runs wild with youth and creeps with hobling age the soul uncumberd with the mortal clay knows no increase of strength nor fears decay a little art this secret may unfold that what can never die is never old by present powers perfection cease to scan for we may daily mourn the fall of man ah how bright wit possessed of every gift dwindled to folly and went mad in swift the mighty marlbrough whose great soul was proved upon the plains of blenheim where unmoved amidst confusion horror and despair he viewed around the dreadful scenes of war in peaceful thought the field of death surveyed to fainting squadrons sent the timely aid inspired repulsed battalions to engage and taught the doubtful battle where to rage even he the springs of nature in decay and all the vital functions worn away unable now to conquer realms or buy with idiot gesture and unmeaning eye sits a spectatour in the foremost row and gapes at heroes in a puppetshew eschew presumption every halflearnd elf the noblest writer does not know himself turn over mighty miltons raptured page observe his strength his majesty his rage his numbers like the almightys thunders roll and strike an awful pleasure to the soul we joy in ruin and are almost pained to see the late lost paradise regained this work himself judged best tell me who read was not the mighty milton blind indeed genius again by infrence apt we see the same in species differs in degree propensities are strong and few men yet but have a relish for some kind of wit homer is monarch of the epic choir yet virgil snatched a brand of homers fire the daring homers allimpetuous strain like a hot courser bore him over the plain the muse of virgil that affected state speeds not so swiftly but she keeps her rate to those though meet to yield the glory due lucan and statius have their merits too each writer is distinguished in his way grand sophocles or trifling seneca all to their favorite art will lay pretense it is inclination or it is excellence midst clouds of dullness gleams of wit have shone like the faint burstings of an april sun grant you what is past and it will less perplex to ask why woman is the weaker sex why the extremes of female wits are such they mostly say too little or too much beautys soft frame for other ends designed faints under toil of body or of mind kind heaven that gave them beauty all things gave the soundest scholar is a womans slave glibly their tongues the pretty lispers move and nonsense will be eloquence in love yet have we known superior nymphs that can assert an equal power and rival man born natures wonders in all shapes to please to speak with eloquence to write with ease to model laws and rule a factious realm witness eliza at old englands helm nay different countries different genius make souls modes peculiar to their climate take baeotias foggy air was marked of old athenian wits were bright and theban cold just view near home the surface of the ball in holland genius is mechanical in france the muses breath a livelier strain they skip in italy and strut in spain in england oh how manifold our rhyme where genius is uncertain as the clime we show consult the press the stage the schools all sorts of wise men and all sorts of fools we count our numbers of illustrious name that climbed by different paths the hill of fame ye bards of britain that have shined in song oh let the muse survey your tuneful throng chaucer who notes not with a merry glee thy genius full of quaint festivity who reads must see and seeing must admire bright spencers fancy and bold miltons fire genius was studied wit in artful ben but flowed spontaneous dryden from thy pen twas thine in manly richness to excel with twice thy labor few write half so well fletcher had copious energy of mind cowleys was wit let loose and wycherlys confined who but applauds soft otways melting lay the negligent simplicity of gay the genuine mirth that tickled butlers vein wallers terse sonnet and garths nervous strain such various forms does genius take to please in row it is elegance in prior ease in lee it is flame that lays half nature waste and in the courtly addison it is taste it is comic grace in steel that shunned offense in pope it is sweetness purity and sense it is humor in the dean unequalled yet and congreve who could stand thy twoedged wit to several bards their several virtues fall but to inimitable shakespeare all shakespeare  o phoebus lend thy golden lyre give me the beams of thy celestial fire avaunt ye vulgar poets listen round and all parnassus thunder with the sound while the muse dwells on shakespeares sacred name and down times rapid tide bears his immortal fame  the raptures over  i pant in vain to sing droops the weak muse and flags her languid wing she sinks beneath the theme she quits her lays shakespeare she named and silence is her praise assert we then the force of genius lies in verse alone are poets only wise we hinted genius is of various kind and vast the province of the human mind who well performs his fateallotted part by strength of nature or by dint of art whatever the subject of his happy skill the product is the work of genius still what honied dew distilled from tullys tongue what soft persuasion on his accents hung so smoothly strong the sweet oration flows it is plain the muses sometimes speak in prose bid him write verses who but will agree cib  r can make as good an ode as he it is naught but genius that in all presides commands in battle and in council guides sad woes ensued where fools have squadrons led for what is caesars arm without his head nor needs the muse to distant regions roam genius appears in every shape at home a glorious list in british annals shines of statesmen chiefs philosophers divines long lucubrations over the midnight oil gave to the world a newton and a boil each alma matter boasts her favorite own oxford her bradley cambridge sanderson it is not a puny judge can find a flaw in sherlocks gospel or in h  s law what plenteous streams of easy sense we see in fluent tillotsons divinity yet fluent tillotson had naught to say had not the solid barrow led the way others may fright you from the tempters gin but south will make a man ashamed of sin nay some we know and knowing we must smile blessed with a talent but without a style hammond stands foremost of this awkward line a rumbling writer but a deep divine who ever knew so strange a vein as his or so much learning in parenthesis it would tire the muse and reader to proceed from reasoning chillingworth to florid seed the works of christian labor to explore of hooker pearson laud and numbers more that drew their manly quills for righteous ends the churchs champions and religions friends i grieve to think what souls have been destroyed by wit perverse and genius misemployd for naught awakes so soon the vengeful rod as wisdom flying in the face of god the force of reason is of finite length this giant that attempts beyond his strength our boasted light of nature feeble spark guides for a while but leaves us in the dark as glimmering vapors with a pallid ray light us to quagmires and to gulphs betray how vain is mortal man above his sphere poor knowing fool just wise enough to err go span the globe the worlds strong bounds oreleap empty the yawning caverns of the deep count all the fibers of that reptiles thigh catch me the trembling sunbeams as they fly then take thy understandings cableline examine god and measure truths divine grant me kind heaven to see ere i explain correct the false ambition of my brain and on my mind this maxim printed be the christian virtue is humility happier the simple swain the rustic fool that never took the polish of a school than swelled with pride a master of all arts with shaftsburys cunning and with st johns parts much wit obscene has crept through every age but lewdness riots on the modern stage o shame to arts  our poets may defy the bards of old with rome and athens vie may boast invention penetration wit all qualities for either drama fit may touch the passions with enchanting art and take minutest copies of the heart yet of past times the panegyric be that pagan wits were better men than we genius depends then on the bodys frame  tell me will genius never be the same or will the difference we to day espy subsist in souls to all eternity such question put if reason may be bold in humble wise conjecture to unfold she seems to dictate and she fears not blame that things once differing never are the same here or hereafter in what light you will a man you know is soul and body still and still corporeal organs and their use must correspondent faculties produce but body in that happier state refined shall leave it is old imfirmities behind and every soul be perfect in her kind consult material objects and we see gods power declared by sweet variety the different seasons different beauties bring it is not one color paints the jolly spring the sun gay giant travels in his might smiles from her orb the placid queen of night each insect that eludes the nicest eye one of the myriads floating in the sky his makers praise proclaim as loudly can as oceans tyrant king the great leviathan look through all nature the vast tracts of space each being has it is proper power and place the angelic hosts that round the godhead wait and issue forth the ministers of fate have their respective provinces and know what part to act above and what below messiahs sword to michaels might is given and gabriel is ambassador of heaven hence then from infrence little forced we find that souls will differ and excel in kind but when admitted to the realms of joy what certain office what precise employ shall exercise the several powers of each present conception not presumes to reach enough from general principles to show that one great point of bliss will be to know to touch perfection in a favorite art and grieve no longer but to know in part to mark where truth in her recesses lies pursue her without toil and grasp her as she flies the sage logician then shall

shall be hurled may count the lamps that light a nobler world and subtle geometry shall lend her line and take dimensions of the plan divine what sounds shall flow from rhetrics silver tongue how sweet her eloquence her voice how strong her wondrous talents graceful she displays and thunders forth the heavenly monarchs praise hark hark the raptured bard has struck his lyre blazes aloft the true poetic fire ten thousand vast ideas swell his mind imagination ranges unconfined now softly trills now loudly sounds the strain he sings jehovahs alltriumphant reign and music fills the unmeasurable plain he charms the winged hosts that hover by and spirits shout applause that rends the sky such then the future pleasures of the mind so solid manly rational refined productive ever of the truest joy and sure to satisfy but not to cloy how vain at once appear all worldly schemes the tricks of statesmen and ambitions dreams low the designs the wisest mortals lay and vile the brutal pleasures of a day awake awake pursue the proper plan virtue and knowledge only make a man despise the world a better fortune try and calculate for immortality idiots by natural organs ill supplied untutored louts whose parts were never tried hereafter hidden excellence may show and rank with souls that scorned them here below but for the sot that sees yet slights his rule the wilful novice the industrious fool that lulls with sloth or steeps in vice his sense the slave of pleasure or of indolence how wretched is his fate fears he not pain the gnawing viper and the galling chain still wretched is the blockheads fate  for why eternal ignorance is misery who goodly talents have should talents use but still with upright and with virtuous views for application sometimes less pretense to merit has than barren indolence nothing fatigues the soul or tires the brain like lust of empire or the thirst of gain and these oerruling in an active mind spoil nations and make havoc of mankind ingenious tyrants only make us slaves were all men fools sure no men would be knaves ambition take the scepter and the robe spread thy huge greatness over half the globe lo the world bursts it is natures dying day the sun is dark the planets melt away now boast thy genius exercise thy parts recount thy feats and recognize thy arts alas thou cursest thy too pregnant brain and knowledge is acute to quicken pain the nature the importance and the end of genius such be wise then and attend how we may best our natural powers improve and qualify the soul for bliss above genius lies hid like metal in the mine till searching education bids it shine it is but a glorious few of deathless name have found without a guide their road to fame nor slight their province if we justly rate who till the mind and genius cultivate much penetration and no little toil must try the strength and temper of the soil some minds richnaturd like a fruitful field to little culture ample harvests yield others assiduous labor must secure they owe their goodly produce to manure true judgment too should mark where talent lies and soon as seen indulge propensities for different objects different fancies strike genius we said before is not alike popes forward muse procured him early fame he lispd in numbers for the numbers came anothers unharmonious taste is such sooner than poetry he would learn high dutch yet he peculiar talents may display and prove a very wonder in his way why must all mortals seek one common praise is there no garland but a wreath of bays to steep parnassus summit most sublime it is not a shortbreathed pegasus can climb yet though the panting jade would fain stand still the blind orbilius flogs him up the hill some seem to think that genius may be sold but wit is not like honor bought with gold to foreign regions wealthy idiots roam though fools of all men sure should stay at home anothers heir through markhams forms must pass he goes a blockhead and returns an ass he gapes he strains he sweats yet gets no higher for nature put him down a country squire others of lively parts but wretched fate want nothing but a fortune to be great sometimes among the vulgar herd we find strong marks and features of a heavenly mind the village swains a wit he knows not how and i have seen philosophy at plough how are our hopes by present chances crossed what oafs make p  sns and what wits are lost when now your genius near to ripeness grown begins to glow with raptures all it is own ply it with chosen books of various kinds for reading is the food of hungry minds moderate and wholesome will suffice your need it is not how much but how and what you read to rise with appetite is always best gluttons devour much more than they digest it is vain for ever over books to pore reading does much but meditation more mere slavish plodding never yet prevailed see yon lank student to his folio nailed he reads at home abroad at meals in bed and has five thousand volumes in his head yet little to perfection has be brought for he has read so much he never thought the youth more sprightly and the glowing bard that had as lief go dig as study hard applies by fits and at his fancys call little he reads but has that little all he sees and he enjoys his authors worth gathers his flowers and culls his beauties forth he dwells with transport on a favorite part and clasps each striking passage to his heart your models choose from authors of first rate he cannot write who dares not emulate to father homers sovereign poetry rome owes her virgil and our milton we high as the towering strains of pindar soar great flaccus was what pindar was before for present times to emulate is all it is not in wit to be original leave books  and go to company and then leave company and go to books again the studious mind it is useful to unbend in pleasing converse with a social friend for cordial juices of the generous vine refresh the weary and the dull refine over flowing bowls rebounds the sparkling wit and sure no poet was a milksop yet intemprate revelling alone consumes the vital powers and clouds the brain in fumes horace expertest handler of the lyre in rich falernum quaffd poetic fire a jovial bard how pleasant are his strains how much good humor in his writings reigns he laughs though angry and will still delight his verse is satyr but it is not spite how does his muse with free politeness rail while juvenals is thrashing with a flail scholars should know all fire in motion lies and whet their parts with manly exercise dullness sits slumbering in an elbow chair but the gay muses love to take the air the shades of night are fled before the morn the mountains echoe to the cheerful horn men dogs and horses neighings shouts and cries shake with tumultuous jollity the skies the chase begins they pant in every vein now climb the hills steep brow then scour along the plain such sports as these enliven they impart warmth to the brain and gladness to the heart but if due aid to genius may be lent much too it suffers by impediment unhappy is the bard that deals in rhyme when wit is obsolete and sense a crime when the weak muse in a degenerate age crawls from the press or lamely treads the stage no longer dares to noble heights advance but chimes in song or trifles in romance infected by false taste great souls we see who r  d  n can nature paint like thee yet would a genius toy as thou have done and spin morality like grandison how shall the genuine bard escape from fools that judge by narrow or by partial rules a thousand witlings maul his mangled name and yelping critics hunt him out of fame nay censure so perversely plays her tricks that she will measure wit by politics and some with hollow heads but faces big will almost swear apollo is a whig men of true genius and of real use can oxford that vile nazareth produce and yet impartial sarum did declare once on a time there was one scholar there remark somewhere made by the late bishop b  r  t  oxford my joy my wonder and my boast my constant triumph and my daily toast o let thy son his willing duty pay and grateful pour the tributary lay rescue thy fame from slander thrown by slaves and snatch thy honor from the gripe of knaves  i spare my pen when naught to prove i find for who can see the sun when all are blind nor came repine we at thy equal praise the learned sisters may divide the bays  but in this wooden age these dastard times oerrun with follies and foulstaind with crimes when vice gigantic takes her public stand and bids corruption deluge all the land sculks now no more in holes from place to place but stares astonished virtue in the face when chiefs blaspheme the god for whom they fight and all religion is to be polite in such a day as this secure to steer with spotless honor from contagion clear to cherish still the dying patriot fire unawed by menace and unbought by hire to own and to defend the christian name and fix on infidels the mark of shame is the first point of praise and let the nine sound with their harps this praise fair oxford thine it is not a minor bard can hope to please and struggle through discouragements like these for ever sure must damp poetic rage false taste loose manners and a slavish age if these are plagues still more remain behind wits tell you fortune frowns upon their kind alas what sources of obstruction lie in the great common woe of poverty whose case is hardest it is not quickly said or theirs that work or theirs that write for bread the starveling curate the fat dean supplies one makes divinity and the other buys  how sinks the needy wretch beneath himself that sells his parts to ministerial pelf yet such for state necessities are fit for nothing helps a villain out like wit sure of all writers poets should not lack twill spoil your pegasus to make him hack the muse expands her wings before you ask she loves employment but she hates a task to dryden the proud manager could say on pain of thirst and hunger bring your play the play appears in breach of every rule and want makes dryden sometimes half a fool such from without the causes that we find obstruct the operations of the mind within too genius has it is enemies and in ourselves too often our hindrance lies our passions vices follies wit misguide intemprance anger hastiness and pride we said debauches will oblivion bring and mix dull lethe with the muses spring the mind is then most vigorous when serene crude are the halfformd dictates of the spleen what then inspires the sharp satyric page often fixed ill nature seldom sudden rage some giddy fancies every object hit it is folly to be prodigal of wit the verse is shortlived that is premature the muse though never slow should still be sure these are thy honors blackmore this thy gain that nonsense came in vollies from thy brain conceit with empty vapors puffs the mind and makes an author to his errors blind it is the first praise to make the next to mend go court the censure of an able friend procure the sanction of a learned few who knows what mortals may your works review true modesty for wit may sometimes pass but every coxcomb is as such an ass the best productions some defects will stain and he affronts mankind who dares be vain  o that my muse assistance could impart as far as nature may be helped by art ingenious art is natures truest friend and what god made it is only she can mend for me however i covet lasting fame and pant with longings for a poets name yet let my soul confess a nobler aim give me kind heaven still higher point to reach give me to practice what i strive to teach my standing rules of daily conduct be faith honor justice candor charity careless of false reproach or vain applause be worth my eulogy and truth my cause o may i wield an independent pen a friend to virtue not a tool to men in perseverance placing all my glory while tories whigs and all men call me tory warm in my breast may patriot passion glow

the sense and plain import of the original  the greatest liberty i have taken is in the two last stanzas wherein i have ventured to mention some striking circumstances rather from the authority of the holy scriptures than that of the hymn itself a liberty which i hope will be indulged to the solemnity of the occasion  a paraphrase on the te deum i god of the worlds eternally supreme hail thou first

this day without sin o lord have mercy upon us have mercy upon us o lord let thy mercy lighten upon us as our trust is in thee o lord in thee have i trusted let me never be confounded an essay on the ancient and modern drama occasioned by mr masons elfrida and the letters prefixed to it  an essay on the ancient and modern drama i have often read with much pleasure the ingenious mr masons dramatic poem entitled elfrida together with the preparatory letters with which that gentleman introduces it to the public this piece is professedly written on the model of the ancient greek tragedy and though i flatter myself the objections i have to the principles laid down in those letters are not removed by this muchlabourd attempt yet i will readily own the design is executed with a skilful hand and in some respects deserves the attention of the present writers of the english drama i did not therefore undertake this argument with any inclination to differ from a person of his known taste and greatly admired abilities but purely in vindication of the theory i have had the honor to deliver in a course of lectures to the university of oxford in which with a particular view to the justification of shakespeare i have ventured to advance and defend a system in some material points inconsistent with that under present consideration neither am i unaware of the great disadvantage i have to contend against when i oppose a celebrated writer whose sentiments are countenanced by the practice of the ancient poets and whose pen is drawn under the banner of aristotle himself a disadvantage which the usage of later writers and the almost concurrent voice of modern criticism by modern criticism i mean that plan upon which the english drama had been formed for a course of many generations and which mr mason and other critics and poets have in our days attempted both by precept and example to supersede and explode in favor of the ancient system perhaps will be thought little enough to counterbalance however as in matters of taste we ought only i apprehend to appeal to the genuine dictates of goodsense reason and nature which an implicit veneration for any name ancient or modern may possibly prevent our regarding so if prejudices on both sides were removed it would probably appear that the victory is rather to be divided than determined and that without depreciating the real merit and excellency of the ancient poets we may yet safely defend the principles on which the moderns reject their writings as the absolute and everlasting standard of dramatic composition i mean principally with regard to the three great unities of action time and place  what i have to say therefore upon these subjects i submit without farther apology to the judgment of the intelligent and impartial reader advertising him only in this place that he is not to expect a methodical treatise of elaborate criticism but only a train of occasional thoughts and reflections as they occurred to me upon the perusal of the poem of elfrida and the letters prefixed to it  had i intended says mr mason in his first letter for i choose to repeat his own words to prevent misapprehension to give an exact copy of the ancient drama your objections to the present poem would be unanswerable but my design was much less confined i meant only to pursue the ancient method so far as is probable a greek poet were he alive would now do in order to adapt himself to the genius of our times and the character of our tragedy according to this notion every thing was to be allowed to the present taste which nature and aristotle could possibly dispense with and nothing of intrigue or refinement was to be admitted at which ancient judgment could reasonably take offense good sense as well as antiquity prescribed an adherence to the three great unities these therefore were strictly observed it is evident from this passage the ingenious author would have us consider the laws of aristotle and the practice of antiquity relating to the great unities as manifestly founded in the first principles of nature and good sense and accordingly in order to adapt himself to the present taste no farther than might be justly allowable we find him deviating from the rules and practice of antiquity but in two instances first in the choice of a story in which love is the predominant passion and secondly in which characters are represented as nearly approaching to private ones as tragic dignity would permit upon our authors hypothesis indeed these are perhaps almost the only deviations that could be allowed him and the point must at once be given up if the theory be true which is here in so positive a manner advanced for satisfaction therefore in this matter it may be useful in the first place to observe that the action of the ancient drama when brought to the perfection in which aristotle found it was so strictly one and the fable so absolutely simple and almost totally abhorrent from incident at least from what mr mason calls contrivance refinement and intrigue that the constitution of the drama did not so properly require as suppose and imply a correspondent unity of time and place nay usually we find among the ancient greek poets the entire action of the drama was brought within the compass of the representation itself and indeed if exact nature and strict propriety are indispensably to be the objects of the dramatic poets attention upon all occasions this must be allowed to be the most perfect model of tragedy and consequently aristotle himself seems to have indulged the tragic muse too far when in conformity with the sometime practice of the greek poets he has prescribed a day as the due and regular boundary of all dramatic action for certainly a day cannot really be comprised within the space of five hours any more than a year or any precise duration whatsoever the truth is poetry was the mother of criticism not criticism of poetry and accordingly this great philosopher formed his simple notions and rules upon the best plan of the drama then extant but i cannot think it will by any means follow that those rules are in all points of perpetual and necessary obligation for why was it not in itself as agreeable to nature and reason for the poets to admit contrivance and policy design and intrigue into the constitution of the fable as it could possibly be to confine themselves to the representation of the most simple and uniform action especially as they hereby improved and heightened that perplexity and distress which are the great sources of delight in dramatic entertainment i say this latitude of design is not in itself unreasonable or unnatural because it is not to be dissembled that the liberty contended for would indeed be as it has been in the hands of the unskilful and injudicious an inlet to confusion and absurdity however it will not surely be denied that there is in fact a very material difference between incidents and the variety of designs and contrivances that occasion them and mere bustle and business in his contempt of which word mr mason seems willing to involve the whole system of dramatic intrigue the general theory i would therefore advance is this for i would not be understood to assert it admits of no exception that it is not barely the privilege but often even the duty of the dramatic poet to adapt himself to the vicissitudes of public taste and to represent human life and human actions as he finds them and if in pursuance of this design he may think it expedient to make choice of a subject of such a complicated nature as cannot with ease and consistency be dispatched within the statutable limits of time and place i cannot see why we may not indulge him with a proportionable allowance of each in order to prevent infinitely greater absurdities and inconsistencies than that allowance can possibly produce that is those confused and precipitate action and all this while the extensiveness of the design provided it be executed with judgment in other respects deserves rather to be looked upon as an excellence and an improvement upon the old model than to be placed to the account either of the ignorance or the inattention of the writer of which more hereafter  there is that sovereign quality in poetry to use the words of the ingenious author of the notes on the epistle to augustus which the poet horace in the following passage ille per extensum funem mihi posse videtur ire poeta meum qui pectus inaniter angit irritat mulcet falsis terroribus implet ut magnus et modo me thebis modo ponit athenis considers as a kind of magic virtue which transports the spectator into all places and makes him occasionally assume all persons the resemblance holds also in this that it is effects are instantaneous and irresistible rules art decorum all fall before it it goes directly to the heart and gains all purposes at once hence it is that speaking of a real genius possessed of this commanding power horace in the lines above quoted ille per extensum etc pronounces him emphatically the poet it being more especially this property which of itself discovers the true dramatist and secures the success of his performance not only without the assistance of art but in direct opposition to it is clearest dictates this passage which i have quoted verbatim abating a few expressions in it exactly coincides with my sentiment upon this head and the application which the author makes of it in favor of corneille may i presume be made with equal propriety at least in behalf of our shakespeare  i am sensible all this while that this great prince and father of the english stage is supposed by mr mason to have shown a total disregard of all the rules of the drama in compliance merely with the taste of the times i must own i could have been glad to have seen fewer things supposed upon this subject i will take the liberty likewise to suppose that this great poet saw no legal or necessary restraint upon the force and impetuosity of his genius with regard to the unities of action time and place that he considered the laws relating to them as merely local and temporary well adapted indeed to the simple genius of ancient tragedy but in themselves and the reason of things dispensable upon the supposition of a dramatic plan of a more extensive and complicated nature his opinion might be like the current one mentioned in mr masons second letter that the strict adherence to the unities restrains the genius of the poet by the simplicity of it is conduct diminishes the pathos of the fable and by the admission of a continued chorus prevents that agreeable embarrass which awakens our attention and interests our passions  however that the nature of dramatic poetry will not only admit of a more extensive model than the tragedies of the greek poets furnish us with but is also improveable by the same if it cannot be proved may at least i think be inferred even from the doctrine of aristotle himself this great critic it is very well known calls the fable the soul of tragedy with a manifest eye to which expression mr dryden observes that aristotle places the fable first non quoad dignitatem sed quoad fundamentum and indeed we need only refer the reader to the simple arguments of aeschylus and even of euripides and sophocles for the most part too to convince him that the fable upon the ancient plan of the drama cannot properly be said to be the soul of the poem in any other sense than as it is the subject of it nay this is in a great measure the case even of those ancient tragedies which are of the implex kind and as such esteemed most excellent by our philosopher one main argument used by him for the priority of the fable in the constituent parts of tragedy is taken from the consideration of the sudden revolutions and discoveries the sea arist poet chap    as he calls them which distinguish the tragedies we are speaking of from those of the simplest kind these are the means says he by which tragedy more particularly captivates and engages  the mind and affections  now if this doctrine be applied to the modern drama it seems to me not only an apology for but in effect a recommendation of the incidents and revolutions which are infinitely more numerous upon the british stage than they were upon that of athens and are so offensive to squeamish judgments unless it can be proved that these under the direction of a good judgment do not contribute to or rather constitute that variety which aristotle plainly refers to in the passage quoted or that such variety in modern plays has not a proportionable influence on the passions upon which as mr mason rightly has observed it is the business of the tragic muse directly to strike  if therefore the fable be the soul of tragedy i will venture to assert there is more soul in a good modern tragedy than in the best ancient one and that mr dryden might very properly and therefore gravely call secret intrigues the beauties of our modern stage indeed that great man in some occasional remarks he made on mr rymers reflections on the tragedies of fletcher etc makes no scruple to give the preference to our english poets before the ancients under this very article of enquiry next show says he in what ancient tragedy was deficient for example in the narrowness of it is plots and fewness of persons and try whether that be not a fault in the greek poets and whether their excellency was so great when the variety was visibly so little or whether what they did was not very easy to be done  in opposition to this the following words of the ingenious author of the notes etc already referred to may possibly be urged an unity says he speaking of the two dramas and even simplicity in the conduct of the fable is a perfection in each for the course of the affections is diverted and weakened by the intervention of what we call a double plot and even by a multiplicity of subordinate events though tending to a common end and of persons though all of them some way concerned in promoting it the like consideration shows the observance of this rule to be essential in just comedy for when the attention is split on so many interfering objects we are not at leisure to observe nor do we fully enter into the truth of representation in any of them the sense of humor as of the pathos depending very much on the continued and undiverted operation of it is object upon us but in answer to this i will venture to assert in my turn that the intervention of what we call a doubleplot a competent number not multiplicity of subordinate events tending to a common end and of persons all of them some way concerned in promoting it do not weaken but ease and relieve the course of the affections and also that in comedy the attention is really quickened even by being split on so many interfering objects  that different and opposite characters set off and illustrate each other  and that we are enabled by a proper variety of personages more precisely to observe and fully to enter into the truth of representation in all of them and consequently that a comedy with a doubleplot artfully conducted and filled judiciously not crammed with incidents and intrigue in which the several persons of the drama have room to exercise and display themselves attains it is end which is the rotation of characters and their specific differences as this author well observes more effectually than the simple and contracted comedy of the ancients but this matter i have handled more at large see lectures elsewhere and in the mean time let these respective opinions be left to the decision of fact and experience  to return to mr mason  i should be loath indeed to see incidents bustle and business supply the place of simplicity nature and pathos which it is not to be denied is the case in some modern performances but that the former are likewise very consistent with the latter and that such consistency and union is one great point of dramatic composition as calculated for the rational entertainment of an audience may be exemplified in many illustrious instances particularly in the tragedies of shakespeare it is true this inimitable poet is not so greatly remarkable for depth of plot and intricacy of contrivance as for the historical continuation of his design which by the way is indeed carried to an unreasonable length in some of his plays but however as such historical continuation necessarily implies a great variety of incidents and revolutions it is fairly reducible to the same head of disquisition shakespeare indeed for the most part formed his dramatic plans from history or romance and therefore has no extraordinary claim to the glory of invention either as to the subject of his tragedies or the conduct of his plots his excellencies for the most part are purely poetical but this is far from being the case of all our dramatic writers the groundwork of the greatest part of our english tragedies is indeed historical but the superstructure is their own the whole business of plot intrigue and contrivance is generally the work of the poets and a work when executed with art and judgment that shows them to be superior at least to their forefathers of greece in the ample field of invention the first point in poetry and therefore i should think some of mr masons expressions relating to the kind assistance of the violin to the distress of the hero or the poet on the british stage may in some measure be retorted upon himself and those whose cause he espouses for though an intermediate space between the acts may be requisite for the purposes of the modern drama and even to save appearances of the probability of the design yet i can by no means admit these prudential pauses to be proofs in themselves of the distress or barrenness of the writer methinks to the relief of these the ancient chorus seems more peculiarly adapted when the drama by reason of the scantiness or if you please simplicity of it is matter and the narrowness of it is plots stood in absolute need of such seasonable and friendly interposition but to the chorus i am to pay my compliments again by and by   it should be observed here i am supposing all this while that notwithstanding the extensiveness of design in modern tragedies a due and even scrupulous regard is to be had to consistency and uniformity of plot and action that there is to be but one grand central point as it were in which the several underplots incidents turns and vicissitudes of the drama are finally to terminate and that though the great business of the poet under this article be to perplex and embarrass his audience and to play with their passions at pleasure yet he is to take care that the unravelling of the whole and the several parts be easy and natural and the labyrinths of his plots such as according to mr addisons expression upon another occasion may be justly deemed a regular confusion if proper care and caution be taken as to these particulars i confess i am apt to look upon the transgression of the letter of the old laws of tragedy as offenses rather against the custom and usage of antiquity than the dictates of reason and nature and as great a veneration as i have for the ancient poets cannot possibly think i am maintaining an argument to the prejudice of their real merit by endeavoring to assert the liberty of modern poets and to rescue the drama from aristotles see mr masons third letter magna charta of restraint  to speak freely i must own farther i cannot subscribe to a theory that condemns at one dash almost every compliance with public taste and the genius of a people as mere complaisance and servility i believe a greek poet now alive would adapt himself to the taste of the times in more instances than mr mason would allow and that these have been occasionally more or less consulted and indulged by all poets in all ages not that i am of mr southerns opinion see his preface to the fatal marriage that every reasonable man will and ought to govern in the pleasures he pays for for in such case hamlet must walk off the stage to make room for harlequin  i would neither servilely indulge public taste nor yet selfsufficiently despise it  i am willing upon this occasion once more to shelter myself under the authority of dryden  one reason of that success says he in the above cited remarks is in my opinion this that shakespeare and fletcher have written to the genius of the age and nation in which they lived for though nature as he mr rymer objects is the same in all places and reason too the same yet the climate the age the dispositions of the people to whom a poet writes may be so different that what pleased the greeks would not satisfy an english audience  and if they proceeded upon a foundation of truer reason to please the athenians than shakespeare and fletcher to please the english it only shows that the athenians were a more judicious people but the poets business is certainly to please the audience  whether our english audience have been pleased hitherto with acorns as he calls it or with bread is the next question that is whether the means which shakespeare and fletcher have used in their plays to raise those passions beforenamed be better applied to the ends by the greek poets than by them and perhaps we shall not grant him this wholly let it be yielded that a writer is not to run down with the stream or to please the people by their own usual methods but rather to form form their judgments it still remains to be proved that our theater needs this total reformation  the faults which he hs found in their designs are rather wittily aggravated in many places than reasonably urged and as much may be returned on the greeks by one who were as witty as himelf  mr dryden is here compang the ancients with the moderns in regard to the conduct and command of the two great tragical passions pity and terror and the comparison concludes to the advantage of the latter  a little farther he proceeds thus to conclude thereore if the plays of the ancients are more correctly plotted ours are more beautifully written and if we can raise passions as high on worse foundations it shows our genius in tragedy is greater for in all other parts of it the english have manifestly excelled them  for the fable itself it is in the english more adorned with episodes and larger than in the greek poets consequently more diverting for if the action be but one and that plain without any counterturn of design or episode i e underplot how can it be so pleasing as that of the english which have both underplot and a turned design which keeps the audience in expectation of the catastrophe wereas in the greek poets we see through the who design at first i do lot use this as an accurate piece of criticism nor would be understood to oppose the authority of mr dryden to the ipse dixit of aristotle in general who has certainly a right to be heard first in critical as well as philosophical matters with a proportionable consideration of the age he lived in the only point in debate is whether he can be supposed in the nature of things from the clear idea he had formed of the greek drama to be qualified to give poetical laws to all posterity  public taste it is probable as mr dryden intimates ries in different countries according to the nature of the climate and the constitution of the people however there are some certain fixed and acknowledged principles of good sense nature and reason that are as mr rymer observes equally and universally in all ages and nations at least all civilized ones the same i believe there has been hardly any age so illiterate whimsical or corrupted in this sense as to explode these standing principles such for instance among many others are the following that the drama is to be the true image and representation of nature that this representation can only be exhibited under an infinite variety of actions designs characters manners sentiments and expressions that with regard to all and each of these propriety consistency and probability are most exactly to be observed that the motives to all actions the springs of all passions the grounds of all prejudices the peculiarities of all tempers have one common foundation and are productive of their correspondent effects in all times and places  the knowledge of these things is the knowledge of nature in which the great arcana of all poetry and particularly dramatic are reposited to these therefore it is the dramatic poets care most heedfully to attend and to these he may attend in fact very consistently with a disregard of the laws of the old drama as might be instanced in many of our best modern plays and in almost all of shakespeares  it is indeed nothing but this attention that has so eminently raised and preserved the reputation of these latter notwithstanding the poets absolute neglect or rather defiance of the great unities contended for as essential to the drama and it is as certain that where this attention is wanting either through ignorance or carelessness the most regular observance of these unities will be found utterly insufficient for the true purposes of stagepoetry  for these and the like reasons i think one may venture to conclude that the practice of the ancients is by no means a necessary standard of dramatic writing and that the laws relating to the several unities of action time and place though they do indeed constitute a particular form or species of the drama and we will grant the most exact too yet are by no means essential to the nature of it whatever is so cannot be violated or infringed without contradiction to the common judgment of mankind and disgusting at least the more rational part of an audience and accordingly every defect in the particulars abovementioned is always received with proportionable marks of disapprobation but the case is quite different in respect of the liberties shakespeare has taken which therefore i can never think absurd or unnatural in themselves and i am the more confirmed in this opinion because johnson fletcher and many others who were confessedly acquainted with the genius of ancient tragedy and generally speaking not only affected art and regularity in their writings but even depended principally upon these for the success of them did nevertheless on many occasions hold themselves free from the obligation of the laws at present in question  but herein our modern refiners will say they judged wrong and as to shakespeare if he has escaped the severity of censure upon this head it must be ascribed wholly to that complaisance which every generation has thought due to his excellencies in the higher beauties of poetry  now this answer and something to this effect must be the answer does itself suppose that the most punctual observance of the old laws has no connection with the great beauties of poetry but is only at best the mechanical part of the drama however it is presumed that the great name of shakespeare scorns to be protected by the complaisance of his countrymen and that the liberties he has taken are very far from being indefensible  for is it more improper and irrational or does it require less force of of genius and knowledge of nature to trace as it were a passion from it is first rise through it is progress and to it is final issue as that of jealousy in othello or of ambition in macbeth than to represent it only at a stated period and at a particular crisis or if the poet thinks proper to shift the scene from a palace to a heath or from venice to cyprus is it at all more inconvenient or impossible for his audience to attend him than it was to give him the meeting and suppose themselves in the place where he laid his first scene it does not at all appear to me that a greater degree of implicit faith is required in one instance than in the other for he may with equal probability do both ut magus as has been hinted above and he can do neither but in quality of the same times and places are in a great measure at the command of a genius and the argument drawn from the absolute unnaturalness of every breach of exact and precise unity with regard to them if it proves any thing proves too much it will prove the unnaturalness of the whole dramatic apparatus it will demonstrate the impossibility of exhibiting woods fields castles and towns in a single room and the absurdity of giving an ear to a company of fiddlers before or after the solemnity of a council or the tumult of a battle in short it seems to me a most ridiculous hypercriticism to object to improprieties which are more or less inseparable from the constitution of the drama and to talk of inconsistencies and impossibilities where all is confessedly a delusion if the question indeed were whether of the two be the more artificial model of tragedy that of the ancients or the moderns i would make no scruple to give up the argument but a regular and exact model is one thing and an excellent play is another it is one thing to allow a reasonable latitude to a great genius and another to prescribe a plan to a common poet  were the ancient greek tragedians defective then in point of genius it will be asked very far from it  however i will venture to assert that the simplicity i had almost said poverty of their fables is by no means their striking beauty that these would have appeared to greater advantage had they taken greater liberties that neither nature nor reason restrained them to the precise observation of the three unities and that the custom of antiquity in this case under the abilities of a great master would to use the words of shakespeare be more frequently honored in the breach than the observance  but what if after all some precedents even from antiquity itself will in a certain measure warrant the nonobservance of the great rules in dispute euripides and sophocles who confessedly improved the more simple plan of their predecessor aeschylus and are supposed to have brought the drama to it is state of perfection do not superstitiously and without exception adhere to their own general system witness first the hecuba of euripides in which there are apparently two distinct and almost unconnected actions at least out of the two great incidents of that tragedy two distinct actions might have been pland for either the death of polixena or the destruction of polymnestor might and strictly speaking ought to have been the simple subject of that drama if it be said that both these actions or incidents were no more than were sufficient or necessary to exemplify the distresses of hecuba and to illustrate the character of that unhappy princess this is saying in effect what we have already said in defense of the complicated plan of modern dramatists and so hanc veniam petimusque damusque vicissim   again the ajax of sophocles ought to have ended with it is natural catastrophe the death of this hero instead of which another action properly speaking commences arising from the violent contest between teucer and agamemnon concerning the forementioned heros right of burial a contest which if the poet in the present case had studied or even regarded absolute simplicity and uniformity he should have reserved for the groundwork of another tragedy  and further the trachiniae of the same excellent author is manifestly defective in point of unity of time of which much more must naturally be supposed to have lapsed between the departure of hyllus to inquire after his father and his return to trachin than the letter of the dramatic law allowed him  these defects and irregularities i have never seen taken notice of and much less objected to these justly admired writers and though we could bring no other examples to the same purpose than the above cited or however none so obvious as these yet it is apprehended a single instance of this nature is of very considerable weight and consequence in the present controversy and will warrant us in determining that the strict laws of the drama were not of indispensable obligation even in the judgment of the ancients themselves  indeed if they are the merit of a poet should be tried chiefly at least by them and therefore when mr mason tells us that shakespeare ought for his other virtues to be exempted from common rules he is unjustifiably candid and indulgent to him for sure he ought by no means to be exempted if such rules are founded in the indispensable laws and first principles of nature and good sense if he is fundamentally and essentially ridiculous a thousand inferior beauties will not excuse him common rules are therefore upon certain important considerations dispensable and if so shakespeares beauties do not so properly excuse as acquit him  if the judicious reader will apply here by the way some of the foregoing remarks to the case of tragicomedy he will be able perhaps to account not only for the toleration but also gracious reception of so motley a production upon the english stage for though shakespeare with his contemporaries and many successors did in such pieces undeniably humor the public taste to their own discredit yet it is to be observed that the grand arcana of nature above intimated might be scrupulously attended to even in this heterogeneous composition and accordingly when the tragic and comic representation was each excellent in it is kind it is no wonder that the bulk of an audience should overlook the manifest impropriety of the coalition or that the more judicious part should forgive it for the sake of the fundamental and essential excellencies of the respective actions and representations it is plainly for this reason that the best tragicomedies of shakespeare and others are received with general applause at this very day the ground of complaint against such tragic and comic union being really not so much that it offends the judgment as that it improperly divides the attention two separate plots and distinct actions do this to a ridiculous degree but in one and the same action absolute uniformity is not essential either to the tragic or comic drama for though the pathos be the characteristic of tragedy and humor of comedy as well ancient as modern yet the former will admit of characters of pleasantry under certain regulations and the latter is frequently known to abound with circumstances of very affecting though domestic distress of which many instances might if need were be on both sides produced in the several dramas both of ancients and moderns nor does such occasional and moderate reciprocation confound or destroy the different genius nature and end of the two species and it was probably owing to some injudicious writers misapplication of this truth and his drawing undue and false consequences from it and even in his own imagination improving it that either the name or the constitution of tragicomedy did ever subsist for the reasons why plautus calls his amphitrion a tragicomedy are of a nature entirely different from this however the great objection to this form of dramatic composition is certainly as has been said that it unsuitably divides the attention not that it lessens it or by exciting many different passions in the same space of time checks the force of any single one that the attention in a very uniform and regular play may be divided without being lessened we have already observed and indeed if this were not the case absolute uniformity and simplicity must be really essential to the two species of the drama and every reciprocal participation will be proportionably to the degree of it absurd but to assert this would be talking against reason experience and the not uncommon practice of the best poets is any man less moved by the delicacy and tenderness of lord townley upon his separation from his wife on account of the mirth that was before excited in him by the ridiculous ignorance and rusticity of sir francis wronghead do we less interest ourselves in the fate of the unhappy indiana because we were diverted by the coxcombical pertness of mr thomas should we be more affected by the pathetical complaints of romeo if they were not contrasted in the buffoonery of mercutio or to refer the reader to a play or two written directly upon the tragicomic plan does the iniquitous drollery of the spanish friar abate our concern for the distresses of torrismond and leonora or do the comical rhodomontades and humors of falstaff and his associates take off our attention from the bravery of prince henry or hotspur etc etc at the battle of shrewsbury  i am very far from contending for this mixture not of opposite but indeed contradictory characters in the same drama and much less for the form of tragicomedy itself proper and due uniformity admits of sufficient variety and though it be not essential to the drama is no doubt a great beauty in it the most popular of the plays i have mentioned are not the better for their medley of characters but all this while let the fault or impropriety be placed in a fair light and ascribed to it is true cause which is the real though nice connection between the genius of tragedy and that of comedy and the extreme difficulty of precisely determining how far or in what degrees and proportions the one may assume the qualities and properties of the other  but to return to my subject  the simple constitution of the ancient drama has indeed some advantages over the more complicated one of succeeding ages but still such as are abundantly more than balanced by those of the latter the frequent shifting of scenes for instance though it does not offend the judgment is yet disgusting to the eye of the spectator and so far the continuation of one and the same scene is a peculiar beauty and propriety but all this while to this beauty and local propriety many other more important points of probability are too often sacrificed this is more or less i believe the case of all strictly uniform tragedies and comedies but evidently at least of some of our best english comedies that have been written on the old dramatic plan in which notwithstanding the unity of action so much business is transacted so much intrigue carried on by so many different personages in one single spot of ground as is utterly incredible in which case the poet really offends against reason nature and good sense purely to save the appearance of doing so indeed if the unities are essential to the drama the utmost simplicity will of course be a perfection in it and consequently many of the most regular compositions of our comic poets as the way of the world and the double dealer of congreve will be found to be infinitely their worst productions so ambitious have some been of improving the model of the ancient drama and yet so cautious at the same time of taking such liberties as were absolutely necessary for those improvements  after all discretion is to be a general rule even in the use of liberty i would neither fetter the dramatic muse nor yet let her run wild deviations from the strict laws of antiquity should be made not affectedly and at random but with a view to beauties of a higher nature not for the ease of the poet but to the advantage of the poem i would not vindicate shakespeare himself in every instance of his transgression to sum up all that need be said upon this point in a few words the old laws of aristotle are in my opinion very proper regulations and restraints for an indifferent poet but ought not to be the shackles of a good one  the other great point of difference between the ancient and modern drama is the disuse of the chorus in the latter which yet mr mason is willing to think essential to the tragic drama now admitting the theory of aristotle and mr mason to be not only a regular but also necessary standard of dramatic writings with respect to the unities of action time and place the chorus though not essential to the drama will indeed as mr mason observes lay a proper and necessary restraint upon the poet but if these unities themselves are far from being essential to the drama as we have endeavored to make it appear the use of the chorus is so far at least superseded  the chorus was indeed as i have before observed not only a constituent part of but even a convenience to the ancient tragedy if i might be excused the indelicacy of the expression for the significancy of the sentiment i would say let a tragedy of aeschylus be gutted of it is chorus and you leave it little better than a skeleton  to proceed upon the simple plan of antiquity the chorus introduced it is true an agreeable variety into the drama and was no doubt both useful and ornamental to it as it is peculiar province had more immediate reference to the great ends of all poetry prodesse and delectare but after all if these great ends are better or even as well answered without the chorus and if these ends are not obstructed by the admission of design contrivance and intrigue into the fable but even promoted by it under the conduct of a masterly hand in this case i say it is not to be denied but the chorus of the ancients has given place to it is betters  it is true mr mason has very positively asserted for i think he has by no means sufficiently proved in behalf of the old chorus that to lay no stress upon subordinate advantages it augmented the pathetic that it afforded a graceful and natural resource to the embellishments of picturesque description sublime allegory and whatever else comes under the denomination of pure poetry and lastly which is most material that it was the properest vehicle to convey moral reflections with grace and propriety for these reasons which respect both the poet and the audience he judges the disuse of the chorus to be an irreparable loss to the modern stage let us briefly then review what this gentleman has said upon each of these articles  now with regard to the first he offers us the authority of a frenchman if you ask me says he how it augmented the pathetic i cannot give you a better answer than the abbe vatry has done in his dissertation on the subject published in the memoirs de l acad des inser etc it affected this says he both in it is odes and dialogue the wonderful power of music and the dance is universally allowed and as these were always accompaniments to the odes there is no doubt but they contributed greatly to move the passions it was necessary that there should be odes or interludes but it was also necessary that these interludes should not suffer the minds of the audience to cool but on the contrary should support and fortify those passions which the previous scenes had already excited nothing imaginable could produce this effect better than the choral songs and dances which filled the mind with ideas corresponding to the subject and never failed to add new force to the sentiments of the principal personages in the dialogue also the chorus served to move the passions by showing to the spectators other spectators strongly affected by the action a spectacle of such a kind as is fitted to excite in us the passions of terror and pity will not of itself so strongly affect us as when we see others also affected by it the painters have generally understood this secret and have had recourse to an expedient similar to that of the chorus of the poets not content with the simple representation of an historical event they have also added groupes of assistant figures and expressed in their faces the different passions they would have their picture excite nay they sometimes inlist into their service even irrational animals in the slaughter of the innocents le brun was not satisfied with expressing all the horror of which the subject is naturally capable he has also painted two horses with their hair standing on end and starting back as afraid to trample upon the bleeding infants this is an artifice which has often been employed and which has always succeeded a good poet should do the same and iphigenia should not be suffered to appear on the theater without being accompanied with persons capable of feeling her misfortunes  i have transcribed the whole passage and cannot help nothing in the first place a very extraordinary inaccuracy in this refined portion of criticism for sure the abovementioned horses with their hair standing on end and starting back etc did greatly add to the horror of this famous piece which yet before had it seems all the horror expressed in it of which the subject was naturally capable or if they did not augment this horror it will be difficult methinks to to tell what business they had there but to be serious  the wonderful power of music is universally allowed and music is by no means excluded from the modern stage nay i venture to say the modern drama has recourse to it more effectually though less frequently than the old drama had as we are more affected by it is occasional and unexpected graces and assistances than we should be by it is stated and periodical interposition  for the dance i own i am at a loss to comprehend how it could contribute greatly to move the passions i mean the passions proper for tragedy i do not pretend to ascertain the nature and method of the ancient stagedancing but such has been the power of the dance in later times that the tragic muse who is a very grave matron has i believe no reason to lament her dancing days are over admitting therefore at present the propriety and efficacy of the choral songs i cannot conceive how any kind of dance should support and fortify those passions which the previous scenes had excited or fill the mind with ideas corresponding to the subject and never fail to add new force to the sentiments of the principal personages nor farther can i see any thing even in the songs or odes which had so peculiar a tendency to produce these effects that nothing imaginable could do it as well for though these might answer this purpose very sufficiently yet if they were not necessary for it they cannot be contended for as essential to the drama and must consequently be considered only as we have before observed in the light of an ancient convenience  now i apprehend the minds of the audience are in no danger of cooling under the present system of the drama and that the music between the acts may be adapted to the purposes forenamed of supporting and fortifying the passions as much as the old chorus could be without depreciating therefore the real use and design of the chorus we only say we can do in many respects better and even in this as well without it  but farther it seems in the dialogue also the chorus served to move the passions by showing to the spectators other spectators strongly affected by the action for a spectacle of such a kind as is fitted to excite in us the passions of terror and pity will not of itself so strongly affect us as when we see others also affected by it admitting the truth of which assertion i do not see what is to be inferred from it to the advantage of the ancient chorus for does not the modern drama move the passions as indeed does the ancient exclusive of it is chorus by showing to the spectators other persons not mere spectators but persons more interested in the action strongly affected by the events of the tragedy the intervention therefore of spectators as such upon the stage is with respect to this purpose superfluous and insignificant except it can be demonstrated that the passions of terror and pity or any other are if i may be allowed the expression more powerfully excited at the second rebound  let common experience at once illustrate and determine this matter  supposing half a dozen indifferent persons admitted to a spectacle of terror or distress in real life for instance that of a dying man taking leave of his wife his mistress or his friend would not such a spectacle immediately raise suitable emotions in all of them or would each first consult the passions of his next neighbor in order to learn what effect this spectacle ought to have upon himself these questions require no answer and therefore as the drama is so lively a representation of real life they may plainly be applied to any case of misery or horror exhibited upon the stage  for this reason also it is that the illustration of the matter before us by the expedients of the painters is i apprehend with deference to the ingenious abbe as mr mason calls him entirely foreign to the present purpose the painters have very wisely had recourse to such expedients as are mentioned in the abovequoted criticism because after all their art is but painting still and properly speaking describes the passions more than it excites them but the drama or rather the actor in the drama realizes what he represents he must be a very insensible spectator who thinks at all of the poet or the player when mr garrick is personating a richard a macbeth or a lear the poet in short has not the same occasion for such artifices and expedients as the painter has let iphigenia appear on the theater and behave as she ought to do and i will be answerable for it the audience will be persons capable of feeling her misfortunes  but again by rejecting the chorus mr mason tells us the true poet has lost a graceful and natural resource to the embellishments of picturesque description sublime allegory and whatever else comes under the denomination of pure poetry to which i take leave to reply that what the poet has lost hereby tragedy has gained for if mr masons own theory be just the tragic muse as we have before observed from him strikes directly upon the passions of the audience which i should be glad to know how picturesque description i mean such as this gentleman has favored us with sublime allegory and poetry in the abstract or if you please pure poetry can do mr mason says the lyric muse addresses herself to the imagination of a reader or hearer and accordingly few men have a strength of imagination capable of pursuing the flights of pindar and still fewer i will venture to add those of mr mason in this dramatic poem i am very far from meaning to decry this ingenious authors peculiar talent in loco but i fear in the present case while he affects to defend the cause of the old chorus his real design was to introduce a new one for the name excepted i can discern little or nothing in the odes of mr mason similar to those of the ancient chorus that poetical flow of tender commiseration of religious supplication or of virtuous triumph of which it principally consisted had none of the longspun allegory and aerial imagery with which these dramatic sonnets of mr mason abound in truth it is to be wished that this professed admirer and imitator of genuine nature and ancient simplicity in the structure of his fable had paid a little more regard to them in his diction throughout this whole poem and particularly in the style of the choral compositions under present consideration it is pity indeed an author so sober and chaste in his whole economy should be so remarkably extravagant and loose in his language  in the hymn to the morning a great deal seems to be unfolded but little discovered  away ye elves away shrink at ambrosial mornings living ray that living ray whose power benign unfolds the scene of glory to our eye where throned in artless majesty the cherub beauty sits on natures rustic shrine p   now i apprehend it would pose the most able linguist to translate these lines or the most dextrous painter to give us a portrait of this angelical personage  charity has ever been ranked with the first of moral virtues but mr mason not only personifies and deifies it but likewise makes it a geometrician and a musician into the bargain  ah follow still the softeyd deity for know each path she draws along the plain of life meets at the central dome of social joy again  humanity thy awful strain shall ever meet our ear sonorous sweet and clear and as amid the sprightlyswelling train of dulcet notes that breath from flute or lyre the deep base rolls it is manly melody guiding the tuneful choir so thou humanity shall lead along the accordant passions in their moral song and give our mental concert truest harmony page     this passage is i confess very melodious in point of numbers it is indeed like music itself for methinks it sounds well and says nothing   in another ode we have several picturesque images of the goddess content presented to us now she sits upon a bank and listens to a linnet  sweet bird like thine our lay shall flow nor gayly loud nor sadly slow for to thy note sedate and clear content still lends a listening ear  then she is gone to sup with a hermit and is amazingly calm and composed though she seems every minute in danger of being drowned or knocked on the head  perhaps to some lone cave the rover flies where lulled in pious peace the hermit lies for scorning often the gorgeous hall where banners wave with blazoned gold there will the meekeyd nymph delight to call and with the solemn seer high converse hold there goddess on the shaggy mound where tumbling torrents roar around where pendent mountains over your head stretch their formidable shade you listen while the holy seer slowly chaunts his vespers clear or of his sparing mess partake the savry pulse the wheaten cake the bevrage cool of limpid rill p        in my humble opinion these and the two following odes to constancy and truth are much more calculated to exercise a metaphysical head than make any impressions upon a sensible heart and after all the beauties of such ideal poetry as this though they may amuse in the closet must surely be lost upon the stage to pass by the ode to constancy let us take a short view of truth in all her glory   no son of light darts swiftly from his heavenly height no train of radiant saints descend mortals in vain ye hope to find if guilt if fraud has stained your mind or saint to hear or angel to defend so truth proclaims i hear the sacred sound burst from the center of her burning throne where aye she sits with starwreathd luster crowned a bright sun clasps her adamantine zone p     it is wonderful to observe how far a true poetic fancy lifts a genius above all prosaic conception most of us profess ourselves admirers of the naked truth but mr mason has clothed her more splendidly than ever solomon was though i think he has given her rather too fine a buckle for so clumsy a girdle  it is indeed well observed by mr pope that he who would take boldness from poetry must leave dullness in the room of it and i am very sensible that no species of poetry is allowed greater liberties than the ode  sed non ut placidis coeunt immitia andc boldness is the medium between dullness and temerity the muse has no more business above the clouds than she has under the ground and mr mason though he never creeps is certainly a highflyer the extravagant thoughts the farfetched allusions and the unconnected ideas in most of these odes are a proof of it  in truth the heat of imagination is apt to transport an author into false conclusions and make him believe he writes poetry because he does not write prose  but farther i can by no means agree with mr mason that if we had a tragedy of shakespeares formed on the greek model we should find in it more frequent if not nobler instances of the high poetical capacity than in any single composition he has left us this author thinks we have a proof of this in those parts of his historical plays which are called choruss and written in the common dialogue meter our imagination continues he will easily conceive how fine an ode the description of the night preceding the battle of agincourt would have made in his hands and what additional grace it would receive from that form of composition let us turn to the description as it now stands in shakespeare  from camp to camp through the foul womb of night the hum of either army stilly sounds that the fixed sentinels almost receive the secret whispers of each others watch fire answers fire and through their paly flames each battle sees the others umberd face steed threatens steed in high and boastful neighs piercing the nights dull ear and from the tents the armourers accomplishing the knights with busy hammers closing rivets up give dreadful note of preparation the country cocks do crow the clocks do toll  this noble description is full of imagery drawn from sensible objects as indeed are most of those we meet with in this incomparable author witness for instance the description of dover cliff of hamlets madness of brutuss disorder etc etc it is consequently of the most affecting nature and in a manner possesses the hearer or the reader with the same kind of terror which the bravest probably feel upon the crisis of a decisive battle and by the by of the same passionate and affecting i e dramatic nature are the poetical parts of our best tragedies in general now i cannot conceive that the several circumstances of this description could receive additional force from the form of an ode notwithstanding the acknowledged power of music and much less that such a description would appear to advantage in an ode of mr masons instead of what we see hear and feel in the striking particulars of the beforementioned description mr mason would entertain and amaze us with an allegorical machine of horror riding on the brow of night or from her black pinions shedding deadly dews  it is certain whatever might be the mystic beauties of such an ode as this it would at best be a dispassionate one and so far infinitely less theatrical than the foregoing description of shakespeare in truth the pure poetry which mr mason tells us that great poet had the power of introducing naturally and what is most strange of joining with pure passion has an air utterly different from or rather contrary to the flights of mr mason throughout this performance shakespeare indeed very rarely gets out of the reach of our apprehensions even when his subject leads him directly into the province of imagination  i refer the reader to his midsummer nights dream his macbeth and his tempest upon the whole of this article it may i think be safely affirmed that the modern drama is by no means destitute of opportunities of having recourse to poetical embellishments and picturesque descriptions of all kinds and it has recourse to them if not so frequently and obviously as the ancient drama by means of the chorus had at least more consistently with the essential character of tragedy whose direct business it is to excite the passions even according to aristotles own definition of it for whether images descriptions etc occasionally and naturally interspersed with the matter of the dialogue itself be not more compatible with that character than separate and detached pieces of poetry is a question that needs not i conceive be discussed  now if these considerations will lead us to conclusions in favor of the poetical parts of modern tragedy against those of the old chorus they will i am sure do this a fortiori against the pure poetry of mr mason  i cannot help observing in this place that our authors affectation of a poetical diction which contributes so much to the rendering the odes of his chorus undramatical discovers itself likewise in many parts of the dialogue itself and often to such a degree that pomp figure and allegory supply the place of simplicity nature and pathos how allegorically does athelwold express the passion of joy mixed with an apprehension of imminent danger   heavens it cannot last the giddy height of joy to which i am lifted is as a hanging rock at whose low foot the black and beating surge of infamy rolls ready to receive and sink my soul p     as this danger approaches still nearer the leader of the chorus tells the unhappy pair athelwold and elfrida that  safety now sits wavering on their love like the light down upon the thistles beard which every breeze may part p  0 upon the earls declaring his resolution to murder himself he is cautioned against such a desperate proceeding by very important but i think scarce intelligible considerations   forbear forbear think what a sea of deep perdition whelms the wretchs trembling soul who launches forth unlicensd to eternity think think and let the thought restrain thy impious hand the race of man is one vast marshalled army whose numerous squadrons fill the plains of time their leader the almighty high in air the chosn archangel rides whose right hand wields the imperial standard of his providence which dreadly sweeping through the vaulted sky oershadows all creation p     with what delicacy and pathetic force is the remorse of this hero expressed in the following passage  i do deserve to breathe deserve to bear this load of life about me for many years to lengthen out my age listening the hourly knell of cursed remembrance whose leaden stroke shall tell to my sad soul that i was faithful once  we may observe farther that the same enthusiastic kind of spirit betrays our author in many other places of this work where the thought is extremely beautiful into a stiffness and formality of language  we will give the reader a few instances of this   the eye that will not weep anothers sorrow should boast no gentler brightness than the glare that reddens in the eyeball of the wolf p    tenderness and pity have made his breast their home he is a man more apt through inborn gentleness to err in giving mercys tide too free a course than with a thristy and illiberal hand to circumscribe it is channel p    let no unhallowed tongue dare to profane her virtue by it is praise it is a bright prodigy which admiration must stand in silent gaze at and behold fullplumd perfection take it is eagle flight above ambition sovereignty and pride p    horror horror the pen of fate dipped in it is deepest gall perhaps on that illomend wall now writes the event of this tremendous day o that our weaker sight could read the mystic characters and spy what to the unpurgd mortal eye is hid in endless night  p     see ye virgins see how despair beneath his ghastly brow stretches her blackest cloud through whose thick night his eyes fast rooted in their angry rings dart a dire glear  p     for solitude which sooths the trnnquil mind has dread effects on wrathful breasts the same sequestered pine which veils the gurgling ringdove with it is boughs whets with his knotty trunk the boars vexed tooth and points each fang with death in short to this spirit we may perhaps ascribe the impropriety and unseasonableness of some of mr masons most elegant and affecting images and descriptions  but i forbear to multiply quotations  enough i presume has been said to show that mr mason throughout this whole work discovers much more of the poet than the tragedian he discovers so much indeed of the former that abating these and a few other blemishes and defects which i thought it but justice to my subject to endeavor to set in a true light elfrida as a dramatic poem has many exquisite beauties which however as they must be obvious to judicious eyes i forbear not for want of inclination but of time to recite indeed as this performance is entitled a dramatic poem and not a tragedy by the author himself i should have made no exceptions to it if the style of the letters prefixed to the drama had been as modest as the title page  but to return once more to the chorus mr mason laments that with the means of introducing poetry naturally is lost also the opportunity of conveying moral reflections with grace and propriety  he tells us afterward that in those parts of the drama where the judgment of a mixed audience is most liable to be misled by what passes before it is view the chief actors are generally too much agitated by the furious passions or too much attached by the tender ones to think cooly and impress on the spectators a moral sentiment properly  this is indeed asserting roundly but however i apprehend without sufficient foundation in reason or experience  i will make bold to assert too that it is the business of the dramatic poet and indeed of every other in a moral view to steal imperceptibly into the heart of his audience or reader that sentiments occasionally and naturally suggested by the circumstances of the parties personally concerned will have a more forcible effect than a thousand set lessons of music and morality from the mouth of a third person and that the chief actors are not generally too much agitated by the furious passions or attached by the tender ones to think cooly enough for the purpose and impress on the spectators a moral sentiment properly  in the next sentence we are told that a confidant or servant has seldom sense enough to do it never dignity enough to be regarded  now by the way a servant or a confidant may always if the poet please be as sensible a person as any in the drama and sure the dignity of either at least of the latter is equal to that of the personages of the ancient chorus which for the most part consisted of a company of virgins the attendants and countrywomen of the hero of the poem  mr masons own chorus with all it is pomp and solemnity is composed of lord athelwolds maids  but after all do the modern tragedians usually convey moral sentiments through the mouths of servants and confidants as these expressions would lead us to imagine or granting they do and err in so doing is the particular error of a few to be objected to the general system instead therefore of these and of the chorus too the moderns are sufficiently provided with persons not merely capable of seeing and hearing but of arguing advising and reflecting from whom a moral sentiment never comes unnaturally but suitably and gracefully for such are or may be all the persons in the drama the character of pierre in venice preserved mr mason justly observes in another place when left entirely to the judgment of the audience is perhaps one of the most improper for public view that ever was produced on any stage it is almost impossible but some part of the spectators should go from the representation with very false and immoral impressions but had that tragedy been written on the ancient plan had pierres character been drawn just as it is and some few alterations made in jaffeirs i know no two characters more capable of doing service in a moral view when justly animadverted upon by the chorus for bad characters become on this plan as harmless in the hands of the poet as the historian this would indeed be as i have elsewhere observed very just reasoning against any man that should undertake to vindicate mr otways conduct in the tragedy referred to and to oppose the same to the ancient plan but as this never was or will be done by any man in his senses it is surely inconclusive to argue against the inconveniences of the whole modern dramatic system from the particular error of a particular poet  the truth is perhaps this gentleman has conceived strong prepossessions in favor of that species of poetry which his talent evidently leads him to for if he had not himself a particular taste for an ode it is likely he would scarce contend for it as absolutely essential to the drama  but whatever may have been his real sentiments upon the occasion i hope i have given sufficient reasons for differing from him  before i conclue i cannot help taking notice that mr mason has drawn mr dryden himself into his interests in a very extraordinary manner and this i do the rather as i have more than once referred to that excellent persons authority mr mason among the insuperable difficulties in the way to the desired reformation of the english stage intimates the present improper form of the theaters and the additional expense requisite for the purposes of the ancient system renders the matter he thinks impracticable this he says mr dryden foresaw long ago and then quotes the following curious passage from him a new theater much more ample and much deeper must be made for that purpose besides the cost of sometimes forty or fifty habits which is an expense too large to be supplied by a company of actors it is true i should not be sorry to see a chorus on a theater more than as large and as deep again as ours built and adorned at a kings charges and on that condition and another which is that my hands were not bound behind me as now they are i should not despair of making such a tragedy as might be both instructive and delightful according to the manner of the grecians  now does any common reader apprehend from this passage that because mr dryden tells us he should not be sorry to see a chorus on a commodious theater etc therefore he ardently wished to see one and judged it absolutely essential to the drama or because he declares that in such case he should not despair of making such a tragedy as might be instructive and delightful according to the manner of the grecians therefore he longed to try his strength in this field and acknowledged the grand secret prodesse and delectare was the characteristic of the greek drama only and yet such methinks is mr masons construction of this passage  this suffrage of mr dryden says he is however very apposite to to the present point but it serves also to vindicate my design of imitating the greek drama for if he who was so prejudiced to the modern stage as to think intrigue a capital beauty in it if he i say owns that the grand secret prodesse and delectare was the characteristic of the greek drama only nothing i think can better justify my present attempt than the approbation he gives to it in this passage  that is to reduce this suffrage to a smaller compass mr dryden informs us that if things were properly circumstanced he would at all events have attempted a tragedy upon the greek model and with some hopes of success therefore he plainly preferred the ancient to the modern system  let the merits of the cause be tried by the evidence of mr dryden and fabio vel judice vincam i have nothing farther to add than that if the reader should chance to wonder at the freedom i have sometimes taken with this truly ingenious writer i desire it may be imputed to my natural resentment of that air of sufficiency and superiority with which he introduces i do not say his performance but his system  good sense i e common sense as well as antiquity required an adherence to the unities this peremptory declaration involves in a very scurvy term almost every dramatic writer but our author and a frenchman or two since the days of aristotle but delicate judgment it seems and a true taste for genuine nature and ancient simplicity are the allotments and privileges only of a happy few  in what contempt does this gentleman hold the universal practice of the modern stage when he acquaints us he believes he could quickly make the whole tolerably fit for an english audience by putting the dialogue of the chorus into the mouth of an emma or matilda who with some little show of sisterly concernment might be easily made to claim kindred with earl athelwold and by the addition of an unnecessary incident or two which would cost him no more than they are worth in contriving and an unmeaning personage or two who would be as little expense in creating i confess i see no sort of foundation for this insult and superiority in the arguments or rather assertions of mr mason for which reason i have written my thoughts upon this occasion otherwise i have no more pretension to write against him as an adversary than desire to enter the lists with him as a poet  letters etc  letters etc sir i sit down in compliance with your request to give you my sentiments upon the subject started at our last interview  in consequence of my researches upon this occasion i have been almost led into a very whimsical conclusion  that the greatest genius is the author a man happens to have in his hand it seems but reasonable to pin our opinion of an author upon that of his editor or translator and yet we may do this till we are in a manner at a loss for a criterion to judge good writing by genius assumes as many shapes as ever proteus did and all literary merit consists principally in invention in judgment in fire in propriety in simplicity in elegance in accuracy in ease in wit in humor in fullness in brevity etc etc according to the spirit and complexion of the writer before me mr pope declares homer was the greatest epic poet in the world and i am quite of his mind till i take up mr meyricks tryphiodorus  when i look into my statius i begin to think virgil was a very cold and insipid writer and virgils acquaintance assure me that statius was little better than a madman  in short by virtue of the preface prefixed to him sophocles or ovid terence or martial milton or butler etc etc is the best poet herodotus or eutropius livy or sallust rapin or clarendon is the best historian aristotle or newton descartes or burnet etc etc is the best philosopher and hammond or hobbes south or toland sherlock or middleton is the best divine   but to be serious  you will wonder perhaps to be told that what gave rise to these ludicrous remarks of mine was nothing less than mr popes commentary upon his universally and justly admired original homer an author whom you will scarce think capable of being complimented or aggrandizd to an undue and extravagant degree especially by so judicious an editor  indeed these great names are so truly venerable that i must obviate the alarm you may take by assuring you that what i am going to say neither can nor means to detract from the infinite merit of the grecian or the british homer for the former see the note at v     of the   th b of the iliad i believe upon the whole that scarce any mortal ever came near him for wisdom learning and all good qualities for the latter he has certainly done more justice to his author as an expositor only than all the commentators ancient and modern put together after this declaration you will give me leave to tell you that mr pope himself appears to me notwithstanding his very great abilities to have sometimes misapprehended the real design of his original to have not unfrequently to use his own words again attributed to him what does not belong to him and now and then to have imagined proprieties or covered defects with a seeming view rather to the honor of his author at all events than to the precise ascertainment of truth all this indeed might be owing not to a blind admiration or to a want of discernment but to a degree of laudable partiality or a too implicit adherence to the notions and interpretations of the commentators his predecessors  but whatever may be allowed to an editor or translator a standerby will be more impartial and is as such more likely to think justly of an author you who turn to your homer merely with an intent to be delighted with him and consider mr pope as a person very able and willing to illustrate his great beauties and excellencies will be apt to sce no grounds for the above allegations but in an affectation of singularity or in caprice especially as mr pope makes no scruple occasionally to point out the blemishes of his author and seems by many remarks to show himself thoroughly divested of all unreasonable prepossessions see the note at v  0  b xi it is customary says he with those who translate or comment on an author to use him as they do their mistress they can see no faults or convert his very faults into beauties but i cannot be so partial to homer etc etc in another place after having enumerated what seemed to him to be faults of any consideration he tells us see the note at v     b xvi he hopes after so free a confession no reasonable modern will think him touched with the  of madam dacier and others i am sensible continues he of the extremes which mankind run into in extolling and depreciating authors we are not more violent and unreasonable in attacking those who are not yet established into fame than in defending those who are even in every minute trifle  there is as much modesty as there is truth in this ingenuous declaration and there is great reason to suppose mr pope in general never speaks of homer in higher terms than he really believed he deserves however whether i have been actuated by a spirit of vanity or of humor rather than just criticism you will be able to judge when you have read the following sheets in which i propose to try homer by himself as every writer should by his own key and by the suffrages and evidence of his own advocates and witnesses for which purpose and for something of methods sake the first subject of our inquiry shall be the machinery of the iliad and the next the general economy of this great poet and his particular conduct in respect of characters incidents and other circumstances and i persuade myself the result of this inquiry will be your agreeing with me that homer with the most fruitful invention extensive knowledge and no small judgment has really much less art and design in this work than he is supposed to have had at least for what appears to the contrary from the observations of his commentators  letter ii the machinery you know is that part which the gods bear in an epic poem that of homer is conducted with extraordinary circumstances of solemnity and magnificence but the great question is whether we are in general to take the simple and literal sense of the author with regard to the appearance and actions of these superior beings or whether we are to suppose a secret and allegorical meaning to be veiled under all this apparatus or in other words whether we can with any degree of certainty extract a system of morality or theology from it this has been attempted to be done by mr pope and all others who have undertaken to explain illustrate or defend the writings of this inimitable poet and it must be owned too that this has been done in many places in a very plausible manner however i must be of opinion upon reviewing the iliad and comparing it with itself that these gentlemen have pushed this matter too far and by strained explications and refinements found out mysteries which were never intended that generally speaking we shall do more justice and even honor to homer by supposing see the note at l     b v he followed fame and common opinion in his account of the gods though no way agreeable to truth upon this supposition at least he will i think appear much more uniform and reconcilable with himself i do not deny indeed that the iliad abounds with noble and rational sentiments and such as are conformable to true theology particularly that the necessity of divine assistance and interposition for all human successes is a moral strongly inculcated throughout the poem but whatever homers religious notions as a man might be or as mr pope expresses it whatever he might think of his gods he took them as he found them he brought them into action according to the notions which were then entertained and in some stories as they were then believed if you consider his jupiter as a fabulous or poetical character there is less in it to shock you but if you believe he meant to exhibit to his reader under this character the one supreme omnipotent god you must soon have a very mean opinion not only of his philosophy but even of his sense it is true he sometimes introduces jupiter with a majesty and superiority worthy the great ruler of the universe particularly in the beginning of the  th book but he is in general represented as much subject to weakness infirmity and passion as the inferior deities indeed if any divine attribute be plainly and consistently applied to jupiter it is power yet even this seems to be applied rather from the authority of fabulous tradition than by the religious theory of the poet himself for the story of the rebellion of the gods and their defeat by jupiter which homer refers to cannot be understood to be his own invention mr pope acknowleges the  see note at l    of the  th b notions and descriptions of his author in respect of the deity to be in many passages unworthy of the divinity see essay on homer p    he is not even exempted from our common appetites and frailties he is made to eat drink and sleep it is pleasant enough to observe how careful the commentators have been notwithstanding such acknowledgements to maintain the supposed superiority of jupiter and what shifts they have recourse to to save his honor upon all occasions see note at l   0 of the  st b eustathius mr pope tell sus makes a distinction between  and  the words which are used at the end of the first book and the beginning of the second with regard to jupiters sleeping he says  only means lying down in a disposition to sleep now granting this interpretation to salve the contradiction that else would follow in the next book where it is said jupiter did not sleep and to prove bytheby that homer himself did not nod in this passage yet surely it will afford but a slender argument for the extraordinary vigilance of jupiter in general beyond that of the other gods especially as homer acquaints us in the preceding lines that he went to the bed where he had used to take his repose see l  0  and   0 of the iliad it is worth observing to you that some critics in aristotles time objected to the passage in the second book and see note at l   of the  d b pretended it was ridiculous to describe all the gods sleeping besides jupiter to which it seems aristotle answers that nothing is more usual or allowable than that figure which puts all for the greater part a plain proof that neither aristotle nor the abovementioned critics of those times supposed any extraordinary degree of vigilance could have been with any propriety ascribed by the poet to jupiter  perhaps you will be of opinion too that there is a little too much refinement in another place in the fifth book where mr pope says see note of l     of the  th b we may observe the decorum and decency his author constantly preserves in making jupiter only smile upon certain occasions while the other gods laugh out  i leave it to you to judge what sort of a salvo this must be allowing any foundation for the distinction itself as indeed i do not recollect there is there seems at least to be universal jollity in heaven in one very remarkable passage without any reserve for the gravity of this deity i mean in the first book where vulcan see at l     of the  st b designs to move laughter by taking upon him the office of hebe and ganymede with his awkward limping carriage  vulcan with awkward grace his office plies and unextinguishd laughter shakes the skies thus you see the jupiter of homer with all his pomp and preeminence is hardly above a level with the subordinate deities in point of corporal weakness and infirmity nor will you find him to rank much higher if you take a view of his conduct and actions in general throughout the poem you will observe him upon numberless occasions under the influence of passions utterly unsuitable to the purity as well as dignity of the supreme being the fiction of his being deceived and laid asleep and of his amorous correspondence with juno has as mr pope confesses as great an air of impiety and absurdity as any fable in all antiquity i see note at l     of the   th b must needs upon the whole says that ingenious remarker as far as i can judge give up the morality of this fable but what color of excuse for it homer might have from ancient tradition or what mystical or allegorical sense might atone for the appearing impiety is hard to be ascertained at this distant period of time here is a condemnation and a palliation of a fault in one breath indeed mr pope through his unabated zeal for the honor of his original is see the note last referred to willing afterward to suppose the present passage to be grounded on religion and to be nothing more than the representation of a religious solemnity or else to be purely allegorical and as such implying only the congress of jupiter and juno the mingling of the ether and the air which are generally said to be signified by these two deities but i believe if you consult the place you will think the first expedient a forced one and the second allowing the physical signification of these two deities insufficient for the intended vindication for what connection is there in the mingling of the ether and the air with the matter in hand or how does it in the least effect the circumstances of the battle between the greeks and the trojans to say nothing of venus who certainly is no physical deity and yet bears a part in this transaction  the literal and obvious sense of homer with all its grossness seems to be the only consistent one which this passage can fairly be made to carry  it is worth while to take notice of the shifts the commentators have recourse to when they are pressed with difficulties of this nature agreeably to the circumstances of the extremity the allegories of homer are moral and physical his see note at l    of the  th b heaven is no more than an ideal world of abstracted beings and so every motion which rises in the mind of man is attributed to the quality to which it belongs with the name of the deity who is supposed to preside over that quality superadded to it the sea note at l     of the  th b deities sometimes mean no more than beings that presided over the passions and faculties of the mind and in consequence of all this jupiter is either the ether or the father of gods and men juno is the goddess of honor or the air and minerva the goddess not only of wisdom but of craft that is both of true and false wisdom etc etc as occasions and exigencies require  now it is certain by these means any difficulty may be solved and any passage in this author pretty easily cleared but all this while the question is whether any system can be ascertained nay in places where the meaning of the author is irreconcilable with allegorical construction it is supposed to see note at     b xxi be darkened by the remoteness of our time a hidden and mysterious sense there plainly is or certainly must be and we must at all events and though apparent absurdities will be saved by it reject a literal interpertation of homer where the gods are concerned mr pope himself owns that sometimes homers see essay on homer p       machines play a little too grossly and that the fable violently oppresses the moral which it may be lost labor to search for in every minute circumstance if indeed it was intended to be there in truth i am apt to think we should read this poet with more pleasure and equal profit if we perplexed ourselves less to find out mysteries in him and by the way it is scarce worth our pains to investigate hidden meanings when the plain and literal moral of the poem is as obvious upon a thousand occasions as it is admirable and excellent if you consider the machinery of homer in a poetical rather than a theological or philosophical light and suppose his gods to be real characters acting under the influence of human passions as ancient fables represented them and taking their measures from motives of personal affection resentment etc etc i believe you will have a surer inlet into the meaning of this famous author and be able to examine him by rules not liable to difficulties which are only to be removed by forced and unnatural solutions  but as there is a novelty in this opinion you will expect i should strengthen and confirm it by more reasons and observations  letter iii the sea note at l     b v famous censure of tully and longinus mentioned by mr pope that homer makes gods of his heroes and mortals of his gods will appear to be groundless if you regulate your ideas of this author by the notions i have conceived of him for pure poetical fictions whether invented or adopted by homer come not properly under the cognizance of a philosophical inquiry accordingly we shall not only have a ready excuse for this great poet when he introduces his deities feasting fighting wounded by men and shedding a sort of blood but also when they are represented as committing actions unworthy of themselves and of the respective characters they are supposed by the common opinion of commentators to sustain mr pope allows that if see note at l    b iv the trojans had no right to break the treaty made between them and the grecians upon the duel of paris and menelaus the machine where juno is made to propose perjury jupiter to allow it and minerva to be commissioned to hasten the execution of it would be one of the hardest to be reconciled to reason in the whole poem whether therefore the trojans had a right to break the treaty is a question it will be very material and i think easy to determine now that the sea note at l    b iv conditions of the treaty were valid notwithstanding the snatching away of paris by venus in a cloud that is to say that the controversy was to be decided either by the victory or by the death of one of the combatants is i apprehend apparent from many considerations it is certain in the first proposal of the challenge paris mentions only the victory and who his rival shall in arms subdue nor does hector who carries it say any more  however continues the note menelaus understands it of the death by what he replies fall he that must beneath his rivals arms and live the rest  and in the solemn oath too agamemnon specifies the latter if by paris slain  and if by my brothers arms the trojan bleed priam also understands it of both saying at his leaving the field whose arms shall conquer and whose prince shall fall heaven only knows  paris himself confesses he has lost the victory in his speech to helen which he would hardly have done had the whole depended upon that alone and lastly menelaus after the conquest is clearly his by the flight of paris is still searching round the field to kill him as if all were of no effect without the death of his adversary  it appears from hence says mr pope that the trojans had no ill pretense to break the treaty so that homer ought not to have been directly accused of making jupiter the author of perjury in what follows which is one of the chief of platos objections against him  but was it not extremely natural for menelaus agamemnon and priam to mention the death of one of the combatants as the decision of the controversy though the terms at the challenge specified victory only in as much as the death of one seemed to be the unavoidable consequence of the duel and the deliverance of paris by venus was a circumstance that could not possibly be foreseen for paris he could not be so absurd as to deny the loss of the victory whatever shifts he might be drove to evade the articles of the combat  indeed he seems to hint at the expedient of a second engagement  this day the foe prevailed by pallas power we yet may vanquish in a happier hour  and lastly for menelaus he might very naturally search round the field to kill his adversary not for the effectual determination of the controversy but for the gratification of his personal resentment  be this as it will whatever private persons might think of this affair it is plain the greeks looked upon the war as ended by this great event and accordingly agamemnon calls upon the trojans to fulfill the conditions of the treaty  ye trojans dardans all our generous foes hear and attest from heaven with conquest crowned our brothers arms the just success have found be therefore now the spartan wealth restored let argive helen own her lawful lord  etc etc but in a word to put the matter out of all doubt the very terms at the commission given to minerva suppose the conditions of the treaty to be binding upon the trojans  the sire of men and monarch of the sky the advice approved and bade minerva fly dissolve the league and all her arts employ to make the breach the faithless act of troy these two last circumstances mr pope for reasons obvious enough takes not the least notice of indeed he found himself so pressed by the difficulties with which this whole transaction is surrounded that he is forced to have recourse to one of the expedients abovementioned viz that of supposing homers heaven to be sometimes no more than an ideal world of abstracted beings etc etc agreeably to this notion he resolves the business into this easy allegory as he is pleased to call it see note at l    b iv pandarus who broke the truce by shooting an arrow at menelaus thinks it prudence to gain honor and wealth at the hands of the trojans by destroying menelaus this sentiment is also incited by a notion of glory of which juno is represented as goddess jupiter who is supposed to know the thoughts of men permits the action which he is not author of etc etc  but how is all this to be reconciled with the general rules of interpretation or with what mr pope see note at l   0 tells us in the very next note the goddess went not to the trojans because they hated paris and would rather have given him up see l     at the last b than have done an ill action for him she therefore looks among the allies and finds pandarus who was of a nation noted for perfidiousness and had a soul avaricious enough to be capable of engaging in this treachery for the hopes of a reward from paris from what principles of prudence then or of honor did pandarus act or lastly how can jupiter be said barely to permit what he expressly commands it is out of the power of allegory and refinement to salve the characters of these deities upon the present occasion  but according to the notion i have formed of homers deities there will be nothing puzzling in all this affair  i can suppose juno and minerva to be actuated by a desire of personal vengeance on the quondam judgment of paris and indeed i am warranted in this supposition almost by the present behavior of these goddesses but clearly i presume by a passage in the   th book of the iliad where the poet informs us that these very deities with neptune opposed the proposal of all the rest to dispatch mercury to steal away the body of hector purely from the implacable hatred they bore to troy ever since that fatal determination   pallas this denies and the unrelenting empress of the skies ever since that day implacable to troy what time young paris simple shepherd boy won by destructive lust reward obscene their charms rejected for the cyprian queen mr pope maintains the authenticity of this passage which it seems some of the sea note at l    b xxiv ancients had disputed who judged it as an indecency that the goddess of wisdom and achilles should be equally inexorable they thought farther that had homer been acquainted with the judgment of paris he would undoubtedly have mentioned it before this time in his poem etc it may be answered replies mr pope that the silence of homer in the foregoing part of the poem as to the judgment of paris is no argument that he was ignorant of that story perhaps he might think it most proper to unfold the cause of the destruction of troy in the conclusion of the ilias that the reader seeing the wrong done and the punishment of that wrong immediately following might acknowledge the justice of it according to this observation which confirms what i have been saying we must look beyond the rape of helen for the original cause of the destruction of troy and for the wrong done which so much exasperated these goddesses the same reason proceeds the note will be an answer to the objection relating to the anger of pallas wisdom cannot be satisfied without justice and consequently pallas ought not to cease from resentment till troy has suffered the deserts of her crimes  now whether that crime of paris could fairly be considered as the crime of troy and whether therefore wisdom could with justice pursue it to the destruction of a whole people a novice in casuistry may determine  if we suppose by the by that the juno of virgil was copied from this original as there is i think no doubt but she was we find that poet in plain terms ascribing the illwill of this goddess toward the trojans to be the affront put upon her by paris  manet alta mente repostum judicium paridis spretaeque injura formae aen l     you will begin probably to think the commentators have affected too much to discover poetical secrets in an author whose design i take to have been much more simple than it is generally imagined to be  for your farther satisfaction you shall hear from me again upon this subject  letter iv the commentators tell us it is with great art and judgment that homer has engaged his several deities either on the side of greece or on that of troy i cannot give you a beter account of their sentiments upon this head than what you have in mr popes note transcribed from eustathius see note at l    b xx this division of the gods is not made at random but founded on very solid reasons drawn from the nature of these two nations he places on the side of the greeks all the gods who preside over arts and sciences to signify how much in that respect the greeks excelled all other nations juno pallas neptune mercury and vulcan are for the greeks juno not only as the goddess who presides over marriage and who is concerned to revenge an jnjury done to the nuptial bed but likewise as the goddess who represents monarchical government which was better established in greece than any where else pallas because being the goddess of war and wisdom she ought to assist those who are wronged besides the greeks understood the art of war better than the barbarians neptune because he was an enemy to the trojans upon account of laomedons perfidiousness and because most of the greeks being come from islands or peninsulas they were in some sort his subjects mercury because he is a god who presides over stratagems of war and because troy was taken by that of the wooden horse and lastly vulcan as the declared enemy of mars and of all adulterers and as the father of arts  the reasons why mars and venus engage for the trojans are very obvious the point in hand was to favor ravishers and debauchees but the same reason you will say does not serve for apollo diana and latona it is urged that apollo is for the trojans because of the darts and arrows which were the principal strength of the barbarians and diana because she presided over dancing and those barbarians were great dancers and latona as influenced by her children xanthus being a trojan river is interested for his country  now whether these are not rather ingenious than solid reasons is in my mind scarce a question  for all that is here asserted is far from being true all the gods who preside over arts and sciences are not on the side of the greeks apollo who is surely one of the most considerable of them being the perpetual patron of troy so that homer never meant by this adjustment to signify how much in this respect the greeks excelled all other nations juno and pallas as plausible as the reasons here alleged for their siding with the grecians may seem to be act in this affair by their own see l  0 etc b iv confessions as we have seen from very different motives nor will it follow by the way that because the latter of these goddesses assisted the greeks therefore homer would intimate that the greeks understood the art of war better than the barbarians for as mr pope observes upon homers introducing apollo on the side of the trojans in the fourth book mars see note at l     b iv the friend of troy which signifies courage without conduct proving too weak to resist minerva or courage with conduct the poet brings in wisdom to assist mars under the appearance of apollo and consequently as much may be inferred to the advantage of the trojans from the constant interposition of this god in their behalf as is in the passage before us to that of the greeks from the consideration of the aid of minerva  but farther neptune it seems is for the greeks because he was an enemy to the trojans upon account of laomedons perfidiousness and because most of the greeks being come from islands or peninsulas they were in some sort his subjects now laomedonss see l     b xxi perfidiousness consisted in the refusal of the wages due to this god on account of the building of the walls of troy and in other illusage and so we are to look upon neptunes espousing the grecian cause as the effect of his resentment of those personal indignities and in this light he is only acting in conformity to the idea i have framed of homers gods in general but why the greeks can with more propriety be called neptunes subjects because they came from islands or peninsulas than the trojans themselves who inhabited a seaport town for which very reason mr pope conjectures homer ascribes the building of the wall to neptune only i confess i am at a loss to discover  again mercury we are informed is a partisan of the grecians because he is a god who presides over stratagems of war and because troy was taken by that of the wooden horse  now the ingenuity of the stratagem of the wooden horse if we believe virgil we must ascribe not to mercury but to pallas instar montis equum divina palladis art aedificant however to let this deity have the credit of it i would only ask whether supposing he had been introduced by homer on the part of troy the sagacity of eustathius would not have assigned as specious a reason for it as the present i can conceive it to be this mercury is for the trojans because he presides over thieves and robbers and is the favourer of all clandestine enterprises such as was the rape of helen by paris  but lastly vulcan assists the greeks as the declared enemy of mars and of all adulterers and as the father of arts true  his personal enmity to mars and consequentially to all adulterers it is granted naturally engaged him on the grecian side  but as the father of the mechanical arts methinks he should have fought under apollo the father of the liberal ones  on the other hand the reasons says eustathius why mars and venus engage for the trojans are very obvious the point in hand was to favor ravishers and debauchees rather a ravisher etc if all the aboveassigned reasons had been as obvious as these it had indeed been scarce worth while to have entered into a discussion of this matter but it would be extraordinary if there were no circumstances to color the hypothesis of the commentators  opinions all this while are not to be grounded on a few circumstances that are contrasted by many others  the reasons given for the assistance of the other deities to troy which indeed are delivered with an air of diffidence are most of them farfetched it is urged that apollo is for the trojans because of the darts and arrows which were the principal strength of the barbarians supposing but by the way not admitting the truth of which assertion itself might not apollo who is destiny according to the common notion have been represented with much more significancy as opposing troy whose destruction was determined by fate one reason see note at l     b xxi given by dacier in the next book why apollo declines fighting with neptune is because apollo being the same with destiny and the ruin of the trojans being concluded upon and decided that god can no longer defer it according to this apollo by taking the part of troy seems to have been fighting against himself  but diana attached herself to the trojan interests we are let to know because she presided over dancing and those barbarians were great dancers it may be so and yet i am apt to think the goddess of chastity acts a little out of character here and by aiding and abetting these dancers ravishers and debauchees is in danger to be taken tripping  as for latona if she was influenced by her children she was a very dutiful mother and xanthus being a trojan river is very naturally and without any design or artifice of the poet interested for his country  do you not begin to believe upon this review of the matter which i hope you will think a fair and impartial one that this division of the gods in homer was made much more at random than eustathius would have persuaded you it was and that the gods upon jupiters permission to them to assist either party in the beginning of this book gratified their personal inclinations and affections  nay jupiter himself supposes they had done and would do this  celestial powers descend and as your minds direct your succor lend to either host l    etc b xx and farther the speeches which the poet puts in the mouths of his gods when they come to engage are full of personal invectives and reproaches and contain little or nothing that countenances an allegorical construction mars puts minerva in mind of the wound diomed had given him through her instigation   in thy frantic mood thou drovst a mortal to insult a god thy impious hand tydides javelin bore and madly bathed it in celestial gore l   0 etc b xxi minerva whom we may observe homer represents in this engagement as superior to mars in point of bodily strength not by virtue of any art or stratagem insults her vanquished antagonist in the language of a conqueror instead of reproving his rashness in a style that would have better become the goddess of wisdom have thou not yet insatiate fury known how far minervas force transcends thy own l     the same goddess next attacks venus and easily overcomes her which circumstance may i apprehend be best literally understood for in an allegorical sense venus might have been at least a match for minerva as love often takes possession of the bravest heart and is irresistible by the wisest counsels  and if venus had been victorious here i make no doubt but that sense would have been put upon this passage  neptune addresses himself to apollo in a long speech in which he recapitulates the injurious treatment they had both met with from laomedon and wonders at that gods forgetfulness and forgiveness of the same but he drops not a single syllable that intimates himself to be the representative of humidity or apollo of dryness upon this occasion  juno gives diana most abusive language and boxes her soundly into the bargain as mr pope expresses it  but i see no clue to a mystery in all this business nor any thing suitable to the emblematical characters of either goddess  lastly upon mercurys declining to fight with latona mr pope borrows this remark from eustathius that see note at l   0 it is impossible that mercury should encounter latona such a fiction would be unnatural he being a planet and she representing the night for the planets owe all their luster to the shades of the night and then only become visible to the world  this commentator in another place see note at l    b xx exclaims with admiration with what art does the poet engage the gods in this conflict but sure if there be truth in the last cited observation there was little art in making latona and mercury take different sides  in short as exactly see note at l    b xx as some circumstances may tally in the the disposition of this engagement i am apt to think upon the whole it is rather to be attributed to chance than design and that the expositors in general either through zeal for the honor of homer or in ostentation of their own sagacity have gone greater lengths in their allegorical hypothesis than they could justify from the plain scheme of their author but i will take occasion once more to resume this argument  letter v it bears hard i presume upon the notion of an allegorical meanings being couched under the appearances and actions of homers deities that we are so often at a loss for any reason to be alleged for them or cannot give one with consistency and propriety if this did not abundantly appear to be the case from what has been laid before you we might proceed to ask how it comes to pass that the interposition of juno in the sea b xvi l   0 etc   th book prevents jupiters seeming design to save sarpedon why does she interpose at all or why is this the effect of it how comes this goddess to interfere in the present passage and minerva in the sea b xxii l       d book when jupiter discovers the same inclination to deliver hector  if eustathius rightly observes that the conduct of homer is remarkably just and rational in the fifth book of the sea l   0 b v iliad where he tells us diomed notwithstanding his intrepid character retired from apollo because it was impossible for him to vanquish apollo in whatsoever capacity he is considered either as the sun or as destiny how is it that the same commentator commends in another place a conduct which is the very reverse of this how see note at l   0 b xvii observable says he or rather mr pope in his name is homers art of illustrating the valor and glory of his heroes menelaus who sees hector and all the trojans rushing upon him would not retire if apollo did not support them and though apollo does support them he would oppose even apollo were ajax but near him according to this remark if it is reconcilable with the former menelaus behaves with more intrepidity or rather rashness than diomed himself and yet neither are the characteristics of that hero of whom we shall have something more to say by and by in the seventh book apollo we are informed see note at l     b vii comes very opportunely to save his favorite hector who is overpowered by ajax eustathius says that apollo is the very same with destiny so that when homer says apollo saved him he means no more than that it was not his fate yet to die now methinks if this observation is justly made this deity should appear to the relief of every hero in the like extremity and yet it is venus who saves paris in the third book and aeneas in the fifth as neptune does the latter this same good office in the twentieth  it belongs to the advocates of the common notion to solve all these difficulties and many more that might be added to them  in the mean time i would have you turn your eyes to a passage or two where the allegory is supposed to be selfevident and tell me whether the matter be so undeniably clear as the illustrations of the commentators pretend to make it the descent of minerva in the first book to prevent achilles attempting the life of agamemnon is descanted upon at large as a passage of this nature the sea note at l     b i allegory here says mr pope may be allowed by every reader to be unforced the prudence of achilles checks him in the rashest moment of his anger it works upon him unseen to others but does not entirely prevail upon him to desist till he remembers his own importance and depends upon it that there will be a necessity of their courting him at any expense into their alliance again having persuaded himself by such reflections he forbears to attack his general but thinking that he sacrifices enough to prudence by this forbearance lets the thought of it vanish from him and no sooner is wisdom gone but he falls into more violent reproaches for the gratification of his passion all this is a most beautiful passage whose moral is evident and generally agreed on by the commentators  now had minerva only been the actress in this affair all this had been a very natural explication but homer gives us to understand that minerva was see l     dispatched by juno the goddess of honor on this errand if therefore juno be not an utterly insignificant personage in this transaction the honor as well as the prudence of achilles must be supposed to suggest his present conduct to him but as a soldier and a passionate one too no doubt he must think himself obliged in point of honor to take immediate satisfaction for the affront which had been put upon him and so his honor suggests what his prudence forbids as allegorical persons therefore i cannot think but juno and minerva appear together with some force in this machine nor by the way does it seem agreeable to the character of the goddess of wisdom to suffer achilles to break out into such scurrilous and virulent expressions as he makes use of in his next speech to agamemnon he does this when wisdom is gone mr pope says but still it was by her permission one might say direction indeed the force of keen reproaches let him feel l     the original is stronger and contains a more unlimited commission and in consequence of it achilles rates his general with a vengeance o monster mixed of insolence and fear thou dog in forehead but in heart a deer l     etc even this passage then you see is not clear of difficulties and as much as may be said in defense of the allegorical interpretation the literal sense is at least easy and liable to no exception  i will only desire you to turn once more to the fifth book of which mr pope observes see note at the end of b v the allegory lies so open is carried on with such closeness and wound up with so much fullness and strength that it is a wonder how it could enter into the imagination of any critic that these actions of diomed were only a daring and extravagant fiction in homer as if he affected the mavelous at any rate the great moral of it is that a brave man should not contend against heaven but resist only venus and mars incontinence and ungoverned fury  nothing is more observable than the particular care homer has taken to show he designed this moral  minerva at the beginning of the battle is made to give this precept to diomed fight not against the gods but give way to them and resist only venus the hero himself as soon as he has performed her dictates in driving away venus cries out not as to the goddess but as to the passion thou have no business with warriors is it not enough that thou deceivest weak women even the mother of venus while she comforts her daughter bears testimony to the moral that man says she is not long lived who contends with the gods and when diomed transported by his nature proceeds but a step too far apollo discovers himself in the most solemn manner and declares this truth in his own voice as it were by direct revelation mortal forbear consider and know the vast difference there is between the gods and thee etc  now in the first place i am afraid homer will not appear to have been so particularly careful to show he designed this moral as mr pope would make us believe for though diomed was commanded in the beginning of the battle to give way to the gods and resist only venus he is afterward empowered to attack mars and any deity that should come in his way not mars himself nor ought immortal fear l  0 0 accordingly he is directed in the original to fall upon mars see l     of the  th book of the iliad first and therefore though he actually attacks no other god he seems to have been sufficiently authorized to do it which is a circumstance that clashes with the allegory  but what bears still harder upon it in my opinion is this that though the poet speaks in high terms of the bravery and intrepidity of this hero and of the honor he had to be under the immediate protection of minerva yet he represents his wounding of venus and contending with the heavenly powers as acts of the highest rashness and impiety observe diones words to her daughter which mr pope refers to as a proof of homers intention to inculcate his moral etc  rash impious man to stain the blessed abodes and drench his arrows in the blood of gods but thou though pallas urged thy frantic deed whose spear illfated makes a goddess bleed know thou whoever with heavenly power contends short is his date and soon his glory ends etc etc l     etc and if you will regulate your opinion by virgils judgment of this matter you will find diomed see note at l  00 according to that author as mr pope remarks in his answer to the ambassador of king latinus enumerating his misfortunes and imputing the cause of them to this impious attempt upon venus  haec adeo ex illo mihi jam speranda fuerunt tempore cum ferro coelestia corpora demens appetii and veneris violavi vulnere dextram aeneid l    nay diomed condemns himself for this very action in his speech to glaucus in the next book and intimates the great danger he had exposed himself to by it  but if from heaven celestial thou descend know with immortals we no more contend not long lycurgus viewed the golden light that daring man who mixed with gods in fight etc b   l   0 etc i cannot help transcribing to you mr popes note upon this place who begins now to be of the same sentiment a quick change of mind from the greatest impiety to as great superstition is frequently observable in men who having been guilty of the greatest crimes without any remorse on the sudden are filled with doubts and scruples about the most lawful or indifferent actions this seems the present case of diomed who having knowingly wounded and insulted the deities is now afraid to engage the first man he meets lest perhaps a god might be concealed in that shape i confess this fear of diomed which violently shakes the allegory in question appears to me inconsistent likewise with the tenor of this heros character nor can i think mr pope brings him off when he acquaints us in the following note that what diomed here says is the effect of remorse as if he had exceeded the commission of pallas in encountering with the gods and dreaded the consequences of proceeding too far at least he had no such commission now and besides was no longer capable of distinguishing them from men a faculty she had given him in the foregoing book he there mentions this story of lycurgus as an example that sufficed to terrify him from so rash an undertaking  now in the first place it by no means appears that this commission was expired or that faculty ceased at least the contrary may be inferred from mr popes translation of this speech diomed says but two lines above unhappy they and born of luckless sires who tempt our fury when minerva fires l     after all why should he torment himself with reflections on what he had done only by virtue of that commission before which he was far from exceeding except in his attempt upon apollo from whom however upon the first reproof he retired or why should the example of lycurgus who acted not by divine impulse terrify one who confessedly did in this light what will become of the allegorical characters of minerva mars and venus or how comes a hero to be troubled in conscience because he had been resisting incontinence and ungoverned fury thus you find this allegory which we were told lies so open is clogged likewise with its difficulties from which indeed neither is the literal construction of the passage clear for it seems unreasonable that a man should suffer from the resentment of one god for what he committed by the direction and command of another though this is no unusual thing in pagan story  upon the whole to have done with the machinery of this great poet i leave it to you to judge whether there is not abundant ground to conclude that the interpreters have frequently taken pains to ascertain a meaning in him which never came into his head that if he had a latent and symbolical meaning at least they have not hit upon it and that there is more ingenuity than solidity as we have hinted in many of their interpretations in a word i cannot see how any thing like a regular and consistent system either of theology or of morality can be extracted from homers machinery  if he drops a sentiment or an expression occasionally as he often does with a view one would think to convince his reader of the rectitude of his private notions with regard to the deity his jupiter appears to have been a fabulous and traditional character and is drawn with imperfections and infirmities incompatible with the natural ideas of a supreme being as to the inferior deities it seems impossible to form a precise idea of their hidden significancy or allegorical importance from the actions which we have seen ascribed to them so that homer had really much less design in the plan of his poem than is supposed on which supposition he may however be plainly made more uniform and of a piece or he had much more than has ever yet been or we may suppose now ever will be comprehended in my next i will consider in another point of view the noble production of this excellent poet  letter vi it may be proper to remind you in this place that i neither have said nor shall say any thing of homer with an intent to lessen your opinion of him but to set it right for it is one thing to undervalue a poet and another to undeceive the reader if homer be justly esteemed one of the greatest geniuses the world has produced perhaps the greatest it is to be remembered that he is one of the first too and it is absurd to look for that perfection in the original which we have a right to expect in the copy it is the characteristic of invention to be great of imitation to be exact and if virgil could not have improved the model of the epopee left him by homer he should not have taken a pen in his hand the intervention of homer with all his defects will always be the object of our admiration the judgment of virgil with all his proprieties will only deserve our praise  i own it has often amazed me to find the commentators so confident to deny or solicitous to extenuate homers defects which really do no discredit to him and which ought to be imputed to that simplicity with which every original production of the human mind is naturally imagined it is i apprehend for want of considering this great author in this light that the expositors often run into the opposite extreme and are industrious to discover beauties and excellencies which were merely accidental and ought rather to be put to the account of the editors affection or sagacity than to that of the art or design of the author  under this notion i have already submitted to your consideration my sentiments on homers machines and agreeably to my proposal i shall next give you my thoughts upon the plan or economy of the iliad in general and then proceed to a review of the poets conduct in some particular instances now i think it may be noted as a defect in the general economy of the iliad which is to be ascribed to the cause just mentioned that the poet has not taken sufficient care to interest his readers on the side of his countrymen notwithstanding the apparent justice of their cause this is clear to me from several considerations as first from the countenance and protection given to the trojans in general by jupiter in preference to the greeks  i am very sensible the commentators represent this protection as the consequence only of that gods promise to thetis to humble the grecians and do honor to achilles  but is it not as plain too that jupiter throughout the poem is personally wellaffected to troy in general and that for very good reasons it appears from jupiters answer to thetis that he had declared himself in the interest of the trojans long before she made this application to him  what have thou asked ah why should jove engage in foreign contests and domestic rage the gods complaints and junos fierce alarms while i too partial aid the trojan arms b   l     and he afterward in the council wherein he intimates himself disposed to end the war with the approbation of the other deities by suffering the treaty made upon the duel of menelaus and paris to take effect expresses a more than ordinary concern for troy as a place that deserved well at his hands  for know of all the numerous towns that rise beneath the rolling sun and starry skies which gods have raised or earthborn men enjoy none stands so dear to jove as sacred troy no mortals merit more distinguished grace than godlike priam or than priams race still to our name their hecatombs expire and altars blaze with unextinguishd fire b   l    etc mr pope has a note from dacier which corroborates what i have remarked upon this head see note at l   b iv jupiters reproaching these two goddesses juno and pallas with neglecting to assist menelaus in the duel proceeds from the affection he bore to troy since if menelaus had gained by their help a complete victory which it has been observed was a sufficient one the siege had been raised and the city delivered on the contrary juno and minerva might suffer paris to escape as the method to continue the war to the total destruction of troy and accordingly a few lines after we find them complotting together and contriving a new scene of miseries to the trojans the latter part of this note confirms what has been before observed that these goddesses seem to have been actuated by a spirit of the most inveterate malice and animosity against a whole race unius obnoxam the restitution of helen etc was not the grand object of their counsels  indeed if you take them in the gross i believe you will find the deities on the side of troy though mars is in the number to be more gentle and mercifully inclined than those that are the assistants of the greeks  again i cannot help being of opinion that upon the whole the poet gives us a much more favorable idea of the trojans than he does of the greeks if we regard the manners and characters of the heroes concerned on both sides let us take a short view of the principal personages that fight in the cause of troy hector as mr pope says see note at l    b iii if he is not the chief hero in the iliad is at least the most amiable and is for several reasons a favorite character with every reader  he stands in contrast to achilles an accomplished character of valor unruffled by rage and anger and uniting his people by his prudence and example it is the love of his country which appears his principal passion and the motive of all his actions he has no other blemish than that he fights in an unjust cause which homer has yet been careful to tell us he would not do if his opinion were followed we may add that homer having so many greeks to celebrate makes them shine it their turns etc whereas hector appears in every battle the life and soul of his party and the constant bulwark against every enemy he stands against agamemnons magnanimity diomeds bravery ajaxs strength and achilless fury  see note at l     b v the piety and valor of aeneas though not drawn at so full a length are marked no less in homer the original than in virgil the copy it is the manner of homer to express very strongly the character of each of his persons in the first speech he is made to utter in the poem in this of aeneas there is a great air of piety in those strokes is he some god who punishes troy for having neglected his sacrifices and then in that sentence the anger of heaven is terrible in a word as mr pope tells us in another place see note at l     b xx though aeneas is represented a man of great courage yet his piety is his most shining character this is the reason why he is always the care of the gods etc  the character of sarpedon says the same commentator is the sea note at l     b xvi most faultless and amiable in the whole iliad this hero is by birth superior to all the chiefs of either side being the only son of jupiter engaged in this war his qualities are no way unworthy his descent since he every where appears equal in valor prudence and eloquence to the most admired heroes nor are these excellencies blemished with any of those defects with which the most distinguished characters of the poem are stained so that the nicest critics cannot find any thing to offend their delicacy but must be obliged to own the manners of this hero perfect his valor is neither rash nor boisterous his prudence neither timorous nor tricking and his eloquence neither talkative nor boasting he never reproaches the living nor insults the dead but appears uniform through his conduct in the war acting with the same generous sentiments that engaged him in it having no interest in the quarrel but to succor his allies in distress this noble life is ended with a death as glorious for in his last moments he has no other concern but for the honor of his friends and the event of the day  his is the only death in the iliad attended with prodigies even his funeral is performed by divine assistance he being the only hero whose body is carried back to be interred in his native country etc  these peculiar and distinguishing honors seem appropriated by our author to him alone as the reward of a merit superior to all his other less perfect heroes these are the most illustrious characters on the side of troy though the inferior ones if not so striking are at least generally amiable and inoffensive as those of deiphobus helenus polydamas and glaucus even that of paris is upon the whole far from being odious or disgusting i believe among other things the value every reader has for these characters particularly his love and esteem of hector inclines his wishes to the side of troy indeed mr pope has perhaps undesignedly given us in the above accounts of sarpedon a kind of contrast to the manners and characters of many of the leaders in the grecian army for the valor of achilles and of diomed is undoubtedly rash and boisterous the prudence of ulysses is sometimes see note at l     b viii timorous and the eloquence of idomeneus and nector is talkative and boasting but what prejudices us more than any thing else against the greeks is that cruelty and inhumanity which is so remarkable in their chiefs of the first note and figure granting achilles in all he does to act in character and suitably to his ferocious and vindictive spirit the very nature of the character itself is offensive and the propriety and coherence with which it is preserved distasteful his inhumanity in dragging the dead body of hector has been severely and i think indeed not without some justice says mr pope censured by several both ancients and moderns indeed the question is whether the whole picture of achilles as drawn by homer has not stronger and more violent features in it than necessity required the subject of the poem is the anger of this hero and the ill consequences of it to the greeks but this brutal treatment of the body of a generous enemy is neither the natural effect of that anger nor a soldierlike revenge for the death of his friend patroclus  it is true the commentators have observed that see note at l     b xvii homer takes care before hand to lessen in his readers mind the horror he may conceive from the cruelty which achilles will exercise upon the body of hector by showing this cruelty as the punishment only of that which hector exercises upon the body of patroclus he drags him he designs to cut off his head and to leave his body upon the ramparts exposed to dogs and birds of prey the observation is founded on fact but however as this piece of intended cruelty is inconsistent with hectors general character he should not have been represented as capable of it and as it was only intended it makes not so horrible an impression upon us as the actual inhumanity of the poets favourrite hero i have often thought by the way that the barbarity of achilles toward the remains of the unfortunate and universally beloved hector occasioned the misrepresentation of the very fact of his death by the wellknown story which shakespeare adheres to in his troilus and cressida of achilless ungenerously attacking him unarmed and cutting him to pieces  so desirous was the exasperated author to depreciate the character of this hero and exalt that of his adversary but to return be the character of achilles as poetically perfect as possible and the morality to be drawn from it as obvious as you please he seems to have the least merit of any of the principal personages in the poem and we can scarce help being sorry to see so many detestable qualities on the right side of the question in a word the virtues of humanity which he see note at l     b xxiv discovers in the   th book when he restores the body of hector to priam and the amiable qualities which mr pope tells us soften the terrible ideas we have conceived of him are exercised too late to wipe off the stain of his past unheroical and unmanly behavior especially when we consider that this act of humanity was the effect of jupiters express command delivered by his mother thetis  in short though we cannot but take notice of a great deal of insolence and cruelty on both sides and are shocked as mr pope confesses he is at the many instances of inhumanity that occur throughout the poem which however are not to be see note at l    b vi imputed to the poet who followed nature as it was in his days but to be ascribed to the uncivilized manners of those times when mankind was not united by the bonds of a rational society yet i believe we shall find much more blame due to the greeks than to the trojans upon this score not to insist upon those other glaring proofs of a bloody and unmerciful disposition which achilles gives in the killing lycaon see b xxi l    etc  taking twelve captives whom he sacrifices afterward to the manes of patroclus we see agamemnon too upon certain occasions betraying a fierce and cruel temper as particularly when he prevails upon his brother to take away a trojans life which he was inclined in compassion to see b vi l    etc spare i do not know where you will meet with more savage sentiments than those of this general in the following speech to menelaus   oh impotent of mind shall these shall these atrides mercy find well have thou known proud troys perfidious land and well her natives merit at thy hand not one of all the race nor sex nor age shall save a trojan from our boundless rage ilion shall perish whole and bury all her babes her infants at the breast shall fall l    etc b vi and if you will turn to the original you will perhaps think it much softened in this translation notwithstanding mr popes observation see note at l    b vi from madam dacier it should be remembered too that the venerable nestor himself is a spectator and applauder of this act of cruelty  but there is one consideration behind that interests the reader in the behalf of troy much more than all the rest i mean that of the private characters of priam and his royal family mr pope is of opinion that the poets chief see note at l  0  b vi intention in making hector retire from the battle to carry a message to troy etc was to introduce the fine episode of his parting with andromache in which the sea note at l     amiable picture of conjugal love homer has drawn gives us cause to think his genius was no less capable of touching the heart with tenderness than of firing it with glory this episode says that excellent person tends very much to raise the character of hector and endear him to every reader and indeed we cannot admire this hero more in the field than we love him at home his conduct his courage and his valor are common to him with many others but his affectionate tenderness to his parents his wife his child and his friends is characteristical and peculiar to himself  in a word you cannot i believe but be a wellwisher to the house of priam when you consider the general character of this good old man himself whose only fault was his indulgence to his children and especially his piety which renders him a favorite of jupiter and procures him the restitution of his sons body or when you look into the manners of his whole family not even helen excepted but as she is the mistress of paris or paris himself but as he is the admirer of that fatal beauty upon the whole i leave you to judge whether the grecians do not deserve the appellation of barbarous according to the worst acceptance of the term much more than the people or the allies of troy  i cannot think then with mr pope that homer see note at l    b v always appears very zealous for the honor of greece or even that he seems to be so in the instance produced to support the assertion i mean that of the trojans in the beginning of the third book rushing on to the battle in a barbarous and confused manner with loud shouts and cries while the greeks advance in the most profound silence and exact order this circumstance it seems is a proof of the poets endeavor every where to represent the greeks as superior to the trojans in valor and the art of war to which if you add the circumstance of the grecians being animated by pallas and the trojans instigated by mars i e the former by a wellconducted valor and the latter by rash strength and brutal force the matter will bear no dispute what weight there is in this latter circumstance you will easily see upon recollecting what has been already remarked upon the machines of homer and for the former i think you will agree with me that little is to be fairly inferred from it to the advantage of the greeks the trojan manner of encountering with shouts and outcries is no argument against their military discipline or proof that they were not drawn up in as exact order as the grecians themselves see note at l   b iii perhaps these clamours were only to encourage their men instead of martial instruments as mr pope has not scrupled to intimate at least it is a peculiarity as what nation is without one that does no discredit to their discipline or skill in the art of war indeed the supposed constant see note at l    b iii superiority of the grecians etc is by no means so apparent to me as it has been to the commentators in general and probably you may be of the same mind if you will refer to book iv l  0  etc to book viii l    etc to book xi l    etc to book vii l    etc    etc etc and to other places wherein there seems to be no sort of inferiority on the part of troy in respect of conduct bravery or resolution more might be said upon this article but i have exceeded the ordinary bounds of my letters and indeed should not have said so much but that i thought it necessary to enter into such particularities as these in order to give you the clearer idea of an author whose work i presume you will think it a rational amusement thoroughly to examine and discuss  letter vii i have two more objections to the general economy of the iliad which i am apt to believe a little attention will convince you are reasonable ones the first is that achilles the hero of the poem is not the first personage in it in point of dignity hector is his superior in every amiable quality and agamemnon no less so in power and command and as the former consideration prepossesses the reader in favor of the trojan general so the latter has at least a tendency to interest us on the side of authority in the quarrel at the beginning of the poem and the more so as homer if he was not a friend to absolute monarchy does yet speak in very high terms of the sacred rights and inviolable supremacy of kings  there want not chiefs in such a cause to fight says agamemnon himself and jove himself shall guard a monarchs right b   l     etc and afterward  hence shall thou prove my might and curse the hour thou stoodst a rival of imperial power and hence to all our host it shall be known that kings are subject to the gods alone l   0 etc old nestor talks in the same strain when he attempts to pacify these chiefs see line     etc as does ulysses in the next book see l     etc  but besides the visible propriety there had been in making achilles commander in chief with which appointment the great design of the poem and the due execution of it were without doubt consistent it is plain that for want of it you will meet with much incongruity not to say absurdity in many places one obvious example shall suffice to maintain the allegation which is that of achilless convening the council in the first book an act of royalty that became him no more than it would diomed ulysses or any secondary commander in the army indeed this very circumstance you find mentioned by mr pope in his note from plutarch and eustathius as doing great honor to the judgment of homer for which reason it will be proper to transcribe it  plutarch observes how justly homer applies the characters of his persons to the incidents not making agamemnon but achilles call this council who of all the kings was most capable of making observations upon the plague and of foreseeing its duration as having been bred by chiron to the study of physic one may mention also a remark of eustathius in pursuance to this that junos advising him in this case might allude to his knowledge of an evil temperament in the air of which she was goddess now admitting the supposed skill of this hero etc to have been a good reason for his private advice in regard to the convention of this council and for his delivering his opinion in it with more than ordinary freedom and confidence yet how it could give him a right to call it or to open it in consequence of so doing with a formal speech i confess i cannot at all comprehend  you will give me leave just to illustrate what i have been observing upon this head by directing you to a passage in the   th book in which achilles at the height of his glory and popularity among the greeks and at the very instant that he promises see note at l     priam a cessation of arms purely by his own authority does nevertheless in effect acknowledge his subordination to the imperial character and by his apprehensions of the consequences of the present proceeding as if the poet even while he is aggrandizing his hero was conscious of ascribing an importance to him unsuitable to the inferiority of his station  then he now father sleep but sleep not here consult thy safety and forgive my fear lest any argive at this hour awake to ask our counsel or our orders take approaching sudden to our opened tent perchance behold thee and our grace prevent should such report thy honored person hear the king of men the ransom might defer but say with speed if ought of thy desire remains unasked what time the rites require to interr thy hector for so long we stay our slaughtring arm and bid the hosts obey l     etc you observe there is an inconsistency here which would have been saved had achilles been the principal person in respect of precedence as well as valor etc etc  but it is time to come to the other objection which as i am not singular in it i will give you in the words of mr popes note prefixed to the   d book of the iliad and endeavor to confirm it by a remark or two upon what that expositor has offered by way of vindication of his author this and the following book which contain the description of the funeral of patroclus and other matters relating to hector are undoubtedly superadded to the grand catastrophe of the poem for the story is completely finished with the death of that hero in the   d book many judicious critics have been of opinion that homer is blameable for protracting it virgil closes the whole scene of action with the death of turnus and leaves the rest to be imagined by the mind of the reader he does not draw the picture at full length but delineates it so far that we cannot fail of imagining the whole draught there is however one thing to be said in favor of homer which may perhaps justify him in his method that what he undertook to paint was the anger of achilles and as that anger does not die with hector but persecutes his very remains so the poet still keeps up to his subject nay it seems to require that he should carry down the relation of that resentment which is the foundation of his poem till it is fully satisfied and as this survives hector and gives the poet an opportunity of still showing many sad effects of achilless anger the two following books may be thought not to be excrescencies but essential to the poem  virgil had been inexcusable had he trod in homers footsteps for it is evident that the fall of turnus by giving aeneas a full power over italy answers the whole design and intention of the poem had he gone farther he had overshot his mark and though homer proceeds after hectors death yet the subject is still the anger of achilles now i apprehend the anger of achilles which is the foundation of the poem is entirely distinct from that anger or rather revenge with which he persecutes the very remains of hector and that the whole declared design and intention of the poet was to paint the anger of achilles as the source of all the misfortunes the grecians underwent which were ended by the reconciliation of that chief and agamemnon we then see as plainly the good effects of union to the greeks as we did the fatal consequences of discord through the most considerable part of the poem and therefore the death of hector and the triumph of the grecians thereupon was the proper and natural catastrophe of the iliad the anger of achilles considered as the passion he was addicted to might have been protracted through many books more  in short the superaddition of these books especially the latter instead of being justifiable by the reasons above alleged does even come within the reach of a former objection for the care taken of hectors body by two see b xxiii l     etc deities the debate in heaven see b    l    etc concerning the redemption of the same by priam the interposition of jupiter in behalf of his deceased votary mercurys see l     b xxiv conducting priam to the tent of achilles the interview of the two monarchs and lastly the several pathetic lamentations made over the corpse of the unfortunate hero by his friends and relations at troy with which the poem concludes i say these incidents confirm our former prepossessions in favor of hector leave the most tender impressions on our minds and at the same time inspire us with fresh indignation at the insolence and barbarity of his implacable enemy  such are the defects as i conceive in the general economy of the ilias  in my next i will communicate to you some observations i have made upon the particular conduct of the great author in relation to characters incidents and other circumstances etc etc  letter viii homer is with much justice to be admired in the main for the agreeable variety of his characters and for the remarkable spirit and uniformity with which each of them is sustained if he is sometimes faulty upon this article it is to be ascribed to mere human infirmity perhaps or in some cases to that simplicity which as has been said distinguishes the inventors of arts and sciences from the improvers of them to one of these it is probably owing that we see such a scandalous character as that of thersites in the iliad or so contemptible a one as that of nireus the latter the most beautiful the former the most deformed person of the poem it is observable mr pope informs us that see note at l     b ii thersites is never heard of after his first appearance such a scandalous character is to be taken no more notice of than just to show that it is despised but whether ludicrous or scandalous characters ought to have place in the epic poem may be justly questioned or whether it be a beauty or propriety to introduce a person but once who seems to be utterly unworthy to appear at all as for see note at l     b ii nireus the insignificancy of his character should i think have excluded him from the iliad who likewise makes his appearance once too often the truth is neither of these personages are of any service toward the illustration of a principal character the caution with which the courage of ulysses is tempered sets off the intrepidity of diomed and the activity of hector is finely opposed to the immobility of ajax but the abovementioned gentlemen are at best unnecessary contrasts to each other and foils to every body else  but that you may not imagine i am industriously looking after objections and picking out characters for the sake of finding fault an office i abhor i must desire you to look a little farther into a character or two of much higher rank which you will i believe find to be liable to the objection of not being preserved with that nicety of consistence and uniformity which is in general so observable in this noble writer if you will judge of the character of menelaus by the idea which mr pope justly gives us of him see note at l     b iii who has taken some pains to place it in a true point of view you will be i make no doubt of opinion that upon the whole his character is by no means contemptible though not of the most shining nature he is called indeed in the   th iliad  a soft warrior or one whose strength is of the second rate and so his brother thought him when he preferred nine before him to fight with hector in the  th book thus far you may safely subscribe to mr popes notion of this commander but i am afraid what follows for the display of the bright side of this character will clash rather too much with these concessions made to his disadvantage for how comes this soft warrior whom you know i have mentioned before in another light to discover a spirit of revenge which distinguishes him from all the other greeks in the second book no see note at l     b ii leader in all the list is represented so eager and passionate he is louder than them all in his exhortations more active in running among the troops etc etc  if homer meant to show us hereby that see note at l     b ii his concern in the war was personal while the others acted only for interest or glory in general it is odd sure that he does not maintain this priority of zeal and ardour as a consequence of that concern throughout the poem again is it not hard to account for his see note at l  0  b vii and at l     forwardness to accept hectors challenge who immediately afterward was not thought worthy even to take his chance of fighting with him it may be said that agamemnon dissuades his brother from the combat from a principle of brotherly love not from any distrust of his courage of which he appears to have so extraordinary an opinion in the  th book when menelaus is wounded by pandarus that he expresses his apprehensions that the death of that hero will force the greeks to return with shame to their country deprived of thee the heartless greeks no more shall dream of conquests on the hostile shore etc b   l  0  etc but if his life was of such consequence to greece he should never have been styled a soft warrior or a chief of the second rate  i will only point out to what i think rather an oversight than not in homer with regard to another character and then quit the present article of inquiry i mean the character of ajax whom not absolutely but comparatively speaking i cannot look upon as a proper person to be dispatched upon the embassy to achilles in the  th book mr pope however informs us that the choice of three see note at l     b ix persons phoenix ajax and ulysses is made with a great deal of judgment achilles could not but reverence the venerable phoenix etc ajax and ulysses had been disgraced in the first book l     as well as he and were therefore proper persons to persuade him to forgive as they had forgiven besides it was the greatest honor that could be done to achilles to send the most worthy personages in the army to him ulysses was inferior to none in eloquence but to nestor ajax was second to none in valor but to achilles ajax might have an influence over him as a relation etc  yet as ingenious as all this may be it is certain that of all the heroes ajax was the worst orator and so far at least he was was unqualified for the charge in question  he is by no means a favorite character with the poet himself if he had he would have given him a prize probably in some of the games in the   d book one reason why he did not mr pope supposes might be because he had a mind to show that strength without conduct is usually unsuccessful which gives us no favorable idea of this hero and much less authorizes us to pronounce him one of the most worthy personages in the army that he was second to none in strength but to achilles may be granted but in valor he has no doubt many competitors  in truth i cannot help looking upon this as a random delegation notwithstanding a few plausible circumstances which surely never entered the authors head viz the disgrace of ajax and ulysses in the first book etc a disgrace which by the way they neither of them resent or allude to in their speeches to achilles or the relationship of ajax to that hero which he takes not the least advantage of in his address to him  mr pope in the note last quoted appears therefore rather to have acted the part of a ready friend than an impartial commentator  i will only suppose and have done that diomed had been employed in this deputation instead of ajax  in that case cannot you conceive mr pope would have expressed himself to the following purpose it is with wonderful art and propriety that homer appoints diomed one of the ambassadors upon this occasion it did honor to achilles to send upon this business the most valiant with the wisest of all the grecian commanders besides diomed see note at l   b v has more of the character of achilles himself than any besides he has naturally an excess of boldness and too much fury in his temper forward and intrepid like the other and running after gods or men promiscuously as they offer themselves add to this that as he is forward to act in the field so is he ready to speak in the council where his advice always inclines to war and is biased rather on the side of bravery than caution a man of this disposition was most likely to influence the congenial spirit of achilles  an ingenious commentator may take a thousand occasions of making the most of his author and convert improprieties themselves into beauties of which i believe i shall be able to give you a few more proofs in my remaining criticisms upon the iliad of homer  letter ix the most material remarks i have farther to make upon the particular conduct of homer etc i shall communicate to you in order as the passages which seem exceptionable will occur in the course of the poem the first that offers itself is the interposition of nestor in the first book in the speech wherein he endeavors to make up the breach between the contending princes achilles and agamemnon which as the design of the iliad required it should be ineffectual i could wish he had spared mr pope observes see note at l     b i that the character of authority and wisdom in nestor is every where admirably used by homer and made to exert itself through all the great emergencies of the poem as he quiets the princes here which how he does we shall see presently he proposes that expedient which reduces the army into order after the sedition in the second book when the greeks are in the utmost distresses it is he who advises the building the fortification before the fleet etc and it is by his persuasion that patroclus puts on the armor of achilles which occasions the return of that hero etc etc in these last mentioned emergencies indeed the authority of this venerable hero has all the weight you can desire but sure in the present instance in which if it had prevailed all future emergencies had been precluded it was exerted to no or at best very little purpose the old man is represented as master of the art of persuasion and rises to speak with all the advantages of the sweetest eloquence and the experience of two generations and he seems accordingly to promise himself success in the proposal of an accommodation   young as you are this youthful heat restrain nor think your nestors years and wisdom vain   do you young warriors hear my age advise atrides seize not on the beauteous slave that prize the greeks by common suffrage gave nor thou achilles treat our prince with pride let kings be just and sovereign power preside  let both unite with wellconsenting mind so shall authority with strength be joined leave me o king to calm achilles rage rule thou thyself as more advanced in age forbid it gods achilles should be lost the pride of greece and bulwark of our host b i l     etc   0 etc     etc but what effect after all has this oratory agamemnon confesses that all he spoke was right but he will not relinquish his pretensions to briseis achilles promises not to fight for briseis but neither will he for his country opprobious language is given on both sides the council dissolves and the calamities of greece ensue for which reasons i think the eloquence of homers nestor is thrown out of character by its proving unavailable for the great end he designed it  if he had not spoken at all or upon offering to do it had been interrupted and prevented by the fury of achilles who seems to have less veneration for him than agamemnon that hero had acted in character and the eloquence of the reverened orator had never been exercised in vain  the next objection i have to make is against the imprudent and unnecessary measure taken by agamemnon to sound the disposition of the grecians in the second book by proposing the return of the forces to greece a proposal which had taken effect but for the management of ulysses and nestor it is likely indeed to give you the words of dionysius of halicarnassus see note at l    b ii who in mr popes opinion has given us an admirable explication of this whole conduct agamemnon after his quarrel with achilles had nothing so much at heart as to draw the greeks to a battle yet knew not how to proceed without achilles who had just retired from the army he was apprehensive that the greeks who were displeased at the departure of achilles might refuse obedience to his orders should he absolutely command it in this circumstance he proposes an expedient to the princes in council which was that he should sound the dispositions of the people by exhorting them to set sail for greece but that then the other princes should be ready to dissuade and detain them  he had some cause to fear the greeks had a pique against him which they had concealed and whatever it was he judged it absolutely necessary to know it before he proceeded to a battle he therefore furnishes them with an occasion to manifest it and at the same time provides against any ill effects it might have by his secret orders to the princes it succeeds accordingly and when the troops are running to embark they are stopped by ulysses and nestor  now not to insist upon an inaccuracy in this note i e that agamemnon judged it necessary to know what the pique the grecians had against him was which if they had any could be no other than what arose from their displeasure at the departure of achilles as is expressed in the former part of the note i say not to dwell upon this the question is whether this stratagem was not absolutely superseded by the vision sent by jupiter to agamemnon the design of this vision was to deceive him into the hope or rather assurance of taking troy without the assistance of achilles and it had its effect the general persuaded as it were by immediate revelation of jupiters favor toward him and concern for his glory and exalted with the thought of the promised success to his arms communicates his dream to the princes in council who appear to a man to be satisfied of the reality of it and of the good will of jupiter to the grecian cause old nestor gives his advice in consequence of this conviction  princes of greece your faithful ears incline nor doubt the vision of the powers divine sent by great jove to him who rules the host forbid it heaven this warning should be lost then let us haste obey the gods alarms and join to rouse the sons of greece to arms b ii l  0  etc let me ask you now whether if this dream had been communicated to the troops as well as the council they would not as readily have given credit to it and have been impatient to follow to battle a leader who was the declared favorite of heaven would not the belief of taking troy in the next attack under his command have entirely removed the pique they had conceived against him on account of the departure of achilles if so as ingenious as the stratagem in question may be in itself and as artful as the speech of agamemnon is which he makes in pursuance of it it seems to be an expedient to which as things were then circumstanced he was not under the least necessity nor in prudence concerned to have recourse  if you will next turn to the  th book i presume you will find an inconsistency between hectors very particular prophecy of the destruction of troy and his prayer for his son immediately after as also the strong hopes see note at l  0  b vi and firm assurance he often entertains of raising the siege by the flight or destruction of the greeks  yet come it will the day decreed by fates the day when thou imperial troy must bend and see thy warriors fall thy glories end and yet no dire presage so wounds my mind my mothers death the ruin of my kind not priams hoary hairs defiled with gore not all my brothers gasping on the shore as thine andromache thy griefs i dread i see thee trembling weeping captive led etc b vi l   0 etc o thou whose glory fills the aetherial throne and all ye deathless powers protect my son grant him like me to purchase just renown to guard the trojans to defend the crown against his countrys foes the war to wage and rise the hector of the future age l  0  etc heard ye the voice of jove success and fame await on troy on greece eternal shame in vain they skulk behind their boasted wall weak bulwarks destined by this arm to fall  soon as before yon hollow ships we stand fight each with flames and toss the blazing brand till their proud navy wrapped in smoke and fires all greece encompassed in one blaze expires b viii l     etc l     etc i dont apprehend that what mr pope has urged from dacier or advanced himself in order to salve this inconsistency will afford us sufficient satisfaction we ought to reflect says he that this is only a prayer hector in the excess of a tender emotion for his son entreats the gods to preserve troy and permit astyanax to rule there it is at all times allowable to beseech heaven to appease its anger and change its decrees and we are taught that prayers can alter destiny  we are taught i conceive the very reverse of this by the general tenor of the poem this assertion however supposes hector to have foreseen the destruction of troy and the ruin of his family and yet we are told in the next sentence that it cannot be inferred from hence that hector had any divine foreknowledge of his fate etc since in many following passages we find him possessed with strong hopes etc to raise the siege etc is not this a sort of confusion of apologies and a defense of one inconsistency by another in short the direct and express prophecy above quoted cannot without much force be resolved into the mere apprehensions and misgivings of a soul dejected with sorrow etc by considering the great dangers to which he saw all that was dear to him exposed  but to proceed  the circumstance of jupiters weighing in his scales the fates of greece and troy in the  th book and those of hector and achilles in the   d has something very striking and poetical in it but at the same time is itself liable to the objection made by macrobius to virgils imitation of it macrobius says see note at l    b viii mr pope observes with some color that the application of this circumstance is not so just in virgil as in our author for virgil had made juno say before that turnus would certainly perish nunc juvenem imparibus video concurrere fatis parcarumque dies and vis inimica propinquat so that there was less reason for weighing his fate with that of aeneas after that declaration   but is it not as clear that the fates of greece and troy and of hector and achilles in homer were respectively to all intents and purposes declared before this suspension of the scales  jupiter in the beginning of the  th book threatens the deities with the pains of tartarus if they assist either side he had in the end of the the preceding see l     b vii book given tokens of his wrath against the grecians and if we could doubt whether the threatening just mentioned was denounced in favor of the trojans minervas request that she may direct the greeks by her counsels must abundantly convince us that it was  from fields forbidden we submiss refrain with arms unaiding mourn our argives slain yet grant my counsels still their breasts may move or all must perish in the wrath of jove b viii l    etc in the case of hector jupiter is undeniably explicit he declares the fate of that hero approaching though he is inclined with the consent of the inferior deities to rescue him from it  consult ye powers it is worthy your debate whether to snatch him from impending fate or let him bear by stern pelides slain good as he is the lot imposed on man so that virgil appears at least not only to have copied this circumstance from homer but to have applied it with more justice for what juno said previously to the suspension of the scales is not at least so glaring an impropriety as what jupiter says here himself the best excuse perhaps for both these great poets we may borrow from a note of mr popes in the  0th book see note at l    b xx that it was not easy in the pagan religion to form the justest ideas upon a doctrine viz that of destiny the divine power etc so difficult to be cleared and upon which it is no great wonder if a poet should not always be perfectly consistent with himself when it has puzzled such a number of divines and philosophers  before i quit this remark i must just take notice of an oversight in mr pope who tells us in his note see note at l    b viii upon the circumstance of jupiters weighing the fates etc that this figure representing god as weighing the destinies of men in his balances was first made use of in holy writ are these only figurative scales in homer then sure aeschylus did not look upon them to be such when as mr pope informs us from plutarch he wrote a whole tragedy upon this foundation which he called psychostatia or the weighing of souls in this he introduced thetis and aurora standing on either side of jupiters scales and praying each for her son while the heroes fought i dont see therefore how any parallel can reasonably be drawn between this passage which must be literally understood in homer and those figurative expressions in scripture of being weighed in the balance and found light etc by which the impartiality of divine justice is significantly illustrated to the human understanding how far milton may be warranted in borrowing this fine fiction from homer which it is acknowledged he has admirably improved or in representing the deity with a pair of golden compasses in his hand upon another occasion it is not my present business to inquire  thus much at least may be said in his behalf that boldnesses give no offense when there is no allay of impiety in them these remarks shall be continued in my next  eetter x in the note at l     b xii   th book of the iliad we have an account of a signal prodigy which much awakens the readers attention but i think never satisfies it i mean that of the eagle with the serpent in his talons etc which appears over the trojan army polydamas see note at l      upon duly considering it pronounces it to be a warning to them from jupiter not to attempt the grecian entrenchments that day but to retreat etc he tells hector too that what he delivers is not conjecture but science and appeals for the truth of it to the augurs of the army but notwithstanding all this hector holds the interpretation of the omen in the utmost contempt and insinuates that the advice proceeded not from the skill but cowardice of the interpreter he appears indeed to have been in the right not only from the success of the trojan arms at the end of the book when sarpedon makes the first breach in the grecian wall and himself forces open one of the gates but even from the countenance and assistance of jupiter to the trojans immediately after the prodigy itself for the poet tells us at the conclusion of hectors speech to polydamas and upon his rushing to the wall l     that  jove breathes a whirlwind from the hills of i would and drifts of dust the clouded navy hide he fills the greeks with terror and dismay and gives great hector the predestined day l     etc either therefore this appearance had no significancy in it and then it will be difficult to account for the solemnity with which homer introduces it or for his introducing it at all or else it boded misfortune to the grecians in which case polydamas who is every where shown in a favorable light enough makes if not a cowardly yet an ignorant application of it  macrobius it seems see note at l    compares virgils imitation of this passage in the   th aeneid v     etc with the original and gives the preference to the latter on account of virgils having neglected to specify the omen mr pope takes notice in another place of this authors partiality to homer and his observation on this circumstance is a strong instance of it he should have considered as mr pope remarks that virgil had no design or occasion to make an omen of it but took it only as a natural image to paint the posture of two warriors struggling with each other what design or occasion homer himself had for an omen in this place you see it is not so easy to say you have however a proof of the latin poets judgment and may observe that a needless or unintelligible prodigy in homer will make an excellent simile in virgil  the recess see note at l   0 b xx of the gods in the  0th book is an incident which mr pope wonders all the commentators should be silent upon it seems strange at the first view says he that so many deities after having entered the scene of action should perform so short a part and immediately become themselves spectators i must indeed look upon this as an objection to the conduct of the poet let us hear however what mr pope has urged in his vindication he conceives then the reason of this conduct in the poet to be that achilles has been inactive during the greatest part of the poem and as he is the hero of it ought to be the chief character in it the poet therefore withdraws the gods from the field that achilles may have the whole honor of the day and not act in subordination to the deities besides the poem now draws to a conclusion and it is necessary for homer to enlarge upon the exploits of achilles that he may leave a noble idea of his valor upon the mind of the reader  now i would take the liberty to ask whether it be derogatory to the important character of achilles to act in subordination to the deities whether their superintendency and assistance has not been an honor to every hero in the course of the iliad particularly to diomed in the fifth book whether achilles himself makes so great a figure in this book as he does in the next when scamander attacks him with all his waves when neptune and pallas see l   0 b xxi appear to assist him simois joins scamander and at length vulcan by the instigation of juno almost dries up the river does the interposition of these deities do a discredit to the valor of achilles or leave a less noble idea of it upon the mind of the reader than he would have had without it  i dare say you will agree with me that what mr pope observes in the next note is a kind of answer to what he has advanced in this and be convinced that the magnificent introduction of achilles into the field in the beginning of this book when the gods descend to battle and all nature is in an uproar is not answered by any suitable exploits of that hero or by any achievement worthy so pompous and terrible an apparatus after the gods are withdrawn achilles and aeneas meet but in the very moment you expect to see a bloody combat you are entertained with a tedious conversation take mr popes own words  see note at l     b  0 our expectation is raised to see gods and heroes engaged when suddenly it all sinks into such a combat in which neither party receives a wound and what is more extraordinary the gods are made the spectators of so small an action what occasion was there for thunder earthquakes and descending deities to introduce a matter of so little importance neither is it any excuse to say the poet has given us a piece of ancient history we expected to read a poet not an historian in short after the greatest preparation for action imaginable he suspends the whole narration and from the heat of a poet cools at once into the simplicity of an historian  i cannot help asking here whether this be the first time homer is faulty in this respect to acquiesce in mr popes ingenious justification of the interview between glaucus and diomed see note at l     b vi in the  th book which has occasioned so much censure i fear the speech of nestor to patroclus in the   th book is equally blameable with the conversation in question machaon is wounded achilles who overlooked the action from his ship sends patroclus to inquire whether it was he etc that hero has no sooner entered nestors tent but he sees machaon bleeding and is impatient to return to his friend with the news upon this nestor detains him in his tent standing with a speech greatly blameable for being too long he see note at l  0  b xi crowds incident upon incident and when he speaks of himself he expatiates upon his own great actions very naturally indeed to old age but unseasonably in the present juncture etc etc etc the circumstances he mentions as they have no visible allusion to the design of the speech seem to be unfortunately introduced in short i think they are not so valuable upon any other account as because they preserve a piece of ancient history etc perhaps the piece of ancient history preserved here is no more valuable than that which aeneas leaves us in the above conversation  but be that as it will it is methinks surprising to find mr pope after having so impartially given up the passage looking after excuses and pretenses to palliate this conduct of his author i will only mention one on which most stress seems to be laid it may not be from the purpose to observe says our english homer that nestor might designedly protract the speech that partoclus might himself behold the distress of the army etc whether this was the intention or not it must be allowed that the stay of patroclus was very happy for the greeks for by this means he met eurypylus wounded who confirmed him into a certainty that their affairs were desperate without achilless aid did patroclus want to be told this then after the embassy to achilles in the  th book or after achilles had told him what he could not indeed be ignorant of when he dispatched him upon this very message that  the time is come when yon despairing host shall learn the value of the man they lost now at my knees the greeks shall pour their moan and proud atrides tremble on his throne b xi l     etc in short any absurdity may be refined away if the present can and if it may be made to appear that the length of nestors speech the interview of patroclus and eurypylus and the farther delay occasioned by the formers stay to cure the wounds of the latter which might have been effected by another hand were proper and well timed in this place  it is now no season for these kind delays the great achilles with impatience stays   thou know the fiery temper of my friend l     etc but to return to the deities the magnificent introduction of the gods above referred to so much extolled by longinus see note at l    b xx seems to be the utmost effort of homers prodigious genius and after all perhaps we must ascribe their recess so soon to the poets consciousness of the inequality of human nature to so exalted a subject it is certain the sublimity of the passage before us consists not so much in the horrors of an actual combat as in the dreadful pomp of preparation but you will desire to know what became of this supposed consciousness in the next book when the deities are really described engaging each other to which i can only say that whatever induced homer to attempt here what he seems to have declined before i am apt to think the battle of the gods the worst upon the whole that occurs in the poem mr pope himself is much of the same opinion you will naturally imagine in the following remark upon it see note at l     b xxi i must confess i am at a loss how to justify homer in every point of these combats with the gods when diana and juno are to fight juno calls her an impudent bitch  when they fight she boxes her soundly and sends her crying and trembling to heaven as soon as she comes thither jupiter falls a laughing at her indeed the rest of the deities seem to be in a merry vein during all the action though mr pope should have excepted neptune and apollo from the first of which gods we have another piece of ancient history pallas beats mars and laughs at him jupiter sees them in the same merry mood juno when she had cuffed diana is not more serious in short unless there be depths that i am not able to fathom homer never better deserved than in this place the censure past upon him by the ancients that as he raised the characters of his men up to gods so he sunk those of gods down to men or even below them  mr pope is willing to believe however that an allegory may be couched under all this and i wish any body could discover it in the mean time i cannot but observe that it is great pity the gods and goddesses that often appear so nobly in separate machines throughout the iliad should make so mean a figure in the present battle  i must request your attention to one incident more which mr pope would fain reconcile us to viz the flight of hector in the   d book i apprehend that what that commentator alleges from the sea note at l   0 b xxii conduct of virgil who transferred this passage to the death of turnus and likewise from the doctrine of aristotle is extremely insufficient for his purpose turnus is a character much inferior to aeneas and therefore we are little shocked at his running away from him but this is confessedly not the case the point of mere strength excepted with hector when compared to achilles it was you will say that very strength which he feared  was it not that very strength too which he had frequently encountered and if it was not necessary he should fly i will venture to say it is a circumstance infinitely disagreeable to the reader that he does  nor farther is the suffrage of aristotle himself if i understand it at all satisfactory upon this point the wonderful says he ought to have place in tragedy but still more in epic poetry which proceeds in this point even to the unreasonable for as in epic poems one sees not the persons acting so whatever passes the bounds of reason is proper to produce the admirable and the mavelous for example what homer says of hector pursued by achilles would appear ridiculous on the stage for the spectators could not forbear laughing to see on one side the greeks standing without any motion and on the other achilles pursuing hector etc etc but all this does not appear when we read the poem for what is wonderful is always agreeable and as a proof of it we find that they who relate any thing usually add something to the truth that it may the better please those who hear it  what can we infer from all this but that the flight of hector round the walls of troy is an action which as such will much better bear being told than represented no doubt of it  but is an action all this while which is unreasonable in itself therefore agreeable because it may be told with propriety do we never wonder without admiring or marvel with disgust as well as delight i will grant this incident renders this part of the poem more astonishing as aristotle says in a subsequent paragraph of mr popes note but why it is more admirable i am quite at a loss to conceive  what mr pope urges himself in vindication of this circumstance has much more weight in it as that hector never thought himself a match for achilles that this incident is prepared by degrees as dacier has observed too that the mere sight and voice of achilles unarmed has terrified and put the whole trojan army into disorder that hector stays not that he hopes to overcome achilles but because shame etc forbid him to reenter the city that he stayed by the immediate will of heaven irresistibly bound down by fate that he had been reflecting on the injustice of the war he maintained that his spirits are depressed by heaven that he flies not from achilles as a mortal hero but from one whom he sees clad in impenetrable armor seconded by minerva etc etc which considerations do indeed amount to a proof of the probability of hectors flight but i think are no argument for the necessity of it in short as mr pope himself says he dont absolutely pretend to justify this passage in every point i presume i may venture to say if hector had stood his ground we should have liked the poem better for it  i cannot think by the way that it is a high exaltation of achilles that so brave a man as hector durst not stand him it would methinks have redounded more to achilless glory had hector been represented as a match for him indeed this great event wherein the whole fate of greece and troy was decided by the sword of achilles and hector does less honor to that hero than any one action he had been engaged in for the last of the above reasons alleged for hectors flight and besause he knew that hector was to fall by his hand he was assured of this by neptune and pallas in the   st book   hector alone shall stand his fatal chance and hectors blood shall smoke upon thy lance thine is the glory doomed  l     etc and again by minerva just before his engagement with hector see l     etc b xxii nay he tells hector himself it is pallas pallas gives thee to my lance l     and yet mr pope inserts an observation in the   th book which he informs us ought to have been made before which is that achilles did not know that hector was to fall by his hand if he had known it where would have been the mighty courage in engaging him in a single combat in which he was sure to conquer the contrary of this is evident continues he from the words of achilles to hector just before the combat  i will make no compacts with thee but one of us shall fall  but sure this declaration is very consistent with the knowledge of his future success even though it had been less clearly ascertained to him  i hope these remarks are sufficient to support my former assertions in regard to homer i shall just mention a few particulars more in my next in order to make my criticism as complete as i can under the present form and to corroborate what has been repeatedly advanced and then take my leave for a time of this noble author  letter xi if you consider the iliad of homer with any thing of exactness of attention you will perceive numberless marks of a genius thoughtless of or it may be superior to the niceties and proprieties in which the excellencies of secondrate authors wholly consist to what has been offered already for the illustration of this truth you may add if you please the repetitions with which homer so much abounds i am far from asserting that these are never proper though they are often as mr pope confesses see note at l   0 b viii visibly absurd i will only point out one place where it is owing to a repetition that the very design of the author cannot easily be understood i mean the speech of agamemnon in the  th book wherein he proposes to the generals to quit the siege etc the critics see note at l    b ix are divided in their opinion mr pope acquaints us whether this speech which is word for word the same with that agamemnon makes in the  d book be only a feint to try the army as it is there or the real sentiments of the general mr pope says he does not pretend to decide upon this point nor is it indeed of any great consequence any farther than as it makes good what has been remarked however that agamemnon upon this occasion spoke his real sentiments is i think most probable because upon a parallel one in the   th book he proposes the very same thing to the grecian princes though in different words  again it is in my opinion more reasonable to put the frequent incongruities we meet with in homer to the account of inadvertency etc than to reconcile them by forced and unnatural constructions thus minerva who is always represented as prudently suppressing her anger upon jupiters declaring himself for troy does yet in one place see l     etc b viii break out into as much virulency of language as juno herself  thus neptune in the same book when juno sollicits him to assist the greeks rejects so desperate a proposal with indignation  what rage what madness furious queen is thine i war not with the highest all above submit and tremble at the hand of jove b viii l     etc but in the   th book he talks in a quite different strain and seems determined to dispute the superiority with jupiter himself  what means the haughty sovereign of the skies rule as he will his portiond realms on high no vassal god nor of his train am i  olympus and this earth in common lie what claim has here the tyrant of the sky etc b xv l  0  etc  thus diomed to give you one instance more is seized with fear at the very sight see note at l     b xi of hector in the   th book for which mr pope gives us no other reason than that diomed had just told us that jupiter fought against the grecians and yet in the  th book when that deity see note at l     b viii personally interposes and throws a burning thunderbolt at the feet of this heros horses he can scarce prevail with himself to retreat thrice turned the chief and thrice imperial jove on idas summits thundered from above b viii l  0  it should be remembered too that at the very time when diomed is struck with this panick the poet tells us notwithstanding the favor of jupiter to troy the battle was doubtful  and level hangs the doubtful scale of fight l     nay at that instant the greeks were victors ulysses kills hypirochus and hippodamus diomed slays agastrophus and even gives hector a blow that stuns him and insults him afterward etc see from line     to     it is needless to multiply such examples  i should lastly be inclined to ascribe to the same cause the frequent unsuitableness of homers epithets etc which as they are sometimes distinctive and specific if i may so say so are they often general and applied at random priam as mr pope himself has see note at l     b vii observed is styled  when he rejects the wholesome advice of antenor and complies with his son  it is the  the godlike polydore whom achilles kills in the  0th book and yet see l     b xx this hero is only the youngest son of priam was forbidden to fight and famous only for the swiftness of his speed etc to the forbidden field he takes his flight in the first folly of a youthful knight l     the mention of these glaring improprieties is abundantly sufficient for the purpose else you might be directed to many more of the like sort in almost any book of the poem though they may not be improper in an equal degree  i have now finished my remarks upon the iliad of homer with as much accuracy i hope as was requisite and must leave it to your consideration whether the common opinion in respect of this poet founded on the interpretations and the prejudices etc of the commentators be not on many accounts an erroneous one if you will suppose this author to have been not only the most sublime but the most simple too of all writers you will i believe have a much more natural and ready excuse for many of his blemishes than the shifts and glosses of interpreters can supply you with indeed these defects in an original author who was inspired with the spirit of poetry even to a degree of enthusiasm to which inadvertency and extravagance are essential will in a great measure carry their apology with them  i have given you my sentiments impartially and should take a much greater pleasure in reviewing the beauties of this admirable poet than i have done in arraigning his faults but mr pope to whom i refer you has illustrated these to more advantage than i could  the practice of succeeding writers of many denominations is a demonstration that we may find a great deal more in homer to imitate than to avoid to convince you of my high esteem of him and that i mean to part in friendship with him i will finish with part of that translation from longinus varying only and abating an expression or two which concludes mr popes notes on the sixth book in our decisions on the characters of great men etc we must impartially confess that with all their errors they have more perfections than the nature of man can almost be conceived capable of attaining  he who commits no faults is barely read without censure but a genius truly great excites admiration in short the magnificence of a single period in one of these admirable authors is almost sufficient to atone for all their defects nay farther if any one should collect from homer all the errors that have escaped him they would bear but little proportion to the many beauties to be met with in almost every page of his writings it is on this account that envy through so many ages has never been able to wrest from him the prize of eloquence etc etc which his merits have so justly acquired an acquisition which he still is and will in all probability continue possessed of as long as streams in silver mazes rove or spring with annual green renews the grove mr fenton  letter xii in my former letters i endeavored to entertain you with some free but i hope just remarks upon mr popes commentaries upon homer if you please we will now take a short review of that excellent persons translation of the same incomparable author i must once more prevent your surprise and perhaps your indignation by declaring that i agree with all the world in allowing this to be in the main the best translation that our or it may be any language has produced if i think we might have had a better translation in some few respects i only mean that we might have had it from mr pope himself nay i will go a step further and grant you with much satisfaction that this celebrated translator always errs on the right side and even when he does not do his reader justice never fails to do honor to his original i should rather say to himself for if boldness of figure force of expression smoothness and ease of numbers and the correspondence of sound with sense be the great beauties of poetical diction i should make no scruple upon the whole to prefer the english iliad to the greek but these very excellencies are in some sort his errors and what i admire in this poem i cannot help often considering as blameable in the translation in short it is the overpoeticalness of this translation if i may so call it which i take to be exceptionable in many place and yet as there was no danger of so naturally a warm translators sinking into flatness and insipidity so one would have thought he had laid himself under restraints sufficient to have prevented his ever soaring into the other extreme of rapture and extravagance  there is not more fire in any one part of the translation than there is good sense and cool reasoning in the following extract from the preface it should be considered what methods may afford some equivalent in our language for the graces of these viz the diction and versification in the greek it is certain no literal translation can be just to an excellent original in a superior language but it is a great mistake to imagine that a rash paraphrase can make amends for this general defect which is no less in danger to lose the spirit of an ancient by deviating into the modern manners of expression if there be sometimes a darkness there is often a light in antiquity which nothing better preserves than a version almost literal i know no liberties one ought to take but those which are necessary for translating the spirit of the original and supporting the poetical style of the translation and i will venture to say there have not been more men misled in former times by a servile dull adherence to the letter than have been deluded in ours by a chimerical insolent hope of raising and improving their author it is not to be doubted that the fire of the poem is what a translator should principally regard as it is most likely to expire in his managing however it is his safest way to be content with preserving this to his utmost in the whole without endeavoring to be more than he finds his author is in any particular place it is a great secret in writing to know when to be plain and when poetical and figurative and it is what homer will teach us if we will but follow modestly in his footsteps where his diction is bold and lofty let us raise ours as high as we can but where his is plain and humble we ought not to be deterred from imitating him by the fear of incurring the censure of a mere english critic nothing that belongs to homer seems to have been more commonly mistaken than the just pitch of his style some of his translators having swelled into fustian in a proud confidence of the sublime others sunk into flatness in a cold and timorous notion of simplicity  there is a graceful and dignified simplicity as well as a bald and sordid one etc  it is one thing to be nicked up and another not to be dressed at all simplicity is the mien between ostentation and rusticity  if mr pope had always conducted his translation conformably to these just sentiments it would have been the most exact as it is now the most spirited one extant but i believe you will by and by be convinced that he has often modernized his original too much and sacrificed the true simplicity of the ancients in general and the particular air and cast of his author either to an excess of affection for him and desire to set his work in the most advantageous light to the english reader or to an undue fear of lessening and injuring him through the inferiority of our language to the grecian in many respects to one or both of those we are indebted i presume for many bold strokes of poetry and fine pieces of painting and imagery which are not so much copies of as refinements on the original  and by the way it may be remarked that mr pope should have been more than ordinarily cautious upon this article as he was under an absolute necessity of sinking some peculiarities in homers diction which would not bear transplanting into our tongue such are his compound epithets and repetitions how our translator has acquitted himself with regard to these you will be best informed by consulting himself see preface to mr popes homer   it is however to be observed in general that every thing characteristical in an author is as far as may be to be most religiously retained and that notwithstanding the allowed occasional use of the periphrasis or circumlocution the transposition of words and the substitution of one expression in the room of another etc etc by means of which the spirit of an original is preserved without prejudice to the literal sense all imaginable care is to be taken that these liberties under the pretense of maintaining and supporting this spirit do not really overpower and extinguish it redundancies are as unoriginal as insipidities and the spirit of an author may be as much overwhelmed in exuberance on the one hand as it evaporates in frigidity on the other  fire and water are scarce more opposite than mr popes translation of the iliad and that of the aeneid by dr trapp i am apt to think we shall often form very wrong ideas of these poems if we regulate them by these respective translations for mr pope seems to have exalted the true simplicity of homer as graceful and dignified as it is in the same degree that the doctor has debased the majesty of virgil  you will begin to think it high time i should make good this charge which i shall accordingly endeavor to do by pointing to a few select passages out of numbers that might be produced in which you will plainly discover certain boldnesses and prettynesses for you must gratify me in the use of that term for them and very frequently a mixture of both that were taken from the storehouse of mr popes own imagination and are utterly foreign to and destructive of the plain scope and unaffected spirit of his author  there is not perhaps in all the iliad a more pompous description than that of achilles arming himself in the   th book the comparisons and images as mr pope well observes rise in a noble scale one above another the hero is set in a still stronger point of light than before till he is at last in a manner covered over with glories he is at first likened to the moonlight then to the flames of a beacon then to a comet and lastly to the sun itself but with all this sublimity and almost enthusiasm there is a simplicity which is i conceive lost in that exaggeration of imagery with which the translator has embelished the passage the whole description which is too long to be transcribed is rather loosely paraphrased perhaps than otherwise but the parts i have marked are so many beautiful excrescencies which have no sort of warrant from the letter or most of them even from the import of the text   his limbs in arms divine achilles dressed  he grinds his teeth and furious with delay oerlooks the embattled host and hopes the bloody day  next his high head the helmet graced behind the sweepy crest hung floating in the wind like the red star that from his flaming hair shakes down diseases pestilence and war so streamed the golden honors from his head trembled the sparkling plumes and the loose glories shed  all bright in heavenly arms above his squire achilles mounts and sets the field on fire not brighter phoebus in the ethereal way flames from his chariot and restores the day the following passages seem liable to the same objections with the preceding   host against host

of that boldness which it is impossible to preserve in another language it may be sometimes very true but if you will be at the pains of comparing these transcripts with the original i believe you will think that the very figure in the greek which occasioned that observation  my spear is mad hardly ranks higher than the major part of those which i have quoted  i will conclude this letter with repeating one general remark that mr pope by improving and embellishing a simple hint in his author and raising pompous superstructures upon plain foundations and by too frequently giving a loose to his own fancy has in many places rather poetically paraphrased homer than translated him  letter xiii as there are certain heterogeneous and unhomerical boldnesses in mr popes translation if you will permit me to call them so so there are several prettynesses as has been hinted which i presume will fall under the same denominations the following are a few of the most remarkable   over the vale descends the living cloud b ii ver      fainter murmurs died upon the ear  b ii ver      groves of lances glitter in the air b ii ver      all the war descends upon the wing b iii ver  0 as when the moon refulgent lamp of night over heavens clear azure spreads her sacred light when not a breath disturbs the deep serene and not a cloud oercasts the solemn scene around her throne the vivid planets

     the whirling car smoaks through the ranks oertakes the flying war  b xvi ver   0 as the young olive in some sylvan scene crowned by fresh fountains with eternal green lifts the gay head in snowy flowerets fair and plays and dances to the gentle air etc etc b xvii ver    and shot the shining mischief to the heart b xix ver    now twilight veiled the glaring fall of day and clad the dusky fields in sober gray b xxiv ver     these last cited verses put me in mind of mr popes descriptions of the morning throughout this translation which one only excepted see ver     b    are much more elegant and picturesque than their counterparts in the original   now from forth the chambers of the main to shed his sacred light on earth again arose the golden chariot of the day and tipped the

morn with early blushes spread now rose refulgent from tithonus bed with newborn day to gladden mortal sight and gild the courts of heaven with sacred light b xi ver   etc soon as aurora heaved her orient head above the waves that blushed with early red with newborn day to gladden etc the affectation of poetry in all these places has diffused an air over mr popes translation quite different from the neat but generally unornamented style of his author to which the inexpressible simplex munditiis of horace may pertinently enough be applied it is owing to this that we meet with such figurative expressions as these around his head an iron tempest rained a wood of spears his ample shield sustained b v ver      to which we may subjoin a multitude of others similar to them throughout the english iliad  as  bristling lances  the steely circle  dark showers of javlins  the tide of combat  the stream of fight  the tide of war  the wooden tempest  the rocky shower  the living flame or fire  the tide of trojans  lifes purple tide  etc etc etc in the free and unlimited use of which the translation is i apprehend little justified by the original  i have often thought it was with the same view to ornament etc etc that mr pope wrote his translation in rhyme however what advantages were hereby gained we shall see presently but it is certain in the mean time that by the use of it the translation becomes absolutely modern and in its very form unlike the original mr dryden says in his dedication prefixed to his translation of the aeneid that he who can write well in rhyme may write better in blank verse and that rhyme is a constraint even to the best poets and those who make it with most ease that what it adds to sweetness it takes away from sense and that it often makes us swerve from an authors meaning  i wish by the by mr dryden had not asserted one way and translated another  it is plain the superfluities complained of in mr pope are in a great measure to be imputed to this method of translation  i believe you have had some instances of this already but the following are notorious ones  he ceased his armys loud applauses rise and the long shout runs echoing through the skies b iii ver     fierce discord storms apollo loud exclaims fame calls mars thunders and the fields in flames b v ver     great agamemnon bids the greeks forbear they breathe and hush the tumult of the war b vii ver    and in his hands two steely javlins wields that blaze to heaven and lighten all the fields b xi ver    in vain he calls the din of helms and shields rings to the skies and echoes through the fields the brazen hinges fly the walls rosound heaven trembles roar the mountains thunders all the ground b xii ver  0  i have purposely selected these verses because excepting the marked redundancies which the rhyme required they are as close a translation as any in the whole performance mr pope no doubt was sensible of this inconvenience naturally inseparable from rhyme but he supposed probably the advantage gained thereby in point of smoothness and harmony would make sufficient amends for it of all things he would not have his author thought unpoetical though there are certainly many passages in him which as mr pope himself occasionally acknowledges are not made to shine in poetry it would be tedious to pick out all these and therefore i will only for illustrations sake transcribe a very remarkable one in which a most simple unadorned narration of homer consisting of a list of proper names and those even without epithets for the far greater part is by virtue of mr popes adjuncts circumlocutions and rhimes transformed into as poetical and entertaining a description as most in the iliad  the circling nereids with their mistress weep and all the seagreen sisters of the deep thalia glauce every watery name nesaea mild and silver spio came cymothoe and cymodoce were nigh and the blue languish of soft alias eye their locks actaea and limnora rear then proto doris panope appear thoa therusa doto melita agave gentle and ampithoe gay next callianira callianassa show their sister looks dexamene the slow and swift dynamene now cut the tides icera now the verdant wave divides nemertes with apseudes lifts the head bright galatea quits her pearly bed these orythia clymene attend moera amphirome the train extend and black junira and junassa fair and amatheia with her amber hair b xviii ver    etc this whole passage which makes so pretty a figure in mr popes hands if literally i mean fairly translated and that too in blank verse would undoubtedly be very flat and spiritless then proto doris panope appear thoa pherusa doro melita  are more just translations than any two lines of the whole number though they have neither fire nor fancy in them in such places as these rhyme may among other expedients help to save the poetical character of an author by giving a seeming equivalent for spirit in sound  but why must a translation be beautiful and poetical when the original is not so  it is the business of a translator to give us the whole of an author not at all events to make the best of him  i will venture to say that had mr pope obliged the world with a blank verse translation of homer at the same time that he would have more effectually preserved the air he would have deviated less from the sense of his author and that his version upon the whole would have been as poetical as animated and even as harmonious as the present dr trapp observes i think very justly in his preface to the aeneid that blank verse is not only more majestic etc but more musical and harmonious than rhyme it has says he more rhyme in it according to the ancient and true sense of the word than rhyme itself as it is now used for in its original signification it consists not in the tinkling of vowels and consonants but in the metrical disposition of words and syllables and the proper cadence of numbers which is more agreeable to the ear without the jingling of like endings than with it  after all the measure in blank verse does really and specifically distinguish it from mere prose and if so rhyme is not wanted for this purpose nor can it be pretended that the strong colors of poetry the beauties of description figures images etc etc are capable of being displayed to more advantage in rhyme than in blank verse  indeed these are not peculiar even to poetry they are independent on meter and derive not energy or strength but gracefulness only and dignity from numbers  they are fitter for verse than prose but not more essential to it  thus the bold figures similies and thoughts etc of homer would be of the same intrinsic value out of measure as in it  as the holy scriptures by the way though literally translated in plain prose are in numberless instances poetical though they are by no means a poem  it is not for the sake of luster but order that diamonds and pearls are ranged upon a string  but to return to mr pope  whatever credit his translation may have done the original by heightening and improving it in some respects by means of rhyme and thereby skreening sometimes a simplicity or perhaps a flatness and frigidity of diction which homer only was answerable for it is as true too that it sometimes by reason only of the rhyme falls short of it and is less beautiful and significant in itself mr pope is very happy in his imitations of those passages where homer applies the sound to the sense see particularly b i ver     etc b x ver     etc b xiii ver     etc b xiii ver  00  but he would have succeeded still more in these places i presume had he been uncumbered with the shackles of rhyme how much better and stronger would the following lines have appeared without rhimes than with them  first march the heavy mules securely slow or hills over dales over crags over rocks they go jumping high over the shrubs of the rough ground rattle the clattring cars and the shockt axles bound loud sounds the axe redoubling strokes on strokes on all sides round the forest hurls her oaks headlong deepechoing groan the thickets brown then rusling crackling crashing thunder down b xxiii ver   0 in spite of the roughness and unmusicalness of this excellent description there is to me a certain evenness and an harmony in the tone of the rhimes which alone renders it inferior to the original itself  to conclude i will upon the strength of these observations put two questions to you which you may determine at your leisure whether a blank verse translation is not like to be more faithful to its original than one in rhyme and whether mr pope would not have been a better translator if he had not been so good a poet  letter xiv after reading my last you will not wonder to hear me wishing rhimes were utterly banished from great poetry by which the critics understand the epopee and the drama how far they may be requisite or even beautiful in lyric elegiac pastoral etc or especially didactic poetry i shall not enquire but it is certain they are in general rather obstructions than helps toward the great purposes of firing the heart and moving the passions  you need only read over your milton and the best tragedies of shakespeare to be convinced of this  and if i would have every firstrate original poem written in blank verse for the sake of the ear as well as the heart i must still more strongly recommend the use of the same to translations  rhyme is so abhorrent from the air and genius of the ancient poetry that nothing but the absolute necessity of it can i think render it dispensable in an english version  now convenient it may sometimes be but it is never necessary  whatever are the imperfections and defects of our language they are it is my opinion such as rhyme though it may disguise can never supply but i would exclude hypocrisy from poetry as well as religion and confess for my own part that i had much rather see a translation in some places inferior to its original than unlike it in all if upon the whole not only the very cast but the sense and spirit of an author may be better preserved in blank verse than rhyme every reasonable critic will make allowances for the poverty and natural inferiority of our mother tongue mr pitts translation of the aeneid is a very noble one though i cannot conceive what induced him to give it us in rhyme unless it was the apprehension of the inequality of our language to the diction of his author where it is most plain and unpoetical indeed purity and manliness are the chief characteristics of virgil as fire and vivacity are those of homer for which reason i should imagine the latter a more attemptable author than the former if mr pope had not precluded every undertaking of this nature even though he wrote in rhyme for bold figures strong paintings and beautiful colorings may be ransfused from one language to another but purity simplicity and elegance though they are the same things in all tongues are not equally striking in them all  however no translation can go farther than the genius of our language will admit and even with regard to virgil it will go i am inclined to believe far enough to convey a strong idea of this noble original in all its parts it will go farther at least without rhyme than with it dr trapp indeed than whom no body better understood his author by too superstitious an adherence to the letter and particularly a fruitless and perpetual endeavor to retain the brevity of virgil is cold and languid upon numberless occasions and has thereby perhaps contributed more to the disreputation of blank verse than any other writer he was offended and not without reason with the licentiousness of mr drydens translation but his squeamishness has carried him into the other extreme for if mr dryden runs away from virgil the doctor is tied to him  there is by the by this observable difference between mr drydens deviations from virgil and mr popes from homer that those of the latter are always uniform graceful and beautiful and if they are not homers thoughts are at least worthy of him whereas mr dryden is apt to dwindle into a kind of puerility which was but too natural to him that is altogether unsuitable to the gravity and dignity of virgil  between this translator then and dr trapp there lay a middle way which mr pit has judiciously taken and religiously pursued to the immortal glory of virgil to his own infinite honor and the credit of our language notwithstanding all this i think he has left room for a translation of another kind as dr trapp says of his when compared with mr drydens by writing in rhyme  i attempted some time ago for my own amusement to translate some of the speeches in the first book of the aeneid into blank verse from a notion that virgil if he had been born in england and in this present age as mr dryden expresses himself would have spoken something like such english as i flattered myself i could speak for him  i have ventured to send you a few specimens which for your satisfaction i could wish you diligently and impartially to compare with the several translaions and with the original itself l

remarks is eminent for its clearness it purity its easiness and its magnificence to which we must add no doubt that which can rarely be transferred with any tolerable grace into our language viz its brevity  how far these translations do justice to the original as far as may be in regard to all these particulars or whether equal justice can possibly be done to it by rhyme from the very nature of it i now leave it with you to judge and am  yours etc etc  finis
