fugitive pieces  coacta prodire  written by j p kemble  york printed by w blanchard and co for the author and sold by fielding and walker london and t wilson and son and n frobisher york mdcclxxx  preface i declare i hardly know how to say what justice to myself obliges me to say  the public hears daily of so many unlucky poets who become publishers from the same fate that ranges me in their class that i am apprehensive the truth when told will not serve me as an apology but the effect of constraint be reputed the wish of presumption  the course of my studies first gave me a taste for poetry and the sweetness of the art inspired me with an inclination to improve it  the few who saw my verses said they liked them and would sometimes ask for a copy of what they had seen  the first pleasure i know is to please and indeed i thought complying with their requests an easy return for the obligation of their praise  they had copies and in their high opinion of me gave copies to others who soon circulated some of my pieces as particular favors to particular friends through half a dozen editions of which three or four were generally very incorrect  to prevent this evil from spreading i have here collected in one small book those verses of which i have ever given copies as far as remembrance and possession have permitted me  all parents have a partiality to their own child  so every writer has a partiality to the productions of his own brain that would rather they were seen in a perfect than an imperfect situation  and when a mans writings must unavoidably be delivered into the hands of the public a decent respect for his own character and good manners to his fellowcreatures will oblige him to endeavor as much as possiible that they may not excite a contempt for himself nor be entirely useless and disgusting to his readers  york    0 fugitive pieces hebes birthday addressed to miss  the queen of paphos flowery groves ascends her doveborne car cupid the graces and the

same  my fondness  says the other and adds ah how unlike thy virtuous mother unlike indeed  what belle can bear the road in which her prim progenetrix has trod  next  but i will not repeat such odious stuff  i am sure you have heard absurdity enough these my objections to the bard i made before his be  li  sa  ri  us was played  would you believe it  says the tasteless creature madam i always strive to copy nature eclogue this is the last of four eclogues  morning  noon  evening  night  it is the only one of them published at present because no friend of mine has yet distributed to his friend any copies of the others night despair addressed to mrs  his sportive lambs reposed in gentle rest thus daphnis sung the sorrows of his breast  ah me the day  when over the jocund green  daphnis the first to lead the dance was seen on blythesome reed the frolic round i played envied by swains admired by every maid to list my strains my lambs have left their food and fondly seemed to say my strains were good  oh they were sweet  my pipe was tuned to love and hebes name made vocal every grove those joys are past  no more the tinkling stream shall stay its course to dwell on that loved name no more the vale my merry notes shall hear far other feelings wait upon despair  hebe how often i have brushed the glistring dew and plucked the pride of vernal morns for you  the virgin lily with the blushing rose and blueeyd vilet for your wreath i chose and while i bound it on your temples stole kisses that thrilled with rapture to my soul  am i not now as fair as when you said a lovelier youth never blessed a happy maid alas some other swain has caught your eye  he cannot be so true so fond as i unmoved could daphnis hear his hebe moan no  he would bewail her sorrows as his own on the green turf he would seat him by his dear give for each look a sigh  each sigh a tear the lovely mourner to his bosom press partake the cause and lessen her distress but wherefore witless do i thus complain relentless hebe laughs at all my pain  why wake my lambkins  sure they cannot know they heed not feel not for their masters woe some happier youth at dawn with careful crook shall guide you bleeting to the limpid brook shall tend afield the fleecy flocks i bred pride of the vale and riches of the mead  my friends my father and my native home this tear is yours  to distant plains i roam  a dieu the wellknown rill the field the grove  absence perhaps may soothe the pangs of love night checked her yoke to hear the artless swain and wept that faithful love should love in vain a picture of helen to the right honorable lady  repentant helen sought the silent shade and wept to think what ruin she had made reflection shows a husbands injured peace hears the deep carses of unpeopled greece points to the story of her ruined fame and future ages shuddring at her name lovely in guilt the great adultress stood saw phrygias plains imbrued with hectors blood saw the slain partner of her lawless joy a murdered priam and a slaming troy she heaved a groan and closed her tearstaind eye lest she might see the grecian heroes die  in vain  patroclus rises to her fight dressed in the reddest horrors of the fight linked with his friend the great achilles rose the tower of greece and terror of her foes stern ajax frowned upon the gory field longing in death to grasp pelides shield  vainly she strives to put them from her mind her guilt hears groans in every whispering wind see plated mars high on his crimson car laugh midst the spreading tumult of the war now sees the greeks and now the trojans fly and hears one deathfraught thunder rend the sky  she heard  and struck with horror at the scene on earths cold bosom sunk the hapless queen in duteous haste her virgins round her press heave sigh for sigh and grieve for her distress anxious each balm to sooth her woes they seek and bid its native roses tinge her cheek fruitless their care  in tears they raise her head where lilies wept their sister roses dead hark  the kind streamlet from the neighboring trees in gentle murmurs chides the noisy breeze  the noisy breeze the sweet reproof obeyed beheld the fair and died along the glade behold her thou whose passions long to rove careless of honor and connubial love and learn that though enamored of her charms her doting lord had taken her to his arms again restored her to his bed and throne and to the world acknowledged her his own  yet not his pardon nor his throne combined could ease the pangs that agonizd her mind epitaphium siste viator hic sepulta
