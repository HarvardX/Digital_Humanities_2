father of guzman and late governor zamor sovereign of a part of potosi montezuma sovereign of another part alzire daughter of montezuma emira  attendants on alzire cephale   spanish officers americans scene lima in his preface to this play voltaire says this tragedy the fable of which is invented and almost of a new species was written with a view of showing how far superior the spirit of true religion is to the light of nature the religion of a barbarian consists in offering up to his gods the blood of his enemies a christian badly instructed has seldom much more humanity to be a strict observer of some unnecessary rites and ceremonies and at the same time deficient in the most essential duties to say certain prayers at particular times and carefully to conceal his vices this is his religion that of a true christian is to look upon all mankind as his brethren to do them all the good in his power and pardon their offences such is guzman at the hour of death and alvarez during the whole course of his life such a man was henry iv as i have described him even with all his foibles in every part of my writings i have endeavored to enforce that humanity which ought to be the distinguishing characteristic of a thinking being the reader will always find in them if i may venture to say so much of my own works a desire to promote the happiness of all men and an abhorrence of injustice and oppression it is this and this alone which hath hitherto saved them from that obscurity to which their many inperfections would otherwise long since have condemned them   act i scene i alvarez guzman alvarez   at length for so the council hath decreed   guzman succeeds alvarez long my son   mayest thou preserve for heaven and for thy king   this better half of our new conquered world   this fertile source of riches and of crimes   joyful to thee i yield the post of honor   that suits but ill with feeble age like mine   in youth thy father trod the paths of glory   alvarez first our winged castles bore   to mexicos astonished sons he led   spains gallant heroes to this golden shore   after a life spent in my countrys service   could i have formed these heroes into men   could i have made them virtuous mild and good   i had been amply paid for all my toils   but who shall stop the haughty conqueror   alas my son their cruelties obscure   the lustre of their fame i weep the fate   of these unhappy victors raised by heaven   to greatness but to be supremely wicked   o guzman i am verging to the grave   let me but live to see thee govern here   as justice shall direct thee and i die   with pleasure   guzman   by thy great example fired   with thee i fought and conquered for my country   from thee must learn to rule it is not mine   to give the wise and good alvarez laws   but to receive them from him alvarez   no my son   the sovereign power can never be divided   worn down with years and labor i resign   all worldly pomp it is enough for me   if yet my feeble voice be sometimes heard   to counsel and direct thee trust me guzman   men are not creatures one would wish to rule   to that almighty being whom too long   i have neglected would i consecrate   my poor remains of life one boon alone   as friend i ask of thee as father claim   to give me up those slaves who by your order   are here confined this day my son should be   a day of pardon marked by clemency   and not by justice guzman   a request from you   is a command but think my lord i beg   what dangers may ensue a savage people   but half subdued and to the yoke of slavery   bending reluctant ready for revolt   should never be familiar with their conquerors   or dare to look on those they should be taught   to tremble at unarmed with power and vengeance   they would despise us these untutored indians   fiery and bold ill brook the galling rein       of servitude by chastisement alone   made tame and humble pardoned once they think   you fear them power in short is lost by mildness   severity alone insures obedience   the brave castilian serves in honors cause   with cheerful resignation tis his pride   his glory but inferior nations court   oppression force and only force constrains them   did not the gods of these barbarians drink   the blood of men they would not be adored alvarez   and can a christian as thou art approve   these tyrant maxims the detested offspring   of narrow policy are these the means   to win the wild barbarian to our faith   thinkest thou to rule them with an iron hand   and serve a god of peace with war and slaughter   braved i for this the burning tropics rage   and all the terrors of a world unknown   to see our country cursed our faith disgraced   god sent us here for other purposes   sent us to make his holy name revered   his sacred laws beloved whilst we my son   unmindful of that faith which we profess   the laws we teach and all the tender ties   of soft humanity insatiate still   for blood and gold instead of winning oer   these savages by gentle means destroy them   all is confusion death and horror round us   and nought have we of heaven but its thunder   our name indeed bears terror with it spain   is feared but hated too we are the scourge   of this new world vain covetous unjust   in short i blush to own it we alone       are the barbarians here the simple savage   though fierce by nature is in courage equal   in goodness our superior o my guzman   had he like us been prodigal of blood   had he not felt the throbs of tender pity   alvarez had not lived to speak his virtues   hast thou forgot that day when by a crowd   of desperate natives i was circled in   on every side and all my faithful band   of followers cut off alone i stood   and every moment looked for death when lo   at mention of my name they dropped their arms   and straight a young american approached me   embraced my knees and bathed them with his tears   and is it you he cried is it my friend   live good alvarez virtue pure as thine   may be most useful to us be a father   to the unhappy let thy tyrant nation   that would enslave us learn from hence—to pardon   and own a savage capable of virtue   i see you are moved o hearken to the voice   of mild humanity by me she speaks   by me addresses guzman o my son   canst thou expect the object of thy wishes   the fair alzire ever will crown thy hopes   if thou art cruel thinkest thou to cement   the dearest bonds of nature in the blood   of her loved countrymen or shall their groans   be heard and guzman soften into mercy guzman   tis your command my lord and i submit   they have their freedom but on this condition       for so our laws require they must be christians   to quit their idols and embrace our faith   alone can save them we must bend by force   their stubborn hearts and drag them to the altar   one king must be obeyed one god adored alvarez   hear me my son i wish as much as guzman   that truth may fix her sacred empire here   that neither heaven nor spain henceforth may find   a foe on earth but know the heart oppressed   is never conquered i force none yet i   have conquered many the true god my son   the god of christians is a god of mercy guzman   youve conquered sir the father over his son   is absolute and you my lord would soften   the hardest heart whilst virtue by alvarez   in mildest accents pleads her powerful cause   o since kind heaven to thee hath lent the art   of soft persuasion use it for thy son   on thee alone depends the happiness   of guzmans life the proud alzire scorns   my proffered hand i love her but too well   heaven knows how dearly but i cannot stoop   meanly to sooth a haughty womans pride   i cannot make myself a poor tame slave   to her imperious will but thou hast power   oer the fair tyrants father talk to him   for the last time let him command his daughter   to take my hand and make your guzman happy   and yet it hurts my soul to think alvarez   should stoop so low and be a suppliant for me  0 alvarez   already i have spoke and montezuma   hath seen his daughter she will soon be thine   ive been a friend to his unhappy race   and soothed the sorrows of captivity   already he hath quitted his false gods   alzire too a convert to our faith   to this new world shines forth a bright example   she only can unite the jarring nations   and make us happy thy long wishedfor nuptials   shall join two distant globes these fierce barbarians   who now detest our laws when they shall see   the daughter of their king in guzmans arms   cheerful beneath thy easy yoke shall bend   their willing hearts and soon be all our own   but montezuma comes away my son   expect me with alzire at the altar scene ii alvarez montezuma alvarez   at length obedient to a fathers will   alzire yields i hope to thy persuasion montezuma   if yet my daughter trembles at the thought   of wedding him who has destroyed her race   alvarez will forgive a womans weakness   for thou hast been a father to the wretched   thy gentle manners teach us to revere   that holy faith from whence they sprung by thee   the will of heaven to this new world revealed        enlightened our dark minds what mighty spain   unconquered left thy virtue has subdued   thy cruel countrymens remorseless rage   had rendered even thy god detestable   but that in thee his great perfections shine   his goodness and his mercy in thy heart   we trace his image montezumas thine   his daughter and his house the good alvarez   shall have them all potosi and peru   with my alzire shall descend to guzman   prepare the nuptial rites adorn your temple   and let your son be ready to receive her   methinks it is as if the immortal beings   had deigned to visit earth and mix with men alvarez   o montezuma let me live to see   this blest event and i shall die content   o god whose gracious hand conducted us   to this new world enlighten and preserve it   propitious smile on these first holy vows   made at thy altar here adieu my friend   to thee i owe my guzmans happiness scene iii montezuma   alone   o thou true god whose powerful arm destroyed   those idle deities i once adored   watch oer the poor remains of my sad life   and sooth my sorrows i have lost my all   all but alzire o protect her youth   watch oer her steps and guide her tender heart    scene iv montezuma alzire montezuma   daughter the hour is come to make thyself   and the world happy to command the conqueror   and make the vanquished smile restore thy country   to her lost honor and to regal power   rise from the bosom of adversity   alzire will obey i know she will   dry up thy tears a father must not see them alzire   i have no will but yours yet o my lord   see my despair and look into my soul montezuma   no more of that thy word is passed alzire   and i depend on it alzire   twas extorted from me   the cruel sacrifice is this a time   to plight my faith and think of nuptial joy   this hapless day when all i held most dear   was ravished from me when our widestretched empire   and all her hosts the children of the sun   inglorious fell beneath the cruel guzman   o twas a day marked by the hand of heaven   as most unfortunate montezuma   our days alzire   are happy or unhappy from ourselves        and not from circumstance or accident   as superstition taught our ancestors   to credit think no more on it alzire   on this day   my zamor fell our countrys great avenger   my lover chosen by thee by thee my father   to be alzires husband montezuma   i have paid   the debt of sorrow due to zamors ashes   and hold his memory dear but death has cancelled   your mutual bonds therefore no longer shed   those fruitless tears but carry to the altar   a free and cheerful heart thy god commands   he calls thee to him if thou art a christian   now hear his voice alzire   alas my lord i know   a fathers power and know my duty to him   tis to obey to fall a sacrifice   before him i have passed the utmost bounds   which nature ever prescribed thy will alone   hath been my law nor did i ever stain   with disobedience my true faith for thee   i left my countrys gods and am a christian   alas my father why wouldst thou deceive me   why tell me the new deity i serve   would bring me peace that his allhealing power   would ease my tortured heart delusive promise   for o my lord the deadly poison still   lurks in my veins still zamors image dwells   in his alzires heart nor time nor death        can eer efface it well i know alvarez   condemns that passion which he once approved   but i will make him ample recompense   by my obedience—wed me to the tyrant   give me to guzman tis a sacrifice   i owe my country but remember sir   how dreadful tis and tremble at the thought   of such unnatural such detested bonds   thou who condemnest me to these fatal nuptials   who bidst alzire give her hand to guzman   and at the altar promise him a heart   which is not hers to give montezuma   what says my child   o in the name of every tender tie   that binds thee to me spare a wretched father   pity my age and do not by the woes   which thou alone alzire canst remove   let me entreat thee o embitter not   the sad remainder of alvarezs life   have i not ever strove to make thee happy   and wilt thou not return it o my daughter   let virtue guide thy steps in dutys path   and lead thee on to bliss thy country calls   wilt thou betray her learn henceforth alzire   to be the mistress of thyself alzire   and must i   learn to dissemble then ungrateful task    scene v guzman alzire guzman   these long delays alzire are unkind   and let me add ungenerous to the man   who lives but to oblige you for thy sake   i stopped the hand of justice all those captives   whose pardon you solicited are free   but i should blush to think that guzman owed   thy kind compliance to so poor a service   tis on thyself and thy consenting heart   he founds his hopes nor thought i ever till now   my happiness could make alzire wretched alzire   wretched indeed o grant kind heaven this day   may not prove fatal to us both you see   i am abashed confounded left a prey   to horror and despair do not these eyes   alone betray the anguish of a mind   oppressed with grief canst thou not read it there   i know thou canst such is my nature guzman   neer did alzires face belie her heart   dissimulation and disguise my lord   are european arts which i abhor guzman   i love thy frankness but lament the cause   zamor is still beloved his memory lives   within thy breast my rival even in death   this is too much alzire duty honor   virtue forbid it weep no more it wounds   my heart and i am jealous of thy tears    alzire   jealous of him my lord who in the grave   is mouldering now my loved lamented zamor   for i confess i loved him we were bound   by mutual vows and still i weep his fate   if thou art a friend to constancy and truth   thou wilt not blame my passion but approve it   by this and this alone may guzman gain   alzires heart scene vi guzman   alone   her pride astonishes   and yet i know not how her freedom charms me   there is a savage beauty in her heart   that suits the wildness of her native clime   but softer manners may subdue her mind   and bind her stubborn fierceness to the yoke   of duty guzman now is lord of all   and nought remains unconquered but alzire   resolved by force or art to make her mine   our hands if not our hearts shall be united end of the first act act ii scene i zamor americans zamor   my noble friends and fellowsufferers   whom dangers strengthen and misfortunes make        but more illustrious shall we neer obtain   our sweet revenge or honorable death   still must we live unable or to serve   alzire or our country shall we never   find out the hated guzman and destroy   that fell destroyer o my countrys gods   powerless and vain ye gave up this fair land   of liberty to hostile deities   and tamely suffered a few wandering spaniards   to spoil your altars lay your temples waste   and desolate our empire i have lost   a kingdom and alzire all is gone   but shame and sorrow and resentment those   i carried with me to the burning sands   and gloomy deserts there i cherished long   the secret hopes of vengeance you my friends   revived your drooping zamor and inspired   his soul with flattering thoughts of better days   deep in the forests shade we left a band   of chosen spirits resolute and bold   and hither came impatient to observe   the walls upraised by our tremendous foe   they watched and seized us in a dungeon long   confined at length our tyrant masters grant us   leave to walk forth and breathe the wholesome air   yet will not deign to let us know our fate   can none inform me where we are who dwells   within this seat of sorrow wheres alzire   wheres montezuma lives he is he free   or a vile slave like zamor say my friends   and partners in affliction know ye not an american   like you my lord in chains and hither led   by secret paths were ignorant of all        great cacique worthy of a better fate   if tis decreed that thou must fall at least   thou shalt find friends prepared to perish with thee   and own them not unworthy of their master zamor   after a glorious victory my friends   a glorious death is most to be desired   but o to die in vile obscurity   to perish thus in ignominious bondage   to leave our bleeding country thus enslaved   by european robbers those assassins   whose thirst for blood and gold these proud usurpers   who would extort by every cruel art   of punishment those riches which we hold   more cheap more worthless than themselves to leave   my loved alzire zamors dearer half   to their licentious fury o my friends   tis worse than death i tremble at the thought scene ii alvarez zamor americans alvarez   live and be free zamor   good heavens what do i hear   o unexpected sound what god art thou   in human shape a spaniard and forgive   it cannot be art thou the ruler here    alvarez   no captive i am only the protector   of innocence oppressed zamor   thou good old man   what is thy office here alvarez   to aid the wretched zamor   what could inspire thee with a thought so noble alvarez   my gratitude religion and my god zamor   god and religion what these cruel tyrants   these ruffians that still bathed in human blood   depopulate earth and change the smiling face   of nature to a dreary desert they   who worship avarice alone their god   cannot be thine alvarez   it is the same my son   but they offend him they disgrace his name   and are indeed more guilty they abuse   their newgot power thou knowest their crime but know   my duty too twice hath the travelling sun   enlightened in his course our world and yours   since a brave indian who he was i know not   stepped from amidst his fellowsavages   and saved me from their fury from that moment   i felt your sorrows pitied your misfortunes   and held you as my brethren and my friends    0   could i but meet my kind deliverer   that gallant stranger i should die in peace zamor   his age his features his transcendent virtue   all all conspire to say it is alvarez   behold and mark us well canst thou distinguish   the hand that saved thee alvarez   gracious heaven come near   o providence it is it must be he   the wishedfor object of my gratitude   he whom these eyes grown dim with age have sought   so long in vain my son my benefactor   what shall i do to serve thee thou shalt live   with old alvarez he shall be thy father   thy guardian and protector here kind heaven   in gracious pity hath prolonged my days   that i might pay the debt i owe to thee zamor   o if thy barbarous nation had possessed   but half the virtues that adorn alvarez   our willing world had bowed submissive down   before them but their souls are not like thine   for they delight in blood whilst natures self   abhorring shudders at their cruelty   death were more welcome far than life with them   urge me not therefore good alvarez all   i wish to know is this have they destroyed   my noble friend the wretched montezuma   wheres my alzires father o my lord   forgive these tears the memory of past griefs   sits heavy on me    alvarez   let them flow my son   tis the best mark of our humanity   the heart that feels not for anothers woe   is fit for every crime thy friend survives   and full of years and honors lives with us   in happiness and peace zamor   might i behold him alvarez   yes thou shalt see him soon may his persuasion   induce thee to think better of us all   and follow his example zamor   can he live   with christians montezuma live with christians alvarez   have patience son and he shall tell thee all   touching our union and the sacred bonds   that soon shall bind in cords of amity   our world to thine—but i must to my son   and let him know my happiness i leave thee   but for a moment fare thee well scene iii zamor americans zamor   at last   heaven seems to smile on zamor i have found   amongst these vile barbarians one just man        honest and true alvarez is a god   sent down from heaven to soften this rude world   and bless mankind he said he had a son   that son shall be my brother and my friend   if he is worthy of his noble father   o glorious hope shall i again behold   great montezuma after three long years   alzire too my dear my loved alzire   shall i embrace thee hast thou kept thy faith   that first of virtues to reward thy zamor   the heart oppressed is ever diffident   another old man comes this way my soul   it still perplexed scene iv montezuma zamor americans zamor   o noble montezuma   do i once more embrace thee see thy zamor   snatched from the jaws of death he lives to save   and to defend his prince behold thy friend   thy soldier and thy son o wheres alzire   be quick and tell me let me know her fate   my life depends on that montezuma   unhappy cacique   with grief sincere we have lamented thee   thy fellowsoldiers to thy memory raised   the decent tomb and every honor paid   due to thy virtues but thank heaven thou livest   henceforth may happier days await thee zamor   but say why camest thou hither    zamor   to avenge   my gods myself my father and alzire montezuma   what sayst thou zamor   call to mind that dreadful day   when the fierce spaniard terrible in arms   rushed through our powerless hosts oerthrew our bulwarks   and laid our empire waste his name was guzman   that name thou well rememberest was the signal   given for destruction at that name they snatched   the sweet alzire thy loved daughter from me   and bore her to captivity with thee   and all thy race destroyed the holy altar   where i had hoped to make alzire mine   then dragged me to the tyrant shall i tell thee   what cruel torments that insatiate monster   inflicted on me to extort confession   of hidden gold the christians deity   which we despise and trample on halfdead   they left me and retired time montezuma   can never bury injuries like mine   thou seest me here prepared for great revenge   some chosen friends attached to zamors cause   by equal wrongs provoked with equal hate   inspired await me in the neighboring forest   resolved with me to conquer or to die montezuma   o zamor whither would thy headlong passion   transport thee wherefore wouldst thou thus pursue   that death which seems so willing to avoid thee        what can thy friends do for thee their weak arms   their fishbone spears their sabres made of stone   their soldiers naked and illdisciplined   against these giants armed with mortal steel   and launching their dread thunder bolts against thee   swift as the winds their fiery coursers bear them   to certain victory the world is theirs   and we my zamor must submit zamor   whilst life   shall animate these veins i never will   no montezuma their destructive thunder   their coats of steel their fiery coursers taught   like them to fight and share their masters glory   this might affright and terrify a while   our gaping savages but i behold   this pompous scene unruffled to subdue   our haughty foe one thing alones required   and that is not to fear them novelty   that conquers cowards only has enslaved us   gold that pernicious native of our soil   draws europe hither but defends us not   against her niggard nature has denied us   a nobler metal her allconquering steel   and given it to barbarians but kind heaven   in lieu of this indulgence hath bestowed   virtues on us which europe never knew   i come to fight and conquer for alzire montezuma   urge it no more my zamor heaven declares   against us calm thy rage the times are changed zamor   changed didst thou say my lord it cannot be        if montezumas heart is still the same   if my alzires faithful if i live   still in her memory—thou turnest aside   and weepest montezuma   unhappy zamor zamor   am i not   thy son our tyrants have not altered thee   they cannot sure they cannot have corrupted   an old mans heart and made it false as theirs montezuma   i am not guilty zamor nor are all   these conquerors tyrants some were sent by heaven   to guide our footsteps in the paths of truth   to teach us arts unknown immortal secrets   the knowledge of mankind the arts my son   to speak to think to live and to be happy zamor   o horrid canst thou praise these ruffians whilst   thy daughter thy alzire is their slave montezuma   zamor alzires free zamor   ha montezuma   alzire free forgive me but remember   shes mine my lord by every solemn tie   you promised me before the gods you promised   to give her to me they received our vows   she is not perjured    montezuma   call not on those gods   for they are vain and fancied

of ægisthus pylades friend of orestes pammenes an old man attached to the family of agamemnon dimas an officer of the guards attendants scene the seashore a wood a temple a palace and a tomb on one side on the other argos at a distance    orestes was produced in    0 an experiment which intensely interested the literary world and the public in his dedicatory letters to the duchess of maine voltaire has the following passage on the greek drama we should not i acknowledge endeavor to imitate what is weak and defective in the ancients it is most probable that their faults were well known to their contemporaries i am satisfied madam that the wits of athens condemned as well as you some of those repetitions and some declamations with which sophocles has loaded his electra they must have observed that he had not dived deep enough into the human heart i will moreover fairly confess that there are beauties peculiar not only to the greek language but to the climate to manners and times which it would be ridiculous to transplant hither therefore i have not copied exactly the electra of sophocles—much more i knew would be necessary but i have taken as well as i could all the spirit and substance of it the feast celebrated by ægisthus and clytemnæstra which they called the feast of agamemnon the arrival of orestes and pylades the urn which was supposed to contain the ashes of orestes the ring of agamemnon the character of electra and that of iphisa which is exactly the chrysothemis of sophocles and above all the remorse of clytemnæstra these i have copied from the greek tragedy when the messenger who relates the fictitious story of the death    of orestes says to clytemnæstra i see madam you are deeply affected by his death she replies i am a mother and must therefore be unhappy a mother though injured cannot hate her own offspring she even endeavors to justify herself to electra with regard to the murder of agamemnon and laments her daughter euripides has carried clytemnæstras repentance still further this madam was what gained the applause of the most judicious and sensible people upon earth and was approved by all good judges in our own nation no character in reality can be more natural than that of a woman criminal with regard to her husband yet softened by her children a woman whose proud and fiery disposition is still open to pity and compassion who resumes the fierceness of her character on receiving too severe reproaches and at last sinks into submission and tears the seeds of this character were in sophocles and euripides and i have only unfolded them nothing but ignorance and its natural attendant presumption can assert that the ancients have nothing worthy of our imitation there is scarcely one real and essential beauty and perfection for the foundation of which at least we are not indebted to them i have taken particular care not to depart from that simplicity so strongly recommended by the greeks and so difficult to attain the true mark of genius and invention and the very essence of all theatrical merit a foreign character brought into œdipus or electra who should play a principal part and draw aside the attention of the audience would be a monster in the eyes of all those who have any knowledge of the ancients or of that nature which they have so finely painted art and genius    consist in finding everything within the subject and never going out of it in search of additional ornaments but how are we to imitate that truly tragic pomp and magnificence which we find in the verses of sophocles that natural elegance and purity of diction without which the piece howsoever well conducted in other respects must after all be but a poor performance i have at least given my countrymen some idea of a tragedy without love without confidants and without episodes the few partisans of good taste acknowledge themselves obliged to me for it though the rest of the world withhold their approbation for a time but will come in at last when the rage of party is over the injustice of persecution at an end and the clouds of ignorance dissipated you madam must preserve among us those glittering sparks of light which the ancients have transmitted to us we owe everything to them not an art was born among us everything was transplanted but the earth that bears these foreign fruits is worn out and our ancient barbarism by the help of false taste would break out again in spite of all our culture and improvement and the disciples of athens and rome become goths and vandals corrupted with the manners of the sybarites without the kind favor and protection of persons of your rank when nature has given them either genius or the love of genius they encourage this nation which is better able to imitate than to invent and which always looks up towards the great for those instructions and examples which it perpetually stands in need of all that i wish for madam is that some genius may be found to finish what i have but just sketched out to free the stage from that effeminacy and    affectation which it is now sunk into to render it respectable to the gravest characters worthy of the few great masterpieces which we already have among us worthy in short the approbation of a mind like yours and all those who may hereafter endeavor to resemble you    act i scene i iphisa pammenes iphisa   sayest thou pammenes shall these hated walls   where i so long have dragged a life of woe   afford at least the melancholy comfort   of mingling sorrow with my dear electra   and will ægisthus bring her to the tomb   of agamemnon bring his daughter here   to be a witness of the horrid pomp   the sad solemnity which on this day   annual returns to celebrate their crimes   and make their guilt immortal pammenes   o iphisa   thou honored daughter of my royal master   like thee confined within these lonely walls   the secrets of a vile abandoned court   do seldom reach pammenes but tis rumored   the jealous tyrant brings electra here   fearful lest argos by her cries alarmed   should rise to vengeance every heart he knows   feels for the injured princess therefore much   he dreads her clamors with a watchful eye   observes her conduct treats her as a slave   and leads the captive to adorn his triumph  0 iphisa   good heaven and must electra be a slave   shall agamemnons blood be thus disgraced   by a barbarian will her cruel mother   will clytemnæstra bear the vile reproach   that on herself recoils and all her race   perhaps my sister is too fierce of soul   she mingles too much pride and bitterness   of keen resentment with her griefs alas   weak are her arms against a tyrants power   what will her anger what her pride avail her   they only irritate a haughty foe   and cannot serve our cause my fate at least   is milder and this solitary state   shields me from wrongs which must oppress electra   far from my fathers foes these pious hands   can pay due offerings to his honored shade   far from his murderer in this sad retreat   freely i weep in peace and curse ægisthus   im not condemned to see the tyrant here   save when the sun unwillingly brings round   the fatal day that knit the dreadful tie   when that inhuman monster shed the blood   of agamemnon when base clytemnæstra— scene ii electra iphisa pammenes iphisa   o my electra art thou here my sister—    electra   the day of horror is returned iphisa   the dreadful rites the guilty feast prepared   have brought me hither thy electra comes   thy captive sister comes a wretched slave   to bear the tidings of their guilty joy iphisa   to see electra is a blessing still   it pours some joy into the bitter cup   of sorrow thus to mix my tears with thine electra   tears my iphisa i have shed enough   of them already o thou bleeding ghost   of my dead father everhonored shade   is that the tribute which i owe to thee   i owe thee blood and blood thou hast required   amidst the pomp of this dire festival   dragged by ægisthus here i will collect   my scattered spirits shake off these vile chains   and be my own avenger yes iphisa   this feeble arm shall reach the tyrants heart   did not the cruel clytemnæstra shed   a husbands blood did i not see her lift   her barbarous hand against him and shall we   suspend the blow and let a murderer live   o vengeance and thou animating virtue   that dost inspire me art thou not as bold   as daring guilt we must revenge ourselves   we must iphisa fearest thou then to strike   fearest thou to die shall clytemnæstras daughter   the blood of atreus fear o rather lend   thy aid and join the desperate electra    iphisa   my dearest sister moderate thy rage   and calm thy troubled mind against our foes   what can we bring but unavailing tears   who will assist us who will lend us arms   or how shall we surprise a watchful king   for guilt is ever fearful by his guards   surrounded why electra wilt thou court   perpetual danger should the tyrant hear   thy loud complaints i tremble for thy life electra   why let him hear them i would have my grief   sink to his heart and poison all his joys   yes i would have my cries ascend to heaven   and bring the thunder down would have them raise   a hundred kings who never yet have dared   unworthy cowards as they are to avenge   great agamemnon but i pardon thee   and the vain terrors of thy fearful soul   that shrinks at danger for he favors you   i know he does and only crushes me   beneath his iron yoke thou hast not been   like me a wretched persecuted slave   thou didst not see the impious parricide   the horrid  feast the dire solemnity        when clytemnæstra—o the dreadful image   is still before me in this place iphisa   where now thou tremblest to declare thy wrongs   there did these eyes behold our hapless father   caught in the deadly snare pammenes heard   his dying groans and ran with me to save him   but when i came what did i see my mother   plunging her ruthless dagger in his breast   to rob him of the poor remains of life   turning to pammenes   thou sawest me take orestes in my arms   my dear orestes little knew he then   of danger but as near his murdered father   he stood called out for aid to clytemnæstra   she midst the horrors of the guilty scene   stopped for a moment short and gave us time   safe to convey the victim from ægisthus   whether the tyrant has completed yet   the imperfect vengeance in orestes blood   i know not o my brother dost thou live   or hast thou followed thy unhappy father   alas i weep for him and fear for thee   these hands are loaded with inglorious chains   and these sad eyes forever bathed in tears   see naught but guilt oppression and despair pammenes   ye dear remains of atreus honored race   whose splendor i have seen whose woes i feel   permit a friend to fill your weeping souls   with cheerful hope that ever waits propitious   to soothe affliction call to mind what heaven   long since hath promised that its vengeful hand   should one day lead orestes to the place   where we preserved him that ægisthus there        even at yon tomb and on the fatal day   marked for his impious triumph oer the dead   should pay the forfeit of his crime the gods   can neer deceive in darkness still they veil   their secret purpose from the eyes of men   and punishment with slow but certain steps   still follows guilt iphisa   but wherefore stays so long   their tardy vengeance i have languished here   in grief and anguish many a tedious hour   electra still more wretched is in chains   meantime the proud oppressor lives in peace   and glories in his crimes electra   thou seest pammenes   ægisthus still renews his cruel triumph   and celebrates the fatal nuptials still   a wretched exile lives my dear orestes   forgetful of his father and electra pammenes   but mark the course of time he touches now   the age when manly strength with courage joined   may aid your purpose hope for his return   and trust in heaven electra   we will thou son of wisdom   thou good old man o thou hast darted forth   a ray of hope on my despairing soul   if with unpitying eye the gods beheld   our miseries here and proud oppression still   unpunished trampled on the tender feet   of innocence what hand would crown their altars        with incense and oblation but kind heaven   will give orestes to a sisters arms   and blast the tyrant hear my voice orestes   o hear thy countrys hear the cries of blood   that call thee forth come from thy dreary caves   and pathless deserts where misfortune long   hath tried thy courage leave thy savage prey   and all the roaming monsters of the forest   to chase the beasts of argos to destroy   the tyrants of the earth the murderers   of kings o haste and let me guide thy hand   even to the traitors breast iphisa   no more repress   thy griefs electra see thy mother comes electra   and have i yet a mother scene iii clytemnæstra

fate my children   i came to lay a mothers heart before you        barren thank heaven hath been my second bed   nor brought a race of jealous foes to sow   division here alas my little race   is almost run the secret grief that long   hath preyed on my sad heart will finish soon   a life of woe spite of ægisthus still   i love my children spite of all his rage   electra thou who in thy infant years   so oft hast given me comfort when the loss   of iphigenia and her cruel father   oppressed my soul though now thy pride disdains me   and braves my power thou art my daughter still   unworthy as thou art theres still a place   in clytemnæstras heart for her electra electra   for me o heaven and am i yet beloved   and dost thou feel for thy unhappy daughter   o if thou dost behold her chains behold   yon tomb— clytemnæstra   unkind electra thus to wake   the sad remembrance thou hast plunged a dagger   into thy mothers breast but i deserve it electra   thou hast disarmed electra nature pleads   a mothers cause i own myself to blame   for all the bitterness of sorrow poured   in dreadful execrations on thy head   by thee delivered to the tyrants power   i would have torn thee from him i lament   but cannot hate thee o if gracious heaven   hath touched thy soul with wholesome penitence   obey its sacred will and hear the voice        of conscience that commands thee to unloose   the horrid ties that bind thee to a wretch   despised and hated follow the great god   who leads thy footsteps to the paths of virtue   call back your son let him return to fill   the throne of his great ancestors to scourge   a tyrant to avenge his murdered father   his sisters and his mother haste and send   for my orestes clytemnæstra   talk no more of that   electra nor speak thus of my ægisthus   i grieve to see thee in these shameful bonds   but know a sovereign cannot tamely brook   repeated insults or embrace a foe   you had provoked him to be cruel i   who am but his first subject oft have tried   to soothe his anger but in vain my words   instead of healing but inflamed the wound   electra is indebted to herself   for all her deepfelt injuries henceforth bend   to thy condition let thy sister teach thee   that we must yield submissive to our fate   if eer we hope to change it i could wish   to end my days in peace amongst my children   but if thy rapid and imprudent zeal   should bring orestes here before the time   his life might answer for it and thy own   if the king see him though i pity thee   electra yet i owe a husband more   than a lost son whom i have cause to fear electra   o heaven that monster he thy husband he   and is it thus thou pitiest me alas        what will this poor this light remorse avail thee   this fleeting sorrow was thy tenderness   but for a moment dost thou threaten me   to iphisa   is this iphisa this a mothers love   to clytemnæstra   it seems thou threatenest my orestes too   thou hast no cause to fear nor i to hope   for him alas perhaps he is no more   perhaps ægisthus the detested tyrant   he whom but now thou didst not blush to call   thy husband hath in secret taen his life iphisa   believe me madam when i call the gods   to witness poor electra and myself   are strangers to the fate of dear orestes   have pity then on your afflicted daughter   pity your helpless son and spare electra   she has been wronged her tears and her reproaches   suit well her fate and ought to be forgiven electra   i must not hope it must not even complain   and if orestes lives but in my thoughts   tis deemed a crime i know ægisthus well   know his fierce nature if he fears my brother   hell soon destroy him clytemnæstra   know thy brother lives   if hes in danger tis from thy imprudence   therefore be humble moderate thy transports   respect thy mother thinkest thou i come here   elate with joy to lead the splendid triumph   o no to me it is a day of sorrow        thou weepest in chains and i upon

us softened into peace   to see our interests and our hearts united   let it be so go thou and talk with her   but take good heed her pride refuses not   the proffered boon that were an insult soon   she might repent of but i hope with you   that slavery hath bowed down her haughty spirit        that this unhoped for unexpected change   from poverty and chains to rank and splendor   joined to a mothers kind authority   and above all to ambition will persuade her   to seize the golden minutes and be wise   but if she spurns the happiness that courts her   her insolence shall meet its due

desiring eyes   struck with the charming image and amazed   i ran to seek thee here beneath the shade   of this dark grove to tell the pleasing tale   but mark what followed—on the sacred tomb   where we so oft have mingled our sad tears   i saw fresh garlands saw the votive wreath   the water sprinkled over it and the hair   doubtless of those whom i so late had seen   the illustrious strangers near to these was laid   what most confirmed my hopes a glittering sword   that spoke methought the day of vengeance near   who but a son a brother and a hero   raised by the gods to save his falling

dutiful obedience to the gods   and well would it become the royal maid   to follow his example fate ofttimes   deceives the hearts of men directs in secret   and guides their wandering steps through

consult   that reverend sage whom babylon adores   i would not thus degrade the majesty         of sovereign power or let sémiramis   betray her fears before a mortals eye   but i have sent to libyas

vengeance on my foes   thou wert my great deliverer arsaces   and in return i give thee all my heart   i will be thine and only thine but o   our fatal passion will destroy us both   thy generous

inexorable—rival arsaces   ha does he love thee azema   no that savage mind   subtle and dark a foe to every virtue         insensible to love and every charm   but those ambition boasts could never feel   a real passion for me but he knows   that azema is descended from the race   of our assyrian kings and soon may claim   my right of empire here as next the throne   and therefore means to blend his interest here   with mine and gain the sceptre for himself   but if the youth whom ninus had decreed   even from my infant years to be my husband   the son of great sémiramis and heir   of babylon were living now and here   would offer me his heart and half his empire   by love i swear and by thy precious self   ninias should sue in vain and see me quit   a throne with him for banishment with thee   even scythias bleak inhospitable plains   would yield a sweet asylum to our love   for they would echo my arsaces name   and sound his praise those barren wilds where first   our passion grew would be to me a court   nor should i cast a thought on babylon   but much i fear this subtle statesman means   to carry his resentment further still   ive searched his soul and know the blackness of it   or i mistake or guilt sits lightly on him   already he is jealous of thy glory   he fears and hates thee arsaces   and i hate him more   but fear him not since azema is mine   keep thou thy faith and i despise his anger   at least i share with him the royal favor         i saw the queen and her humanity   equalled the pride of assur when i fell   prostrate before her gently she upraised me   and called me the support of babylon   with pride i heard the flattering voice of her   whose name contending kings unite to honor   the distance twixt her royal state and mine   was lessened soon by mildest condescension   it touched it melted me and after thee   to me she seemed of all the human race   most nearly to resemble the divine azema   if she protects us assurs threats are vain   i heed them not arsaces   inspired by thee i went   fearless and brave to lay before the feet   of my great mistress that aspiring passion   which assur dreads and azema approves   when lo that very moment came a priest   from egypt with ammonian joves decree   trembling she opened quick the awful scroll   first fixed her eyes on me then sudden turned   her face aside and wept stood fixed in grief   like one distraught then sighed and vanished from me   they tell me she is fallen into despair   and hath of late been dreadfully pursued   by some avenging god i pity her   tis wonderful that after fifteen years   heaven that so long defended should at last   oppress her thus by what hath she offended   the angry gods and wherefore are they changed     azema   we hear of naught but dreadful spectres omens   and vengeance from above the queen of late   lets loose the reins of empire we had cause   to fear for babylon least subtle assur   who knows her weakness in this dangerous time   should seize the helm and bury all in ruin   but the queen came and all was calm again   all owned the power of her despotic sway   if i have any knowledge of the court   the queen hates assur but keeps fair with him   and watches close theyre fearful of each other   would quarrel soon but that some secret cause   some mutual interest still prevents a rupture   i saw her fire indignant at his name   the blushes on her cheeks betrayed her thoughts   and her heart seemed to glow with deep resentment   but sudden changes happen in a court   return and speak to her arsaces   i will but know not   whether again i eer shall gain admittance azema   thou hast my vows my wishes and my prayers   for thy success i glory in my love   and in my duty let sémiramis   rule oer the vanquished east i

i might have added this that i avenged   and saved her gave new lustre to the throne         which she was born to fill if i had chosen   like thee to boast of my exploits before her   but i must

knowest   in scythias plains when i avenged the persian   and conquered asia this young hero fought   beneath his fathers banners and surrounded   with captives brought to me the bloody spoils   and blushing laid his victims at my feet   when first i saw him i could feel his heart   as by some secret power attracting mine   insensibly towards him all mankind   besides arsaces seemed not worth my notice         assur grew jealous of him and ever since   has fired with indignation at his name   whilst his dear image still employed my thoughts   before that voice which guides my every word   and every action named him for my husband   before the gods had pointed out arsaces otanes   it was indeed a noble conquest thus   to bend that haughty spirit which disdained   the proffered homage of our eastern monarchs   who as her subjects not as lovers still   accepted kings you who contemned those charms   that sovereign beauty which extended wide   your universal empire whilst your eyes   pierced every heart you scarce would condescend   to mark their power and dost thou yield at last   to loves imperious sway to fears and horror   succeed the tender passions can it be sémiramis   o no it is not love i am not fallen   so much beneath myself as to bestow   on beauty the reward thats due to virtue   i feel a nobler passion in my breast   alas such weakness would but ill become   sémiramis unhappy as i am   for me to think of love otanes how   couldst thou suppose it once i was a mother   but scarce had studied to deserve the name   by my fond cares when heaven in anger snatched   my child away and left me here alone   a prey to anguish i had nothing near me   that i could love and midst my grandeur felt   an aching void within my soul i fled   the court endeavored to avoid myself         and sought relief in these proud monuments   amusing flatterers of a restless heart   that shunned reflection rest was still a stranger   and long remained so but he comes once more   i feel him now and wonder at the power   that charmed him hither twas arsaces he   shall hold the place of husband and of son   a conquered world and all my glories past   how much i owe to thee celestial power   who thus propitious leadest me to the altar   so long abhorred and hast thyself inspired   that passion which alone can make me happy otanes   but what will be the rage and grief of assur   hast thou reflected on it when he hears   thy new resolves he is not without hopes   the people have already fixed thy choice   on him and his resentment will not end   in mere complaints sémiramis   i never have deceived   and therefore fear him not these fifteen years   whateer his views have been ive taught him still   to rank but with my subjects though the first   amongst them and set bounds to his ambition   which he hath never oerleaped i reigned alone   and if this feeble hand so long could guide   the helm of power and curb his haughtiness   what can his courage or his cunning do   against arsaces and sémiramis   yes ninus hath accepted my repentance   and leaves the mansions of the dead to urge   our happy union his illustrious shade   again would rage to see his murderer seize         his throne and bed this calls him from the tomb   and ammons oracles unite with him   to crown my bliss no more the awful virtue   of oroes affrights me ive sent

true picture of the manners of those times all that cicero catiline cato and cæsar do in this piece is not true but their genius and character are faithfully represented if we do not there discover the eloquence of cicero we shall at least find displayed all that courage and virtue which he showed in the hour of danger in catiline is described that contrast of fierceness and dissimulation which formed his real character cæsar is represented as growing into power factious and brave that cæsar who was born at once to be the glory and the scourge of rome     act i scene i catiline   soldiers at

alone i tremble pity me   pity a wretched wife and tell me all catiline   know then my life my fortune and my fame   thy safety and my own the common cause   demand a conduct which thy fears condemn   but if thou lovest me let whateer thou seest   be buried in thy breast i mean to save   romes better part the senate and the people   are disunited—danger threats the state   on every side ive taken the best means   to make all well again aurelia   i hope thou hast   but can we hide our hearts from those we love         canst thou deceive me yet what thou hast said   doubles my fears alas thy looks are wild   and full of horror what will nonnius say   when he shall see these dreadful preparations   the voice of nature and the tender names   of father and brother oft have passed   unheard and unregarded when the cause   of rome required it—well thou knowest our marriage   gave much offence and when my angry father   returning shall behold these sad effects   of our unhappy union what my lord   must i expect o why wilt thou abuse   the power which love has given thee oer a heart   devoted to thy service—thou hast gained   a party but consider well my father   cato and cicero and rome and heaven   are all thy foes nonnius perhaps may come   this very day on purpose to destroy thee catiline   be not afraid i know he cannot aurelia   how catiline   wheneer he comes he must approve our purpose   i am not left at liberty to tell thee   what we design suffice it that his interest   and mine are one i know when he shall find   the fair result he then will join with me   to pull down the proud tyrants he obeys   trust me aurelia what i do shall prove   the fertile spring of everlasting glory   and honor to you both—     aurelia   alas the honor   i fear is doubtful and the danger certain   what seekest thou wherefore wouldst thou urge thy fate   is it not enough to rank among the first   of human kind and rule the subject world   why wouldst thou mount the giddy heights of power   and court destruction my foreboding heart   already sees and trembles at thy danger   are these the promised joys of flattering love   the peace i hoped for i have lost it now   for ever o my lord when last these eyes   were in a short and broken slumber closed   methought i saw in flames imperial rome   saw murders deaths and rivers stained with blood   my father massacred in open senate   and thee my catiline amidst a band   of vile assassins breathing forth thy soul   in dreadful agonies i rose and fled   from these sad images to find my lord   my guardian my protector—thou art here   and i alas am but the more unhappy catiline   away—thy omens fright not catiline   complain not but be resolute i want   thy courage not thy tears when i am serving   thee and my country aurelia   is it thus thou meanst   to serve her o my lord i know not what   thy purpose is but were it fair and just   perhaps i might long since have been consulted         our mutual interest claimed it from a husband   if thou dissemblest with me i have cause   to doubt and to be wretched—cicero   has long suspected thee and rome thou knowest   adores him catiline   whom my hated rival scene iv catiline aurelia martian one of the conspirators martian   sir   the consul comes this way—by his command   the senate meet he wishes first to see   and speak with you aurelia   i tremble at his name catiline   why tremble at the name of cicero   let nonnius fear and reverence him disgrace   his rank and character by mean submission   i pity the weak senator but hoped   to find in thee a noble soul not thus   remember acted thy brave ancestors   gods that a woman and a roman sprung   from neros blood should thus be void of pride   or of ambition noble minds are neer   without them     aurelia   mine perhaps thou thinkest is mean   and timid cruelty alone with thee   is courage thy reproach is most unkind   but know me better know that this fond wife   whom thou contemnest who has not power to change   or soften thee has more of roman in her   than thou canst boast and coward as she is   can teach thee how to die catiline   how many cares   at once surround me—cicero comes—but him   i fear not this aurelia— scene v cicero catiline chief of the lictors cicero   to the chief lictor   do as i   command you—ill try if i can sound   this faithless heart leave

catiline   and is it thus thy hate   pursues me cicero   call it pity—but observe me   the capitol is weary of thy plaints   thy factious cries and bold impertinence   rome and the senate have it seems debased   the consuls dignity by choosing me   thy pride we know expected it but how   hadst thou deserved it was it by the name   or family thy valor or the pride   of a loose prodigal in shows and feasts   and idle pomp could these entitle thee   to such exalted honors couldst thou hope   to be the great dispenser of the laws   to guide the mistress of the world who rules   oer prostrate kings had catiline been what   he ought to be i might perhaps to him   have yielded the contested palm—hereafter   thou mayest support the state but to be consul   tis fit thou first shouldst be—a citizen   thinkest thou by vile reflections on my birth   my fortune and my fame to taint my honor   or weaken the firm basis of my power   in our corrupted days it is not name   or family that rome has need of no   tis virtue and the pride of cicero   hath ever been that he should nothing owe   to his forefathers—my nobility   springs from myself and thine may end in thee     catiline   it ill becomes a temporary power   like thine to boast of its authority cicero   had cicero used that power as thou deservest   thou wouldst not have been here to question it   thou who hast stained our altars with pollution   and sacrilegious rage thy days are numbered   but by thy crimes thy merit is to dare   to strike at all dissemble and betray   thou hast abused the precious gifts that heaven   bestowed on thee for other purposes   sense beauty courage and heroic warmth   all the fair ornaments of human nature   in thee are but the instruments of ill   my voice which still is raised to scourge the wicked   and plead for the oppressed hath spared thee yet   nor with the odious verres ranked the name   of catiline but long impunity   hath made thee shameless and insensible   of all reproof—thou hast betrayed the state   at rome and in etruria all is discord   and foul confusion umbria is revolted   præneste staggers in her faith the soldiers   of barbarous sulla drenched in blood come forth   from their dark caves prepared for slaughter armed   by cruel mallius all are leagued with thee   thy partisans declared or secret friends   all are united in one guilty bond   and sworn to the destruction of their country   i know thee for their chief for i have eyes   on every side and hands too thou shalt find   that spite of thee shall vindicate the cause   of injured rome thy guilty friends shall feel         my justice too thou hast beheld me long   but as thy rival now behold thy judge   and thy accuser who will force thee soon   to answer for thy actions by those laws   which thou so oft hast trampled on unpunished   those laws which thou contemnest and i revenge catiline   ive told you sir already that your office   but ill excuses this indecent freedom   but for that countrys sake whom both are bound   to serve i pardon your unjust suspicions   nay i do more i honor your warm zeal   blind though it be in such a cause tis just   but do not thus reproach me for past errors   for the wild follies of impetuous youth   that soon are oer your senate is to blame   i followed their example pomp and pride   excess and luxury the fruits of conquest   are the times vices not the native bent   of catilines heart i served the commonweal   in asia as a soldier as a judge   in africa spite of our domestic feuds   did i not make the name of rome revered   among the nations i who have defended   shall neer betray her cicero   sulla too and marius   both served their country well and then destroyed her   tyrants have all some specious show of virtue   and ere they break their countrys laws support them     catiline   if you suspect each brave and gallant soldier   let cæsar pompey crassus be accused   why fix on me amongst so many why   am i the only object of your fears   have i deserved it cicero   that you best can tell   but wherefore deign i thus to answer you catiline   the more i plead in my defence the more   will cicero condemn me if as friend   thou talkest to me thou but deceivest thyself   i am thy foe if as a citizen   so too is catiline if as a consul   a consuls not a master he presides   but in the senate i defy him there cicero   thou durst not for i there can punish guilt   if thou art innocent i will protect thee   if not i charge thee be not seen in rome catiline   this is too much i will no longer bear   thy insults though i scorn thy vague suspicions   yet know i think the worst affront that thou   couldst put on catiline would be to protect him cicero   alone   insolent traitor means he thus to prove   his innocence by false affected pride   perfidious wretch im not to be deceived   nor shalt thou thus escape the watchful eye   of vengeance     scene vi cicero cato cicero   well my friend hast thou prepared   for romes defence cato   your orders are obeyed   i have disposed the chiefs and all are ready   to march as you direct them but i fear   the people nay the senate cicero   ha the senate cato   ay—they are swollen with pride—and foul division   will soon enslave them cicero   much indeed i fear   our vices will avenge the conquered world   our liberty and virtue are no more   but rome may still have hope whilst cato lives cato   alas who serves his country often serves   a most ungrateful mistress—even thy merit   offends the senate with a jealous eye   it views thy greatness cicero   catos approbation   is recompense enough thy honest praise     0   will more than balance their ingratitude   on that and on posterity alone   i shall rely let us perform our duty   and leave the rest to heaven cato   how shall we stem   the torrent of corruption when i see   even in this sacred temple raised to virtue   infamous treason rise with shameless front   can we suppose that manlius that proud rebel   would dare advance his standard and blow up   the flames of civil war if greater powers   did not support him if some secret foe   abetted not their vile conspiracy   the leaders of the senate may betray us   from sullas ashes may new tyrants rise   my just suspicions light on cæsar cicero   mine   on catiline perfidious sordid rash   and bold he loves rebellion and delights   in novelty more dangerous than cæsar   i know him well even now i parted from him   what passed between us but confirms me more   in my suspicions on his face i read   rage and resentment the determined pride   of his fierce spirit that no longer deigned   to hide its purpose but stood forth and owned   its enmity to rome—i must discover   his bold compeers perhaps i may prevent   his future crimes and save my falling country cato   catiline has friends and much i fear the power   of these united tyrants may prove fatal         our forces are in asia and at rome   we are corrupted but one upright man   may save the state cicero   if we unite our country   has naught to fear—in factions discord soon   dissolves the tie cæsar perhaps may join them   but if i know him right his noble soul   will never stoop to serve a worthless tyrant   he loves his country still and hates a master   though soon the time will come when he shall strive   to be one both are eager for applause

masters of mankind end of the first act act ii scene i catiline cethegus cethegus   at length the torch is lit to set on fire   rome and the subject world our armys nigh   and all is ready for the great event   knowest thou meantime my friend what passes here catiline   i know the consuls prudence so he calls   his cowardice which deeply ruminates   on future ills like an unskilful pilot         he sets up every sail for every wind   but knows not or which way the tempest comes   or whither it may drive him—for the senate   i fear it not that manyheaded monster   so proud of conquest and nobility   looks with an evil eye on cicero   i know it hates him so does cæsar crassus   would gladly yield him up a sacrifice   to our resentment on their jealousy   depend my hopes—hes like a dying man   with feeble arm he struggles for a while   but soon shall sink beneath us and expire cethegus   envy i know attacks him but his tongue   can soften all he leads the captive senate catiline   i brave him everywhere despise his clamors   and smile at his resentment let him rail   to his last hour and triumph in the shouts   of his admirers i have other cares   that sit more heavy on me cethegus   what should stop   thy rapid progress in the paths of glory   and happiness canst thou have aught to fear catiline   my numerous foes i heed not tis my friends   i have most cause to dread the jealousy   of lentulus the aspiring soul of cæsar   and above all my wife     cethegus   shall catiline   be frightened at a womans tears—for shame   leave her to indulge her visionary fears   i thought thou lovest her as a master should   and madest her but the servile instrument   of thy ambition catiline   tis a dangerous one   rome and her child divide with me her love   curse on the name of rome that even beneath   the roof of catiline those should dwell who love   their country but before the important hour   that must decide our fate she shall be moved   she and her son—be that thy care cethegus   our wives and children must not trouble us   in those distressful moments—but for cæsar— cethegus   whats to be done if he refuse to join   our cause shall we proscribe him shall the names   of cicero and of cæsar be united catiline   let me consider—to cut cæsar off—   that were a dreadful sacrifice methinks   i cannot but admire him and revere   in him the honor of the roman name   but where is lentulus cethegus   o fear not him   his pride we know will prompt him to believe   that thou with him wilt share the sovereign power     catiline   let him believe it still the credulous fool   thou seest cethegus with what sublety   im forced to manage these imperious spirits   their rage resentment pride and jealousy   knowest thou he dares even to be cæsars rival   to keep my friends within the pale of prudence   will cost me much more trouble than the ruin   of cicero and rome—to guide a party   is of all tasks the hardest— cethegus   lentulus   is here my lord scene ii catiline cethegus lentulussura sura   in spite of my remonstrance   you will rely on cæsar and confide   in him alone prænestes in his power   and i must yield to him but know i scorn it   the blood of scipio was not made to yield catiline   ive joined with cæsar but depend not on him   he may support our cause or he may hurt it   i use his name but tis for your advantage sura   and what is there in cæsars name superior   to yours or mine why must we meanly court   his favor but because hes pompeys rival         rome makes a god of him—i am thy friend   sura and catiline may defy them all   and without cæsar make the world their own catiline   we may—thy conduct and approved valor   have ever been my best and surest hope   but cæsar is beloved respected feared   the senate and the people all admire   and court him statesman general magistrate   in peace revered and terrible in war   a thousand ways he charms the multitude   in short he will be necessary— sura   say   destructive rather—if today he shines   our equal by tomorrow he will prove   our rival and ere long perhaps our master   trust me i know him well and therefore think   our party has not a more dangerous foe   perhaps his haughty soul may yield to thee   but play the tyrant oer the rest for me   i cannot will not brook it—ive devoted   my honor and my fortunes to thy service   but i renounce my plighted faith renounce   thee and thy cause if cæsar is preferred catiline   and so thou shalt—id sacrifice my life   rather than eer permit a haughty rival   to soar above us—cæsar is our tool   our instrument today i flatter him   tomorrow can bring down his pride perhaps   do more—thou knowest our mutual happiness         and interest are my first and dearest care   to cethegus   away and let aurelia be prepared   go or her fond intruding love may ruin   our deep laid schemes and mar the great design   return some private way and meet me here   i wait for cæsar sura   nothings to be done   i find without him—but ill wait the event catiline   farewell remember i rely on thee   more than on cæsar— cethegus   i shall execute   your high command and gather all our friends   before the standard of great catiline scene iii catiline cæsar catiline   hail godlike cæsar thou whom from the days   of sulla i have ranked amongst my best   and dearest friends whose fortunes i foretold   born as thou art to be the first of romans   how suits it with thy pride to be the slave   of a plebeian who forever thwarts   and braves thee to thy face i know thou hatest him   thy piercing eye observes impatient rome   contending for her freedom will not cæsar         assist his country to shake off her chains   the cause is noble and the fate of millions   depends on this important crisis thou   wilt join us—lookest thou not with jealous eye   on pompey still dost thou not still abhor   the surly cato canst thou serve the gods   with half thy wonted zeal when the proud consul   presides at the altar will thy noble spirit   bear these imperious rulers soft lucullus   sunk in the arms of luxury and sloth   the greedy crassus grasping his large heaps   of illgot wealth enough to purchase rome   and all her venal sons on every side   or faction or corruption reigns the world   calls out on cæsar wilt thou hear her voice   wilt thou redress and save thy falling country   will cæsar listen to his friend cæsar   he will   and if the senate do thee wrong step forth   to plead thy cause i never will betray thee   but ask no more catiline   are these the utmost bounds   of cæsars friendship but to talk for him cæsar   ive weighed the projects and shall not oppose them   i may approve but would not execute catiline   i understand you you are on that side   which fortune favors and would stand aloof         to mark the progress of our civil wars   and raise your fortunes on the common ruin cæsar   no—i have nobler views my hate of cato   my jealousy of pompey the renown   of cicero conspire to make me wish   i might surpass them all fair glory calls   the banks of seine the tagus and the rhine   i pant for honor and for victory catiline   if conquest is thy aim begin with rome   tomorrow we may reign the masters of her cæsar   the enterprise is great perhaps too bold   but to be open with thee though tis worthy   of catiline it suits not cæsar catiline   how cæsar   i do not choose to serve catiline   to share with cæsar   were no dishonor to the most ambitious cæsar   but power supreme is not to be divided   ill not be dragged at catilines chariot wheels   to grace his triumph as a friend i love thee   but know that friend shall never be—my master   even pompey shall not—sulla whom thy valor   hath nobly followed in the race of glory   whose courage i admire whose lawless rage         i ever shall abhor enslaved proud rome   but he deserved the glorious prize subdued   the hellespont and made euphrates tremble   asia was conquered mithridates owned   his martial genius—but what noble deeds   hast thou to boast what kings hast thou subdued   what seas has catiline passed what lands explored   thou hast the seeds of greatness in thy nature   but to enslave thy country is above   thy present powers above the powers of cæsar   we have not strength authority or name   for such an enterprise rome soon must fall   but ere i will attempt to be her master   i will extend her empire and her glory   and if i forge my countrys chains at least   will cover them with laurels catiline   mine perhaps   is after all the shortest path to glory   how did your boasted sulla rise to empire   he had an army so has catiline   raised by myself alone and not like his   the gift of fortune he observed with care   the favorable hour and well improved it   i have done more have made the times and seasons   subservient to me sulla was a king   wouldst thou be one wilt thou be ciceros slave   or rule with catiline cæsar   neither to be free   for i no longer will dissemble with you   i esteem cicero but love him not   nor fear him though i love i dread not thee     0   divide the senate if thou canst pull down   the proud oppressors thou hast my consent   but hope no more nor dare to think that cæsar   will ever be thy slave ill keep thy secret   and be thy friend or foe as thou deservest it scene iv catiline   if he supports us not even let him fall   the victim of his folly sulla knew   and would have cut him off but sulla dared not   i know he is my secret enemy   as such i shall beware of him scene v catiline cethegus lentulussura sura   what says   the mighty cæsar is he friend or foe catiline   his barren friendship only offers me   a feeble aid but we can do without him   perhaps he may repent it and meantime

were ravished from you by usurping tyrants   for the proud senate still your blood hath flowed   for them tigranes mithridates fell   for them alone and all your poor reward   was but to stand at distance and adore   your haughty masters but at length the hour   of vengeance is approaching be prepared   for no inglorious enterprise i know   your souls would scorn a victory cheaply bought   but i will bring you noble conquests full   of danger and of glory seize my friends   the golden opportunity already   i see your foes expiring at your feet   rush on your prey burn plunder and destroy

false   know i despise this mean this last resource   of disappointed malice—fathers say   have i not cleared myself are you convinced cicero   i am that thou art guilty can ye think   that good old man was ever capable   of such detested fraud it was thy art   thy cunning miscreant to conceal from me   thy treachery therefore didst thou choose the palace   of nonnius to secrete thy instruments   of vengeance there thou wouldst have hid thy guilt   perhaps thou hast seduced his wretched daughter   alas his family is not the first   where thou hast carried sorrows crimes and death   and now thou wouldst destroy thy country too   yet boldly darest instead of punishment   to call for approbation and reward   o thou abandoned traitor murderer   reviler hypocrite such titles suit   thy boasted services o you who once   stood forth the happy patrons of mankind   the sovereign judges of the world at length   will you submit to let a tyrant hold   dominion oer you will you shut your eyes   and rush into the precipice awake         revenge yourselves or you partake his guilt   this day or rome or catiline must perish   lose not a moment therefore but determine cæsar   judgments too quickly made are oft unjust   this is the cause of rome and therefore merits   our strict attention when our equals lag   beneath the stroke of censure we should act   with caution and in them respect ourselves   too much severity suits none but tyrants cato   too much indulgence here suits none but traitors   what balance twixt a murderer and rome   is it not cicero speaks and shall we doubt cæsar   these are suspicions only give us proof   the arms once found and nonnius guilt confirmed   catiline deserves our praise   turning to catiline   thou knowest ill keep   my word with thee in all things cicero   o my country   o rome o gods thus shall a hero plead   a traitors cause art thou the senates friend   and canst be catilines henceforth rome has naught   to fear but from her own ungrateful sons clodius   rome is in safety cæsar loves his country   and we should think with him     cicero   it well becomes   a man like clodius to unite with those   who plan destruction and delight in ruin   but wheresoer i turn my eyes they meet   with bold conspirators or citizens   cold and inactive in the cause of rome   catiline without or fear or danger drives   the storm upon us he proscribes the senate   already reaps in thought the bloody harvest   marks out his victims threatens and commands   and when i point out the dread consequence   then cæsar talks of senatorial rights   and clodius joins him cicero must be dumb   catiline has murdered nonnius he who takes   anothers life should lose his own no rights   no laws should plead for him the first great care   is to defend our country but alas   that country is no more scene v the senate aurelia aurelia   ye great avengers   of innocence oppressed my only hope   and thou o consul virtues kind protector   to

murder him   the lictors support her catiline   turning to cethegus and fainting in his arms   this is a dreadful sight—support me—this   is punishment enough cethegus   why droops my friend   aurelia calls for vengeance but if catiline   has served his country what has he to fear catiline   turning to aurelia   aurelia tis too true—my cruel duty—   my country—think me not so base aurelia   thou

act act v scene i cato with part of the senate in arms clodius   to cato   what whilst the senate armed for its own safety   from busy factions power can scarce preserve   these sacred walls thus shall a proud plebeian   insult us shall a people born to freedom   be treated like dependent slaves by him   shall romes best friends the conquerors of the world   be put in chains because he is a consul   shall he condemn his masters catilines self   were less despotic and less dangerous   with you i feel my countrys wretchedness   and weep her fate but cannot will not see   the senate thus disgraced cato   disgrace attends   on those alone who merit it—but know   the blood of nobles your patrician friends   debased by guilt should rank below the meanest   those who betrayed us are condemned to death         cicero condemned them he who saved your country   the glorious consul whom ye dare accuse   because he loved you but too well yet fear   and tremble all ungrateful as ye are   to join with traitors for an equal fate   shall soon oerwhelm you catilines at our gates   what cæsar hath determined yet we know not   whether he means to save or to destroy   his country cicero bravely acts alone   and hazards all for rome whilst you despise   your best of friends and treat him as a foe clodius   cato has more severity than courage   and ever rigorous hates not guilt so much   as he loves punishment reproach us not   nor act the censor when we want a friend   whilst the destructive flames of war surround   tis not a consuls edict can defend us   what can your lictor and his fasces do   against a band of fierce conspirators   you talk of dangers and of cæsars power   who does not know that cæsar is the friend   of catiline you have pointed out the ills   that threaten rome it were a nobler task   to show us how we may remove them cato   yes   and so i will i would advise the senate   to be aware of cæsar and of—thee   nay more—but see our father comes     scene ii cicero cato part of the senate cato   to cicero   behold   great cicero the sons of thankless rome   approach and save us envys self shall soon   fall at thy feet in humble admiration   of such transcendent virtue cicero   friends and romans   the love of glory is my ruling passion   fame is the fair reward of human toil   and i would wish to merit it from you   i have done little yet perhaps hereafter   i may do more to serve my country rome   was full of open and of secret foes   patricians and plebeians citizens   and soldiers all in wild confusion seemed   to thirst for blood i saw the gathering storm   that threatened universal ruin saw   the bold conspirators tumultuous rise   and bear down all before them at their head   were sura and cethegus them i seized   and gave to justice but the hydra faction   hath many heads which still successive rise   and mock my labors catiline boldly pushed   to the quirinal gate by gallant deeds   almost incredible he kept the field   and forced a passage to his army rome   beheld him with amazement antony         in vain opposing sullas hardy veterans   was baffled and subdued petreius strove   to succor him but with unequal force   and fruitless valor thus on every side   surrounded by calamities great rome   the mistress of the world is on the brink   of ruin cicero trembles for her fate crassus   what part hath cæsar taken cicero   he hath behaved   as cæsar must with most undaunted courage   yet not as rome could wish a zealous friend   would act in her defence i saw him quell   the rebel foe yet after that stir up   seditious spirits and by every art   of smooth insinuation work himself   into the peoples hearts amidst this scene   of blood methought a secret joy oerspread   his glowing cheek whilst his allsoothing voice   courted applause inviting rome to be   his slave hereafter cato   i was ever fearful   of cæsars power he is not to be trusted scene iii the senate cæsar cæsar   well am i still suspected in the senate         is catos stubborn virtue still my foe   of what does he accuse me cato   as a friend   to catiline the sworn enemy of rome   you have protected him and leagued with those   it had become you better to chastise cæsar   i would not stain my laurels with the blood   of such vile miscreants cæsar fights with none   but warriors cato   what are these conspirators cæsar   a dastard crowd contemptible and vile   they fled like slaves before me but the soldiers   of sulla are a formidable band   and boast an able chief from them indeed   rome hath some cause to fear petreius sinks   beneath his wounds and catiline marches onward   our soldiers are alarmed what says our consul   and what has he resolved cicero   ill tell thee cæsar   grant heaven we may succeed—thou hast deserved   suspicion but ill give thee the fair means   to clear thy honor and avenge thy country   i know thee well thy virtues and thy frailty   know what thou canst and what thou darest not do   know cæsar would command but not betray   a noble friend and a most dangerous foe         whilst i condemn i cannot but esteem thee   away remember that the eyes of rome   and of the world are on thee go support   petreius save the empire and deserve   the love of cato we have men but want   a general to conduct them cæsar best   can lead them and to him alone we trust   the safety and the glory of mankind cæsar   cicero on cæsar safely may depend   farewell i go to conquer or to die   exit cato   youve touched him in the tenderest part ambition   will urge him on cicero   great souls must ever thus   be treated i have bound him to the state   by this firm confidence i know his valor   will now support us the ambitious still   should be distinguished from the traitor i   shall make him virtuous if he is not so   already courage as directed forms   the mighty hero or the mighty villain   and he who is renowned for guilt alone   had glory fired his breast to him had been   the incense poured to him the temple raised   for his exalted merit catilines self   by me conducted had like scipio shone   though many a sulla is in cæsar hid   yet doubt i not but rome shall find in him   her best support   turning to the chief of the lictors who enters armed         well these conspirators   what have they done chief lictor   my lord they met the fate   they merited but other foes rise up   sprung from their blood like ætnas flames that burst   from the parched entrails of the burning mount   another hannibal but far more dreadful   because amongst the guilty sons of rome   he finds his traitorous friends is at our gates   a hundred voices roar for catiline   condemn your laws and curse your tardy senate   demand their ancient rights and cry aloud   for vengeance on the consul clodius   well indeed   they may while cicero tramples on the laws   and spurns his equals thus perhaps the senate— cicero   clodius no more restrain thy envious tongue   nor rashly blame the guiltless my short power   will soon be wrested from me whilst it lasts   it shall not be controlled you will have time   enough to vex and persecute hereafter   but whilst the states in danger cicero claims   the tribute of respect i know too well   this fickle world to hope for constancy   and candor from it foul ingratitude   is all that i expect on false surmises   great scipio was accused he thanked the gods   and quitted rome i too will pay my vows   to gracious heaven but will not leave you no         my days are all devoted to my country   and all shall be expended in her service cato   suppose i were to show myself in rome   perhaps my presence might disperse the crowd   and be a check on cæsar whom i own   i much suspect if fortune frowns upon us— cicero   we cannot do without you in the senate   ive given my orders cæsars in the field   thy great example may be useful here   and romes expiring glory be restored   by catos virtue—but behold he comes   and crowned with victory   cæsar enters cicero embraces him   most noble cæsar   hast thou preserved the state— cæsar   i hope so now   the consul will believe me—brave petreius   has gained immortal glory here we fought   beneath this sacred rampart in the sight   of our domestic gods that fired each soul   with nobler rage metellus and murena   with the brave scipios showed in romes defence   the same exalted courage that subdued   asia and carthage they have merited   most nobly of their country touching cæsar   let others speak the desperate remains   of sullas army seemed to brave their fate   and in the agonies of death breathed forth   their curses on us midst the general slaughter   the fiery catiline long undaunted stood         fought through a host of circling foes till spent   with ceaseless toil and covered oer with wounds   bravely he fell i must admire the soldier   though i detest the rebel once i loved him   i own it but let cicero judge if ever   to friendship cæsar sacrificed his honor cicero   cæsar is all that cicero could desire   all that he wished and all he hoped to find him   go on brave youth preserve thy noble spirit   and be thy countrys friend may

maid to miss lindon freeport a merchant of london wasp a writer lady alton several english gentlemen frequenting the coffeehouse servants messengers c scene london voltaire dashed off this comedy in eight days to ridicule fréron who had unfavorably criticised candide it was first published as by hume or home author of the tragedy douglas   act i scene i the scene represents a coffeehouse with apartments on the same floor on each side communicating with it wasp at one corner of the room reading the papers coffee pen and ink etc on the table before him a plague on this vile news here are places and pensions given to above twenty people and nothing for me a present of a hundred guineas to a subaltern for doing his duty a great merit indeed so much to the inventor of a machine to lessen the number of hands so much to a pilot so much settled on men of letters but nothing for me heres another pension and another—but the deuce a farthing for wasp he throws down the paper and walks about and yet i have done the state some service i have written more than any one man in england i have raised the price of paper and yet nothing is done for me but i will be revenged on all those whom the world calls men of merit i have got something already by speaking ill of others and if i can but contrive to do them a real mischief my fortune is made i have praised fools and calumniated every good quality and perfection of human nature and yet can scarce live by it in short to be a great man you must not be content with slander and destruction but endeavor to be   really hurtful to the master of the coffeehouse good morrow to you mr fabrice well mr fabrice everybodys affairs i find go well but mine it is intolerable fabrice indeed indeed mr wasp you make yourself a great many enemies wasp i believe i excite a little envy fabrice on my soul i believe not but rather a passion of a very different kind to be free for i have really a friendship for you i am extremely concerned to hear people talk of you as they do how do you contrive to be so universally hated wasp it is because i have merit mr fabrice fabrice that may possibly be but you are the only person who ever told me so they say you are a very ignorant fellow but that is nothing they say moreover that you are illnatured and malicious that gives me concern as it must every honest man wasp i assure you i have a good and tender heart i do indeed now and then speak a little freely of the men but for the women mr fabrice i love them all provided they are handsome as a proof of it i must absolutely insist on your introducing me to your amiable lodger whom i have never yet been able to converse with   fabrice upon honor mr wasp that young lady will never do for you for she never praises herself or speaks ill of anybody else wasp she speaks ill of nobody because i suppose she knows nobody are you not in love with her fabrice fabrice not i indeed sir she has something in her air so noble that i dare not think of it—besides her virtue— wasp laughing ha ha ha her virtue indeed fabrice why so merry sir think you there is no such thing as virtue—but i hear a coach at the door and yonder is a livery servant with a portmanteau in his hand some lord coming to lodge with me perhaps wasp be sure my dear friend you recommend me to him as soon as possible scene ii lord montross fabrice wasp montross you sir i

coffeehouse conversation montross have you many boarders with you at present fabrice only one young lady sir very handsome and extremely virtuous wasp o mighty virtuous ha ha fabrice who lives quite retired montross beauty and youth are not for me let me have an apartment sir if possible entirely to myself what do i feel have you any remarkable news in london fabrice this gentleman sir can inform you he talks and writes more than any one man in england and is extremely useful to foreigners   montross walking about i have other business fabrice ill step out sir and get things ready for you exit wasp aside this gentleman i suppose is just arrived in england he must be some great man for he seems to care for nobody turning to montross permit me my lord to present to your lordship my respects my pen and self my lord are at your lordships service montross i am no lord sir to boast of a title if we have one is the part of a fool and to assume one when we have no right that of a knave i am what i am but pray sir what may be your employment in this house wasp i dont belong to the house sir but i spend most of my time in the coffeeroom write news politics and so forth and am always ready to do an honest gentleman service if you have any friend you want to have praised or any enemy to be abused any author you want to protect or to decry tis but one guinea per paragraph if you are desirous of cultivating any acquaintance for profit or pleasure sir i am your man montross and have you no other business friend  0 wasp o sir it is a very good one i assure you montross and have you never been shown in public with a pretty iron collar about your neck wasp this fellow has no notion of literature scene iii wasp sitting down to the table several people walking about the coffeehouse montross comes forward montross will my misfortunes never have an end proscribed banished condemned to lose my head in scotland in my dear native country i have lost my honors my wife my son my whole family except one unhappy daughter like myself a miserable wanderer perhaps dishonored and must i die without taking revenge on murrays barbarous family i am razed out of the book of life i am no more even my name is wrested from me by that cruel decree i am but a poor departed ghost that hovers round its tomb one of the gentlemen in the coffeehouse slapping wasp on the shoulder well you saw the new piece yesterday it met with great applause the author is a young fellow of merit but has no fortune the public ought to encourage him    another rot the new piece public affairs are strangely carried on stocks rise the nations rich and im ruined absolutely undone wasp writing the piece is good for nothing the authors a fool and so are all those that support him public affairs are in a wretched condition the nations ruined i shall prove it in my pamphlet another gentleman your pamphlets nonsense philosophy is the most dangerous thing in the world it was that which lost us the island of minorca montross at a distance from them lord murrays son shall pay dearly for it o that before i die i could avenge the fathers injuries in the sons blood a gentleman i thought the comedy last night was an excellent one wasp detestable our taste grows worse and worse another gentleman not so bad as your criticisms another philosophers sink the public funds we must send another ambassador to porte    wasp we should always hiss a successful piece for fear anything good should appear four of them talk at once first gentleman if there was nothing good you would lose all the pleasure of satirizing it now i think the fifth act has great beauties second gentleman i cant sell any of my goods third gentleman i am in pain for jamaica this year depend ont these philosophers will make us lose it wasp the fourth and fifth acts are both contemptible montross what a riot is here first gentleman it is impossible the government can exist as it is second gentleman if the price of barbadoes water is not lowered the nations undone montross how happens it that in every country when men meet they all talk together though they are certain of not being heard or attended to enter fabrice a napkin in his hand dinners on the table gentlemen but pray let us have no disputes there if you mean to dine with    me any more sir turning to montross shall we have the honor of your company montross what with this tribe no friend let me have something in my own room harkee sir whispering to him is my lord falbridge in london fabrice no sir but i believe he will be here soon montross does he come to your house sometimes i think i have heard so fabrice he has done me that honor— montross very well good morrow to you—how hateful is life to me exit fabrice this man seems lost in grief and thought i should not be surprised to hear he had made away with himself twould concern me for he has the appearance of a worthy gentleman the gentlemen leave the coffeehouse and go to dinner wasp continues at the table writing fabrice knocks at mrs lindons door    scene iv fabrice polly wasp fabrice mrs polly mrs polly polly whos there my landlord fabrice will you be so obliging as to favor us with your company to dinner polly i dare not my mistress eats nothing how indeed should we eat we have too much grief fabrice o it will give you spirits and make you cheerful polly i cant be cheerful when my mistress suffers i must suffer with her fabrice then ill send you up something privately exit wasp rising from the table ill follow you mr fabrice—well and so my dear polly you will not introduce me to your mistress—still inflexible    polly tis a fine thing for you to pretend to make love to a woman of her condition wasp pray what is her condition polly a respectable one i assure you sir i should think a servant was good enough for you wasp that is to say if i were to court you you would be thankful polly not i indeed wasp and what pray is the reason why your mistress positively refuses to see me and her waitingmaid treats me so contemptuously polly we have three reasons for it first you are a wit secondly you are very tiresome and thirdly you are a wicked fellow wasp and what right has your mistress pray who is kept here on charity to despise me polly upon charity who told you so sir my mistress sir is very rich if she is not expensive it is because she hates pomp she is plainly clad out of modesty and eats little because temperance is prescribed to her in short sir you are very impertinent    wasp dont let her give herself so many airs we know her conduct her birth and her adventures polly you sir who told them you what do you know wasp o i have correspondents in every part of the world polly aside o heaven this man will ruin us turning to him mr wasp my dear mr wasp if you know anything dont betray us wasp o ho there is something then and now i am dear mr wasp well well i shall say nothing but you must— polly what wasp you must love me polly fie fie sir thats impossible wasp either love or fear me you know there is something— polly there is nothing sir but that my mistress is as respectable as you are hateful we are truly easy we fear nothing and only laugh at you    wasp they are very easy from that i conclude they are almost starved they fear nothing that is to say they are afraid of being discovered—i shall get to the bottom of it by and by or—i shall not ill be revenged on them for their insolence despise me scene v miss lindon coming out of her chamber dressed very plainly miss lindon polly miss lindon o my dear polly you have been with that vile fellow wasp he always makes me uneasy a destestable character whose pen words and actions are all equally abominable they tell me he works himself into families to bring in misery where there is none and to increase it where it is i had left this house because he frequents it long since but for the honesty and good heart of our landlord polly he absolutely insisted on seeing you and i would not let him miss lindon to see me where is my lord murray he has not been here these two days polly true madam but because he does not come are we never to dine    miss lindon remember polly to conceal my misery from him and from all the world i am content to live on bread and water poverty is not intolerable but contempt is i am satisfied to be in want but i would not have it known i am so polly alas my dear mistress whoever looks at me will easily perceive it with you it is a different thing your nobleness of soul supports you you seem to rejoice in calamities and only look the handsomer for it but i grow thinner and thinner you may see me fall away every minute i am so altered within this last year that i scarcely know myself miss lindon we must not part with our courage nor our hopes i can support my own poverty but yours indeed affects me my dear girl let the labor of my hands relieve you we will have no obligations to anybody go and sell this embroidery which i have done lately i think i succeed pretty well in this kind of work you have assisted me and in return my hands shall feed and clothe you it is noble to owe our subsistence to nothing but our virtue polly let me kiss let me bathe with my tears the dear hands that have labored in my service o i had rather die with my dear mistress in poverty than be servant to a queen would i could administer some comfort to you miss lindon alas lord murray is not come he whom i ought to hate the son of him who was the author of    all my misfortunes alas the name of murray will be forever fatal to me if he comes as he certainly will let him not know my country my condition or my misfortunes polly do you know that villain wasp pretends to be well acquainted with him miss lindon how is it possible he should know anything of him when even you are scarcely acquainted with him nobody writes to me i am locked up in my chamber as closely as if i were in my grave he only pretends to know something in order to make himself necessary take care he does not so much as find out the place of my birth you know my dear polly i am an unfortunate woman whose father was banished in the late troubles and whose family is ruined my father is wandering from desert to desert in scotland i should have left london to join him in his misfortunes but that i have still some hopes in lord falbridge he was my fathers friend our true friends never desert us he has returned from spain and is now at windsor i wait but to see him but alas murray comes not i have opened my heart to thee remember the most fatal blow thou canst give to it would be the disclosure of my condition polly to whom should i disclose it i never go from you besides that the world is very indifferent about the poor and unfortunate miss lindon the world is indifferent polly in this respect  0 but still it is always inquisitive and loves to tear open the wounds of the wretched besides that the men assume a right over our sex when they are unhappy and abuse their power i would make even my miseries respectable but alas lord murray will not come scene vi miss lindon polly fabrice fabrice forgive me madam i am not acquainted with your name or quality but i have i know not why the greatest respect for you i have left the company below to wait on you and know your commands miss lindon the regard which you express for me my dear sir deserves my most grateful acknowledgments but what are your commands with me fabrice i came madam only to know yours you had no dinner yesterday miss lindon i was sick sir and could not eat fabrice you are worse than sick madam you are melancholy you will pardon me but i cannot help thinking your fortune is not equal to your person and appearance    miss lindon why should you think so i never complained of my fortune fabrice notwithstanding that madam i am sure it is not what you could wish it were miss lindon what say you fabrice i say madam that the world you seem to shun admires and pities you i am but a plain man madam but i can see all your merit as well as the finest courtier let me entreat you my dear lady to take a little refreshment there is above stairs an elderly gentleman who would be glad to eat with you miss lindon what sit down to table with a stranger fabrice the gentleman i am sure would be agreeable to you you seem afflicted and so does he the communication of your grief might perhaps give mutual consolation miss lindon i cannot will not see anybody fabrice at least madam permit my wife to pay her respects to you and keep you company permit her— miss lindon i return you thanks sir but i want nothing    fabrice you will pardon me madam but i cannot think you want nothing when you stand in need even of common necessaries miss lindon who could make you believe so indeed sir you are imposed upon fabrice you will forgive me madam miss lindon o polly tis two oclock and lord murray not come yet fabrice that lord you speak of madam is one of the best of men you never received him here but before company why would not you permit me to furnish out a little repast for you both he is perhaps a relative of yours miss lindon my dear sir you are mistaken fabrice pulling polly by the sleeve go child there is a good dinner for you in the next room this woman is incomprehensible but who is yonder lady in the coffeeroom with a masculine air i should have taken her for a man how wildly she looks polly o my dear mistress tis lady alton who wanted to marry my lord—i remember i saw her once before this way tis certainly she    miss lindon and my lord not come then i am undone why am i still condemned to live she goes in scene vii lady alton walking across the stage in a violent passion and taking fabrice by the arm follow me sir i must talk with you fabrice with me madam lady alton with you wretch fabrice what a devil of a woman end of the first act act ii scene i lady alton fabrice lady alton i dont believe a word you say mr coffeeman you will absolutely drive me out of my senses fabrice then pray madam get into them again    lady alton you have the impudence to affirm to me that this fortunehunter here is a woman of honor though she has received visits from a nobleman you ought to be ashamed of yourself fabrice why so madam when my lord came he never came in privately she received him publicly the doors of her apartment were open and my wife present you may despise my condition madam but you should respect my honesty and as to the lady you are pleased to call a fortunehunter if you knew her you would esteem her lady alton leave me sir you grow impertinent fabrice what a woman lady alton goes to miss lindons door and knocks rudely open the door scene ii miss lindon lady alton miss lindon who knocks so what do you want madam lady alton answer me madam does not lord murray come here sometimes    miss lindon whats that to you what right have you to ask me am i a criminal and you my judge lady alton i am your accuser if my lord still visits you if you encourage that wretchs passion tremble renounce him or you are undone miss lindon if i had a passion for him your menaces madam would but increase it lady alton i see you love him that the perfidious villain has seduced you he has deceived you and you brave me but know there is no vengeance which i am not capable of executing miss lindon then madam know i do love him lady alton before i revenge myself i will astonish you there know the traitor look at these letters he wrote to me there is his picture too which he gave me but let me have it back or— miss lindon giving her back the picture what have i seen unhappy woman madam— lady alton well miss lindon i no longer love him    lady alton keep your resolution and your promise know he is inconstant cruel proud the worst of characters miss lindon stop madam if you continue to speak ill of him i may relapse and love him again you are come here on purpose to take away my wretched life that madam will easily be done—polly tis all over come and assist me to conceal this last and worst of all my miseries polly what is the matter my dear mistress where is your courage miss lindon against misfortune injustice and poverty there are arms that will defend a noble heart but there is an arrow that always must be fatal they go out scene iii lady alton wasp lady alton to be betrayed abandoned for this worthless little wretch to wasp you newswriter have you done what i ordered you have you employed your engines of intelligence and found out who this insolent creature is that makes me so completely miserable    wasp i have fulfilled your ladyships commands and have discovered that she is a scotchwoman and hides herself from the world lady alton prodigious news indeed wasp i can find out nothing else at present lady alton what service then have you been of wasp when we discover a little we add a little and one little joined to another makes a great deal theres a hypothesis for you lady alton how pedant a hypothesis wasp yes i suppose she is an enemy to the government lady alton certainly nothing can be worse inclined for she has robbed me of my lover wasp you plainly see therefore that in troublesome times a scotchwoman who conceals herself must be an enemy to the state lady alton i cant say i see it altogether so clearly but i heartily wish it were so    wasp i would not lay a wager about it but id swear to it lady alton and would you venture to affirm this before people of consequence wasp i have the honor of being related to many persons of the first fashion i am intimate with the mistress of a valet de chambre to the first secretary of the prime minister i could even talk with the lackeys of your lover lord murray and tell them that the father of this young girl has sent her up to london as a woman ill disposed now observe this might have its consequences and your rival for her bad intentions might be sent to the same prison where i have so often been for my writings lady alton good very good violent passions must be served by people who have no scruples about them let the vessel go with a full sail or let it go to the bottom you are certainly right a scotchwoman who conceals herself at a time when all the people of her country are suspected must certainly be an enemy to the state you are no fool as you have been represented to me i thought you had been only a smatterer on paper but i see you have genius i have already done something for you i will do a great deal more you must let me know everything that passes here wasp let me advise you madam to make use of everything you know and of everything you do not know    truth stands in need of some ornament downright lies indeed may be vile things but fiction is beautiful what after all is truth a conformity with our own ideas what one says is always conformable to the idea one has whilst one is talking therefore properly speaking there is no such thing as a lie lady alton you seem to be an excellent logician i fancy you studied at st omers but go only tell me whatever you discover i ask no more of you scene iv lady alton fabrice lady alton this is certainly one of the vilest and most impudent scoundrels dogs bite from an instinct of courage and this fellow from an instinct of meanness methinks now i am a little cool his behavior makes me out of love with revenge i could almost take my rivals part against him she has in her low condition a pride that pleases me she is decent and i am told sensible but she has robbed me of my lover and that i can never pardon to fabrice whom she sees in the coffeeroom honest man your servant you are a good kind of fellow but you have got a sad rascal in your house fabrice i have heard madam from many that he is as wicked as miss lindon is virtuous and amiable lady alton amiable that wounds my heart  0 scene v fabrice mr freeport dressed plainly with a large hat fabrice heaven be praised mr freeport i see you safe returned how are you since your voyage to jamaica freeport pretty well i thank you mr fabrice i have been very successful but am much fatigued to the waiter boy some chocolate and the papers—one finds it more difficult to amuse oneself than to get rich fabrice will you have wasps papers freeport no what should i do with such stuff it is no concern of mine if a spider in the corner of a wall walks over his web to suck the blood of flies give me the gazette what public news have you fabrice none at present freeport so much the better the less news the less folly but how go your affairs my friend have you a good deal of business who lodges with you now fabrice this morning an old gentleman came who wont see anybody    freeport hes in the right of it three parts of the world are good for nothing either knaves or fools and as for the fourth they keep to themselves fabrice this gentleman has not so much as the curiosity to see a charming young lady who is in the same house with him freeport there hes wrong who is she pray fabrice she is something more singular even than himself she has now been with me these four months and has never stirred out of her apartment she calls herself lindon but i believe that is not her real name freeport i make no doubt but shes a woman of virtue or she would not lodge with you fabrice o she is more than you can conceive beautiful to the last degree greatly distressed and the best of women between you and me she is excessively poor but of a high spirit and very proud freeport if that be the case she is more to blame even than your old gentleman fabrice by no means her pride is an additional virtue she denies herself common necessaries and at the    same time would let nobody know she does works with her own hands to get money to pay me never complains but hides her tears it is with the utmost difficulty i can persuade her to expend a little of her money due for rent on things she really wants and am forced to make use of a thousand arts before she will suffer me to assist her i always reckon what she has at half the price it cost me and when she finds it out there is always a quarrel between us which indeed is the only quarrel we have ever had in short sir she is a miracle of virtue misfortune and intrepidity she frequently draws from me tears of tenderness and admiration freeport you are naturally tender i am not i admire none though i esteem many but i will see this woman i am a little melancholy and she may divert me fabrice o sir she scarcely ever receives any visitors there is a lord indeed who comes now and then to see her but she will never speak to him unless before my wife he has not been here for some time and now she lives more retired than ever freeport i love retirement too and hate a crowd as much as she can i must see her where is her apartment fabrice yonder even with the coffeeroom freeport ill go in    fabrice you must not freeport i say i must why not go into her chamber bring in my chocolate and the papers pulls out his watch i have not much time to lose for i am engaged at two scene vi miss lindon frightened polly following her freeport fabrice miss lindon my god who is this sir you are extremely rude i think you might have shown more respect to my sex than thus to intrude on my retirement freeport you will pardon me madam to fabrice bring me the chocolate fabrice yes sir with the ladys consent freeport seats himself near a table reads the newspaper and looks up to miss lindon and polly takes off his hat and puts it on again polly this gentleman seems pretty familiar

freeport harkee madam i hate compliments i have heard one of the best of characters of you you are    poor and virtuous but they tell me you are proud thats a fault polly and pray sir who told you all this freeport the master of this house who is a very honest man and therefore i believe him miss lindon o sir tis all a fable he has deceived you not indeed with regard to pride which always accompanies true modesty nor as to virtue which is my first duty but with regard to that poverty of which he suspects me those who want nothing can never be poor freeport you dont stick to truth which is even a worse fault than being proud i know better i know you are in want of everything and sometimes deny yourself so much as a dinner polly thats by order of the doctor freeport hold your tongue hussy do you pretend to give yourself airs too polly what an original freeport in a word whether you are proud or not is nothing to me i have made a voyage to jamaica that has brought me in five thousand pounds now you must know it is a law with me and ought to be    a law with every good christian always to give away a tenth part of what i get it is a debt which i owe to the unfortunate you are unhappy though you wont acknowledge it theres five hundred pounds for you now remember youre paid let me have no curtseys no thanks keep the money and the secret throws down a large purse on the table polly in faith this is more original still miss lindon rising i never was so astonished in my life—alas how everything conspires to humble me what generosity and yet what an affront freeport reading the news and drinking his chocolate this impertinent writer a ridiculous fellow to talk such nonsense with an air of consequence—the king is arrived he makes a most noble figure being extremely tall the blockhead what signifies it whether he is tall or short could not he have told us the plain fact miss lindon coming up to freeport sir— freeport well madam— miss lindon what you have done sir surprises me still more than what you said but i cannot possibly accept the    money as it may not perhaps ever be in my power to repay it freeport who talks of repaying it miss lindon i thank you sir for your goodness from the bottom of my heart you have my sincere acknowledgments my admiration i can no more polly you are more extraordinary than the gentleman himself surely madam in the condition you are in deserted by all the world you must have lost your senses to refuse an unexpected succor thus offered you by one of the most generous though whimsical and absurd men i ever met with freeport what do you mean by that madam whimsical and absurd polly if you wont accept of it for your own sake take it for mine i have served you in your illfortune and have some right to partake of the good in short sir this is no time to dissemble we are in the utmost distress and if it had not been for our kind landlord must have perished with cold and hunger my mistress concealed her condition from all those who might have been of service to us you became acquainted with it in spite of her in spite of herself therefore oblige her to accept of that which heaven hath sent her by your generous hand miss lindon dear polly you will ruin my honor    polly you my dear mistress would ruin yourself by your folly miss lindon if you love me consider my reputation i shall die with shame freeport reading what are these women prating about polly and if you love me madam dont oblige me to perish with hunger miss lindon o polly what think you my lord would say if still he loves me could he believe me capable of such meanness i always pretended to him that i wanted nothing and shall i receive a present from another from a stranger polly your pretence was wrong and your refusal still more so as to my lord hell say nothing about it for he has deserted you miss lindon my dear polly by our sorrows i entreat you do not let us disgrace ourselves contrive in some way to excuse me to this strange man who means well though he is so rude and unpolished tell him when an unmarried woman accepts such presents the world will always suspect she does it at the expense of her virtue    freeport reading what does she say polly coming close to him o sir something mighty ridiculous she talks of the suspicions of the world and that an unmarried woman— freeport is she unmarried then polly yes sir and i too freeport so much the better so she says that an unmarried woman— polly cannot take a present from a man— freeport she does not know what she says why am i to be suspected of a dishonest purpose because i do an honest action polly do you hear him madam miss lindon i hear and i admire him but am still resolved not to accept it they would say i loved him that villain wasp would certainly report it and i should be undone polly to freeport she is afraid sir you are in love with her  0 freeport in love with her how can that be when i know nothing of her indeed madam you may make yourself easy on that head and if perchance some years hence i should fall in love with you and you with me well and good as you determine i shall determine also and if you think no more of it i shall think no more of it if you tell me i am disagreeable to you you will soon be so to me if you desire not to see me you shall never see me again and if you desire me to return i will pulls out his watch so fare you well i have a little business at present madam your servant miss lindon your servant sir you have my esteem and my gratitude but take your money with you and once more spare my blushes freeport the womans a fool miss lindon mr fabrice mr fabrice for heavens sake come and assist me fabrice coming in a violent hurry whats the matter madam miss lindon giving him the purse here take this purse the gentleman left it by mistake give it him again i charge you assure him of my esteem and remember i want no assistance from any one    fabrice taking the purse o mr freeport i know you by this generous action but be assured this lady means to deceive you she is really in want of this miss lindon tis false and is it you mr fabrice who would betray me fabrice i will obey you madam aside to freeport i will keep this money it may be of service to her without her knowing it my heart bleeds to see such virtue joined to such misfortunes freeport i feel for her too but she is too haughty tell her it is not right to be proud adieu scene vii miss lindon polly polly well madam you have made a fine piece of work of it heaven graciously offered you assistance and you resolve to perish in indigence i too must fall a sacrifice to your virtue a virtue which is not without its alloy of vanity that vanity madam will destroy us both miss lindon death is all i have to wish for lord murray no longer loves me he has left me these three days    he has loved my proud and cruel rival perhaps he loves her still i was to blame to think of him but tis a crime i shall not long be guilty of she sits down to write polly she seems in despair alas she has but too much reason to be so her condition is far worse than mine a servant has always some resource but a woman like her can have none miss lindon folding up her letter tis no great sacrifice there polly when i am no more carry that letter to him— polly what says my dear mistress miss lindon to him who is the cause of my death i have recommended you to him perhaps he may comply with my last request go polly embracing her and be assured that amongst all my misfortunes that of not being able to recompense you as you deserve is not the least which this wretched heart has experienced polly o my dear mistress i cannot refrain from tears you harrow up my soul what is your dreadful purpose what means this letter god forbid i should ever deliver it she tears the letter alas madam why would not you open your heart to lord murray perhaps your cold reserve has disgusted him    miss lindon perhaps so indeed my eyes are open now i must have offended him but how could i disclose my condition to the son of him who ruined my father and family polly how madam was it my lords father who— miss lindon yes it was he who persecuted my father had him condemned to death deprived us of our nobility and took away everything from us left as i am without father mother or fortune i have nothing but my reputation and my fatal love i ought to detest the son of murray misfortune that still pursues me brought me acquainted with him i have loved him and i ought to suffer for it polly o madam you grow pale your eyes are dim miss lindon may grief perform that office for me which sword or poison— polly help here mr fabrice help my mistress faints fabrice help help here where are ye all my wife my servants come down tell the gentlemen above—help here— fabrices wife her maids and polly carry off miss lindon into her chamber    miss lindon as she is going out why will ye bring me back to life again let me die in peace

baroness de lorme a relation of the counts a haughty imperious woman of a bad temper and disagreeable to live with the marchioness dolban mother of the count nanine a young girl brought up in the counts house philip hombert a peasant in the neighborhood blaise the gardener germon  servants marin   scene the count dolbans country seat this comedy is called in the french nanine ou le préjugé vaincu nanine or prejudice overcome it is written as we are told in the titlepage in verses of ten syllables the absurdity of comedies in rhyme i have already remarked the original begins thus   il faut parler il faut monsieur le comte   vous expliquer nettement sur mon compte the reader cannot but observe what villainous rhymes comte and compte are and perhaps will more readily forgive my reducing this comedy into plain prose it was produced in         act i scene i the count dolban the baroness de lorme baroness in short my lord it is time to come to an explanation with regard to this affair we are no children therefore let us talk freely you have been a widower for these two years past and i a widow about as long the lawsuit in which we were unfortunately engaged and which gave us both so much uneasiness is at an end and all our animosities i hope now buried with those who were the causes of them count i am glad of it for lawsuits were always my aversion baroness and am not i as hateful as a lawsuit count you madam baroness yes i sir for these two years past we have lived together with freedom as relations and friends the ties of blood taste and interest seem to unite us and to point out a more intimate connection count interest madam make use of some better term i beseech you    baroness that sir i cannot but with grief i find your inconstant heart no longer considers me in any other light than as your relative count i do not wear the appearance madam of a trifler baroness you wear the appearance sir of a perjured villain count aside ha whats this baroness yes sir you know the suit my husband began against you to recover my estate was by agreement to have been terminated by a marriage a marriage you told me of choice you are engaged to me you know you are and he who defers the execution of his promise seldom means to perform it count you know i wait for my mothers consent baroness a doting old woman well sir and what then count i love and respect her yet baroness but i do not sir come come these are idle frivolous excuses for your unpardonable falsehood you wait not for her or for anybody perfidious ungrateful man    count who told you so madam and whence all this violence of passion who told you so whence comes your information madam baroness who told me yourself yourself your words your manner your air your whole behavior put on on purpose to affront me it shocks me to see it act in another manner or find some better excuses for your conduct can you think me blind to the shameful unworthy passion that directs you a passion for the lowest meanest object you have deceived me sir basely deceived me count tis false i cannot deceive dissimulation is no part of my character i own to you there was a time when you were agreeable to me i admired you and flattered myself that i should have found in you a treasure to make amends for that which heaven had deprived me of i hoped in this sweet asylum to have tasted the fruits of a peaceful and happy union but you have found out the means to destroy your own power love as i told you long since has two quivers one filled with darts tipped with the purest flame which inspires the soul with tender feelings refines our taste and sentiments enlivens our affection and enhances our pleasures the other is full of cruel arrows that wound our hearts with quarrels jealousy and suspicion bring on coldness and indifference and remove the warmth of passion to make room for disgust and satiety these madam are the darts which you have drawn forth against us both and yet you expect that i should love    baroness there indeed i own myself in the wrong i ought not to expect it it is not in your power but you are false and now would reproach me for it and i must suffer your insults your fine similes and illustrations but pray sir what is it i have done to lose this mighty treasure what have you to find fault with count your temper your humors madam beauty pleases the eye alone softness and complacency charm the soul baroness and have not you your humors too sir count doubtless madam and for that very reason would have an indulgent wife one whose sweet complying goodness would bend a little to my frailties and condescend to reconcile me to myself to heal my wounds without burning them to correct without assuming to govern without being a tyrant to insinuate herself by degrees into my heart as the light of a fine day opens gradually on the weak and delicate eye he who feels the yoke that is put on him will always murmur at it and tyrannic love is a deity that i abjure i would be a lover but not a slave your pride madam would make me contemptible i have faults i own i have but heaven made woman to correct the leaven of our souls to soften our afflictions sweeten our bad humors soothe our passions and make us better and happier beings this was what they were designed for and for my part i would prefer ugliness and affability to beauty with pride and arrogance    baroness excellently well moralized indeed and so when you insult abuse and betray me i in return with mean complacency must forgive the shameful extravagance of your passion and your assumed air of grandeur and magnanimity must be a sufficient excuse to me for all the baseness of your heart count how madam baroness yes sir i know you it is the young nanine who has done me this injury a child a servant a field beggar whom my foolish tenderness nourished and supported whom your fond easy mother touched with false pity took up out of the bosom of penury and sorrow o you blush sir do you count i madam i wish her well baroness you love her sir i know you do count well madam and if i did love her know i would openly avow it baroness nay i believe you are capable of it count i am so baroness and would you break thus through all the bounds of decency degrade your rank demean your birth    and plunged as you are in shame and infamy laugh at and defy all honor count call it prejudice whatever you or the world may think madam i never mistake vanity for honor and glory you love pomp and splendor and place grandeur and nobility in a coat of arms i look for it in the heart the man of worth who has modesty with courage and the woman who has sense and spirit though without fortune rank or title are in my eyes the first of human kind baroness but surely they ought to have some rank and condition in life would you treat a lowborn scholar or an honest man of the meanest birth because he had a little virtue in the same manner and with the same respect as you would a lord count the virtuous should always have the preference baroness this extravagant humility is insupportable do we owe nothing then to our rank count yes to be honest baroness my noble blood would aspire to a higher character count that is a high one which defies the vulgar baroness thus you degrade all quality    count no thus i do honor to humanity baroness ridiculous what then becomes of the world what is fashion count fashion madam is despised by wisdom i will obey its ridiculous commands in my dress perhaps but not in my sentiments no it becomes a man to act like a man to preserve to himself his own taste and his own thoughts am i ridiculously to ask of others what i am to seek or to avoid to praise or condemn must the world decide my fate surely i have my reason and that should be my guide apes were made for imitation only but man should act from his own heart baroness why this to be sure is freedom of sentiment and talking like a philosopher go then thou noble and sublime soul go and fall in love with village damsels be the happy rival of plowmen and hedgers go and support the honor of your race count good heaven what must i do how am i to act scene ii the count the baroness blaise count well sir what do you want    blaise your poor gardener sir humbly beseeches your honor— count my honor well blaise and what wouldst thou have of my honor blaise and please your honor i would fain—be married and— count with all my heart blaise you have my consent i like your design and will assist you it is well folks should marry well and thy spouse elect blaise what is she handsome blaise o yes sir a delicate little morsel baroness and does she like you blaise blaise o yes count well and her name is blaise yes tis— count what blaise the pretty nanine count nanine    baroness well very well indeed i approve of the match extremely count aside o heaven how am i sunk it cannot must not be blaise im sure master will like it count what did you say she loved you rascal blaise i beg pardon sir i— count did she tell you that she loved you sir blaise why no sir not absolutely sir not directly but she seemed to have a little sort of a sneaking kindness for me too a hundred times has she said to me in the prettiest softest most familiar tone help me my dear friend blaise to make a fine nosegay for my lord that best of masters then would she make the nosegay with such a pretty air and look so thoughtful and so absent and so confused and so—o it was plain enough count aside away blaise get thee gone—oh and am i agreeable to her then blaise nay master now dont put off this little affair of mine  00 count ha blaise you shall see how this little spot of land will thrive under our hands soon why wont you answer me sir you say nothing count aside oh my heart is too full i must retire—madam your servant scene iii the baroness blaise baroness to herself he loves her to distraction of that im positive by what charms by what happy address could she thus steal his heart from me nanine good heaven what a choice what madness nanine no i shall burst with disappointment blaise what did you say madam about nanine baroness to herself insolent creature blaise is not nanine a charming girl baroness no  0  blaise well i say no more but do speak for me speak for poor blaise baroness what a dreadful stroke is this blaise i have a little money madam a few crowns my father left me three good acres of land and they shall be hers money and land everything i have body and soul blaise and all baroness believe me blaise i wish you as well as you can wish yourself and should be glad to serve you i should be glad to see you married this very night nay whats more ill give her a portion blaise o good dear baroness how i do love you is it possible you can make me so happy baroness alas blaise i am afraid i cannot we shall never succeed blaise o but you must madam baroness i wish to god she was your wife wait for my orders blaise and must i wait not long i hope baroness be gone  0  blaise servant madam i shall have hear i shall have her scene iv baroness alone what a strange adventure could i have received a more cruel injury a more shameful affront the count dolban rivalled by a gardener—here boy she calls out to her servant fetch nanine to me since i am so unhappy i must examine her where could she have learned this art of flattery who taught her to gain hearts and to preserve them to light up a strong and a lasting flame where doubtless in her eyes in plain and simple nature but this shameful and unworthy passion of his is still a secret it has not dared as yet to appear openly dolban i see has his scruples about it so much the worse if he had none i might still have hopes but he has all the symptoms of true love o here she comes the sight of her hurts me nature is most unjust to bestow so much beauty on such a creature tis an affront to nobility come this way madam scene v the baroness nanine nanine madam baroness and yet after all she is not so very handsome  0  those great black eyes of hers express nothing but if they have said i love ay theres the danger but i must—come this way child nanine i come madam as is my duty baroness yes but you make me wait a little for you prithee child step on how awkwardly she is made what a mien there is he was never made for such a creature as you nanine tis very true madam i assure you i have often blushed in secret when i looked on these fine clothes but they were your first present to me the effect of that goodness which i shall ever acknowledge and of that generous care with which you were pleased to honor me you took a pride in dressing me o madam remember how often you have protected me believe me madam i am still the same why should you wish to humble a submissive heart which can never forget itself baroness bring that couch nearer to me—o i am distracted whence come you what have you been about nanine reading madam baroness reading what nanine an english book that was given me baroness whats the subject of it  0  nanine tis extremely interesting the author would have us believe that we are all brethren all born equal and on a level with each other but tis an idle chimera i cant reconcile myself to his doctrine baroness aside she will soon i suppose—what vanity to nanine bring me my standish and pen and ink nanine yes madam baroness no stay give me something to drink nanine what madam baroness nothing its no matter take my fan go and get my gloves—or—stay—it does not signify you need not come hither i desire you to take care never to think yourself handsome nanine that madam is a lesson you have so often taught me that if i had so much vanity and selflove had such influence over my foolish heart you would soon have cured me of it baroness aside where can she have learned all this how i hate her beauty and wit together tis intolerable—harkee child you know the tenderness i had for you in your infancy  0  nanine yes madam and i hope my youth will be honored with equal goodness from you baroness be careful then to deserve it it is my intention now this very day nay this very hour to fix and establish your happiness judge then whether i love you nanine to fix my happiness baroness yes i will give you a portion the husband i design for you is wellmade and in every way worthy of you a proper match for you in every particular and the only one that at present could suit you you ought to thank me for the choice in a word tis blaise the gardener nanine blaise madam baroness yes why that simpering do you hesitate a moment to consent my offers madam i would have you know are commands obey or expect my resentment nanine but madam— baroness let me have no buts they offend me a pretty thing indeed for your impertinence to refuse a husband at my hands that simple heart of yours is swelled to a fine degree of vanity but your boldness is a little premature and your triumph will be of  0  short duration you take advantage of the capricious fortune of one lucky day but shall soon see what will be the event you ungrateful little wretch have you the insolence to please you understand me madam but ill bring you back to that nothingness whence you came and you shall lament your folly and your pride ill shut you up for the rest of your life in a convent nanine on my knees i thank you madam do shut me up my fate will be too mild yes madam of all the benefits you have ever bestowed on me this which you call a punishment i shall esteem the greatest favor shut me up forever in a cloister there i will thank you for your goodness and bless my dear master there i shall learn to calm those cruel fears those dreadful alarms those worst of evils those passions that are far more dangerous to me even than your resentment which fill me with terror and astonishment o madam by that anger i entreat you deliver me save me save me if possible from myself this moment i am ready to go baroness what do i hear can it be are you in earnest nanine or mean you to deceive me nanine no indeed i do not o do me this charming this divine favor my heart stands too much in need of it baroness with transport rise then and let me embrace you o happy hour my dear nanine my friend ill go this instant  0  and prepare your sweet retreat o tis a charming thing to live in a convent nanine tis at least a shelter from the world and all its cares baroness o my dear tis a delightful situation nanine do you think so madam baroness this world is a hateful place—jealous— nanine sighing tis so indeed baroness foolish wicked vain deceitful inconstant and ungrateful o tis a horrid place nanine yes i see it would be fatal to me i ought to flee from it baroness you ought indeed a good convent is the best haven of security now my good lord i think i shall be beforehand with you nanine did you say anything about my master madam baroness o nanine i love you even to madness this moment i would if possible lock you up never to come out again but tonight it is too late we must wait till morning harkee child come to me at  0  midnight to my apartment and we will set off secretly for the convent be ready by five at the latest scene vi nanine alone how distressful is my condition what trouble and uneasiness do i feel and what various passions rise in my soul to leave so good so amiable a master perhaps to offend him by it and yet if i had stayed this excess of his goodness might have brought on worse calamities and put his whole family in confusion the baroness seems apprehensive that he has a particular regard for me but his heart could never stoop so low i must not dare not think of it and my lady seems desperately angry about it am i hated then and should i be afraid of being beloved o but myself myself i have most reason to fear and my foolish heart that beats so at the thought of him what will become of me taken out of my humble state my notions now are too refined and too exalted it is a misfortune nay and it is a fault too to have a mind above ones condition i must go i know it will kill me but no matter scene vii the count nanine a servant count stay at that door there somebody dye hear bring chairs here quick make haste he bows to nanine who makes him a low courtesy come sit down  0  nanine who i sir count yes i will have it so i mean to pay you nanine that respect which your conduct your beauty and merit deserve shines the diamond with less lustre or is it less valuable because found in a desert whats the matter your eyes seem bathed in tears o i see it but too plainly our angry baroness jealous of your charms has been venting her illhumors on you and left my poor girl weeping nanine no sir no her goodness i assure you to me was never greater than at present but everything here softens and affects me count im glad to hear it i was afraid it was some of her malice nanine why so sir count o my dear girl jealousy reigns in every breast every man is jealous when he is in love and every woman even before she is so a young and beautiful girl who at the same time is goodnatured and sincere is sure to displease her whole sex men are more just and we endeavor as well as we can to revenge ourselves on you for your jealousy but with regard to nanine i only do her justice i love that heart which is void of artifice i admire the display of those extraordinary talents which you have so finely cultivated and i am both surprised and charmed at the ingenuous simplicity of your manners   0 nanine o sir my merit is small indeed but i have seen you have heard and been instructed by you you have raised me too high above my humble birth i owe you but too much from you only i have learned to think count o nanine wit and good sense are not to be taught nanine i think too much i fear for one in my station my fortune designed me for the lowest rank in life count your virtues have placed you in the highest but tell me ingenuously what effect had that english book i lent you nanine not convinced me at all sir i am more than ever of opinion that there are hearts so noble and so generous that all others must appear mean and vile when put in comparison with them count true nanine and you are yourself a proof of it but permit me to raise you for the future to a rank and station here less unworthy of you nanine my condition sir is already too high and too desirable for me count no nanine that cannot be henceforward i shall consider you as one of the family my mother is     coming she will look on you as her daughter my esteem and her tender friendship will put you on a different footing and place you in a better rank than you have hitherto held under a proud and imperious woman nanine aside she only taught me my duty sir—and a hard one it is to fulfil count what duty yours nanine is only to please and that you always perform would i could do so too but you should be more at your ease and appear with more splendor you are not yet in your proper sphere nanine i am indeed quite out of it and it is that which makes me unhappy tis my misfortune perhaps an irreparable one rising o my lord my master remove i beseech you from me all these vanities i am confused overwhelmed with your excess of goodness let me live unknown and unenvied heaven formed me for obscurity and humility has nothing in it that to me is grating or disagreeable leave me to my retreat what should i do in the world what should i wish to see there after the admiration of your virtues count to himself it is too much i can resist no longer to nanine you remain in obscurity you     nanine whatever i may do permit me to ask one favor of you count what is it speak nanine for some time past you have loaded me with presents count pardon me nanine i acted but as a tender father who loved his child i have not the art to set off my presents by flattery i aim not at gallantry and only desire to be just fortune had done you wrong and i meant to avenge the injury but nature in recompense for it lavished all her bounties on you and her i strove to imitate nanine you have done a great deal too much but i flatter myself i may be permitted without being thought ungrateful to dispose of those noble presents which i shall ever hold dear because they came from you count you mean to affront me sure scene viii the count nanine germon germon my lady wants you she waits     count let her wait then what cant i speak a moment to you without being interrupted nanine it gives me pain to leave you but you know sir she was my mistress count no i know it not nor ever will nanine she has still a power over me count no such thing she shall have none—you sigh nanine theres something at the bottom of that heart whats the matter nanine i am sorry to leave you sir—but i must—o heaven now all is over she goes out scene ix the count germon count to himself she wept as she left me for a long time she has groaned beneath the tyrannical caprice of this peevish baroness who insults her and by what right or what authority but tis an abuse which i will never suffer this world is nothing but a lottery of wealth titles dignities rights and privileges bartered for     without legal claim and scattered without distinction—here you— germon my lord count tomorrow morning lay this purse of a hundred louis dors on her toilette be sure you dont fail you must then go and see after her servants below theyll wait there germon the baroness shall certainly have them on her toilette according to your orders count blockhead theyre not for her for nanine i tell you germon o very well sir i beg pardon count begone leave me germon goes out this tenderness of mine can never be a weakness in me true i idolize her but my heart was not touched by her beauty only her character is to the last degree amiable i admire her soul but then her low condition—it is too high were she lower i should love her yet more but can i marry her doubtless i may can one pay too dear for being happy shall i fear the censure of an idle world and let pride deprive me of all i wish for but then custom—a cruel tyrant nature has a prior right and should be obeyed and so i am blaises rival too and why not blaise is a man he loves her and he is in the right of it she can be but in the possession of one     though the desire of all gardeners may sigh for her and so may kings my happiness will justify my choice end of the first act act ii scene i the count marin count to himself well this night is a whole year to me not once have i closed my eyelids everybody is asleep but me nanine sleeps in peace a sweet repose refreshes her charms while i wander from place to place and can find no rest i sit down to write but cant then strive to read but all in vain i dont know the words before me while i am looking on them nor can my mind retain a single idea methinks in every page i see the name of nanine imprinted by some hand divine—hullo whos there all asleep german marin marin behind the scenes coming sir count you idle rascals make haste its broad daylight come come marin lord sir what spirit has raised you up so early this morning count love     marin o ho my lady will let none of

love the baroness i know will be in a rage with all my heart let her rave as long as she will i     despise her and the world and its opinion and am afraid of nobody i will never be the slave of prejudice it is an enemy whom we ought to subdue those who make a rational mind more virtuous and those only are respectable but hark what noise is that in the court a chariot sure it must be so yet who could come at this time in the morning my mother perhaps germon— germon sir count what is that germon a chariot sir count whose is it anybody coming here germon no sir theyre going count going who where germon the baroness sir going out immediately count o with all my heart let her go forever if she pleases germon nanine and she are this minute setting out count o heaven what sayest thou nanine

to talk to them no matter ill go i ought—but stop that must not be i should at once discover all my passion no—go germon stop them let everything be fast bring nanine to me or answer it with your life germon goes out so they would have carried her off what a dreadful stroke ungrateful cruel unjust woman how have i deserved this what have i done i only loved and adored her but never declared my passion never endeavored to force her inclinations or to alarm her timid innocence why should she fly from me the more i think of it the more i am astonished scene iii the count nanine count my sweet girl is it you what run away from me answer me explain this mystery to me terrified i suppose with the baronesss threats you were willing to escape and that tender regard which i have long had for your virtues i know     has quickened her resentment surely you could not yourself have thought of leaving me of depriving this place of its fairest ornament last night when i saw you in tears tell me nanine had you any intention of this answer me tell me why would you have wished to leave me nanine behold me on my knees and trembling before you count raising her up rise nanine and tell me—i tremble more myself nanine my lady sir— count well—what of her nanine that lady sir whom i honor and esteem did not i assure you force me to the convent count and could it then be your own choice o misery nanine it was i own it was i entreated her to restrain my wandering thoughts—she wanted to marry me count indeed to whom nanine to your gardener   0 count o the worthy choice nanine i sir was ashamed and to the last degree unhappy i who in vain endeavor to stifle sentiments far above my condition i whom your bounty had raised too high must now be punished by the loss of that goodness which i never deserved count you punish yourself nanine and for what nanine for having dared to raise the resentment of your relation sir who was once my mistress i know sir i am disagreeable to her the very sight of me disgusts her she has reason indeed for when i was near her i was guilty of a weakness which i shall ever feel it grows on me every hour but i would have torn it from my breast i would have humbled by the austerities of a convent this proud heart exalted by your goodness and revenged on it the involuntary crime but the bitterest grief i felt was my fear of offending you count turning from her and walking about what sentiments what a noble and ingenuous mind can she be prejudiced in my favor was she afraid of loving me o exalted virtue nanine if i have offended you i beg a thousand pardons but permit me sir in some deep retreat to hide my sorrows and to reflect in secret on my own duty and your goodness to me     count no more of that now observe me the baroness is your friend and out of her generosity has provided you with a servant a rustic a boor for your husband i know of one who will at least be less unworthy of you in birth and fortune far superior to blaise young honest and well provided for a man i assure you of sense and reflection his character very different from those of the present age if i am not much mistaken hell make you an excellent husband is not this better than a convent nanine no sir i own to you this new favor which you would bestow on me has nothing in it that can give me any real satisfaction you know my grateful heart read there my real sentiments and see why i wish to retreat from the world a gardener or the monarch of the whole world who should offer marriage to me would be equally displeasing count you have determined me and now nanine know the man for whom i have designed you you already esteem him he is yours he adores you that husband is—myself i see you are troubled and surprised but speak to me my life depends on you o recollect yourself you are strangely agitated nanine what do i hear can it be count it is no more than you deserve nanine in love with me o do not think do not imagine i     will ever dare to claim my conquest no sir never will i suffer you to descend thus low for me such marriages believe me sir are always unhappy fancy vanishes and repentance alone remains no i will call your ancestors to witness—alas sir think not on me you took pity on my youth this heart which you have formed which is your own work would be unworthy of your care if it could accept from you this noblest present no sir i owe you at least this refusal my heart shall sacrifice itself for your sake count no more for i am resolved and you shall be my wife did you not this moment assure me you would refuse every other man though he were a prince nanine i did and repent not of the resolution count do you hate me then nanine should i have fled should i have avoided should i have feared if i had hated you count it is enough and i am fixed nanine what then have you determined on count our marriage nanine think sir     count i have thought of everything nanine and foreseen too count i have nanine if you love me believe me sir— count i do believe—that i have resolved on the only means to make myself happy nanine but you forget— count i have forgotten nothing everything is ordered and everything shall be ready nanine what in spite of all i say will your obstinate passion— count yes in spite of you my impatient love must urge the happy moment i will quit you for a minute that henceforth we may never part adieu my dear nanine scene iv nanine alone good heaven do i dream or am i indeed arrived at the summit of earthly happiness tis not the honor great as it is tis not the splendor that dazzles me no i despise it all but to wed the most     generous of men the dear object of all my timid wishes him whom i was so much afraid of loving him whom i adore yet i love him too much to wish he should demean himself for my sake but it is impossible to avoid it i cannot now escape him what can i do heaven i trust will direct me and support my weakness perhaps even—but ill write to him—and yet how to begin and what to say—what a surprise i will write immediately before i enter into this solemn engagement scene v nanine blaise blaise o there she is well my little maid my lady has spoken to you in my favor has she not ha she writes on and takes no notice of me nanine writing on o blaise good morrow to you blaise good morrow is but a cold compliment nanine writing every word i write doubles my distress and my whole letter is full of doubts and uneasiness blaise how she writes offhand o shes a great genius and a monstrous wit i wish i was a wit too then id tell her—     nanine well sir blaise lackaday shes so clever im afraid to speak i shall never be able to break my mind to her—yet i was hot upont and came here o purpose that i did nanine dear blaise you must do me a piece of

these packets and accept the contents of them know i have been offered a most noble and truly     enviable condition in life such as i might well be dazzled with the prospect of but there is nothing which i would not sacrifice to the only one on earth whom my heart ought to love very fine indeed upon my word nanine an excellent style how prettily she writes the innocent orphan her passion speaks most eloquently a rare billet this o thou sly jade thus you deceived poor blaise and thus deprived me of my lover this going into a convent i find was all a feint a pretence and the counts money it seems is for philip hombert thou little coquette but i am glad of it the counts perfidiousness to me deserved this return i thought indeed nanines heart was as mean as her birth and now i am satisfied

have—aside o philip hombert to his mother but you have prevented me my respect and tenderness—aside with that air of innocence too perfidious wretch marchioness why you rave child i heard indeed as i passed through paris that your head was a little touched and i find there was some truth in it how long has this misfortune—     count good heaven how confused i am marchioness does it seize you often count it never will again madam marchioness i should be glad to speak with you alone turns to the baroness and makes her a formal courtesy good morrow madam baroness aside the old fool turning to the marchioness madam i leave you the pleasure of entertaining the count at your leisure and retire she goes out scene xii the marchioness the count marchioness talking very fast and in the manner of a little prattling old woman well sir and so you intend to make the baroness my daughterinlaw twas this to tell you the truth that brought me here so soon shes a peevish impertinent proud opinionated creature and one who never had the least regard for me last year when i supped with the marchioness agard she said before all the company i was a babbler lord forbid     i should ever sup there again a babbler besides i know between you and me she is not so rich and that let me tell you son is a great point and we ought to be wellinformed about it they tell me that the château dorme did but half of it belong to her husband and that the other half was disputed by a long lawsuit that is not finished to this day that i had from your grandpapa and he always told the truth ay he was a man there are few such nowadays there is nothing now at paris but a set of halfmen vain foolish impertinent coxcombs talking on every subject and laughing at times past oh their eternal clack distracts me prating about new kitchens and new fashions we hear of nothing now but bankrupts and distress and ruin the wives in short are licentious and the husbands simpletons everything grows worse and worse count reading the letter over again who could have thought it this is a desperate stroke indeed well germon scene xiii the marchioness the count germon germon heres your lawyer sir count o let him wait germon and heres the paper sir she sent you     count reading give it me—well let me see she loves me she says here and refuses me out of—respect faithless woman thou hast not told me the true reason of that refusal marchioness my sons head is certainly turned tis the baronesss doing love has taken away his senses count to germon is nanine gone shall i be rid of her germon alas sir she has already put on her old rustic garb with the greatest modesty and never murmured or complained count very likely so germon she bore her misfortune with the utmost tranquillity while everybody about her was in tears count with tranquillity sayest thou marchioness whom are you talking about germon o madam poor nanine she is going to be driven away and everybody laments the loss of her marchioness to be driven away how is this i dont understand it what my little nanine go call her back     again my charming orphan what has she done pray why nanine was my present to you o i remember at ten years of age she delighted everybody that saw her our baroness took her and i said then she would be illused i knew it would be so but you never mind what i say you will do everything of your own head but let me tell you turning nanine out of doors thus is a very bad action count alone on foot without money without assistance germon o sir i forgot to tell you an old man asked after you below and says he wants to speak to you on an affair of importance which he can communicate to none but yourself he wants to throw himself at your feet count in my present unhappy situation of mind am i fit to converse with anybody marchioness you are uneasy enough i believe child and so am i too to drive away poor nanine and make up a marriage which you knew would be disagreeable to me come it was not a wise thing in three months time you will be weary of one another ill tell you what happened exactly like this to my cousin the marquis of marmure his wife was as sour as verjuice though by the by yours is worse when they married they thought they loved one another and in two months after they were parted my lady went to live with her gallant a foolish sharking extravagant fop and my lord took a vile tricking ridiculous coquette fine suppers country     houses horses clothes a rascally steward new trinkets bought on trust lawyers contracts interestmoney all together soon ruined them and in two years both went together to the hospital o and now i think of it i remember another story more tragical and more extraordinary than the other it was of a— count my dear mother we must go in to dinner come—could i ever have suspected such infidelity marchioness tis really dreadful but ill tell it you all at table in proper time and place son it may be of great use to you away end of the second act act iii

and in this dress too nanine obscurity was my first condition     germon what a change and only from this morning to suffer is nothing but to be degraded is terrible nanine no no there are a thousand times worse misfortunes germon i admire your patience and humility surely my master must have been illadvised our baroness has certainly abused her power she must have done you this injury the count could never have the heart nanine i am indebted to him for everything and if he thinks fit to banish me i must submit his favors are his own and he has a right to recall them germon who would ever have expected such a change what do you intend to do with yourself nanine to retire and repent germon how we shall all detest the baroness nanine they have made me miserable but i forgive them germon but what shall i tell my master from you when you are gone nanine tell him i thank him for restoring me to my   0 former condition tell him that forever sensible of his goodness i shall forget nothing but his—cruelty germon you melt my very soul i could leave this house immediately to go along with you wherever you went but blaise is beforehand with us all he will go and live with you and we are all ready to follow him nanine no germon that im sure you are not o germon to be driven out in this manner—and by whom germon the devil is certainly at the bottom of this business you are leaving us and my master is going to be married nanine married sayest thou indeed nay then let us be gone o he was too dangerous for me—farewell germon well after all my master must have a cruel heart to banish so sweet a creature she seems a most amiable girl but in this world one should swear to nothing scene ii the count germon count well is she gone at last     germon yes sir tis done count im glad of it germon then sir you have a heart of iron count did philip hombert meet and give her his hand germon what philip hombert sir alas sir poor nanine went off without a creature to give her his hand she

care she does not know they come from me tell her tis a present from my mother on no account mention my name to her     germon very well sir i shall obey your orders he goes towards the door count germon you saw her as she went off germon i did sir count did she seem dejected did she weep germon she behaved still better sir a few tears dropped from her but she strove as much as she could to repress them count did she let fall anything that betrayed her sentiments did you remark— germon what sir count did she say anything of me germon yes sir a great deal count tell me then rascal what did she say germon that you were her master her best and kindest benefactor that she shall forget everything—but your cruelty     count away—be sure you take care she never returns germon going out and harkee germon germon sir count one word more remember if by chance as you are conducting her one philip hombert should follow you that you treat him in a proper manner germon o sir ill use him most politely and treat him with a good drubbing that you may depend on ill do the business honestly i warrant you young hombert you say count the same germon very well i have not the honor to know him but the first man i see will i trim most heartily and afterwards make him tell me his name he goes towards the door and comes back this young hombert ill lay my life is some lover of hers a beau a prig i suppose the cock of the village let me alone to deal with him count do as i bid you and immediately germon i thought there was some lover in the case—and blaise too puts in his claim i suppose ay they always love their equals better than their masters count begone i tell you     scene iii the count alone hes in the right and has hit on the true cause of my unhappiness but i shall myself be the punisher of my own folly i must now marry the baroness it is determined and i cant avoid it tis dreadful but i have deserved it twill at least be a convenient match shes not very tractable indeed but every man may rule if he has a mind to it and he who has resolution may at any time be master in his own house scene iv the count baroness marchioness marchioness well son you are going to marry this lady here count yes madam marchioness this night she is to be your wife and my daughterinlaw baroness if you approve of it madam i suppose i shall have your consent marchioness why i must give it

suppose     nothing more likely for to be sure shes very handsome ay ay we are all frail we tempt and are tempted the heart has its weakness young girls are always a little coquettish but come it is not so bad as you make it tell me fairly what my poor child has done count i tell you madam marchioness you seem after all at the bottom to have some regard for the girl and perhaps you may— scene v the count marchioness baroness marin booted marin ive done it sir its all agreed for marchioness whats agreed for baroness ay what sir what marin why sir ive done as you ordered me spoke to the tradesmen and youll have your equipage tomorrow baroness what equipage marin everything madam that your future spouse had ordered six fine horses and a charming berlin im     sure your ladyship will like it its very fine the panels all varnished by martin the diamonds too are brilliant and wellchosen and the new stuffs quite in taste—o nothing comes up to them baroness to the count and had you ordered all this count i had—aside but for whom marin everything will come tomorrow morning in the coach and will be ready for your wedding in the evening o theres nothing like paris for getting everything at a minutes warning if you have but money as i came back i called on the lawyer hes just by finishing your affair baroness it has hung a long time in suspense marchioness aside i wish it would hang these forty years marin in the hall i met a poor old man sighing and in tears he has waited a long time he says and begs to speak to you baroness an impertinent fellow let him go about his business he has chosen the wrong time to trouble us now marchioness why so madam have a little consideration son     let me tell you its very wrong to repulse poor people in this manner i have told you over and over when you were a child you ought to treat them with indulgence hear what they have to say be courteous and affable to them are not they men as well as yourself we dont know perhaps whom we affront and may repent our hardness of heart the proud never prosper to marin go see to that old man marin i will maam he goes out count forgive me madam my respects are always due to you and i am ready to see this man in spite of my present embarrassment scene vi the count marchioness baroness a peasant marchioness to the peasant come come speak dont be afraid peasant o my lord for heavens sake hear me permit me to fall at your feet and to give you back— count rise friend ill not be knelt to do not imagine me capable of such pride you seem to be an honest man do you want employment in my family who are you     marchioness cheer up man peasant alas sir i am the father of—nanine count you baroness your daughters a slut peasant this sir is what i feared this is the cruel stroke that has wounded my poor heart i thought indeed so much money could not fairly belong to one in her condition we little folks soon lose our integrity when we come among the great baroness there hes right enough but still hes a deceiver for nanine is not his daughter she was an orphan peasant it is too true she was so i left her with her poor relatives in her infant years having lost her mother with all my fortune obliged by necessity i went to serve abroad and as i would not have her pass for the daughter of a soldier forbade her ever to mention my name marchioness why so for my part i respect a soldier we stand in need of them sometimes count what is there shameful in the profession peasant it meets indeed with less honor than it deserves   0 count the prejudice against them is inexcusable i own i esteem an honest soldier who hazards his life in the defence of his king and country much more than an important selfsufficient scoundrel whose knavish industry sucks up the blood of his fellow subjects marchioness you must have been in a great many battles let me have an account of them all i long to hear it peasant in my present unhappy condition you must excuse me let it suffice to inform you that i received a thousand promises of advancement but without friends how was it possible to rise thrown amongst the common crowd all i could do was to distinguish myself and honor my only reward marchioness you were then wellborn baroness fie how can you think so wellborn indeed peasant no madam but i was born of honest parents and merited—a better daughter marchioness could you have had a better count well go on marchioness a better than nanine     count prithee go on peasant my daughter i understood was brought up here and treated in the kindest manner i thought myself happy and blessed heaven for your goodness and paternal care of her i came to the neighboring village full of hopes and fears i own i trembled for her dangerous youth and by this ladys intimation find i had but too much reason it has shocked me to the soul but i thought a hundred louis dors besides diamonds was a treasure too great to be fairly come by she could never be mistress of them but at the expense of her innocence the bare suspicion makes me shudder if it be so i shall die with grief and shame but i came as soon as possible to give them you back again they are yours therefore i beseech you take them if my daughter is to blame punish me but dont ruin her marchioness o my dear son i cannot bear this it overpowers me baroness what is all this a dream a trick count o what have i done peasant taking out the purse and the letter here sir take them count i take them no they were given to her and she     has made a noble use of them was it to you then the message was delivered who brought it peasant your gardener sir in whom nanine ventured to confide count was it directed to you peasant it was i own it sir count o grief o tenderness what excess of virtue in them both but now your name—o i am lost distracted marchioness ay your name what mystery is this peasant philip hombert de gatine count o my father baroness what does he say count how day breaks in upon me i have done wrong and i must make amends for it o if you knew how culpable i have been i have injured the sublimest virtue he steps aside and speaks to one of his servants away fly baroness what is all this emotion for     count my coach immediately marchioness now madam you must be her protectress when we have done such an injury we should blush at nothing so much as an imperfect repentance my son often has his whims which people are too apt to mistake for unpardonable follies but at bottom he has a generous soul and is naturally good i can do what i please with him you my daughterinlaw are

precedent end of the third and last act     the prude   0 dramatis personæ mme de dorfise a widow mme de burlet her cousin collette chambermaid to dorfise blandford captain of a ship darmin his friend bartolin a cashier mondor a coxcomb adine niece to darmin and disguised like a young turk scene marseilles this comedy is partly imitated from an english piece called the plain dealer it does not suit very well for the french stage the manners are too rough and bold though much less so than in the original the english seem to take too much liberty and the french too little t s     act i scene i darmin adine adine dressed like a turk o my dear uncle what a cruel voyage what dangers have we run and then my dress and appearance too still must i conceal under this turban my sex my name and the secret of my foolish heart darmin at last we are returned safe in good truth niece i pity you but your father dying consul in greece both of us left as we were after his death without money or friends your youth beauty and accomplishments but so many dangerous advantages and to crown all our misfortunes that wicked pasha desperately in love with you what was to be done you were obliged to disguise yourself and make your escape as soon as possible adine alas i have yet other dangers to encounter darmin dear girl be composed nor blush at what cant be prevented embarking with me in such a hurry and forced to disguise yourself in that manner you could not with any decency resume your sex on board a ship before a hundred sailors who were more to be     feared than your old debauched pasha but happily for us everything has turned out well and we are safely arrived at marseilles out of the reach of amorous pashas near your friends and relatives amongst frenchmen and good sort of people adine blandford is certainly an honest man but how dearly will his virtues cost me that i should be forced to return with him darmin your deceased father designed you for him he had set his heart on that match when you were but a child adine there he was deceived darmin blandford my dear when he is better acquainted with you will do justice to your charms he can never be long attached to a prude who makes it her perpetual study to deceive and impose upon him adine they say she is handsome he is constant in his nature and will always love her darmin constant who is so in love child adine i am afraid of dorfise darmin she has too much intrigue about her her prudery they say has a little too much gallantry in it her     heart is false and her tongue scandalous never fear her my girl deceit can last only for a time adine ay but that time may be long very long the thought makes me miserable dorfise deceives him and dorfise has found the way to please darmin but after all niece has blandford really got so far into your heart adine he has indeed ever since that day when the two algerine vessels attacked us with such violence o how i trembled for him i think verily i was as much frightened for him as for you i wished to be a man indeed that i might have defended him dont you remember uncle it was blandford alone who saved us when our ship was on fire good heaven how i admired his courage and his virtues they are deeply engraved in my heart and never to be effaced darmin a grateful heart cannot but be prejudiced in favor of such distinguished virtue i dont so much wonder at your choice fine eyes a noble demeanor a good shape and scarce thirty years of age these are great recommendations to his—virtue but then his strange humor and austerity can surely never be agreeable to you adine why not i am naturally serious myself and perhaps in him may be fond even of my own faults darmin he hates the world     adine they say he has reason darmin his temper is too easy and complying he relies too much on others and is too generous and then his moroseness makes his freedom disagreeable adine the greatest fault he has in my opinion is his passion for dorfise darmin thats too true why then wont you endeavor to open his eyes disabuse him and shine in your true character adine how is it possible to shine in any character till we are able to please alas from the first day he took us both on board i have been afraid he should discover me and now i am on shore i have still the same apprehensions darmin i had intended to discover you to him myself adine for heavens sake dont but join with me in my design upon him sacrificed as i am to the adored dorfise i would wish to remain still unknown to him and would have him continue a stranger to that victim which he offers up to love darmin what then is your design adine this very night to retire to a convent and avoid     the sight of an ungrateful man whom i cannot help loving darmin indeed niece those who go to a convent in haste generally live to repent it at leisure i tell you child time will do all things in the meanwhile a more dreadful misfortune calls for our attention the very instant that this new dugué so nobly got off his ship both his fortune and mine went to the bottom we are both involved in the same calamity and have come to marseilles full of hope but without a shilling and must therefore look out for some immediate assistance love my dear niece is not always the only thing to be thought of adine there uncle i differ from you when you are in love i think it is darmin time will open your eyes love my dear at your age is blind but not at mine and where there is no fortune and nothing but grief and poverty with it it has very few charms only the rich and happy should be in love adine you think then my dear uncle that now you are in distress you can have no mistress and that your widow burlet will forsake you as soon as she knows your circumstances darmin my distress perhaps may serve her for an excuse such my dear is the custom of the world but i have other cares to afflict me i want money and thats the most pressing calamity     scene ii blandford darmin adine blandford so so in the age we live in everything may be had of everybody but money what a heap of close embraces kisses fulsome compliments false oaths joyous welcomes have i received from this whole city but no sooner were they acquainted with my distress than every soul forsook me such is this world darmin it is indeed a base one but your friends come in search of you blandford friends know you any such i have looked for them and have found a number of scoundrels of every rank and degree i have found honest men too that live in the bosom of indolence and plenty like their own marbles hard polished and always wrapped up in themselves and their own interests but worthy hearts elevated souls who were not the slaves of fortune such as take a generous pleasure in relieving the unhappy these darmin i have seldom very seldom met with there is naught but vice and corruption on every side mammon is the god of this world and i wish with all my heart that all mankind had sunk with our vessel and was buried in the waves darmin be so good as to except me from your general sentence     adine the world i do believe is false and yet i think there is in it still a heart worthy of you a heart that can boast of courage with sensibility and strength with softness which would resent the unkind treatment you have met with by loving you if possible but the more for it tender in its vows and constant in its attachment to you blandford invaluable treasure but where is it to be found adine in me blandford in thee away deceitful boy am i in a condition think you to listen to such idle tales prithee young man choose a fitter time to jest in yes even in this world i know there are pure and uncorrupted hearts who will cherish my misfortune and pity my distress even in this low condition i have the happiness to reflect that dorfise at least knows how to love and to distinguish virtue adine dorfise then is the idol of your heart blandford she is adine you have tried and proved her then blandford i have darmin my late brother before he went to greece if i remember aright designed my niece for you     blandford your late brother my friend made a bad choice then i have made a much better i have determined in favor of that virtue which banished from the world hath taken up its residence in the breast of my dorfise adine merit like hers is rare indeed i am astonished at it but great as it is it cannot equal her happiness blandford this youth is of a noble nature and i love him he takes my part even against you darmin not so much perhaps as you think but pray tell me how happened it that this dorfise with all her attachment and love for you never wrote to you for a whole year blandford would you have had her write to me through the air or the post travel by sea i have received large packets from her before now letters written in such a style too—so much truth so much good sense nothing affected embarrassed or obscure no false wit nothing but the language of nature and the heart such is the effect of real love darmin to adine you turn pale blandford looking earnestly at adine whats the matter with you     adine with me sir o sir i have got a sad pain at my heart blandford to darmin his heart and what a tone too a girl of his age would have more strength and courage i love the lad but am astonished at his effeminacy he was never made for such a voyage hes afraid of the sea the enemy and every wind that blows i caught him one day sitting down to a lookingglass he appears to be cut out for the gay world to sit in a box at a playhouse and admire his fine form which he seems to be mightily enamored with tis a very narcissus darmin he has beauty blandford ay but he should beware of vanity adine you need not fear sir tis not myself that i admire i am more likely to hate myself i assure you i love nothing that resembles me blandford dorfise my friend is after all the mistress of my fate convinced as i have long been of her prudence i gave her a promise of marriage at parting i left everything i had in her possession jewels notes contracts ready money all thank heaven have i frankly trusted to my dear dorfise and her i consigned to the virtue of my friend m bartolin darmin what bartolin the cashier   0 blandford the same a good friend who esteems me and whom i love darmin in an ironical tone to be sure you have made an excellent choice and are extremely happy in a mistress and a friend not at all prejudiced blandford not in the least i am impatient at their absence and long to see them adine aside i can bear it no longer i must go blandford you seem disordered adine everyone has some misfortunes or other mine are heavy indeed they overpower me but they will cease—with blandfords she goes out blandford i know not why but this grief affects me darmin tis an amiable youth and seems wonderfully attached to you blandford blandfords heart is not a bad one and what fortune i have howsoever small it be shall be in common with us both as soon as dorfise returns me the money i left with her your young adine shall     have a part of it i wish his voice was a little more masculine and his air more easy but time and care must form the manners of youth he is modest sensible and has just notions of right and wrong i observed through the whole voyage that he would blush at any indecent expression which my people made use of on board i promise you i shall endeavor to be a father to him darmin thats not what he wants of you but come let us go immediately to dorfise at least we shall get your money of her blandford true but that unlucky demon which always accompanies me has contrived to keep her in the country still darmin well but the cashier— blandford the cashier is there too but they will both come to town as soon as they know i am here darmin you are satisfied then that mme dorfise is always devoted to your service blandford why should she not be if i keep my faith to her surely she may do the same by me i have not been so foolish as like you to throw away my heart on a gay coquette darmin it may happen that i shall find myself despised but that you know every man is liable to i will own     to you her airy trifling humor is very different from that of her wise cousin blandford but what will you do with a heart so— darmin nothing at all i shall hold my tongue till our two fair idols make their appearance at marseilles apropos here comes our friend mondor blandford our friend said you he our friend darmin his head no doubt is a little of the lightest but at the bottom he is a worthy character blandford prithee undeceive thyself dear darmin and be assured that friendship requires a firmer mind than his fools are incapable of love darmin but the wise man does he love so much then come we may reap some advantage from this fool notwithstanding as the case now stands with us there will be no harm in borrowing his money scene iii blandford darmin mondor mondor morrow morrow my dears so you are still in the land of the living im glad of it glad of it with     all my heart good morrow to you but pray who is that pretty boy i saw in tother room whence comes he did he come over with you what is he turk

my life mondor then you never got anything blandford i never asked it i wait till the masters eye in its own time shall find me out mondor yes and these fine sentiments will carry you as they do everybody else at their own time to jail darmin we are pretty near it already for our honor and glory has not left us a shilling mondor i am inclined to think so     darmin dear knight let us fairly confess to you— mondor in two words i must inform you— darmin that our friend here has had a terrible loss— mondor that i have made my dear a discovery— darmin of all his fortune— mondor of a famous beauty— darmin which he was carrying— mondor to whom without vanity— darmin by sea— mondor after a good deal of mysterious conduct— darmin in his ship— mondor i have the happiness to be well with darmin this sir is a misfortune—     mondor o tis a most enchanting pleasure to conquer these excessive scruples to get the better of that modesty that fierce angry preceptor who is always thwarting and scolding at nature i had once an inclination for lady burlet for her gayety and those pretty light airs she gives herself but that was a foolish taste as foolish as herself darmin im glad to hear it mondor o no tis the prude i dote on encouraged by the difficulty i presented my apple to the beauty darmin ay sir this prude who has captivated your heart this proud beauty is— mondor dorfise blandford laughing dorfise is it o you know i suppose whom you are speaking to mondor to you my friend blandford i pity thy folly young man and shall take care that for the future this lady shall never encourage such sparks as you mondor very well my dear but let me tell you—your wise woman never complains when she is taken by a fool     blandford be so kind however my friend as to play the fool no longer with her for know her virtues are destined to make me happy she is mine and has promised to marry me she waits with impatience till we are united mondor laughing the pretty note that my friend blandford has there to darmin you say he wants a few more in his distress here darmin he is going to give him a pocketbook blandford stopping darmin stay take care darmin darmin why you would not— blandford from him i would not—receive anything when i do any man the favor to borrow of him it shall be one whom i think worthy of it it shall be a friend mondor and am not i your friend blandford no sir a friend indeed an excellent friend who wants to run away with my wife a friend who this very night perhaps would entertain twenty coxcombs at my expense o i know them well these fashionable friends these friends of the world     mondor that world sir which you grumble at is better than all your illhumor your servant sir i am going this moment to the fair dorfise to split my sides with laughing at your folly is going off blandford stopping him what say you sir darmin how is this can dorfise be here mondor most assuredly blandford o heaven mondor and pray what is there in that so wonderful blandford in her own house mondor yes i tell you at marseilles i met her just as i came in returning in a violent hurry from the country blandford aside to meet me thank heaven now all my sorrows are past come ill go and see her mondor done with all my heart the more fools there are the more one laughs blandford going to the door ill rap     mondor rap away collette in the house whos there blandford tis i mondor tis i myself scene iv blandford darmin collette mondor collette coming out of the house blandford darmin amazing lord sir— blandford collette collette bless me sir i thought you had been drowned long ago youre welcome sir blandford no collette just heaven propitious to my love preserved me that i might once more see thy dear mistress collette she is this moment gone out sir darmin and her cousin too collette yes sir her cousin has gone along with her     blandford but where for heavens sake is she gone where must i find her collette making a prudish curtsy at the—assembly blandford what assembly collette lord sir you are mighty ignorant you must know sir there are about twenty ladies of fashion most intimately connected to reform the age to correct our foolish young women to substitute in the room of that scandal which now prevails a prudent modesty and reserve and mme dorfise is at the head of the party blandford to darmin but how happens it darmin that such a coxcomb as this should be suffered by so rigid so severe a beauty darmin o prudes love coxcombs blandford where does she go from the assembly collette that i cant tell to do good in secret i suppose blandford secretly thats the height of virtue but when may i in my turn speak with her at home   0 mondor that sir you must ask me and i believe i may venture to grant it you you may see her sir as you used to do blandford your business sir is to respect her and take care that you say nothing to her prejudice darmin and her cousin too pray where is she to be found i was told they lived together collette they do so but their tastes are different and they are seldom together mme de burlet with ten or a dozen young fellows and as many pretty women entertains herself every day keeps a plentiful table and goes forever to the comedy afterwards they dance or play always at her house you will meet with good suppers new songs and bonsmots old wines red and white icecream liquors new ribbons saxon monkeys rich bagatelles invented by hebert for the use of the fine ladies day and night pleasures succeeding pleasures scarce is there a moment left even to scandalize one another mondor ay this my friend is the way to live darmin but whither must i follow her collette everywhere for she runs about from morning to night and sees everything plays balls music     suppers she is always employed perhaps very late in the evening you may meet with her and her joyous companions at home about suppertime blandford if after what i have heard you are fond of her my friend you must have as little understanding as herself is it possible to love a woman who has all the follies of her sex put together to be sure it will be worth your while to follow her chariot wheels to dance after a coquette and sigh and whine for a ridiculous creature who thinks of nothing but her pleasures darmin i may be mistaken but i cannot help thinking that a love of pleasure and the strictest honor may be consistent with each other and i am likewise of opinion with all due deference to you be it spoken that a prude with all her severity of virtue may do a great deal of good in public and yet in secret is often good for—just nothing blandford well well we shall be better judges by and by you shall see my choice and i yours mondor ay ay by the time you return my dears the place will be taken blandford by whom pray mondor by me blandford by you     mondor i have made too good use of your absence to be afraid of your presence i assure you so fare you well scene v blandford darmin blandford well what think you can one be jealous of such a creature darmin o fools have fortune you know nothing more common blandford you can never imagine surely— darmin o yes your sensible women are very fond of fools at times but i must take my leave to know my own fate and see whether i am a happy or a forsaken lover he goes out blandford alone ay ay make haste and get your dismissal poor fellow i pity him how happy am i to have made choice of a woman worthy of my esteem unfortunate as i have been i have reason to bless the hour of my return reason increases my passion yes i am resolved i will leave the world the whole ungrateful world for one good and worthy woman i have had enough of hopes and fears the port at     length appears and there will i shelter myself what is all the world to this a foolish ridiculous fatal world ought i not to detest it there is not a friend remaining in it not a creature who at the bottom really cares a farthing for one o tis a vile world if there is any love or affection to be expected it must be from a wife all the difficulty is how to choose one a coquette is a monster one would avoid but a beautiful a tender and a sensible woman is the noblest work of nature end of the first act act ii scene i dorfise mme de burlet mondor dorfise i must beg of you m mondor not to indulge yourself in this excessive familiarity it is impossible for ears so chaste as mine to suffer such liberties mondor laughing and yet you like them you rate me for my impertinence but you listen to it why my dear your hair is cut short on purpose that you may hear the better dorfise again mme de burlet indeed i shall take his part you are too rigid and affect too much severity liberty is not always licentiousness there is nothing indecent in my opinion     in little sallies of innocent mirth and gayety which we may choose whether we will understand or not but your outrageous virtue would shut up our mouths and our ears together dorfise i would indeed cousin and moreover i would advise you to shut your doors too against some visitors whom i frequently see here i have told you often enough cousin it will ruin your reputation how can you suffer such a libertine crew cleon that pretty fellow who is very brilliant without a spark of wit and is always laughing at the good things he would make you believe he has just said damon who for twenty beauties that he is in love with makes twenty madrigals as insipid as himself and that robin who is always talking of himself with the old pedant that makes every creature sick of him then theres my cousin too that— mondor enough enough madam let everybody speak in his turn and since your ladyship shows so much good nature in speaking of the world i will endeavor to convince you i have at least as much charity as yourself and propose giving you in three words a picture of the whole city to begin then with— dorfise stop thy licentious tongue none should dare to chastise vice but persons of the strictest virtue i cannot bear to hear libertines satirizing others who are much less culpable than themselves for my part what i say is from my regard to the honor of human nature and disgust of the world this vile world how i do hate it     mme de burlet for all that cousin it has some attractions dorfise for you i believe it has and to your ruin mme de burlet and has it none for you cousin do you really hate the world dorfise horribly mme de burlet and all the pleasures of it dorfise abominably mme de burlet plays balls mondor music dancing— dorfise o my dear they are all the devils inventions mme de burlet but dress and finery you must acknowledge— dorfise all vanity o how i regret every minute thrown away at my toilette i hate to look at myself and of all things in nature detest a lookingglass mme de burlet and yet my dear rigid cousin you seem tolerably well dressed     dorfise do i mondor extremely well dorfise plain very plain mondor but with taste mme de burlet you may say what you please but your wise ladyship loves to please dorfise i love to please o heaven mme de burlet come come be honest have you not some small inclination to this young rattle hes not ill made pointing to mondor mondor o fie mme de burlet young rich and handsome mondor pooh prithee dorfise o abominable a handsome young man is my aversion handsome and young o fie fie mondor upon my soul

had been cured of all his faults to tell you the truth i imagined he was dead long ago mondor no madam he is alive i assure you the pirate intends to sink me at once he pretends to be a favorite of yours dorfise aside to collette o collette collette o madam dorfise to mondor dear sir cant you find out some means of sending him to sea again mondor o yes with all my heart     mme de burlet pray sir is there any news of his intimate friend and confidant darmin has he arrived mondor he has madam the captain it seems fell in with him at some port or other they have had a battle at sea and now are returned home without a stiver blandford has brought with him a little greek too the handsomest genteelest— dorfise o yes i believe i saw him just by my house large black eyes mondor the same dorfise penetrating yet full of softness rosy cheeks mondor he has so dorfise fine hair and teeth something in his air thats noble and fine mondor the very paragon of nature dorfise if his morals are good if he is wellborn and discreet ill see him you shall bring him to me—though he is young mme de burlet i must find out darmins lodging as soon as possible here la fleur go this minute and carry him     these five hundred pounds she gives a purse to la fleur and tell him i expect blandford and him to supper with me our friends have long wished for his return and none more than myself never did i know a better creature more honest or ingenuous i admire above all things his amiable complacency and those social virtues that so strongly recommend him dorfise blandford is not of his disposition he is so serious mondor so full of spleen dorfise true and so jealous mondor so affronting dorfise he is— mondor very true dorfise let me speak sir i say he is— mondor yes madam i attend to you—he is— dorfise he is in short a dangerous man mme de burlet they tell me he has fought nobly for his king and country and distinguished himself greatly at sea   0 dorfise that may be cousin but by land he is dreadfully troublesome mondor and besides he is— dorfise true mondor o those sailors have all of them such horrid principles dorfise they have so mme de burlet but i have heard cousin that you formerly gave him some hopes— dorfise yes but since that i have taken an antipathy to the whole world and quitted it i began with him twas he and the world together that have made me so fearful scene ii dorfise mme de burlet mondor collette collette madam dorfise well collette m blandford has come     dorfise o heaven mme de burlet is darmin with him collette yes madam mme de burlet i am heartily glad of it dorfise and im heartily sorry i must retire i would fly from the whole world mondor with me i hope dorfise no sir if you please without you she goes out scene iii mme de

train of triflers go and pretend to pleasures which you never enjoy go and be weary of one another as soon as you can you and i turning to adine will go in search of dorfise scene iv blandford adine collette blandford then we shall see a woman indeed a woman submitting to every duty of life a woman who for me has renounced the whole world and who to her faithful passion joins the most scrupulous and rigid virtue i hope you will endeavor to recommend yourself to her adine of that sir you may assure yourself i shall try to imitate her virtues her example may be the best instruction to me blandford im glad to hear you think so ill introduce you to her from this time forward i shall look upon you adine as a son whom fortune has thrown in my way to make amends for all her past unkindness it is impossible to know without loving thee     your disposition is only too pliant and flexible nothing therefore can be of more service to you than to keep company with a prudent and discreet woman whose acquaintance will improve the goodness of your heart and confirm you in your honesty and love of justice without depriving you at the same time of that sweetness and complacency which i own i find myself deficient in a woman of sense and beauty who has nothing trifling or ridiculous in her is an excellent school for a young fellow at your time of life it will form your mind and direct your heart her house is the temple of honor adine the sooner we visit it then the better but her example is so uncommon i fear i shall never be able to follow it blandford why not adine because i like yours better there is something in your virtue though the external appearance has too much severity in it that charms me it must i am sure be good at the bottom you have always been my favorite but for dorfise— blandford going towards the door of dorfises house you must not indeed flatter yourself that you can at once be able to imitate her but in time you may however let me advise you to see dorfise and to avoid her cousin he is going in collette comes out stops him and shuts the door he knocks at it     collette you must not go in sir blandford not i collette no sir blandford hows this blandford refused admittance collette my mistress sir is retired to her apartment and would be private blandford i admire her delicacy but i must go in collette pray hear me sir blandford not i i will go in and this minute too he goes in collette stay sir adine ill follow him and see the event of this strange interview scene v collette alone now will he see her and discover all im frightened to death about it twill be all over now with     my poor mistress what a foolish woman to stipulate this secret marriage and give herself to such a fellow as bartolin what will the malicious world say well women are strange creatures thats the truth of it nay and so are the men too what excessive weakness to be sure my mistress is a fool she deceives herself and everybody else and half her time is employed in finding out artifices to hide her indiscretion and repair her reputation she follows her inclination and then has recourse to intrigue and management and yet she takes no care of the main point this is a cursed adventure for us and a most unfortunate return how will blandford take the injury she has done him here have we no less than three husbands in the house two of them promised and the other i believe absolutely taken a woman in such a case must be a little hampered scene vi dorfise collette collette o madam whats to be done dorfise fear nothing there are ways and means to dazzle peoples eyes to delay and put off matters men are easily managed their weakness is our strength and helps our designs against them i have got myself out of the worst scrape our disagreeable interview is over—and i have sent the good man—god speed him—into the country to his old crony bartolin who may lend him some money at least i shall gain time by it and thats enough     collette but surely madam the deuce was in you to sign that plagued contract what had you to do with bartolin dorfise the devil my dear is full of spite thats certain that fellow persecuted me so but we tempt and are tempted and the heart easily surrenders you know we heard that blandford would never come back again collette that he was dead dorfise i was left without any support money or friends and weak withal all owing to the weakness of my sex collette but our stars will prevail tis often the lot of a beauty to marry a scab my heart was severely attacked collette there are certain seasons very dangerous to a prude but if you must sacrifice to love you should have taken the chevalier he is handsome dorfise o but i wanted a bit of intrigue and mystery besides i am not fond of his character but he is useful to me he is my puffer my emissary hes a prateapace you know and can scatter reports about town for me that may be serviceable collette but bartolin is such a villain dorfise yes but—     collette and for his wit im sure there are no charms in that dorfise no but— collette but what dorfise fate whim caprice my unhappy circumstances a little avarice withal and then opportunity—in short i surrendered played the fool and signed the contract i kept you know blandfords strong box and after he was gone gave away a little of his money for him—out of charity who would ever have thought that after two years he should be constant to his old flame and come back again to look for his wife and his strong box collette everybody here said he was dead and now he is not the fellows a fool and stands in his own light dorfise resuming the prude well since the mans alive i must give him his jewels back let him take them but bartolin has got them to keep for me he fancies they are mine holds them fast and is fond of them and as jealous as he is of me collette so i suppose dorfise husbands jewels virtue and character how to reconcile you all heaven knows     scene vii mondor adine dorfise mondor i must drive away this powerful rival who gives himself such airs and despises me positively must adine coming in slowly whats this ill listen a little mondor in short i must make myself happy and punish his insolence tis you tis dorfise alone whom i adore let old darmin enjoy his little coquette they are not worth our notice but blandford the severe and virtuous blandford there i own i could wish to triumph he thinks you can refuse him nothing because he is a man of honor and virtue now to me these are the most disagreeable creatures in the universe indeed my queen youll soon be heartily tired of him dorfise prudishly after looking steadfastly at adine you are mistaken sir i have the highest respect and esteem for m blandford mondor there are those madam whom one may esteem and yet laugh at and make fools of is it not so adine aside amazing she is constant and virtuous doubtless she loves him i am confounded who would have thought it     dorfise what is he talking of adine aside dorfise is faithful and to complete my misery she is handsome dorfise to mondor after looking tenderly at adine he says i am handsome mondor there hes right but he begins to be troublesome harkee child i have something to say to this lady in private adine i will retire sir dorfise to mondor i say sir you are greatly mistaken to adine stay you here my dear to mondor how dare you sir send him away to adine come hither child hes almost ready to weep the sweet boy he shall stay with me blandford brought him to me and from the first moment i took a fancy to him i like his disposition mondor o let his disposition alone for heavens sake and attend to me this blandford madam i know you hate him you have often told me he is brutal jealous—  00 dorfise angrily never sir to adine what age are you adine eighteen madam dorfise such tender youth as thine requires the curb of wisdom to guide and direct it vice is bewitching temptations frequent and example dangerous a single glance may be your ruin be upon your guard against women nay and against yourself and dread the poisonous blast that withers the sweet flower of virtue mondor prithee dorfise let the boys flower alone what is it to you whether it be withered or not mind me my dear dorfise my god his innocence is so engaging mondor tis a mere child dorfise coming up to adine whats your name my dear and whence come you adine my name madam is adine i was born in greece m blandford brought me over with darmin dorfise twas kindly done of him  0  mondor what a ridiculous curiosity here i am making strong love to you and you all the while talking to a child dorfise softly be quiet you blockhead scene viii dorfise mondor adine collette collette madam dorfise well collette they wait for you at the assembly dorfise well i shall be there presently mondor hang your engagement i tell you what my dear you and i will put an end to these prudish meetings these conspiracies against love taste and gayety upon my word child it does not become a beautiful young creature as you are to go about declaring against everything thats joyous amongst a parcel of toothless old beldames that meet together in their gloomy vaults to weep over the pleasures of the living but ill go and rout these immortal tattlers and stop their clack with a hundred bonmots  0  dorfise for heavens sake dont go and expose me there i desire you positively you shall not mondor positively i will this minute and tell them you are coming he goes out dorfise the wild creature to adine avoid my dear whatever you do such fools as these be prudent and discreet make my compliments to blandford—what a piercing eye adine turning back did you speak madam dorfise that sweet complexion that ingenuous look so charming so modest—i hope i shall have the pleasure of seeing you often adine i shall pay my respects madam with the greatest pleasure madam your servant dorfise adieu my dear child adine i dont know what to think of it i cant discover whether she deceives him or not all i know is i love him  0  scene ix dorfise collette dorfise looking after adine what said he i love love whom perhaps the boy has fallen in love with me he talks to himself stops and looks at me i have certainly turned his brain collette he ogles you most wonderfully and looks with such tenderness dorfise is that my fault collette how can i possibly help it collette very true madam but danger approaches i am terribly afraid of this blandfords coming back again and dread still more the savage resentment of bartolin dorfise sighing this young turks mighty handsome do you think he is a turk that an infidel can have such softness in his manner so fine a figure i fancy i could convert him collette ill tell you what i fancy that when it is discovered you are married to bartolin your reputation will be severely handled blandford will storm  0  dreadfully and your little turk will be of no great service to you dorfise never do you fear collette i have long madam relied on your prudence but bartolin is a jealous brute and whats worse he is—your husband tis really a melancholy case and indeed rather singular the two rivals i am afraid will be very intractable dorfise o i can avoid them both peace is the object of my wishes it is my duty and my interest to foresee and prevent the ill consequences of a discovery i have friends men of merit and fortune collette take their advice dorfise i intend to immediately collette but whose dorfise why let me see—suppose i ask this stranger—this little— collette ask his advice the advice of a beardless boy dorfise he seems to be very sensible and if he is why not consult him let me tell you young people are the best counsellors in things of this kind he might  0  throw some light on my affairs besides he is blandfords friend and i must talk with him collette o to be sure madam tis quite necessary dorfise and as one talks over such things better at table it would not be amiss to ask him to dinner what think you collette softly there madam excuse me but you who are so afraid of scandal— dorfise i am afraid of nothing i know what i am about when once a reputation is established we may be perfectly easy about it all the party will defend us and cry out on our side collette ay but the world will talk madam dorfise well for once well submit to the wicked world ill give up this innocent dinner and not sharpen their malicious tongues ill talk no more with adine never see him again and yet after all what could they say of a child but to chastity and virtue i will add the appearance of them also will observe decency and decorum ill do it in my cousins name and beg her— collette an excellent contrivance a woman of the world has no reputation to lose one may put her name to  0  ten billetsdoux she may have as many lovers as many assignations as she pleases nobodys offended nobody blushes nobodys surprised but if perchance a lady of honor makes a false step it must be carefully concealed dorfise a false step i make a false step thank heaven i have nothing to reproach myself with to be sure i have signed but i am not yet absolute mme bartolin he has a claim and thats all and perhaps i may find a method to get rid of my master i have an excellent design in my head if this handsome turk has any inclination to me i am satisfied everything will go well i am yet mistress of myself and can terminate all happily go you and ask him to dinner is there any harm in having an agreeable young fellow at ones table and one that can give good advice too collette o excellent advice nothing can be more proper let us immediately set about this charitable work end of the second act act iii scene i dorfise collette dorfise is it not he how uneasy i am hark somebody knocks hes come collette hullo collette tis he  0  collette no madam tis the chevalier that impertinent coxcomb who runs in and out skips laughs prates and flutters about perpetually he swears he will have a têteàtête with you and at last between jest and earnest i have driven him away dorfise o send him to my cousin i hate their insipid parties their ridiculous prating and nonsense dear collette preserve me from them collette hush hush i hear somebody coming dorfise o tis my sweet greek collette tis he i believe scene ii dorfise adine dorfise pray come in good morrow to you sir how i tremble pray sir be seated adine im quite confounded—i beg pardon madam i believe another— dorfise be not alarmed sir i am that other my cousin dines abroad today with blandford you must supply his place and stay with me  0  adine supply his place madam who can do that what passion can equal his or who can exceed him in virtue honor and nobleness of soul dorfise you talk of him with warmth your friendship has life and spirit in it i admire you for it adine tis a sincere regard but an unhappy one dorfise tenderness is to the last degree becoming in youth like thine virtue is nothing if it is not linked by the sacred bonds of friendship adine alas if a natural sensibility is the infallible mark of virtue without vanity i may boast some degree of worth and honesty dorfise a soul so noble deserves to be cultivated and improved perhaps i was born to be the happy instrument many a woman has long wished in vain to find a tender friend lively yet discreet who possessed all the graces of youth without its flighty extravagance and if i am not deceived in thee all those qualities are united indeed they are what lucky star conducted thee to marseilles adine i was in greece and the brave blandford brought me from thence i have told you so twice already  0  dorfise suppose you have i could hear it again and again but tell me why is that fair forehead wrapped up in a turban are you really a turk adine greece is my country dorfise who would have thought it is greece in turkey then o how i should like to talk greek with you why you have all the sprightliness all the natural ease of a true frenchman surely nature mistook when she made you a greek well i bless providence for throwing you thus amongst us adine here i am to my sorrow dorfise and canst thou be unhappy adine indeed i am so but tis the fault of my own heart dorfise ay tis the heart that does all the good and all the evil in this world tis that which makes us both miserable have you any engagement then adine i have indeed a base intriguing woman has betrayed me her heart like her face is painted and disguised she is bold haughty and full of artifice more dangerous because she hides her vices beneath the mask of virtue how cruel is it that so false a heart should govern one who is but too honest   0 dorfise some faithless woman let us be revenged on her who is she of what rank what country what is her name adine that i must not tell you dorfise why so i fear you have art too the art of concealment o you have every talent to please and to delight young and discreet beautiful and sensible but i will explain myself if to make you amends for all the injuries you have received you should meet with a woman rich amiable admired and esteemed one who had a heart constant firm and hitherto untouched such as is seldom to be met with in turkey and more seldom perhaps in this country if such a one could be found tell me sweet youth what think you what would you say to her adine i would say—she meant but to deceive me dorfise nay that would be carrying your distrust too far come come be more confident adine forgive me madam but the unfortunate you know are always a little suspicious dorfise and what for example may your suspicions be whilst i am talking to and looking at you adine my suspicions are that you mean to try me     dorfise o the malicious little rogue how cunning he is with that air of innocence tis love himself just out of his childhood get you gone i am in absolute danger positively ill see you no more adine since tis your order madam i take my leave dorfise but you need not be in such a hurry to obey come back come back i esteem you too much to be angry with you but dont abuse my esteem my sincere regard adine but you esteem blandford can one esteem two at the same time dorfise o no never the laws of reason and of love allow succession but not division youll learn a great deal by living with me child adine i have learned a great deal by what i see already dorfise when heaven my dear makes a fine woman it always at the same time forms a man on purpose for her we go in search of each other for a long time and make twenty choices before we fix on the right we are always looking as it were for our counterpart and seldom very seldom meet with it—by a secret instinct we fly after true happiness and she looking tenderly at him who finds you need look no further     adine if you knew what i really am you would soon change your opinion of me dorfise never adine if once you knew me im sure you would think me unworthy of your care we should both be caught in the same snare dorfise caught my dear what can you mean were interrupted o tis you collette scene iii collette dorfise adine collette in a violent flurry ay madam i could not help it but theres a more impertinent visitor still coming m bartolin dorfise indeed i did not expect him till tomorrow the villain has deceived me returned already collette ay madam and heres another unlucky accident the chevalier that king of coxcombs not knowing the master of the house is disputing with him in the street and keeps him there in spite of his teeth     dorfise so much the better collette no madam so much the worse for this blunderer not knowing whom he is talking to laughs in his face insists upon it that nobody shall come in here today that everybody shall be excluded as well as himself that hes an impertinent rascal and that you were engaged in your own apartment in a sober têteàtête with a pretty young fellow bartolin swears in wrath that hell break the door down mondor splits his sides with laughing and the other bursts with spleen dorfise and i in the meantime am dying with fear o collette what shall i do at what hole shall we creep out adine what can this mystery be dorfise the mystery is that we are both undone collette where are you going adine what will become of me dorfise to collette harkee stay what a time was this for him to return to adine you must hide yourself for tonight in this closet youll find a black sack there wrap yourself up in it and be quiet my god it is he thats certain     adine going into the closet o love what do i suffer for thee dorfise poor lad hes desperately fond of me collette hush hush here he comes your dear spouse scene iv bartolin dorfise collette dorfise meeting bartolin my dear sir heaven be with you how late you are you made me so uneasy i was ready to die with fretting bartolin mondor told me quite another story dorfise its all a lie every syllable he says a horrid lie i think i ought to be believed first you know im sincere the fellow loves me to madness and is piqued at my refusal of him his eternal clack teases me to death i will positively never see him again bartolin he seemed to me to talk rationally enough dorfise dont believe a word he says     bartolin well well i shant mind him i only came to finish our affairs and to take some necessaries here out of the closet dorfise in a persuasive tone what are you doing there now come dont go into a bodys closet bartolin why not dorfise after pausing a little why do you know i had the same thought as you and have just been putting my papers in order there so i sent for our old advocate and we were consulting together when he was taken with a sudden weakness bartolin o nothing but old age hes very old collette and so sir they took him in there to give him bartolin ay i understand you dorfise hes retired a little and has taken a dose of my syrup i suppose by this time he has gone to sleep bartolin that he has not i am sure for i hear him walking about and coughing     collette and would you go to disturb an advocate in the midst of his cough bartolin i dont like this ill go in dorfise grant heaven he may find nothing there hark what do i hear he cries out murder my poor advocates killed to be sure and i am undone which way shall i fly in what convent shall i hide my shame where shall i drown myself bartolin returning and holding adine by the arm o ho my dear spouse that is to be your advocates are mighty pretty figures you have made a good choice picked him out from the whole bar come my old practitioner you must disappear from this court and harangue out the window away with you dorfise my dear husband do but hear me adine he her husband bartolin to adine come rascal i must begin my revenge upon you and curry you out of your insolence

scoundrel a dangerous rival and shall be punished come along sir adine help here help for heavens sake sir dorfise hes mad with passion help neighbors help bartolin hold your tongue dorfise collette adine help here help bartolin thrusting out adine come sir get out of my house scene v dorfise collette dorfise what an unfortunate affair this is hell kill the poor boy and me too perhaps collette to be sure nothing but the devil could make you sign a contract with such a wretch as this     dorfise the villain go collette this minute to a justice and get a warrant for him charge him with— collette with what madam dorfise with everything collette very well madam but which way are you going dorfise that i know not scene vi mme de burlet dorfise collette mme de burlet why cousin cousin whats the

ashamed and sorry i conceived such suspicions but appearances were strong against her how indeed could i ever     have imagined that this young fellow for so i thought him was only a girl in disguise dorfise aside an excellent comeoff mme de burlet mighty well indeed so my lady here took a girl for a boy bartolin the poor child is in tears still by my troth i pitied her but why could you not have told me who she was why take a pleasure in trying my temper and making me angry dorfise aside droll enough this he has played his part well however to persuade bartolin he is a girl and get off so

really believe that a young fellow was locked up in my closet mme de burlet indeed but i do my dear dorfise what when my husband told you to the contrary mme de burlet perhaps your spouse might be mistaken he may have bad eyes besides cousin did you not tell me yourself here in this very place that a young fellow— dorfise ridiculous what i child i tell you so never do you think i have lost my senses indeed cousin     you should take more care what you say when once a womans tongue has got a habit of talking thus lightly and spreading scandalous stories invented merely to calumniate and

and my character are gone the libertines will laugh at my expense dorfise will be the common butt of every satirist my name will be hitched into a hundred rhymes and furnish matter for every singsong in town blandford will believe the scandal and bartolin will cry for vengeance how shall i stop the tongues of calumny two husbands and a lover in one day what a deal one has to go through to be a prude would it not be better after all to fear nothing to affect nothing and be a plain woman of honor well one day or other ill try to be one collette at least madam let us take care to appear as such when we do all we can you know we have done enough and she is not always a woman of virtue who wishes to be so end of the third act act iv scene i dorfise collette dorfise o collette im inevitably ruined would i could see young adine he is so kind and so sensible he     would tell me everything they do and say and i might take my measures with him accordingly my affairs would at least be more settled and i should know what i have to depend on what shall i do collette collette see him and talk to him freely dorfise right towards evening o collette if success would but crown this mysterious affair if i could preserve my reputation and keep my lover if i could but keep one of them i should be happy collette ay ay one of them is enough in conscience dorfise but have you taken care the chevalier shall be here presently that he shall come privately and according to custom let everybody know it collette o never fear hell be here i warrant you hes always ready and fancies youve a passion for him dorfise he may be of service wise men in their designs the better to compass their ends always make use of fools     scene ii dorfise mondor collette dorfise my dear chevalier come along i have something to say to you mondor you know madam i am the lowest of your subjects your humble slave your chevalier what must i do tilt for you fight for you die for you spite of all your cruelty i am ready speak madam and it is done dorfise and am i indeed so happy as to have charmed the agreeable mondor but do you love me as you ought to love me with that pure and refined passion mondor i do but prithee my dear dont be so formal beauty is most engaging when it is easy and tractable the excess of virtue is disgusting in short my dear you want a little of my correction dorfise what think you of young adine mondor who i nothing at all his figure makes me perfectly easy i assure you mars and hercules were never jealous of adonis dorfise well i love your confidence and shall reward it the malicious world perhaps will tell you i am secretly     engaged but tis false believe them not a hundred lovers have ogled and teased me but i was born to be subdued by you and you alone mondor thats more indeed than i could flatter myself with the hopes of dorfise to convince you of it i promise to marry you as soon as ever you please be prudent and be happy mondor happiness is enough for me prudence well leave to another opportunity but do not my dear charmer delay it time you know is precious dorfise but then one thing i must insist on from you mondor i am your husband madam and you may command me dorfise you must take care that none of my troublesome visitors intrude on me tonight the proud peevish blandford my cousin and her fool darmin with all their train of impertinent relations must go somewhere else for i positively will not be disturbed by them then chevalier at midnight and not before ill meet you in the arbor bring your lawyer with you and well sign and seal mondor transporting thought how i shall triumph over that fool blandford well i will so laugh at so ridicule the poor creature     dorfise be sure you dont forget to be at my window a little before midnight away be discreet mondor o if blandford did but know this dorfise away begone or we shall be surprised mondor adieu my dear wife dorfise adieu mondor i go with rapture to wait for the dear happy hour when prudery shall be sacrificed to love scene iii dorfise collette collette well if i can guess at your design hang me tis a riddle to me dorfise ill explain it to you ive made mondor promise to tell nothing but i know very well hell tell all thats enough his tale will justify me blandford will think everything mere calumny and not know a word of the truth today at least i shall be safe and after tomorrow if success crowns my designs i shall be afraid of nobody   0 collette delightful im glad to hear you say so and yet you put me in a horrid fright are you sure maam the plan is well laid and that you wont after all fall into the snare yourself which you laid for others for heavens sake take care what you do dorfise o collette collette how strangely one slip brings on another we are led aside from error to error and from crime to crime till our heads turn round and we fall down the precipice but i have one string still to my bow i am sure of young adine the chevalier comes at twelve but my little lover will be beforehand with him let him be here at nine collette do you hear me collette ill take care of that madam dorfise they take him for a girl by his air his voice and his beardless chin therefore tell him i would have him dress himself in girls clothes collette an excellent scheme heaven prosper it dorfise the boy may serve you know to dispel ones melancholy but the great point i would bring about is to throw all the scandal upon my cousin and to make blandford believe that adine came here upon her account let him fall a dupe to his own credulity     collette the fittest instrument you could have chosen for he believes everything thats bad of her and everything thats good of you imagines he sees clearly and at the same time is stark blind i have taken care already to confirm him in the opinion that our little coquette is in love with the boy and not you dorfise to be sure lies are bad things but they are mighty serviceable sometimes and do a great deal of good scene iv blandford dorfise blandford o tempora o mores dreadful corruption indeed to desire him to visit her the poor simple ingenuous youth she wants to draw him into a passion for her and employs all the little subtleties all the snares which love makes use of to catch unwary hearts dorfise well but after all m blandford she may not have carried it so far as we imagine i would not do her so much injury as to suppose it one should not think evil of ones neighbor to be sure things were in a fair way but you know our french coquettes blandford yes yes i know them     dorfise the moment a young man appears with an air of innocence and simplicity they are after him blandford yes yes vice above all things is fond of seducing virtue but how dorfise can you bear people of such character dorfise as patiently as i can sir but this is not all blandford why what pray— dorfise o sir you have another tale to hear do you know these excellent contrivers would endeavor to persuade the world truly that the young fellow was brought in for me blandford for you dorfise yes they say i wanted to seduce him blandford well that to be sure is ridiculous to the last degree for you dorfise ay for me and that this pretty youth— blandford that was really a fine invention dorfise a better than they think for they have played     me a great many such tricks o m blandford if you knew what i suffer theyll tell you too im to be married to that fool mondor and this very night blandford o my dear dorfise the more thou art wounded by the envenomed darts of slander and calumny with the warmer zeal shall this heart that adores thee defend thy injured and unspotted virtue dorfise you are deceived indeed you are blandford no dorfise i think i know myself a little and i would have laid my life on it i saw your cousin ogling adine this very day let me tell you it requires sense and understanding to be honest i never knew a fool with a good heart virtue itself is nothing but good sense i am sorry for darmin because i really love and esteem him it was against my advice he ventured to embark in such a leaky vessel scene v blandford dorfise darmin mme de burlet mme de burlet what

certainly mme de burlet and twas i that put him in the closet blandford it was the thing was clear enough mme de burlet o mighty well a lucky thought indeed i admire the contrivance o my dear madman

interest at heart i am angry and i have reason to be so in short you must quit this artful woman get out of the snare she has laid for you despise her or break with me darmin the alternative is a cruel one i own to thee i love my friend and i love my mistress but how can thy hard heart judge so uncharitably of all human kind cant you see that this web of perfidy is woven by a base designing woman that she deceives you and would lay the shame and ignominy on another blandford dost thou not see fool as thou art that a vile scandalous abandoned wretch has chosen thee for her tool her butt her stalking horse that like an idiot you bite at the hook and that she is only trying to see how far she can exercise her tyranny over your easy heart     darmin easy as it is let me entreat you ask the only witness who is able to determine it i have sent for young adine he will tell you the whole truth of the affair blandford o yes i doubt not but the jade has tutored her young parrot well and

dorfise to draw me off to your niece whose charms you have so often boasted but you need not give yourself the trouble for i shall never think of her darmin as you please for that but indeed blandford i pity your folly to experience the falsehood of a perfidious woman may perhaps be many a poor mans fate and must be borne but really to lose ones money is a serious affair this bartolin this noble friend of yours has he refunded blandford what business is that of yours darmin i beg pardon i thought it was but i am mistaken here comes adine ill retire let me inform you if you distrust him you

resolutely bent to lead me by the nose dorfise thank heaven is of another nature she says nothing but submits to her unhappy fate without appearing too deeply affected by it too confident or too timid she avoids me and hides herself in retirement such is always the behavior of injured innocence now young man tell me the truth in every particular with sincerity nature seems in you pure and uncorrupted you know i love you do not abuse my growing inclination to you but consider that the happiness of my life is concerned in this affair adine indeed sir i love you too well to abuse or to

she grew loud and vehement when on a sudden a violent knocking was heard and who should come in but her husband blandford her husband o very well what a ridiculous story the chevalier i suppose     adine no a real husband i assure you for he was extremely brutal and extremely jealous he threatened to murder her called her false perfidious infamous and abandoned i expected to have been killed too for he was in a dreadful rage with me though for what reason i know not i was forced to fall on my knees and entreat him to spare my life im sure i tremble yet at the thoughts of him blandford the little coward but this husband what was his name adine i dont know indeed blandford a fine trick this—what sort of a man was he describe him to me adine he seemed to me as far as the horrid fright i was in permitted me to observe him a fellow of a very disagreeable aspect fat and short like a turnspit flatnosed with a large chin hunchbacked a yellowtanned complexion gray eyebrows and an eye that looked like—the devil blandford an excellent picture how can i recollect him by all this yellow you say tanned gray short and fat who can it be but you only mean i see to laugh at me adine try then

farthing about it aside this boy has not learned half his lesson harkee sir to adine this appointment and yours are a little incompatible what say you to this sir does it strike you either you endeavor to deceive me or are deceived yourself but you are young in the school of vice a heart like thine simple and inexperienced is an excellent instrument in the hands of a villain alas thou

always admired your discretion you must know then the fighting m blandford a hero at sea but an arrant blockhead at home when he left marseilles to go after the pirates most cordially and most

recover them and assist blandford the poor man is honest and should live away let us part immediately and take care nobody follows us adine but what will the world say dorfise o never heed it i was

down to preserve me the half of all i have will be but a poor reward for thy care and fidelity adine you must not know at present what reward i aspire to but can your heart refuse the request which darmin perhaps may ask of you     blandford ha thou hast removed the veil i see i see it all but who what art thou art thou indeed what thou resemblest adine smiling whatever i am for heavens sake be silent now i hear dorfise coming this way dorfise with strong box ive got the box propitious love has favored my design here my dear take it away let us be gone have you got it fast blandford taking

the very woman whom i so often proposed to my deluded friend who deceived by a faithless wretch despised and hated all but her blandford how could i injure by an unkind refusal so many charms such beauty and such virtue adine you never would have known me if chance and my own constancy had not removed the veil of black ingratitude and saved you from yourself darmin you owe everything your fortune and your reason to her generous love what then is she to hope for in return what will you do to make her amends     blandford kneeling to adine adore her mondor this turn of affairs is as agreeable as it is surprising we shall all be gainers by the change away end of the fifth and last act b the tatler     dramatis personæ euphemia damis hortensia trasimon clitander nerine pasquin several footmen belonging to damis     act i scene i euphemia damis euphemia dont imagine my dear that by what im going to say i mean to exercise the authority of a mother always ready as you know i am to listen in my turn to your reasons when i think them good my intention is not to lay my commands on you but to give you my advice it is my heart which speaks to you and that experience i have had in the world makes me foresee evils which i would endeavor to prevent you have been at court i think not above two months believe me tis a dangerous situation the perfidious group of courtiers always look on a newcomer with an eye of malevolence and soon find out all his imperfections from the first moment they condemn him without pity or remorse and which is still worse their judgment is irrevocable be guarded against their malice on the first step we take in life the rest of it must in a great measure depend if you once make yourself ridiculous the world will think you always so the impression will remain it is in vain as you advance in years to change your conduct and assume a more serious behavior you will suffer a long time from old prejudices even if we do grow better we are still suspected and i have often known men pay dearly in their old age for the errors of their youth have a     little regard therefore to the world and remember you ought to live now more for that than for yourself damis now i cannot conceive what all this long preamble tends to euphemia i see it appears to you both absurd and unnecessary you despise those things which may be of the greatest consequence to you one day or other perhaps you may believe me when it will be too late to be plain with you you are indiscreet my too long indulgence passed over this fault in your infancy in your riper years i dread the effects of it you are not without abilities a good understanding and a good heart but believe me in a world so full of injustice virtue will not make amends for vice our faults are censured on every occasion and perhaps the worst we can be guilty of is indiscretion at court my dear the most necessary art is not to talk well but to know how to hold ones tongue this is not the place where society enjoys itself in the freedom of easy conversation here they generally talk without saying anything and the most tiresome babblers have the best success i have been long acquainted with the court and bad enough it is but whilst we live there we ought to conform to it with regard to the women you should be remarkably cautious talk but seldom of them and still less of yourself pretend to be ignorant of all they do and all they say conceal your opinion and disguise your sentiments but above all be master of your secrets he who tells those of another will always be esteemed a villain and he     who tells his own be assured will here at least be looked on as a fool what have you to object to this damis nothing i am entirely of your opinion i abominate the character of a tatler that is not my foible i assure you so far from being guilty of the vice you seem to reproach me with i now fairly confess to you madam that i have a long time concealed a thing from you which i ought to have told you of but in life you know one must sometimes dissemble i love and am beloved by a most charming widow young rich and handsome as prudent as she is amiable in a word it is hortensia judge madam yourself of my happiness judge if it were known how miserable it would make all our courtiers who are sighing for her we have concealed our mutual passion from every one of them this engagement has been made now for these two whole days past and you knew nothing of it euphemia but i have been at paris all that time damis o madam never was man so happy in his choice the more you approve of it the more satisfaction shall i feel and the more pleasure in my pursuit of her euphemia i am sure damis the confidence you repose in me is a mark of your friendship and not of your imprudence damis i hope you never doubted that     euphemia but seriously damis you should reflect on the prospect of happiness before you hortensia i know has charms but besides that she is the best match that could have offered itself in all france damis i know she is euphemia she is entirely her own mistress and can choose for herself damis so much the better euphemia you must take care how you manage her mark her inclinations and flatter them damis o i can do better i know how to please her euphemia well said damis but remember shes not fond of noise and bustle no blustering or flashy airs will be agreeable to her she may like other women have her foibles but even in love matters shell always act with discretion above all let me advise you not to show off in public with her nor appear at court together as if on purpose to be stared at and become the topic of the day secret and mystery are all her taste damis and yet the affair must be known at last     euphemia but pray what lucky accident introduced you to her she never admits young men to her toilette but like a prudent woman carefully avoids the crowd of wild sparks that are perpetually after her damis to tell you the truth i have never been at her house yet but i have ogled her a long time and thank heaven with success at first she sent back my letters unopened but soon after read them and now writes to me again for near two days past i have had strong hopes and in a word intend this very night to have a têteàtête with her euphemia well i think ill go and see her too the mother of a lover who is well received cannot i imagine but be agreeable to her i may contrive to speak of you and prevail on her to hasten the match on which i shall tell her your happiness depends get her consent and make her yours as soon as you can ill do my best to assist you but speak of it to nobody else i charge you damis no madam never was mother more tender and affectionate or friendship more sincere and to please her shall for the future be my first ambition euphemia all that i desire of you is to be happy     scene ii damis alone my mother is right address and cunning are absolutely necessary in this world there is no succeeding without them i am resolved to dissemble with the whole court except ten or a dozen friends whom i may talk freely with but first by way of trial of my prudence let me tell my secrets to myself a little and consider now nobodys by what fortune has bestowed on me i hate vanity but theres no harm in knowing ones self and doing ourselves justice i have some wit am agreeable well received at court and thought i believe by some to be admitted to the kings private hours then i am certainly very handsome can dance sing drink and dissemble with the best of them made a colonel at thirteen i have reason to hope for a staff at thirty happy in what i have and with a good prospect before me ill keep julia and marry hortensia when i have possessed her charms ill be guilty every day of a thousand infidelities but all with prudence and economy and without ever being suspected as a rambler in six months time i shall make away with half her fortune and enjoy all the court by turns without her knowing anything of the matter scene iii damis trasimon damis good morrow governor     trasimon aside hang him for coming across me damis my dear governor let me embrace thee trasimon excuse me sir but i really— damis positively i will come come— trasimon well what what do you want damis nay dont frown so man pray thee unbend a little i am the happiest of mortals trasimon i came to tell you sir— damis o by heavens you kill me with that hard frozen face of yours trasimon i cant help it sir nor can i smile at present for let me tell you you have got a bad affair upon your hands damis not so very bad surely trasimon erminia and valere exclaim violently against you you have spoke of them it seems too lightly and old lord horace too desired me to tell you—   0 damis o a mighty matter indeed to be uneasy about horace an old lord an old fool a proud coxcomb puffed up with notions of false honor low enough at court he puts on an air of importance in the city and is as ignorant as he would fain seem knowing as for madam erminia its pretty well known i had her and left her abruptly an illnatured busybody i believe you know a little of her lover my friend valere did you ever remember such a starched affected strained lefthanded understanding o by the by i was told yesterday in confidence that his huge elder brother that important creature is well received by clarice and the fat countess is bursting with spleen and disappointment well but my old commandant how go your loveaffairs trasimon you know i dont trouble myself much about the sex damis thats not my case for i do and in faith both in court and city they keep me pretty well employed but listen while i intrust you with a secret on which the happiness of my life depends trasimon can i serve you in it damis no not in the least trasimon then pray tell me nothing about it damis o but the rights of friendship—     trasimon tis that very friendship which makes me shrink from the weight of a secret which is intrusted to me not out of real regard but from mere folly and weakness which anybody else might keep as well as myself which is generally attended with a thousand suspicions and may chance to give us both a great deal of uneasiness me for knowing and you for saying more than you ought damis say what you will about it captain i must let you have the pleasure of reading this billetdoux which this very day— trasimon what a strange humor— damis youll say its written with a great deal of tenderness trasimon well if you insist upon it— damis tis dictated by love itself youll see how fond she is of me tis the hand that wrote it which makes it so valuable but you shall see it zounds ive lost it positively i cant find it—hullo la fleur la brie scene iv damis trasimon several footmen footman did

looks gloomy and dismal today i think but i suppose— clitander aside i have but too much reason damis what are you muttering about clitander in a low voice what a poor unhappy creature i am damis come to give you both a little spirit suppose i read you this little billet of mine ha marquis clitander aside looking at the letter what letter can it be surely tis from hortensia cruel creature damis to clitander tis a letter would make a rival hang himself clitander you are indeed a happy man if you are beloved damis that i most assuredly am but you shall hear your city ladies dont write in this style observe her he reads at length i yield to the passion which has taken possession of my heart i would have concealed it but tis impossible why should i not write what my eyes no doubt have a thousand times     informed you of yes my dearest damis i own i love you the more perhaps because my heart fearful of your youth and fearful of itself for a long time resisted my inclination and told me i ought not to love you after the confession of such a weakness ought i not forever to reproach myself for it but the more frankly i avow my tenderness for you with the more care you ought to conceal it trasimon you take care i see to obey the ladys commands most punctually a mighty discreet lover to be sure clitander happy is that man who receives such letters and never shows them damis well what do you think of it is it not— trasimon very strong indeed clitander charming damis and the writer a thousand times more so o if you did but know her name but in this wicked world we must have a little discretion trasimon well we dont desire you to tell us clitander you and i damis love one another very well but prudence—     trasimon so far from desiring you to acquaint us with particulars that— damis come come i love you both too well to dissemble with you i know you think and the whole court has proclaimed it that i have no affair here with anybody but julia clitander nay they have it from yourself but as to us we do not believe a word of it damis to be sure there was something between us and the affair went on tolerably well till now we loved one another and then we parted and then we met again all the world knows that clitander the world i assure you knows nothing at all about it damis you think im very fond of her still but youre mistaken upon honor i am not trasimon tis nothing to me whether you are or are not damis julia is handsome that she is but then shes fickle the other—o the other is the very thing clitander well and this charming woman—     damis come i see you will know and i must tell you my dear friend look at this picture only look at it did you ever see two such eyes the most charming most adorable creature painted by mace that you know is saying everything you know the features dont you clitander o heaven tis hortensia damis you seem surprised trasimon you forget sir that hortensia is my cousin that she is tender of her honor and a declaration of this kind— damis o give her up give her up man why i have six cousins you shall have them all make up to them ogle them deceive them desert them print their loveletters with all my heart it will give me no uneasiness we should have enough to do indeed to be out of humor with one another to vindicate the honor of our cousins its very well here if every one can answer for themselves trasimon but hortensia sir— damis is the woman i adore and i tell you again sir she loves me and me only and to make you more angry i intend to marry her     clitander aside could i have been more cruelly injured damis our wedding will be no secret but you shant be there—cousin trasimon a cousin sir may have some power over her and that you shall know soon your servant sir scene vii damis clitander damis how i detest that fellow the ridiculous pedant with his affected airs of romantic virtue a tedious heavy tiresome brute you seem to be mighty curious about that picture and examine it closely clitander aside i must be master of myself and dissemble damis you may observe perhaps one of the brilliants is missing at the corner there it was a long chase yesterday and there was such jostling and pushing one another you must know i had four pictures loose in my pocket and this unfortunately met with a mischance the case broke and a brilliant dropped out as you go to town tomorrow you may call at frénayes hes dear but clever in his way i     wish youd choose a diamond at his shop as if it was for yourself for between you and me i owe him a few pounds here take the picture but dont show it to anybody your servant clitander aside where am i damis well god be with you marquis i shall depend on you take care be discreet now clitander aside can he possibly do it damis returning i love a discreet friend you shall be my confidant ill tell you all my secrets is it possible for a man to be happy to possess everything his heart can wish for and not tell it to another wheres the joy of keeping our insipid pleasures to ourselves one may as well have no friends as not trust them and happiness uncommunicated is no happiness at all i have shown you a letter and a picture but thats not all clitander why what else have you damis do you know that this very night i am to meet her clitander aside o dreadful horrible     damis tonight clitander before the ball is over alone and unsuspected i am to meet her by appointment in this garden clitander aside o i am lost undone this last cruel stroke— damis is not that charming my friend dost not rejoice with me boy clitander and will hortensia meet you damis most certainly just at dusk i expect her but the declining sun already gives me notice of my approaching happiness i must be gone ill go to your lodgings i think and dress let me see i must have two pounds of powder for my hair and some of the most exquisite perfume then will i return in triumph and finish the affair immediately do you in the meantime prowl about here that you may have some share in the happiness of your friend i shall leave you here as my deputy to keep off impertinent rivals scene viii clitander alone how hard a task it was to conceal my grief and my resentment after a whole year of sincerest passion when hortensias heart wearied of resistance   0 began at length to soften and relent for damis thus to come and change her in an instant one fortunate moment has done what my long and faithful services in vain solicited nay she even anticipated his wishes gave this young coxcomb that picture which i had so much better deserved she writes to him too o that letter would have killed me with ecstasy and then to make my misery complete she has written to me this morning never to see her more this hairbrained fellow has got hold of her heart and will carry her off in triumph o hortensia how cruelly hast thou deceived me scene ix clitander pasquin clitander so pasquin i have found out my rival pasquin indeed sir so much the worse clitander yes shes in love with that blockhead damis pasquin who told you so clitander himself the proud coxcomb boasted to me of the treasure he had stolen from me here pasquin look at this picture out of mere vanity he has left it in my hands only that he may triumph the more o hortensia who could ever have believed that damis would supplant clitander     pasquin damis is a good and pretty fellow clitander collaring him ha rascal an impertinent young fool that— pasquin very true sir and perhaps—but for heavens sake dont strangle me sir between you and me sir hes nothing but a babbler a prig— clitander be he what he will she prefers him to me pasquin therefore now is the time to exert thy usual skill and serve me hortensia and my rival are to meet this night in the garden by appointment find out some method if possible to prevent it pasquin but sir— clitander thy brain i know is fertile take money as much as thou wilt for heavens sake disappoint my rival while he is tricking out his insignificant person we may rob him of the happy moment since he is a fool let us take the advantage of his folly and by some means or other keep him away from this place pasquin and this you think mighty easy to be done why sir i would sooner engage to stop the course of a river a stag on a heath or a bird in the air a mad poet repeating his own verses a litigious woman that has a suit in chancery a parson hunting after     a benefice a highwind a tempest or thunder and lightning than a young coxcomb going to a rendezvous with his mistress clitander and will you then abandon me to despair pasquin stay a thought is just come into my head let me see hortensia and damis have never seen me clitander never pasquin you have got her picture clitander i have pasquin good and you have got a letter that she wrote you clitander ay and a cruel one it is pasquin her ladyships orders i think to you never to visit her again clitander it is so pasquin the letter is without a direction i think clitander it is rascal and what of that     pasquin give me the picture and the letter immediately give them me i say clitander shall i give a picture into other hands that was intrusted to my care pasquin come come no ceremony a pretty scruple indeed give them me clitander well but pasquin— pasquin leave everything to me and rely on my discretion clitander you want to— pasquin away away here comes hortensia scene x hortensia nerine hortensia what you say nerine is very true clitander is a worthy man i know the warmth of his passion for me and the sincerity of it he is sober sensible constant and discreet i ought to esteem him and so i do but damis is my taste i find by the struggles of my own heart that love is not always the     reward of virtue we are always won by an agreeable outside and for one who is captivated by the perfections of the soul a thousand are caught by the eye i blush at my own inconstancy but damis comes no more here i assure you nerine what a strange humor this is how resolute you are hortensia no i ought not to be there first and positively i will not nerine are you afraid of the first meeting hortensia to tell you the truth damis takes up all my thoughts this very day i have had a visit from his mother who has greatly increased my prejudices in favor of her son i see she is extremely eager for the match and presses it in the warmest manner but i want to see the man himself in private and sound his real sentiments nerine you have no doubt of his regard for you hortensia none i believe nay i know he loves me but i want to hear him tell me so a thousand and a thousand times over i want to see if he deserves my love to know his temper his character and his heart i would not yield blindly to inclination but judge of him if i could without passion or prejudice     scene xi hortensia nerine pasquin pasquin madam my master damis has sent me here to acquaint you privately— hortensia is he not coming himself pasquin no madam nerine the little villain hortensia not come to me pasquin no madam but as in point of honor he thinks himself obliged he has sent you back this portrait hortensia my picture pasquin please to take it madam hortensia am i awake pasquin pray maam make haste for i am really in a hurry i have two more pictures to carry back for my master and two to receive and so madam till we meet again i am your most obsequious—     hortensia perfidious wretch i shall die with grief pasquin he desired me moreover madam to inform you that you need not ogle him any more and that for the future he should be glad if you would find out some other dupe to laugh at besides himself scene xii hortensia nerine damis pasquin damis at the farther end of the stage here i am to meet the dear object of my wishes pasquin ha damis then i am caught but ill take courage however and proceed he runs up to damis and takes him aside i belong sir to lady hortensia and have the honor to be employed on her little affairs i have sir here a billetdoux for you hortensia what a change is here what a reward for my tender passion damis reads let me see ha hows this you deserve my regard i know the esteem that is due to your virtues but i cannot love you was ever such abominable perfidy this is what i little expected indeed but it shall be known the public shall be acquainted     with it it shall be no secret at court i can assure her hortensia at the other part of the stage could he carry his infamous perfidy so far as this damis there madam you see what value i set on your correspondence he tears the letter pasquin running up to hortensia o madam i blush for his behavior you saw him tear the letter which you condescended to write to the ungrateful man hortensia he has sent back my picture perish thou wretched image of my ineffectual charms she throws down the picture pasquin coming back to damis there sir you see how she treats you she has thrown away your picture and broken it in pieces damis there are some ladies in the world who receive the original in a very different manner i can assure her hortensia o nerine what a regard i had for this ungrateful man tell me fellow speaking to pasquin and     giving him money for whose sake is it i am thus deserted to what happy object am i sacrificed pasquin o madam to five or six beauties with whom he pretends to be in love though he cares as little for them as for yourself but your most dangerous rival is the fair julia damis coming up to pasquin here take this ring and now tell me honestly on what impertinent court fool your sweet mistress has fixed her affections pasquin no one sir deserves her so well as yourself but to tell you the truth there is a certain young abbé who ogles her perpetually not to mention that i frequently help her cousin trasimon over the gardenwall of an evening damis im glad of it this is excellent news ill put it into a ballad hortensia the worst of it is nerine that to make me still more unhappy this affair will make a noise in the world and i shall be horribly exposed come let us be gone i will retire and hide my tears pasquin to hortensia you have no more commands for me madam to damis can i be of any further service to you sir heaven preserve you both     scene xiii hortensia damis nerine hortensia returning why do i stay in this place damis i ought to be dancing at the ball now hortensia he seems thoughtful but tis not on my account damis i am mistaken or she looks this way ill even make up to her hortensia ill avoid him damis o stay hortensia can you fly me can you avoid me cruel perfidious woman hortensia ungrateful man leave me to myself and let me try to hate you damis that madam will be an easy task thanks to your infidelity hortensia tis what i ought to do tis but my duty now thanks to your injustice   0 damis and are we met at last hortensia but to quarrel hortensia how can damis talk thus and at the same time affront me and love another o julia julia damis after your writing me such a letter madam— hortensia after your sending back my picture sir— damis could i send back your picture cruel woman hortensia could i ever write a line to you that was not full of love and tenderness perfidious man damis madam i will consent to leave the court to give up the posts i enjoy and all my hopes of future preferment to be despised and condemned by the whole world if ever i sent you back the picture the precious treasure which love intrusted to my care hortensia and may i never be loved by the dear charmer of my soul if i ever sent you that letter but here here ungrateful man is the picture your insolence returned me the reward of tender friendship which you despised tis here and can you— damis ha here comes clitander     scene xiv hortensia damis clitander nerine pasquin damis my dear marquis come here where are you going he madam will unravel all hortensia clitander why what does he know of the matter damis dont be alarmed madam he is my friend to whom i have opened my whole heart he is my confidant let him be yours too you must indeed you must hortensia let us be gone this moment nerine o heaven what a ridiculous creature scene xv damis clitander pasquin damis o marquis i am the most unhappy of men let me speak to you i must follow her observe me to hortensia stay hortensia nay then i must after her     scene xvi clitander pasquin clitander i dont know what to think of it pasquin i understood by what you told me that they had quarrelled pasquin i thought so too im sure i played my part most certainly they have cause to hate one another but for aught i know a minutes time may reconcile them again clitander let us observe which way they turn pasquin hortensia seems as if she was going to her own house clitander damis follows her close by his being behind however it looks as if she shunned him pasquin she flies but slowly and the lover pursues clitander she turns her head back and damis talks to her but to no purpose pasquin i fancy not but damis stops her often     clitander he kneels to her but she treats him with contempt pasquin o but observe now she looks tenderly on him if so youre undone clitander she is gone into her own house and has dismissed him joy and fear hope and despair at once surround me i cant imagine how it will end scene xvii clitander damis pasquin damis o my dear marquis im glad youre here for heavens sake inform me what can be the meaning that hortensia forbids my coming nigh her how happens it that the picture which i trusted to you is now in her hands answer me clitander you amaze and confound me damis to pasquin as for you sir rascal there the servant of hortensia at least the pretended one ill make an end of you this moment pasquin to clitander protect me sir     clitander to damis well sir— damis tis in vain— clitander spare this poor fellow let me entreat you do damis what interest have you in him clitander i beg of you and seriously damis out of regard to you i will withhold my resentment but tell me scoundrel the whole black contrivance pasquin o sir tis a most mysterious affair but ill let you into some surprising secrets if youll promise not to reveal them damis ill promise nothing and insist on knowing all pasquin you shall sir but hortensia is coming this way and will overhear us to clitander come sir let us to the masquerade and there ill tell you everything     scene xviii trasimon nerine hortensia in a domino with a masque in her hand trasimon take my word for it hortensia this young coxcomb will cover us with shame and ignominy to show your letters and your picture about in this public manner tis intolerable i saw them myself but ill punish the scoundrel as he deserves hortensia to nerine is julia then so beautiful in his eyes do you think hes really in love with her trasimon no matter whether he is or no but if he dishonors you it concerns me nearly i know a relatives duty and will perform it hortensia to nerine do you imagine he is engaged to julia give me your opinion nerine one may know that easily enough from himself hortensia o nerine he was excessively indiscreet i ought to hate yet perhaps still love him o how he wept     and swore he loved that he adored me and that he would conceal our mutual passion trasimon there im sure he promised more than he will perform hortensia for the last time however i mean to try him hes gone to the masquerade there i shall be sure to find him you must dissemble nerine go and tell him that julia expects him here with impatience this masque at least will hide my blushes the faithless man will take me for julia i shall know what he thinks of her and of myself on this meeting will depend my choice or my contempt of him to trasimon you must not be far off endeavor if you can to keep clitander near you wait for me here or hereabouts and i will call you when there is occasion scene xix hortensia alone in a domino with a masque in her hand at length it is time to fix my wavering affections under the cover of this masque and the name of julia i shall know whether his indiscretion was owing to excess of love or vanity whether i ought to pardon or to detest him but here he comes     scene xx hortensia masqued damis damis not seeing hortensia this seems to be the favorite spot for ladies to make their assignations in well ill follow the fashion fashion in france determines everything regulates precedency honor goodbreeding merit wit and pleasure hortensia aside the coxcomb damis if this affair of mine could but be known in two years time the whole court would run mad for love of me a good setting out here is everything then ægle and doris and—o theres no counting them such a group such a sweet prospect o the pretty creatures— hortensia aside light vain man damis o julia is it you i know you in spite of that envious masque my heart cannot be mistaken come come my dear julia take off that cruel veil that hides thy beauties from me do not in pity do not conceal those sweet looks those tender smiles that were meant to reward that love which they inspired thou art the only woman on earth whom i adore     hortensia let me tell you damis you are a stranger to my humor and disposition i should despise a heart that never felt for any woman but myself i like my lovers should be more fashionable that twenty young flirts should be hunting after him that his passion for me should draw him away from a hundred contending beauties i must have some noble sacrifice offered up to me or ill never accept of his services a lover less esteemed would be of no value i should despise him damis i can make you easy on that head my dear i have made some pretty good conquests and perhaps as expeditiously as most men i believe i can boast of tolerable success that way many a fine woman has run after me another man would be vain of it i could reckon up a few of your nice ladies who are not overcoy with me hortensia well but who who are they damis only give the word my julia and i begin the sacrifice there is first the little isabel secondly the lively smart erminia then theres clarice ægle doris— hortensia poor pitiful offerings i could have a hundred such every day these will never do they are loved and turned off again twenty times in a week let me have some respectable names women of character such as i may triumph over without a blush if you     could reckon among your captives one who before she saw the incomparable damis was invulnerable one who in all actions paid the strictest regard to decency and decorum some modest prudent fair who never felt a weakness but for you that would be the woman damis sitting down by her now then observe me i have a mistress who exactly resembles in every feature the picture you have drawn but you would not have me be so indiscreet as to— hortensia not for the world damis if i were imprudent enough to tell her name i should call her—hortensia why are you startled at it i think not of her while my julias here she is neither young nor handsome when you are by besides there is a certain young abbé who is very familiar with her and between you and me her cousin trasimon is too apt to come to her in an evening over the gardenwall hortensia aside to join calumny thus to his infidelity execrable villain but i must dissemble pray damis on what footing are you with hortensia does she love you damis o to distraction thats the truth of it hortensia aside impudence and falsehood to the highest degree  00 damis tis even so i assure you i would not tell you a lie for the world hortensia aside the villain damis but what signifies thinking about her we did not meet here to talk of hortensia come let us rather— hortensia i can never believe hortensia would ever have given herself up so totally to you damis i tell you i have it under her own hand hortensia i dont believe a word of it damis tis insulting me to doubt it hortensia let me see it then damis you injure me madam there read perhaps you know her hand gives her the letter hortensia unmasking i do villain and know your treachery at length i have in some measure atoned for my folly and have luckily recovered both the picture and the letter  0  which i had ventured to trust in such unworthy hands tis done now trasimon and clitander appear scene xxi hortensia damis trasimon clitander hortensia to clitander if i have not yet offended you beyond a possibility of pardon if you can still love hortensia my hand my fortune and my life are yours clitander o hortensia behold at your feet a despairing lover who receives your kind offer with joy and transport trasimon to damis did i not tell you sir i should bring her to a right way of thinking this marriage sir is my making now damis fare you well and henceforth learn to dissemble better or never attempt it more damis just heaven for the future how shall i venture to speak at all end   nothing could add more to the horror of the crime than such a circumstance clytemnæstra not content with murdering her husband instituted a solemn feast in commemoration of the happy event and called it with cruel raillery the supper of agamemnon dinias in his history of argos informs us it was on the thirteenth of the month gamelion which answers to the beginning of our january
