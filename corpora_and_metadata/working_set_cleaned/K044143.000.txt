to david garrick esquire sir amidst the regrets i feel for your quitting the stage it is peculiarly gratifying that a play of mine closes your dramatic life  it is the highest pleasure to me that that play from its success reflects no dishonor on your judgment as a manager  posterity will know through a thousand channels that mr garrick was the ornament of the eighteenth century that he possessed the friendship of those whose names will be the glory of english history that the first ranks in the kingdom courted his society  may my small voice be heard amongst those who will inform it that mr garricks heart was no less an honor to him than his talents  unpatronized by any name i presented myself to you obscure and unknown you perceived dawnings in my comedy which you nourished and improved with attention and solicitude you embellished and presented it to the world  that world which has emulated your generosity and received it with an applause which fills my heart with most lively gratitude i perceive how much of this applause i owe to my sex  the runaway has a thousand faults which if written by a man would have incurred the severest lash of criticism  but the gallantry of the english nation is equal to its wisdom  they beheld a woman tracing with feeble steps the borders of the parnaffian mount  pitying her difficulties for it is a thorny path they gave their hands for her support and placed her high above her level  all this sir and whatever may be its consequences i owe to you had you rejected me when i presented my little runaway depressed by the refusal and all confidence in myself destroyed i should never have presumed to dip my pen again it is now my task to convince you and the world that a generous allowance for a young writers faults is the best encouragement to genius  it is a kindly soil in which weak groundlings are nourished and from which the loftiest trees draw their strength and their beauty  i take my leave of you sir with the warmest wishes for your felicity and mrs garricks  to whose taste and sollicitede for me i am highly indebted may your recess from the stage be attended with all the blessings of retirement and ease  and may the world remember in its most distant periods that it is to mr garrick the english theater owes its emancipation from grossness and buffoonery  that to mr garricks judgment it is indebted for being the first stage in europe and to his talents for being the delight of the most enlightened and polished age  i am sir your most devoted and obedient humble servant the author  prologue written by the

will be more agreeably protected here  and this is my business   mr h a young lady who has put herself under your protection who is she   mr d her name she wishes to conceal   mr h that is very odd  where did you meet with her   mr d at the house of a widow tenant of mine a few miles from hence where she had taken refuge from a marriage to which an uncle would have forced her  she had no companion but the good old lady whom i found employed in assisting her to weep instead of consoling her  in short there were reasons to think her situation highly dangerous and i prevailed on her to leave it   har and so your credulity is again taken in and the air of a weeping beauty is the trap that caught you  ha ha ha  will you never be sick of impositions   mr d i dont remember that i was ever imposed on   mr h no dont i know how many people you have plagued yourself about who had not a grain of merit to deserve it   mr d i want merit mr hargrave yet all the blessings of health and

his father and i hope sir you will not withhold yours   mr h oh no to be sure george  sbud refuse protection to a fine girl  twould be with you a crying sin i warrant  but mr drummond i should suppose    mr d come be satisfied the weaknesses with which you reproach me might have induced me to have snatched her from an alarming situation without much examination  but in compliment to your delicacy i have made proper enquiries  she was placed under the care of mrs carlton by a person of credit  she has dispatched a messenger to her uncle who i presume will be here tomorrow   har pray sir permit us to wait on the lady and conduct her here i am strongly interested for her   mr h it is an odd affair  what say you to it my lady   lady d as your family seem desirous to receive her sir i am sorry to

elopement    mr h aye very true  sbud mr drummond how can you encourage such    mr d madam i do not mean to encourage but to restore the young lady to her family she seems terrified at the peculiar severity of her uncles temper so well put ourselves in form receive him in full assembly and divide his anger amongst us  your ladyship i am sure must be happy to render the recovery of the first

thought so and supposed myself influenced by the worst genius that ever fell to the lot of a poor mortal  but she has entirely retrieved herself in my opinion and by two or three capital strokes has made me forget her unlucky pranks and believe her one of the best disposed sylphs in all the regions of fancy   em smiling you recommend this aerial attendant very strongly  have you any intention to part from her   geo i would willingly exchange her  if your genius would be so obliging to take a fancy to me  i will accept her with all my heart  and give you mine   em you would lose by the

should  these are precious moments which i must not lose  may i presume to use them in telling you how happy i am in the event which placed you in my fathers house  but you have perhaps forgot the presumptuous tancred who gave such disturbance to the gentleman honored by protecting you at the masquerade   em no sir i remember  and if i dont mistake you were nearly engaged in a fracas with that gentleman  i was happy when i observed you stopped by a mask and seized that moment to leave the room   geo a moment madam that i have never ceased to regret till now  but that which i at present possess is a felicity so unexpected and unhopd for    em you forget sir these gallantries are out of place here  under a mask a shepherd may sigh or an eastern prince amuse himself in saying the most extravagant things  but they know there are delicacies to be observed in real life quite incompatible with the freedoms of a masquerade   geo whilst you are thus severe on mere gallantries i will venture to hope that a most tender and respectful passion will be treated more favorably   em sir   geo i comprehend madam what your delicacy must feel and will therefore only add that from the first moment i beheld you my heart has known no other object you have been the mistress of its wishes  and you are the mistress of its fate   em hesitatingly indeed sir this declaration at a time when i must appear in so strange a light to your family hurts me greatly  i can scarcely believe you mean it a compliment  but surely my situation here ought    geo i acknowledge madam the confession i have dared to make is premature  it is ill timed  nothing can excuse it but the peculiarity of our situation  when i reflect that in a few moments your uncle may arrive that he may snatch you from us and that such an opportunity never may be mine again    enter mr drummond mr d so so my young ones have i found you it is a most delicious morning  but is it usual with you madam to taste the air so early

observances which are the surest battery when there is time to play em off  if any man had thus obtained my sisters heart  left her a prey to disappointment and then said  he meant nothing  my sword

bell very true this might be sufficient for me  but what pleasure can you have in tormenting two hearts so attached to each other   geo i do mean to plague em a little and it will be the greatest favor we can do them  for they are such sentimental people  you know  that they will blush and hesitate and torment each other six months before they can come to an explanation  but by alarming their jealousy they will betray themselves in as many hours   bell oh cry your mercy  so there is not one grain of mischief in all this and you carry on the plan in downright charity  well really in that

me  it would be the most cruel mortification if i thought he would ever suspect my weakness  i wonder bella if the lady whom he is to marry is so handsome as george describes her   bell of what consequence is that to you child  never think about it if you suffer your mind to be softened with reflections of that sort you will never behave with a proper degree of scorn to him   har oh do not

intimate some such thing   bell why  a  i dont know  to be sure there was a kind of a distant intimation  though perhaps sir charles only means that you are awkward  ha ha  but consider sir this

 but you have certainly been too precipitate  your son has scarcely been at home four and twenty hours and cannot possibly have received any impression or formed an idea of my character  he has been so much engaged indeed with other persons that i have had no opportunity of conversing with him and how so circumstanced can he have formed a judgment of his own heart   mr h good god madam he has given the best proof in the world that he has formed a judgment for he told me this morning that the prospect of the marriage made him very happy  i dont know what other proof a man can give that he knows his own heart  and let me tell you madam i have accustomed my children to pay a proper regard to my inclination   lady d i am apprehensive sir that mr george hargraves obedience may influence

his father say it  and there is not a woman in the kingdom who might not be proud to call him her husband  too obedient    lady d bless me this man has no ideas aside  you mistake me mr hargrave i do not mean to lessen the merit of obedience in your son  but i confess i wish him to have a more delicate a more tender motive for offering his hand to me   mr h look ye madam  you have a great understanding to be sure  and i confess you talk above my reach  but i must nevertheless take the liberty to blame your ladyship  a person of your ladyships experience  and allow me to say your date

you that i had talked to my son concerning the affair and to incline you when he waits on you to give him a favorable hearing   lady d mr hargrave  a person of your sons merit is entitled to a proper attention from any woman he addresses   mr h there  now we are right again  i was fearful that you had not liked my boy  and that your difficulties arose from that quarter  but since you like george

that enchanting girl the offer of my heart and hand and though her delicacy forbids her while our families remain unknown to each other to give the assent my heart aspires to  yet she allows me to atch hopes that i would not forfeit to become master of the universe   mr d there is a little of the ardor of youth in this  the ardor of youth george  however i will not blame you for twenty years ago i might have been tempted to enter the lists with you myself   geo i should fear less to meet a hector in the field  in such a cause the fury of achilles would inspire me  and i would bear off my lovely prize from amidst the embattled phalanx   mr d bravo  i like to see a man romantic in his love and in his friendships  the virtues of him who is not an enthusiast in those noble passions will never have strength to rise into fortitude patriotism and philanthropy  but here comes your father leave us   geo may the subject inspire you with resistless cloquence   exit enter mr hargrave mr d so mr hargrave   mr h so mr drummond  what i guess your business   mr d i suppose you do and i hope you are prepared to hear me with temper   mr h you will talk to no purpose for i am fixed and therefore the temper will signify nothing   mr d strange infatuation why must george be sacrificed to your ambition  surely it may be gratified without tying him to your lady dinah   mr h how   mr d by marrying her yourself  which till now i supposed to have been your design  and that would have been sufficiently preposterous   mr h what  make me a second time the slave of hysterics longings and vapors  no no i have got my neck out of the noose  catch it there again if you can  what her ladyship is not youthful enough for george i suppose   mr d true  but a more forcible objection is the disproportion in their minds  it would not be less reasonable to expect a new element to be produced between earth and fire than that felicity should be the result of such a marriage   mr h psha psha  what do you suppose the whole world has the same idle notions about love and constancy and stuff that you have do you think if george was to become a widower at five and twenty he would whine all his life for the loss of his deary   mr d not if his deary as you call her should be a lady dinah and if you marry him with no other view than to procure him a happy widowhood i admire the election you have made  but if she should be like my lost love  my sainted harriet  my  oh hargrave    mr h come come i am very sorry i have moved you so  i did not mean to affect you  come give me your hand  sbud if a man has any thing to do with one of you fellows with your fine feelings he must be as cautious as if he was carrying a candle in a gunpowder barrel   mr d it is over my friend  but when i can hear my harriet named without giving my heart a fond regret for what i have lost  reproach me  for then i shall deserve it   mr h well well  it shall be your own way  but come let me convince you that you are wrong in this business   sbud i tell you it has been the study of my life to make george a great man  i brought lady dinah here with no other design  and now when i thought the matter was brought to bear  when lady dinah had consented  and my son as i supposed eager for the wedding  why  it is all a flam   mr d my good friend  the motives from which you would sacrifice your sons happiness appear to me so weak   mr h weak  why i tell you i have provided a wife for george who will make him perhaps one of the first men in the kingdom   mr d that is she would make him a court dangler an attendant on ministers levees  one whose ambition is to be fostered with the cameleon food of smiles and nods and who would receive a familiar squeeze with as much rapture as the plaudits of a nation  oh  shame  to transform an independent english gentleman into such a being   mr h well to cut the argument short  the bargain is struck and george shall marry lady dinah or never have an acre of my land that is all   mr d and he shall never possess a rood of mine if he does  walking about mr h aside there i thought it would come to this what a shame it is for a man to be so obstinate  but hold  faith if so i may lose more than i get by the bargain  he will stick to his word   enter justice jus i am very much surprised mr drummond  sir  that i cannot be left alone in the discharge of my magisterial duties

legislators and obstruct the operations of justice  yes sir you do   mr h dont be so warm  what is this affair   jus why the poacher whom we committed last night mr drummond has released and given money to his family  how can we expect a due observance of our laws when rascals find encouragement for breaking them  shall lords and commons in their wisdom assemble in parment to make laws about hares and partridges only to be laughed at oh it is abominable   mr h very true and let me tell you mr drummond it is very extraordinary that you will be continually    mr d peace ye men of justice  i have all the regard to the laws of my country which it is the duty and interest of every member of society to possess  if the man had been a poacher he should not have been protected by me  the poor fellow found the hare in his garden which she had considerably injured   mr h ho ho  what the rascal justifies himself an unqualified man gives reasons for destroying a hare  zounds if a gang of ruffians should burn my house would you expect me to hear their reasons   jus ah there it works  susans my own aside  there can be no reasons  if he had found her in his house in his bedchamber  in his bed and offered to touch her  i would prosecute him for poaching   mr d oh blush to avow such principles   mr h lookee mr drummond though you govern george with your whimsical notions you shant me

mr d we were talking on a subject mr hargrave of more importance at present than this and i beg you will hear me farther   mr h enough has been said already mr drummond  or if not i will give you one answer for all  i shall never think myself obliged to study the humor of a man who thinks in such opposition to me i have a humor of my own which i am determined to gratify in seeing george a great man  he shall marry lady dinah in two days and all the fine reasoning in the world you will see has less strength than my resolution  sbud if i cannot have the willing obedience of a son i will enjoy the prerogatives of a father  come along justice  exit jus do you hear with what a fine firm tone he speaks  this was only a political stroke to restore the balance of power   mr d why dont you follow

moment and promise to effect your happiness if within the compass of my abilities or fortune but that i may know my task  favor me with the key to your uncles character   em my uncle possesses a heart sir that would do him honor if he would be guided by it  but unhappily he has conceived an opinion that his temper is too flexible  that he is too easily persuaded  and the consequence is  he will never be persuaded at all   mr d i am sorry to hear that  a man who is obstinate from such a mistake must be in the most incurable stage of the disorder however well attack this man of might  his flexibility shall be besieged and if it will not capitulate well undermine it   em ah sir my uncle is in a state of mind ill prepared for yielding  he returned from spain with eager pleasure to his native country but the disgust he has conceived for the alteration of manners during his absence has given him an impatience that you will hardly be able to combat   mr d take courage  let me now lead

ha ha  my son  why he is under engagements that would make it madness   mr m then sir you may depend upon it tho fit is on him now for he clapped emily into a chaise whilst an impudent puppy fastened on me  egad twenty years ago i would have given him sauce to his cornish hug  i could not discern his face  but the other i will swear to   mr h george look for george there i will convince you sir instantly  ha ha   enter harriet mr h where is george   har sir my brother is at mr drummonds   mr h there i knew it could not be him though you would not be persuaded   mr m what a plague you cannot persuade me out of my senses  your son i aver took her out of the coach  with her own consent no doubt and on an honorable design without doubt  sir i give you joy of your daughter   mr h if it is on an honorable design they may live on their honor or starve with it  not a single sous shall they have of me  but i will not yet believe my george could be such a fool   mr m fool sir  the man who loves emily gives no such proof of folly neither  but she shall be punished for hers  twas a concerted affair i see it plainly all agreed upon  but she shall repent   mr h your resentment sir is extraordinary  i must tell you that my sons ancestry or the estate to which he is heir  if he has not forfeited by his disobedience are not objects for the contempt of any man   mr m very likely sir  but they are objects to which i shall never be reconciled  what have i been toiling these thirty years in spain to make my niece a match for any man in england  to have her fortune settled by an adventure in a postchaise an evenings frolic for a young spark who had nothing to do but push the old fellow into a corner and whisk off with the girl sir if there was not another man in the kingdom your son should not have my consent to marry emily   mr h and if there was not another woman in england i would suffer the name of hargrave to be annihilated rather than he should be husband to your niece   hargrave and mrly walk about the stage disordered enter mr drummond mr d gone  her uncle arrived and the amiable girl gone  what infatuation mr hargrave could render you so blind to the happiness that awaited your family  i will follow this obdurate man  where is george  look for george there  he shall hear reason   mr h there sir  that is the person to whom you must address your complaints   mr d unfortunate  i have made discoveries that must have shaken even your prejudices  to mr hargrave  but this uncle  surely my dear harriet you might have prevailed   har sir this gentleman is mr morley  mr drummond sir   mr d hah i beg pardon sir i am rejoiced to see you i understood you were gone   mr m i was gone sir but i was robbed of my niece on the road  she was taken out of my coach and carried off  which forced me to return   mr d carried off   mr h aye sir carried off by george whom you have trained to such a knowledge of his duty   mr m stopped on the kings highway sir by the fiery youth and my niece dragged from my side   mr d admirable   mr h what is this right too  by heaven it is not to be borne   mr d where are they   har at your house sir    mr m what a country am i fallen into can a person of your age and character approve of so rash and daring    mr h let george do what he will  he is sure of his approbation   mr d gentlemen  if you are sure miss morley is at my house i am patience itself  she is too rich a prize to be gained without some warfare   mr m sir i am resolved to    enter lady dinah exit harriet frightend lady d so mr hargrave so sir  what your son  this new insult deprives me of utterance  but your son  what is the reason of this complicated outrage   mr h my dear lady dinah i am as much enraged as you can be  but he shall fulfill his engagements  depend on it he shall   mr m engagements  what the young gentleman was engaged too  a very fine youth upon my word   lady d to mr hargrave your honor is concerned sir  and if i was sure he was drawn in by the girls art and that he was convinced of the impropriety    mr m drawn in by the girls art  whatever cause i may have to be offended with my nieces conduct madam no person shall speak of her with contempt in my presence  i presume this gentlemans son was engaged to your daughter but that is not a sufficient reason for    lady d daughter impertinent  no sir twas to me that he was engaged  and but for the arts of your niece    mr m to you  a matrimonial negotiation between that young fellow and you  nay then before george i dont wonder at your ill temper  a disappointment in love at your time of life must be the devil   lady d mr hargrave do you suffer me to be thus insulted   mr h why my lady we must bear something from this gentleman  the mistake we made about his niece was a very ugly business   mr d i entreat you madam to retire from a family to whom if you suffer me to explain myself    lady d what new insolence is this   mr d i would spare you my lady but you will not spare yourself  blush then whilst i accuse you of entering into a base league with your servants to blast the reputation of an amiable young lady and drive her from the protection of mr hargraves family   mr h what a league with her servants  aside lady d and how dare you accuse me of this  am i to answer for the conduct of my servants   mr d the villainy of your servants is the consequence of those principles with which you have poisoned their minds robbed of their religion they were left without support  against temptations to which you madam have felt philosophy opposes its shield in vain   lady d i feel his superiority to my inmost soul  but he shall not see his triumph aside  is it your virtue which prompts you to load me with injuries to induce mr hargrave to break through every tie of honor  through the most sacred engagements   mr d i have just heard these terms nearly as much prostituted by your servants who reproach you with not keeping your engagements to them   lady d ha am i then betrayed  aside enter george leading emily geo miss morley sir commanded me to lead her to you  i cannot ask you to pardon a rashness of which i do not repent   mr h then i shall make you i fancy   mr m hah  did you really wish to return to me   em i left mr drummonds sir the moment i knew you were here   mr m that is a good girl  i will remember it come child the coach is at the door and we must make speed to retrieve our lost time but have a care young gentleman  though i have pardoned your extravagance once a second attempt shall find me prepared for your reception   geo if miss morley consents to go with you sir you have no second attempt to fear but since this moment is the crisis of our fate thus i entreat you kneeling  you to whom i have sworn eternal love to become my wife consent my charming emily and every moment of my future life shall thank you   mr m so so so   mr h what without my leave   lady d amazing  all together em at such a moment as this meanly to disguise my sentiments would be unworthy of the woman to whom you offer such a sacrifice  obtain the consent of those who have a right to dispose of us and i will give you my hand at the altar   mr m that you will not my frank madam  so no more ceremony but away  seizing her arm and going off mr d and will you go impenetrable man  i have discovered sir that your niece is the daughter of major morley who was one of the earliest friends of my youth  he would not have borne the distress she now endures  i will be a father to his orphan emily and ensure the felicity of two children on the point of being sacrificed to the ambition and avarice of those on whose hearts nature has graven duties which they wilfully mispel   lady d what sir are you not content with the insults you have offered to me and mr hargrave but you must interfere with this gentleman in the disposal of his niece   mr m what right have you sir to dispose of our children   mr h aye very true you dont know how to value the authority of a parent   drum mistaken men into what an abyss of misery  perhaps of guilt would you plunge them  they claim from you happiness and you withold it  they shall receive it from me i will settle the jointurd land of my harriet on miss morley and george shall now partake that fortune to which i have already made him heir   mr h ay there is no stopping him  what can these servants have told him that makes him so warm  egad i will hear their tale   exit unperceived by lady dinah mr m why sir this is extraordinary friendship indeed fettle jointurd lands  i am glad brother tom had prudence enough to form such a connection twas seldom he minded the main chance  honor and a greasy knapsack running about after ragged colors instead    mr d sir i have served and i love the profession  the army is not more the school of honor than of philosophy  a true soldier is a citizen of the world he considers every man of honor as his brother and the urbanity of his heart gains his country subjects whilst his sword only vanquishes her foes   mr m nay if you have all this romance i dont wonder at your proposal  however though your jointure lands might have been necessary for major morlys daughter  my niece sir if she marries with my consent shall be obliged to no man for a fortune   lady d the insolence of making me witness to this is insupportable  is this you sir who this very morning paid your vows to me   geo pardon madam the error of this morning i imagined myself paying my devoirs to a lady who was to become my mother   lady d your mother sir  your mother  mr hargrave  ha where is mr hargrave   enter mr hargrave mr h i am here my lady  and have just heard a tale of so atrocious a nature from your servants  that i would not for half my estate such an affair should have happened in my family   lady d and can you believe the malicious tale   mr h indeed i do   lady d mr drummonds arts have then succeeded   mr h your arts have not succeeded my lady and you have no chance for a husband now i believe unless you prevail on george to run off with you   lady d insolent wretches  order my chaise i will not stay another moment beneath this roof  when persons of my rank thus condescend to mix with plebeians  like the phoenix which sometimes appears within the ken of common birds they are stared at jeered and hooted till they are forced to ascend again to their proper region to escape the flouts of  ignorance and envy   exit mr m well said a rare spirit faith i see ladies of quality have their privileges too    as lady d goes off geo fixes his eye on his father and points after her mr h catching george s hand my dear boy i believe we were wrong here  and i am heartily glad we have escaped  but i suppose you will forget it when i tell you i have no objection to your endeavoring to prevail on this gentleman    geo nothing dear sir can prevent my feeling the most unbounded gratitude for the permission  now may i hope sir    mr m hope sir  upon my word i dont know what to say you have somehow contriyed to carry matters to such a length  that asking my consent is become a matter of form   mr h upon my soul i begin to find out that in some cases ones children should lead  come sir  do keep me in countenance that i may not think i yielded too soon   mr d your consent sir is all we want to become a very joyous circle  let us prevail on you to permit your beloved emily to receive the addresses of my godson and you will many happy years hence recollect his boldness on the road as the most fortunate reneounter of your life you shall come and live amongst us and well reconcile you to your native country notwithstanding our ideas of the degeneracy of the times we shall find room enough to act virtuously and to enjoy in england more securely than in any other country in the world  the rewards of virtue   mr m sir i like you  promise me your friendship  and you shall dispose of my niece   mr d i accept the condition with pleasure   mr m there it is now this is always the way  persuaded out of every resolution  a perfect proverb for flexibility   geo oh sir permit me    mr m nay no extacies  emily dislikes you now you have got me on your side what say you to em dont you begin to feel your usual reluctance   em the proof i have given of my sentiments sir admits of no disguise  or if disguise were necessary i could not assume it   geo enchanting frankness my heart my life must thank you for this goodness but what shall i say to you  to drummond to you sir to whom i already owe more than    mr d to me you owe nothing  the heart george must have some attachments  mine has for many years been centered in you  if i have struggled for your happiness  twas to gratify myself   geo oh sir why will you continually give me such feelings and yet refuse them utterance  seymour behold the happiest of men   sir cha may your bliss my dear george be as permanent as it is great  to hargrave allow me sir to seize this propitious moment to ask your consent to a second union  permit me to entreat miss hargrave for her hand and i will prove george a vain boaster when he calls himself the happiest of men   har why sir charles you have chosen a very lucky moment  but there is no moment in which i should not have heard this request with pleasure why harriet  if we may believe your eyes you are not very angry with sir charles for this request   har a request sir which gives you so much pleasure ought not to give your harriet pain   bell lord you look so insulting with your happiness and seem to think i make such an awkward figure amongst you  but here taking a letter from her pocket  this informs me  that a certain person    geo of the name of  belville    bell be quiet  is landed at dover and posting here  with all the fancy confidence our engagements inspire him with   mr d say you so  then well have the three weddings celebrated on the same day   bell oh mercy  i will not hear of it  love one might manage that perhaps  but honor obey  it is strange the ladies had never interest enough to get this ungallant sorm mended   mr d the marriage vow my dear bella was wisely framed for common apprehensions  love teaches a train of duties that no vow can reach  that refined minds only can perceive  but which they pay with the most delighted attention you are now entering on this state  may you  and you to bella significantly and you to the audience possess the blisful envied lot of  married lovers   finis
