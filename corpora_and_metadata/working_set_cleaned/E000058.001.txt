dialogues of the dead   by lord lyttelton  introduction   dialogues of the dead   dialogue i   lord falklandmr hampden  lord falklandare not you surprised to see me in elysium mr hampden  mr hampdeni was going to put the same question to your lordship for doubtless you thought me a rebel  lord falklandand certainly you thought me an apostate from the commonwealth and a supporter of tyranny  mr hampdeni own i did and i dont wonder at the severity of your thoughts about me  the heat of the times deprived us both of our natural candour  yet i will confess to you here that before i died i began to see in our party enough to justify your apprehensions that the civil war which we had entered into from generous motives from a laudable desire to preserve our free constitution would end very unhappily and perhaps in the issue destroy that constitution even by the arms of those who pretended to be most zealous for it  lord falklandand i will as frankly own to you that i saw in the court and camp of the king so much to alarm me for the liberty of my country if our arms were successful that i dreaded a victory little less than i did a defeat and had nothing in my mouth but the word peace which i constantly repeated with passionate fondness in every council at which i was called to assist  mr hampdeni wished for peace too as ardently as your lordship but i saw no hopes of it  the insincerity of the king and the influence of the queen made it impossible to trust to his promises and declarations nay what reliance could we reasonably have upon laws designed to limit and restrain the power of the crown after he had violated the bill of rights obtained with such difficulty and containing so clear an assertion of the privileges which had been in dispute  if his conscience would allow him to break an act of parliament made to determine the bounds of the royal prerogative because he thought that the royal prerogative could have no bounds what legal ties could bind a conscience so prejudiced or what effectual security could his people obtain against the obstinate malignity of such an opinion but entirely taking from him the power of the sword and enabling themselves to defend the laws he had passed  lord falklandthere is evidently too much truth in what you have said  but by taking from the king the power of the sword you in reality took all power  it was converting the government into a democracy and if he had submitted to it he would only have preserved the name of a king  the sceptre would have been held by those who had the sword or we must have lived in a state of perpetual anarchy without any force or balance in the government a state which could not have lasted long but would have ended in a republic or in absolute dominion  mr hampdenyour reasoning seems unanswerable  but what could we do let dr laud and those other court divines who directed the kings conscience and fixed in it such principles as made him unfit to govern a limited monarchythough with many good qualities and some great oneslet them i say answer for all the mischiefs they brought upon him and the nation  lord falklandthey were indeed much to blame but those principles had gained ground before their times and seemed the principles of our church in opposition to the jesuits who had certainly gone too far in the other extreme  mr hampdenit is a disgrace to our church to have taken up such opinions and i will venture to prophesy that our clergy in future times must renounce them or they will be turned against them by those who mean their destruction  suppose a popish king on the throne will the clergy adhere to passive obedience and nonresistance  if they do they deliver up their religion to rome if they do not their practice will confute their own doctrines  lord falklandnature sir will in the end be sure to set right whatever opinion contradicts her great laws let who will be the teacher but indeed the more i reflect on those miserable times in which we both lived the more i esteem it a favour of providence to us that we were cut off so soon  the most grievous misfortune that can befall a virtuous man is to be in such a state that he can hardly so act as to approve his own conduct  in such a state we both were  we could not easily make a step either forward or backward without great hazard of guilt or at least of dishonour  we were unhappily entangled in connections with men who did not mean so well as ourselves or did not judge so rightly  if we endeavoured to stop them they thought us false to the cause if we went on with them we ran directly upon rocks which we saw but could not avoid  nor could we take shelter in a philosophical retreat from business  inaction would in us have been cowardice and desertion  to complete the public calamities a religious fury on both sides mingled itself with the rage of our civil dissensions more frantic than that more implacable more averse to all healing measures  the most intemperate counsels were thought the most pious and a regard to the laws if they opposed the suggestions of these fiery zealots was accounted irreligion  this added new difficulties to what was before but too difficult in itself the settling of a nation which no longer could put any confidence in its sovereign nor lay more restraints on the royal authority without destroying the balance of the whole constitution  in those circumstances the balls that pierced our hearts were directed thither by the hands of our guardian angels to deliver us from horrors we could not support and perhaps from a guilt our souls abhorred  mr hampdenindeed things were brought to so deplorable a state that if either of us had seen his party triumphant he must have lamented that triumph as the ruin of his country  were i to return into life the experience i have had would make me very cautious how i kindled the sparks of civil war in england for i have seen that when once that devouring fire is lighted it is not in the power of the head of a party to say to the conflagration thus far shalt thou go and here shall thy violence stop  lord falklandthe conversation we have had as well as the reflections of my own mind on past events would if i were condemned to my body again teach me great moderation in my judgments of persons who might happen to differ from me in difficult scenes of public action they would entirely cure me of the spirit of party and make me think that as in the church so also in the state no evil is more to be feared than a rancorous and enthusiastical zeal    dialogue ii   louis le grandpeter the great  louiswho sir could have thought when you were learning the trade of a shipwright in the dockyards of england and holland that you would ever acquire as i had done the surname of great  peterwhich of us best deserved that title posterity will decide  but my greatness appeared sufficiently in that very act which seemed to you a debasement  louisthe dignity of a king does not stoop to such mean employments for my own part i was careful never to appear to the eyes of my subjects or foreigners but in all the splendour and majesty of royal power  peterhad i remained on the throne of russia as my ancestors did environed with all the pomp of barbarous greatness i should have been idolised by my peopleas much at least as you ever were by the french my despotism was more absolute their servitude was more humble  but then i could not have reformed their evil customs have taught them arts civility navigation and war have exalted them from brutes in human shapes into men  in this was seen the extraordinary force of my genius beyond any comparison with all other kings that i thought it no degradation or diminution of my greatness to descend from my throne and go and work in the dockyards of a foreign republic to serve as a private sailor in my own fleets and as a common soldier in my own army till i had raised myself by my merit in all the several steps and degrees of promotion up to the highest command and had thus induced my nobility to submit to a regular subordination in the sea and land service by a lesson hard to their pride and which they would not have learnt from any other master or by any other method of instruction  louisi am forced to acknowledge that it was a great act  when i thought it a mean one my judgment was perverted by the prejudices arising from my own education and the ridicule thrown upon it by some of my courtiers whose minds were too narrow to be able to comprehend the greatness of yours in that situation  peterit was an act of more heroism than any ever done by alexander or caesar  nor would i consent to exchange my glory with theirs  they both did great things but they were at the head of great nations far superior in valour and military skill to those with whom they contended i was the king of an ignorant undisciplined barbarous people  my enemies were at first so superior to my subjects that ten thousand of them could beat a hundred thousand russians  they had formidable navies i had not a ship  the king of sweden was a prince of the most intrepid courage assisted by generals of consummate knowledge in war and served by soldiers so disciplined that they were become the admiration and terror of europe  yet i vanquished these soldiers i drove that prince to take refuge in turkey i won battles at sea as well as land i new created my people i gave them arts science policy i enabled them to keep all the powers of the north in awe and dependence to give kings to poland to check and intimidate the ottoman emperors to mix with great weight in the affairs of all europe  what other man has ever done such wonders as these  read all the records of ancient and modern times and find if you can one fit to be put in comparison with me  louisyour glory would indeed have been supreme and unequalled if in civilising your subjects you had reformed the brutality of your own manners and the barbarous vices of your nature  but alas the legislator and reformer of the muscovites was drunken and cruel  petermy drunkenness i confess nor will i plead to excuse it the example of alexander  it inflamed the tempers of both which were by nature too fiery into furious passions of anger and produced actions of which our reason when sober was ashamed  but the cruelty you upbraid me with may in some degree be excused as necessary to the work i had to perform  fear of punishment was in the hearts of my barbarous subjects the only principle of obedience  to make them respect the royal authority i was obliged to arm it with all the terrors of rage  you had a more pliant people to governa people whose minds could be ruled like a finemanaged horse with an easy and gentle rein  the fear of shame did more with them than the fear of the knout could do with the russians the humanity of your character and the ferocity of mine were equally suitable to the nations over which we reigned  but what excuse can you find for the cruel violence you employed against your protestant subjects  they desired nothing but to live under the protection of laws you yourself had confirmed and they repaid that protection by the most hearty zeal for your service  yet these did you force by the most inhuman severities either to quit the religion in which they were bred and which their consciences still retained or to leave their native land and endure all the woes of a perpetual exile  if the rules of policy could not hinder you from thus depopulating your kingdom and transferring to foreign countries its manufactures and commerce i am surprised that your heart itself did not stop you  it makes one shudder to think that such orders should be sent from the most polished court in europe as the most savage tartars could hardly have executed without remorse and compassion  louisit was not my heart but my religion that dictated these severities  my confessor told me they alone would atone for all my sins  peterhad i believed in my patriarch as you believed in your priest i should not have been the great monarch that i was  but i mean not to detract from the merit of a prince whose memory is dear to his subjects they are proud of having obeyed you which is certainly the highest praise to a king  my people also date their glory from the era of my reign  but there is this capital distinction between us  the pomp and pageantry of state were necessary to your greatness i was great in myself great in the energy and powers of my mind great in the superiority and sovereignty of my soul over all other men    dialogue iii   platofenelon  platowelcome to elysium o thou the most pure the most gentle the most refined disciple of philosophy that the world in modern times has produced  sage fenelon welcomei need not name myself to you  our souls by sympathy must know one another  feneloni know you to be plato the most amiable of all the disciples of socrates and the philosopher of all antiquity whom i most desired to resemble  platohomer and orpheus are impatient to see you in that region of these happy fields which their shades inhabit  they both acknowledge you to be a great poet though you have written no verses  and they are now busy in composing for you unfading wreaths of all the finest and sweetest elysian flowers  but i will lead you from them to the sacred grove of philosophy on the highest hill of elysium where the air is most pure and most serene  i will conduct you to the fountain of wisdom in which you will see as in your own writings the fair image of virtue perpetually reflected  it will raise in you more love than was felt by narcissus when he contemplated the beauty of his own face in the unruffled spring  but you shall not pine as he did for a shadow  the goddess herself will affectionately meet your embraces and mingle with your soul  feneloni find you retain the allegorical and poetical style of which you were so fond in many of your writings  mine also run sometimes into poetry particularly in my telemachus which i meant to make a kind of epic composition  but i dare not rank myself among the great poets nor pretend to any equality in oratory with you the most eloquent of philosophers on whose lips the attic bees distilled all their honey  platothe french language is not so harmonious as the greek yet you have given a sweetness to it which equally charms the ear and heart  when one reads your compositions one thinks that one hears apollos lyre strung by the hands of the graces and tuned by the muses  the idea of a perfect king which you have exhibited in your telemachus far excels in my own judgment my imaginary republic  your dialogues breathe the pure spirit of virtue of unaffected good sense of just criticism of fine taste  they are in general as superior to your countryman fontenelles as reason is to false wit or truth to affectation  the greatest fault of them i think is that some are too short  fenelonit has been objected to themand i am sensible of it myselfthat most of them are too full of commonplace morals  but i wrote them for the instruction of a young prince and one cannot too forcibly imprint on the minds of those who are born to empire the most simple truths because as they grow up the flattery of a court will try to disguise and conceal from them those truths and to eradicate from their hearts the love of their duty if it has not taken there a very deep root  platoit is indeed the peculiar misfortune of princes that they are often instructed with great care in the refinements of policy and not taught the first principles of moral obligations or taught so superficially that the virtuous man is soon lost in the corrupt politician  but the lessons of virtue you gave your royal pupil are so graced by the charms of your eloquence that the oldest and wisest men may attend to them with pleasure  all your writings are embellished with a sublime and agreeable imagination which gives elegance to simplicity and dignity to the most vulgar and obvious truths  i have heard indeed that your countrymen are less sensible of the beauty of your genius and style than any of their neighbours  what has so much depraved their taste  fenelonthat which depraved the taste of the romans after the ago of augustusan immoderate love of wit of paradox of refinement  the works of their writers like the faces of their women must be painted and adorned with artificial embellishments to attract their regards  and thus the natural beauty of both is lost  but it is no wonder if few of them esteem my telemachus as the maxims i have principally inculcated there are thought by many inconsistent with the grandeur of their monarchy and with the splendour of a refined and opulent nation  they seem generally to be falling into opinions that the chief end of society is to procure the pleasures of luxury that a nice and elegant taste of voluptuous enjoyments is the perfection of merit and that a king who is gallant magnificent liberal who builds a fine palace who furnishes it well with good statues and pictures who encourages the fine arts and makes them subservient to every modish vice who has a restless ambition a perfidious policy and a spirit of conquest is better for them than a numa or a marcus aurelius  whereas to check the excesses of luxurythose excesses i mean which enfeeble the spirit of a nationto ease the people as much as is possible of the burden of taxes to give them the blessings of peace and tranquillity when they can he obtained without injury or dishonour to make them frugal and hardy and masculine in the temper of their bodies and minds that they may be the fitter for war whenever it does come upon them but above all to watch diligently over their morals and discourage whatever may defile or corrupt themis the great business of government and ought to be in all circumstances the principal object of a wise legislature  unquestionably that is the happiest country which has most virtue in it and to the eye of sober reason the poorest swiss canton is a much nobler state than the kingdom of france if it has more liberty better morals a more settled tranquillity more moderation in prosperity and more firmness in danger  platoyour notions are just and if your country rejects them she will not long hold the rank of the first nation in europe  her declension is begun her ruin approaches for omitting all other arguments can a state be well served when the raising of an opulent fortune in its service and making a splendid use of that fortune is a distinction more envied than any which arises from integrity in office or public spirit in government  can that spirit which is the parent of national greatness continue vigorous and diffusive where the desire of wealth for the sake of a luxury which wealth alone can support and an ambition aspiring not to glory but to profit are the predominant passions  if it exists in a king or a minister of state how will either of them find among a people so disposed the necessary instruments to execute his great designs or rather what obstruction will he not find from the continual opposition of private interest to public  but if on the contrary a court inclines to tyranny what a facility will be given by these dispositions to that evil purpose  how will men with minds relaxed by the enervating ease and softness of luxury have vigour to oppose it  will not most of them lean to servitude as their natural state as that in which the extravagant and insatiable cravings of their artificial wants may best be gratified at the charge of a bountiful master or by the spoils of an enslaved and ruined people  when all sense of public virtue is thus destroyed will not fraud corruption and avarice or the opposite workings of court factions to bring disgrace on each other ruin armies and fleets without the help of an enemy and give up the independence of the nation to foreigners after having betrayed its liberties to a king  all these mischiefs you saw attendant on that luxury which some modern philosophers account as i am informed the highest good to a state  time will show that their doctrines are pernicious to society pernicious to government and that yours tempered and moderated so as to render them more practicable in the present circumstances of your country are wise salutary and deserving of the general thanks of mankind  but lest you should think from the praise i have given you that flattery can find a place in elysium allow me to lament with the tender sorrow of a friend that a man so superior to all other follies could give into the reveries of a madame guyon a distracted enthusiast  how strange was it to see the two great lights of france you and the bishop of meaux engaged in a controversy whether a madwoman was a heretic or a saint  feneloni confess my own weakness and the ridiculousness of the dispute but did not your warm imagination carry you also into some reveries about divine love in which you talked unintelligibly even to yourself  platoi felt something more than i was able to express  feneloni had my feelings too as fine and as lively as yours but we should both have done better to have avoided those subjects in which sentiment took the place of reason    dialogue iv   mr addisondr swift  dr swiftsurely addison fortune was exceedingly inclined to play the fool a humour her ladyship as well as most other ladies of very great quality is frequently in when she made you a minister of state and me a divine  addisoni must confess we were both of us out of our elements but you dont mean to insinuate that all would have been right if our destinies had been reversed  swiftyes i do  you would have made an excellent bishop and i should have governed great britain as i did ireland with an absolute sway while i talked of nothing but liberty property and so forth  addisonyou governed the mob of ireland but i never understood that you governed the kingdom  a nation and a mob are very different things  swiftay so you fellows that have no genius for politics may suppose but there are times when by seasonably putting himself at the head of the mob an able man may get to the head of the nation  nay there are times when the nation itself is a mob and ought to be treated as such by a skilful observer  addisoni dont deny the truth of your proposition but is there no danger that from the natural vicissitudes of human affairs the favourite of the mob should be mobbed in his turn  swiftsometimes there may but i risked it and it answered my purpose  ask the lordlieutenants who were forced to pay court to me instead of my courting them whether they did not feel my superiority and if i could make myself so considerable when i was only a dirty dean of st patricks without a seat in either house of parliament what should i have done if fortune had placed me in england unencumbered with a gown and in a situation that would have enabled me to make myself heard in the house of lords or of commons  addisonyou would undoubtedly have done very marvellous acts  perhaps you might then have been as zealous a whig as my lord wharton himself or if the whigs had unhappily offended the statesman as they did the doctor who knows whether you might not have brought in the pretender pray let me ask you one question between you and me if your great talents had raised you to the office of first minister under that prince would you have tolerated the protestant religion or not  swiftha mr secretary are you witty upon me  do you think because sunderland took a fancy to make you a great man in the state that he or his master could make you as great in wit as nature made me no no wit is like grace it must be given from above  you can no more get that from the king than my lords the bishops can the other  and though i will own you had some yet believe me my good friend it was no match for mine  i think you have not vanity enough in your nature to pretend to a competition in that point with me  addisoni have been told by my friends that i was rather too modest so i will not determine this dispute for myself but refer it to mercury the god of wit who fortunately happens to be coming this way with a soul he has brought to the shades  hail divine hermes  a question of precedence in the class of wit and humour over which you preside having arisen between me and my countryman dr swift we beg leave  mercurydr swift i rejoice to see you  how does my old lad  how does honest lemuel gulliver  have you been in lilliput lately or in the flying island or with your good nurse glumdalclitch  pray when did you eat a crust with lord peter  is jack as mad still as ever  i hear that since you published the history of his case the poor fellow by more gentle usage is almost got well  if he had but more food he would be as much in his senses as brother martin himself but martin they tell me has lately spawned a strange brood of methodists moravians hutchinsonians who are madder than ever jack was in his worst days  it is a great pity you are not alive again to make a new edition of your tale of the tub for the use of these fellows  mr addison i beg your pardon i should have spoken to you sooner but i was so struck with the sight of my old friend the doctor that i forgot for a time the respects due to you  swiftaddison i think our dispute is decided before the judge has heard the cause  addisoni own it is in your favour but  mercurydont be discouraged friend addison  apollo perhaps would have given a different judgment  i am a wit and a rogue and a foe to all dignity  swift and i naturally like one another  he worships me more than jupiter and i honour him more than homer but yet i assure you i have a great value for you  sir roger de coverley will honeycomb will wimble the country gentleman in the freeholder and twenty more characters drawn with the finest strokes of unaffected wit and humour in your admirable writings have obtained for you a high place in the class of my authors though not quite so high a one as the dean of st patricks  perhaps you might have got before him if the decency of your nature and the cautiousness of your judgment would have given you leave  but allowing that in the force and spirit of his wit he has really the advantage how much does he yield to you in all the elegant graces in the fine touches of delicate sentiment in developing the secret springs of the soul in showing the mild lights and shades of a character in distinctly marking each line and every soft gradation of tints which would escape the common eye  who ever painted like you the beautiful parts of human nature and brought them out from under the shade even of the greatest simplicity or the most ridiculous weaknesses so that we are forced to admire and feel that we venerate even while we are laughing  swift was able to do nothing that approaches to this  he could draw an ill face or caricature a good one with a masterly hand but there was all his power and if i am to speak as a god a worthless power it is  yours is divine  it tends to exalt human nature  swiftpray good mercury if i may have liberty to say a word for myself do you think that my talent was not highly beneficial to correct human nature  is whipping of no use to mend naughty boys  mercurymen are generally not so patient of whipping as boys and a rough satirist is seldom known to mend them  satire like antimony if it be used as a medicine must be rendered less corrosive  yours is often rank poison  but i will allow that you have done some good in your way though not half so much as addison did in his  addisonmercury i am satisfied  it matters little what rank you assign me as a wit if you give me the precedence as a friend and benefactor to mankind  mercuryi pass sentence on the writers not the men and my decree is thiswhen any hero is brought hither who wants to be humbled let the talk of lowering his arrogance be assigned to swift  the same good office may be done to a philosopher vain of his wisdom and virtue or to a bigot puffed up with spiritual pride  the doctors discipline will soon convince the first that with all his boasted morality he is but a yahoo and the latter that to be holy he must necessarily be humble  i would also have him apply his anticosmetic wash to the painted face of female vanity and his rod which draws blood at every stroke to the hard back of insolent folly or petulant wit  but addison should be employed to comfort those whose delicate minds are dejected with too painful a sense of some infirmities in their nature  to them he should hold his fair and charitable mirror which would bring to their sight their hidden excellences and put them in a temper fit for elysiumadieu  continue to esteem and love each other as you did in the other world though you were of opposite parties and what is still more wonderful rival wits  this alone is sufficient to entitle you both to elysium    dialogue v   ulyssescircein circes island  circeyou will go then ulysses but tell me

inspired those verses and had tuned their lyres to infuse into the hearts of mankind the love of wisdom and virtue and the fear of the gods  how beneficent was she how tender to my people  what care did she take to instruct them in all the finer arts to relieve the necessities of the sick and aged to superintend the education of children to do my subjects every good office of kind intercession to

impetuosity that he put me out of my play and i could not prevent him from whipping me through the lungs  i died the next day as a man of honour should without any snivelling signs of contrition or repentance and he will follow me soon for his surgeon has declared his wounds to be mortal  it is said that his wife is dead of grief and that his family of seven children will be undone by his death

honour my honour to what infamy art thou fallen    dialogue vii   pliny the elderpliny the younger  pliny the elderthe account that you give me nephew of your behaviour amidst the tenors and perils that accompanied the first eruption of vesuvius does not please me much  there was more of vanity in it than of true magnanimity  nothing is great that is unnatural and affected  when the earth was shaking beneath you when the whole heaven was darkened with sulphurous clouds when all nature seemed falling into its final destruction to be reading livy and making extracts was an absurd affectation  to meet danger with courage is manly but to be insensible of it is brutal stupidity and to pretend insensibility where it cannot be supposed is ridiculous falseness  when you afterwards refused to leave your aged mother and save yourself without her you indeed acted nobly  it was also becoming a roman to keep up her spirits amidst all the horrors of that tremendous scene by showing yourself undismayed but the real merit and glory of this part of your behaviour is sunk by the other which gives an air of ostentation and vanity to the whole  pliny the youngerthat vulgar minds should consider my attention to my studies in such a conjuncture as unnatural and affected i should not much wonder but that you would blame it as such i did not apprehendyou whom no business could separate from the muses you who approached nearer to the fiery storm and died by the suffocating heat of the vapour  pliny the elderi died in doing my duty  let me recall to your remembrance all the particulars and then you shall judge yourself on the difference of your behaviour and mine  i was the prefect of the roman fleet which then lay at misenum  on the first account i received of the very unusual cloud that appeared in the air i ordered a vessel to carry me out to some distance from the shore that i might the better observe the phenomenon and endeavour to discover its nature and cause  this i did as a philosopher and it was a curiosity proper and natural to an inquisitive mind  i offered to take you with me and surely you should have gone for livy might have been read at any other time and such spectacles are not frequent  when i came out from my house i found all the inhabitants of misenum flying to the sea  that i might assist them and all others who dwelt on the coast i immediately commanded the whole fleet to put out and sailed with it all round the bay of naples steering particularly to those parts of the shore where the danger was greatest and from whence the affrighted people were endeavouring to escape with the most trepidation  thus i happily preserved some thousands of lives noting at the same time with an unshaken composure and freedom of mind the several phenomena of the eruption  towards night as we approached to the foot of mount vesuvius our galleys were covered with ashes the showers of which grew continually hotter and hotter then pumice stones and burnt and broken pyrites began to fall on our heads and we were stopped by the obstacles which the ruins of the volcano had suddenly formed by falling into the sea and almost filling it up on that part of the coast  i then commanded my pilot to steer to the villa of my friend pomponianus which you know was situated in the inmost recess of the bay  the wind was very favourable to carry me thither but would not allow him to put off from the shore as he was desirous to have done  we were therefore constrained to pass the night in his house  the family watched and i slept till the heaps of pumice stones which incessantly fell from the clouds that had by this time been impelled to that side of the bay rose so high in the area of the apartment i lay in that if i had stayed any longer i could not have got out and the earthquakes were so violent as to threaten every moment the fall of the house  we therefore thought it more safe to go into the open air guarding our heads as well as we were able with pillows tied upon them  the wind continuing contrary and the sea very rough we all remained on the shore till the descent of a sulphurous and fiery vapour suddenly oppressed my weak lungs and put an end to my life  in all this i hope that i acted as the duty of my station required and with true magnanimity  but on this occasion and in many other parts of your conduct i must say my dear nephew there was a mixture of vanity blended with your virtue which impaired and disgraced it  without that you would have been one of the worthiest men whom rome has over produced for none excelled you in sincere integrity of heart and greatness of sentiments  why would you lose the substance of glory by seeking the shadow  your eloquence had i think the same fault as your manners it was generally too affected  you professed to make cicero your guide and pattern but when one reads his panegyric upon julius caesar in his oration for marcellus and yours upon trajan the first seems the genuine language of truth and nature raised and dignified with all the majesty of the most sublime oratory the latter appears the harangue of a florid rhetorician more desirous to shine and to set off his own wit than to extol the great man whose virtues he was praising  pliny the youngeri will not question your judgment either of my life or my writings they might both have been better if i had not been too solicitous to render them perfect  it is perhaps some excuse for the affectation of my style that it was the fashion of the age in which i wrote  even the eloquence of tacitus however nervous and sublime was not unaffected  mine indeed was more diffuse and the ornaments of it were more tawdry but his laboured conciseness the constant glow of his diction and pointed brilliancy of his sentences were no less unnatural one principal cause of this i suppose to have been that as we despaired of excelling the two great masters of oratory cicero and livy in their own manner we took up another which to many appeared more shining and gave our compositions a more original air but it is mortifying to me to say much on this subject  permit me therefore to resume the contemplation of that on which our conversation turned before  what a direful calamity was the eruption of vesuvius which you have been describing  dont you remember the beauty of that fine coast and of the mountain itself before it was torn with the violence of those internal fires that forced their way through its surface  the foot of it was covered with cornfields and rich meadows interspersed with splendid villas and magnificent towns the sides of it were clothed with the best vines in italy  how quick how unexpected how terrible was the change all was at once overwhelmed with ashes cinders broken rocks and fiery torrents presenting to the eye the most dismal scene of horror and desolation  pliny the elderyou paint it very truly  but has it never occurred to your philosophical mind that this change is a striking emblem of that which must happen by the natural course of things to every rich luxurious state  while the inhabitants of it are sunk in voluptuousnesswhile all is smiling around them and they imagine that no evil no danger is nighthe latent seeds of destruction are fermenting within till breaking out on a sudden they lay waste all their opulence all their boasted delights and leave them a sad monument of the fatal effects of internal tempests and convulsions    dialogue viii   fernando cortezwilliam penn  cortezis it possible william penn that you should seriously compare your glory with mine  the planter of a small colony in north america presume to vie with the conqueror of the great mexican empire  pennfriend i pretend

know william penn that with less than six hundred spanish foot eighteen horse and a few small pieces of cannon i fought and defeated innumerable armies of very brave men dethroned an emperor who had been raised to the throne by his valour and excelled all his countrymen in the science of war as much as they excelled all the rest of the west indian nations  that i made him my prisoner in his own capital and after he had been deposed and slain by his subjects vanquished and took guatimozin his successor and accomplished my conquest of the whole empire of mexico which i loyally annexed to the spanish crown  dost thou not know that in doing these wonderful acts i showed as much courage as alexander the great as much prudence as caesar that by my policy i ranged under my banners the powerful commonwealth of tlascala and brought them to assist me in subduing the mexicans though with the loss of their own beloved independence and that to consummate my glory when the governor of cuba velasquez would have taken my command from me and sacrificed me to his envy and jealousy i drew from him all his forces and joined them to my own showing myself as superior to all other spaniards as i was to the indians  penni know very well that thou wast as fierce as a lion and as subtle as a serpent  the devil perhaps may place thee as high in his black list of heroes as alexander or caesar  it

cortezthe pope gave it to my master  pennthe devil offered to give our lord all the kingdoms of the earth and i suppose the pope as his vicar gave thy master this in return for which he fell down and

casuistry which it is not the business of a soldier to decide  we leave that to gownsmen  but pray mr penn what right had you to the province you settled  pennan honest right of fair purchase  we gave the native savages some things they wanted and they in return gave us lands they did not want  all was amicably agreed on not a drop of blood shed to stain our acquisition  cortezi am afraid there was a little fraud in the purchase  thy followers william penn are said to think cheating in a quiet and sober way no mortal sin  pennthe saints are always calumniated by the ungodly  but it was a sight which an angel might contemplate with delight to behold the colony i settled  to see us living with the indians like innocent lambs and taming the ferocity of their barbarous manners by the gentleness

mexico in that state  no thou hadst turned those delightful and populous regions into a deserta desert flooded with blood  dost thou not remember that most infernal scene when the noble emperor guatimozin was stretched out by thy soldiers upon hot burning coals to make him discover into what part of the lake of mexico he had thrown the royal treasures  are not his groans ever sounding in the ears of thy conscience  do not they rend thy hard heart and strike thee with more horror than the yells of the furies  cortezalas  i was not present when that dire act was done  had i been there i would have forbidden it  my nature was mild  pennthou wast the captain of that band of robbers who did this horrid deed  the advantage they had drawn from thy counsels and conduct enabled them to commit it and thy skill saved them afterwards from the vengeance that was due to so enormous a crime  the enraged mexicans would have properly punished them for it if they had not had thee for their general thou lieutenant of satan  cortezthe saints i find can rail william penn  but how do you hope to preserve this admirable colony which you have settled  your people you tell me live like innocent lambs  are there no wolves in north america to devour those lambs  but if the americans should continue in perpetual peace with all your successors there the french will not  are the inhabitants of pennsylvania to make war against them with prayers and preaching  if so that garden of god which you say you have planted will undoubtedly be their prey and they will take from you your property your laws and your religion  pennthe lords will be done  the lord will defend us against the rage of our enemies if it be his good pleasure  cortezis this the wisdom of a great legislator  i have heard some of your countrymen compare you to solon  did solon think you give laws to a people and leave those laws and that people at the mercy of every invader  the first business of legislature is to provide a military strength that may defend the whole system  if a house is built in a land of robbers without a gate to shut or a bolt or bar to secure it what avails it how wellproportioned or how commodious the architecture of it may be  is it richly furnished within the more it will tempt the hands of violence and of rapine to seize its wealth  the world william penn is all a land of robbers  any state or commonwealth erected therein must be well fenced and secured by good military institutions or the happier it is in all other respects the greater will be its danger the more speedy its destruction  perhaps the neighbouring english colonies may for a while protect yours but that precarious security cannot always preserve you  your plan of government must be changed or your colony will be lost  what i have said is also applicable to great britain itself  if an increase of its wealth be not accompanied with an increase of its force that wealth will become the prey of some of the neighbouring nations in which the martial spirit is more prevalent than the commercial  and whatever praise may be due to its civil institutions if they are not guarded by a wise system of military policy they will be found of no value being unable to prevent their own dissolution  pennthese are suggestions of human wisdom  the doctrines i held were inspired they came from above  cortezit is blasphemy to say that any folly could come from the fountain of wisdom  whatever is inconsistent with the great laws of nature and with the necessary state of human society cannot possibly have been inspired by god  selfdefence is as necessary to nations as to men and shall particulars have a right which nations have not  true religion william penn is the perfection of reason fanaticism is the disgrace the destruction of reason  pennthough what thou sayest should be true it does not come well from thy mouth  a papist talk of reason  go to the inquisition and tell them of reason and the great laws of nature  they will broil thee as thy soldiers broiled the unhappy guatimozin  why dost thou turn pale  is it the name of the inquisition or the name of guatimozin that troubles and affrights thee  o wretched man who madest thyself a voluntary instrument to carry into a newdiscovered world that hellish tribunal tremble and shake when thou thinkest that every murder the inquisitors have committed every torture they have inflicted on the innocent indians is originally owing to thee  thou must answer to god for all their inhumanity for all their injustice  what wouldst

selfexamination requires retirement    dialogue ix   marcus portius catomessalla corvinus  catooh messalla is it then possible that what some of our countrymen tell me should be true  is it possible that you could live the courtier of octavius that you could accept of employments and honours from him from the tyrant of your country you the brave the nobleminded the virtuous messalla you whom i remember my soninlaw brutus has frequently extolled as the most promising youth in rome tutored by philosophy trained up in arms scorning all those soft effeminate pleasures that reconcile men to an easy and indolent servitude fit for all the roughest tasks of honour and virtue fit to live or to die a free man  messallamarcus cato i revere both your life and your death but the last permit me to tell you did no good to your country and the former would have done more if you could have mitigated a little the sternness of your virtue i will not say of your pride  for my own part i adhered with constant integrity and unwearied zeal to the republic while the republic existed  i fought for her at philippi under the only commander who if he had conquered would have conquered for her not for himself when he was dead i saw that nothing remained to my country but the choice of a master  i chose the best  catothe best  what a man who had broken all laws who had violated all trusts who had led the armies of the commonwealth against antony and then joined with him and that sottish traitor lepidus to set up a triumvirate more execrable by far than either of the former who shed the best blood in rome by an inhuman proscription murdered even his own guardian murdered cicero to whose confidence too improvidently given he owed all his power  was this the master you chose  could you bring your tongue to give him the name of augustus  could you stoop to beg consulships and triumphs from him  oh shame to virtue  oh degeneracy of rome  to what infamy are her sons her noblest sons fallen  the thought of it pains me more than the wound that i died of it stabs my soul  messallamoderate cato the vehemence of your indignation  there has always been too much passion mixed with your virtue  the enthusiasm you are possessed with is a noble one but it disturbs your judgment hear me with patience and with the tranquillity that becomes a philosopher  it is true that octavius had done all you have said but it is no less true that in our circumstances he was the best master rome could choose  his mind was fitted by nature for empire  his understanding was clear and strong  his passions were cool and under the absolute command of his reason  his name gave him an authority over the troops and the people which no other roman could possess in an equal degree  he used that authority to restrain the excesses of both which it was no longer in the power of the senate to repress nor of any other general or magistrate in the state  he restored discipline in our armies the first means of salvation without which no legal government could have been formed or supported  he avoided all odious and invidious names  he maintained and respected those which time and long habits had endeared to the roman people  he permitted a generous liberty of speech he treated the nobles of pompeys party as well as those of his fathers if they did not themselves for factious purposes keep up the distinction  he formed a plan of government moderate decent respectable which left the senate its majesty and some of its power  he restored vigour and spirit to the laws he made new and good ones for the reformation of manners he enforced their execution he governed the empire with lenity justice and glory he humbled the pride of the parthians he broke the fierceness of the barbarous nations he gave to his country exhausted and languishing with the great loss of blood which she had sustained in the course of so many civil wars the blessing of peacea blessing which was become so necessary for her that without it she could enjoy no other  in doing these things i acknowledge he had my assistance  i am prouder of it and i think i can justify myself more effectually to my country than if i had died by my own hand at philippi believe me cato it is better to do some good than to project a great deal  a little practical virtue is of more use to society than the most sublime theory or the best principles of government ill applied  catoyet i must think it was beneath the character of messalla to join in supporting a government which though coloured and mitigated was still a tyranny  had you not better have gone into a voluntary exile where you would not have seen the face of the tyrant and where you might have quietly practised those private virtues which are all that the gods require from good men in certain situations  messallano i did much more good by continuing at rome  had augustus required of me anything base anything servile i would have gone into exile i would have died rather than do it  but he respected my virtue he respected my dignity he treated me as well as agrippa or as maecenas with this distinction alone that he never employed my sword but against foreign nations or the old enemies of the republic  catoit must i own have been a pleasure to be employed against antony that monster of vice who plotted the ruin of liberty and the raising of himself to sovereign power amidst the riot of bacchanals and in the embraces of harlots who when he had attained to that power delivered it up to a lascivious queen and would have made an egyptian strumpet the mistress of rome if the battle of actium had not saved us from that last of misfortunes  messallain that battle i had a considerable share  so i had in encouraging the liberal arts and sciences which augustus protected under his judicious patronage the muses made rome their capital seat  it would have pleased you to have known virgil horace tibullus ovid livy and many more whose names will be illustrious to all generations  catoi understand you messalla  your augustus and you after the ruin of our liberty made rome a greek city an academy of fine wits another athens under the government of demetrius phalareus  i had much rather have seen her under fabricius and curius and her other honest old consuls who could not read  messallayet to these writers she will owe as much of her glory as she did to those heroes  i could say more a great deal more on the happiness of the mild dominion of augustus  i might even add that the vast extent of the empire the factions of the nobility and the corruption of the people which no laws under the ordinary magistrates of the state were able to restrain seemed necessarily to require some change in the government that cato himself had he remained upon earth could have done us no good unless he would have yielded to become our prince  but i see you consider me as a deserter from the republic and an apologist for a tyrant  i therefore leave you to the company of those ancient romans for whose society you were always much fitter than for that of your contemporaries  cato should have lived with fabricius and curius not with pompey and caesar    dialogue x   christina queen of swedenchancellor oxenstiern  christinayou seem to avoid me oxenstiern and now we are met you dont pay me the reverence that is due to your queen

stockholm was paid to my dignity  that which i drew from the french and roman academies was paid to my talents  how much more glorious how much more delightful to an elegant and rational mind was the latter than the former  could you once have felt the joy the transport of my heart when i saw the greatest authors and all the celebrated artists in the most learned and civilised countries of europe

pleasures thou bestowest  i was thy votary  thou wast the god for whom i changed my religion  for thee i forsook my country and my throne  what compensation have i gained for all these sacrifices so lavishly so imprudently made  some puffs of incense from authors who thought their flattery due to the rank i had held or hoped to advance themselves by my recommendation or at best overrated my passion for literature and praised me to raise the value of those talents with which they were endowed  but in the esteem of wise men i stand very low and their esteem alone is the true measure of glory  nothing i perceive can give the mind a lasting joy but the consciousness of having performed our duty in that station which it has pleased the divine providence to assign to us  the glory of

tutelary gods the eyes of jupiter capitolinus with the sight of a queenan asiatic queenon the throne of the caesars  titusi did not  they judged of it as you scipio judge they detested they disdained it  in vain did i urge to some particular friends who represented to me the sense of the senate and people that a messalina a poppaea were a much greater dishonour to the throne of the caesars than a virtuous foreign princess  their prejudices were unconquerable i saw it would be impossible for me to remove them  but i might have used my authority to silence their murmurs  a liberal donative to the soldiers by whom i was fondly beloved would have secured their fidelity and consequently would have forced the senate and people to yield to my inclination  berenice knew this and with tears implored me not to sacrifice her happiness and my own to an unjust prepossession  shall i own it to you publius  my heart not only pitied her but acknowledged the truth and solidity of her reasons  yet so much did i abhor the idea of tyranny so much respect did i pay to the sentiments of my subjects that i determined to separate myself from her for ever rather than force either the laws or the prejudices of rome to submit to my will  scipiogive me thy hand noble titus  thou wast worthy of the empire and scipio africanus honours thy virtue  titusmy virtue can have no greater reward from the approbation of man  but o scipio think what anguish my heart must have felt when i took that resolution and when i communicated it to my dear my unhappy berenice  you saw the struggle of masinissa when you forced him to give up his beloved sophonisba  mine was a harder conflict  she had abandoned him to marry the king of numidia  he knew that her ruling passion was ambition not love  he could not rationally esteem her when she quitted a husband whom she had ruined who had lost his crown and his liberty in the cause of her country and for her sake to give her person to him the capital foe of that unfortunate husband  he must in spite of his passion have thought her a perfidious a detestable woman  but i esteemed berenice she deserved my esteem  i was certain she would not have accepted the empire from any other hand and had i been a private man she would have raised me to her throne  yet i had the fortitudei ought perhaps to say the hardness of heartto bid her depart from my sight depart for ever  what o publius was your conquest over yourself in giving back to her betrothed lover the celtiberian captive compared to this  indeed that was no conquest  i will not so dishonour the virtue of scipio as to think he could feel any struggle with himself on that account  a woman engaged to anotherengaged by affection as well as vows let her have been ever so beautifulcould raise in your heart no sentiments but compassion and friendship  to have violated her would have been an act of brutality which none but another tarquin could have committed  to have detained her from her husband would have been cruel  but where love is mutual where the object beloved suffers more in the separation than you do yourself to part with her is indeed a struggle  it is the hardest sacrifice a good heart can make to its duty  scipioi acknowledge that it is and yield you the palm  but i will own to you titus i never knew much of the tenderness you describe hannibal carthage rome the saving of my country the subduing of its rival these filled my thoughts and left no room there for those effeminate passions  i do not blame your sensibility but when i went to the capitol to talk with jove i never consulted him about love affairs  titusif my soul had been possessed by ambition alone i might possibly have been a greater man than i was but i should not have been more virtuous nor have gained the title i preferred to that of conqueror of judaea and emperor of rome in being called the delight of humankind    dialogue xii   henry duke of guisemachiavel  guiseavaunt thou fiend  i abhor thy sight  i look upon thee as the original cause of my death and of all the calamities brought upon the french nation in my fathers time and my own  machiaveli the cause of your death  you surprise me  guiseyes  your pernicious maxims of policy imported from florence with catherine of medicis your wicked disciple produced in france such a government such dissimulation such perfidy such violent ruthless counsels as threw that whole kingdom into the utmost confusion and ended my life even in the palace of my sovereign by the swords of assassins  machiavelwhoever may have a right to complain of my policy you sir have not  you owed your greatness to it and your deviating from it was the real cause of your death  if it had not been for the assassination of admiral coligni and the massacre of the huguenots the strength and power which the conduct of so able a chief would have given to that party after the death of your father its most dangerous enemy would have been fatal to your house nor could you even with all the advantage you drew from that great stroke of royal policy have acquired the authority you afterwards rose to in the kingdom of france but by pursuing my maxims by availing yourself of the specious name of religion to serve the secret purposes of your ambition and by suffering no restraint of fear or conscience not even the guilt of exciting a civil war to check the necessary progress of your wellconcerted designs  but on the day of the barricades you most imprudently let the king escape out of paris when you might have slain or deposed him  this was directly against the great rule of my politics not to stop short in rebellion or treason till the work is fully completed  and you were justly censured for it by pope sixtus quintus a more consummate politician who said you ought to have known that when a subject draws his sword against his king he should throw away the scabbard  you likewise deviated from my counsels by putting yourself in the power of a sovereign you had so much offended  why would you against all the cautions i had given expose your life in a loyal castle to the mercy of that prince  you trusted to his fear but fear insulted and desperate is often cruel  impute therefore your death not to any fault in my maxims but to your own folly in not having sufficiently observed them  guiseif neither i nor that prince had ever practised your maxims in any part of our conduct he would have reigned many years with honour and peace and i should have risen by my courage and talents to as high a pitch of greatness as it consisted with the duty of a subject to desire but your instructions led us on into those crooked paths out of which there was no retreat without great danger nor a possibility of advancing without being detested by all mankind and whoever is so has everything to fear from that detestation  i will give you a proof of this in the fate of a prince who ought to have been your hero instead of caesar borgia because he was incomparably a greater man and of all who ever lived seems to have acted most steadily according to the rules laid down by you i mean richard iii king of england  he stopped at no crime that could be profitable to him he was a dissembler a hypocrite a murderer in cool blood  after the death of his brother he gained the crown by cutting off without pity all who stood in his way  he trusted no man any further than helped his own purposes and consisted with his own safety  he liberally rewarded all services done him but would not let the remembrance of them atone for offences or save any man from destruction who obstructed his views  nevertheless though his nature shrunk from no wickedness which could serve his ambition he possessed and exercised all those virtues which you recommend to the practice of your prince  he was bold and prudent in war just and strict in the general administration of his government and particularly careful by a vigorous execution of the laws to protect the people against injuries or oppressions from the great  in all his actions and words there constantly appeared the highest concern for the honour of the nation  he was neither greedy of wealth that belonged to other men nor profuse of his own but knew how to give and where to save  he professed a most edifying sense of religion pretended great zeal for the reformation of manners and was really an example of sobriety chastity and temperance in the whole course of his life  nor did he shed any blood but of those who were such obstacles in his way to dominion as could not possibly be removed by any other means  this was a prince after your heart yet mark his end  the horror his crimes had excited in the minds of his subjects and the detestation it produced were so pernicious to him that they enabled an exile who had no right to the crown and whose abilities were much inferior to his to invade his realm and destroy him  machiavelthis example i own may seem to be of some weight against the truth of my system  but at the same time it demonstrates that there was nothing so new in the doctrines i published as to make it reasonable to charge me with the disorders and mischiefs which since my time any kingdom may have happened to suffer from the ambition of a subject or the tyranny of a prince  human nature wants no teaching to render it wicked in courts more especially there has been from the first institution of monarchies a policy practised not less repugnant than mine to the narrow and vulgar laws of humanity and religion  why should i be singled out as worse than other statesmen  guisethere have been it must be owned in all ages and all states many wicked politicians but thou art the first that ever taught the science of tyranny reduced it to rules and instructed his disciples how to acquire and secure it by treachery perjuries assassinations proscriptions and with a particular caution not to be stopped in the progress of their crimes by any check of the conscience or feeling of the heart but to push them as far as they shall judge to be necessary to their greatness and safety  it is this which has given thee a preeminence in guilt over all other statesmen  machiavelif you had read my book with candour you would have perceived that i did not desire to render men either tyrants or rebels but only showed if they were so what conduct in such circumstances it would be rational and expedient for them to observe  guisewhen you were a minister of state in florence if any chemist or physician had published a treatise to instruct his countrymen in the art of poisoning and how to do it with the most certain destruction to others and security to themselves would you have allowed him to plead in his justification that he did not desire men to poison their neighbours but if they would use such evil means of mending their fortunes there could surely be no harm in letting them know what were the most effectual poisons and by what methods they might give them without being discovered  would you have thought it a sufficient apology for him that he had dropped in his preface or here and there in his book a sober exhortation against the committing of murder  without all doubt as a magistrate concerned for the safety of the people of florence you would have punished the wretch with the utmost severity and taken great care to destroy every copy of so pernicious a book  yet your own admired work contains a more baneful and more infernal art  it poisons states and kingdoms and spreads its malignity like a general pestilence over the whole world  machiavelyou must acknowledge at least that my discourses on livy are full of wise and virtuous maxims and precepts of government  guisethis i think rather aggravates than alleviates your guilt how could you study and comment upon livy with so acute and profound an understanding and afterwards write a book so absolutely repugnant to all the lessons of policy taught by that sage and moral historian  how could you who had seen the picture of virtue so amiably drawn by his hand and who seemed yourself to be sensible of all its charms fall in love with a fury and set up her dreadful image as an object of worship to princes  machiaveli was seduced by vanity  my heart was formed to love virtue  but i wanted to be thought a greater genius in politics than aristotle or plato  vanity sir is a passion as strong in authors as ambition in princes or rather it is the same passion exerting itself differently  i was a duke of guise in the republic of letters  guisethe bad influences of your guilt have reached further than mine and been more lasting  but heaven be praised your credit is at present much declining in europe  i have been told by some shades who are lately arrived here that the ablest statesman of his time a king with whose fame the world is filled has answered your book and confuted all the principles of it with a noble scorn and abhorrence  i am also assured that in england there is a great and good king whose whole life has been a continued opposition to your evil system who has hated all cruelty all fraud all falseness whose word has been sacred whose honour inviolate who has made the laws of his kingdom the rules of his government and good faith and a regard for the liberty of mankind the principles of his conduct with respect to foreign powers who reigns more absolutely now in the hearts of his people and does greater things by the confidence they place in him and by the efforts they make from the generous zeal of affection than any monarch ever did or ever will do by all the arts of iniquity which you recommended    dialogue xiii   virgilhoracemercuryscaliger the elder  virgilmy dear horace your company is my greatest delight even in the elysian fields  no wonder it was so when we lived together in rome never had man so genteel so agreeable so easy a wit or a temper so pliant to the inclinations of others in the intercourse of society  and then such integrity such fidelity such generosity in your nature  a soul so free from all envy so benevolent so sincere so placable in its anger so warm and constant in its affections  you were as necessary to maecenas as he to augustus  your conversation sweetened to him all the cares of his ministry your gaiety cheered his drooping spirits and your counsels assisted him when he wanted advice  for you were capable my dear horace of counselling statesmen  your sagacity your discretion your secrecy your clear judgment in all affairs recommended you to the confidence not of maecenas alone but of augustus himself which you nobly made use of to serve your old friends of the republican party and to confirm both the minister and the prince in their love of mild and moderate measures yet with a severe restraint of licentiousness the most dangerous enemy to the whole commonwealth under any form of government  horaceto be so praised by virgil would have put me in elysium while i was alive  but i know your modesty will not suffer me in return for these encomiums to speak of your character  supposing it as perfect as your poems you would think as you did of them that it wanted correction  virgildont talk of my modesty  how much greater was yours when you disclaimed the name of a poet you whose odes are so noble so harmonious so sublime  horacei felt myself too inferior to the dignity of that name  virgili think you did like augustus when he refused to accept the title of king but kept all the power with which it was ever attended even in your epistles and satires where the poet was concealed as much as he could be you may properly be compared to a prince in disguise or in his hours of familiarity with his intimate friends the pomp and majesty were let drop but the greatness remained  horacewell i will not contradict you and to say the truth i should do it with no very good grace because in some of my odes i have not spoken so modestly of my own poetry as in my epistles  but to make you know your preeminence over me and all writers of latin verse i will carry you to quintilian the best of all roman critics who will tell you in what rank you ought to be placed  virgili fear his judgment of me was biassed by your commendation but who is this shade that mercury is conducting  i never saw one that stalked with so much pride or had such ridiculous arrogance expressed in his looks  horacethey come towards us  hail mercury  what is this stranger with you  mercuryhis name is julius caesar scaliger and he is by profession a critic  horacejulius caesar scaliger  he was i presume a dictator in criticism  mercuryyes and he has exercised his sovereign power over you  horacei will not presume to oppose it  i had enough of following brutus at philippi  mercurytalk to him a little  hell amuse you  i brought him to you on purpose  horacevirgil do you accost him  i cant do it with proper gravity i shall laugh in his face  virgilsir may i ask for what reason you cast your eyes so superciliously upon horace and me  i dont remember that augustus ever looked down upon us with such an air of superiority when we were his subjects  scaligerhe was only a sovereign over your bodies and owed his power to violence and usurpation  but i have from nature an absolute dominion over the wit of all authors who are subjected to me as the greatest of critics or hypercritics  virgilyour jurisdiction great sir is very extensive  and what judgments have you been pleased to pass upon us  scaligeris it possible you should be ignorant of my decrees  i have placed you virgil above homer whom i have shown to be  virgilhold sir  no blasphemy against my master  horacebut what have you said of me  scaligeri have said that i had rather have written the little dialogue between you and lydia than have been made king of arragon  horaceif we were in the other world you should give me the kingdom and take both the ode and the lady in return  but did you always pronounce so favourably for us  scaligersend for my works and read them  mercury will bring them to you with the first learned ghost that arrives here from europe  there is instruction for you in them  i tell you of your faults  but it was my whim to commend that little ode and i never do things by halves  when i give praise i give it liberally to show my royal bounty  but i generally blame to exert all the vigour of my censorian power and keep my subjects in awe  horaceyou did not confine your sovereignty to poets you exercised it no doubt over all other writers  scaligeri was a poet a philosopher a statesman an orator an historian a divine without doing the drudgery of any of these but only censuring those who did and showing thereby the superiority of my genius over them all  horacea short way indeed to universal fame  and i suppose you were very peremptory in your decisions  scaligerperemptory ay  if any man dared to contradict my opinions i called him a dunce a rascal a villain and frightened him out of his wits  virgilbut what said others to this method of disputation  scaligerthey generally believed me because of the confidence of my assertions and thought i could not be so insolent or so angry if i was not absolutely sure of being in the right  besides in my controversies i had a great help from the language in which i wrote  for one can scold and call names with a much better grace in latin than in french or any tame modern tongue  horacehave not i heard that you pretended to derive your descent from the princes of verona  scaligerpretended  do you presume to deny it  horacenot i indeed  genealogy is not my science  if you should claim to descend in a direct line from king midas i would not dispute it  virgili wonder scaliger that you stooped to so low an ambition was it not greater to reign over all mount parnassus than over a petty state in italy  scaligeryou say well  i was too condescending to the prejudices of vulgar opinion  the ignorant multitude imagine that a prince is a greater man than a critic  their folly made me desire to claim kindred with the scalas of verona  horacepray mercury how do you intend to dispose of this august person  you cant think it proper to let him remain with us  he must be placed with the demigods he must go to olympus  mercurybe not afraid  he shall not trouble you long  i brought him hither to divert you with the sight of an animal you never had seen and myself with your surprise  he is the chief of all the modern critics the most renowned captain of that numerous and dreadful band  whatever you may think of him i can seriously assure you that before he went mad he had good parts and great learning  but i will now explain to you the original cause of the absurdities he has uttered  his mind was formed in such a manner that like some perspective glasses it either diminished or magnified all objects too much but above all others it magnified the good man to himself  this made him so proud that it turned his brain  now i have had my sport with him i think it will be charity to restore him to his senses or rather to bestow what nature denied hima sound judgment  come hither scaliger  by this touch of my caduceus i give thee power to see things as they are and among others thyself look gentlemen how his countenance is fallen in a moment  hear what he says  he is talking to himself  scaligerbless me with what persons have i been discoursing  with virgil and horace  how could i venture to open my lips in their presence  good mercury i beseech you let me retire from a company for which i am very unfit  let me go and hide my head in the deepest shade of that grove which i see in the valley  after i have performed a penance there i will crawl on my knees to the feet of those illustrious shades and beg them to see me burn my impertinent books of criticism in the fiery billows of phlegethon with my own hands  mercurythey will both receive thee into favour  this mortification of truly knowing thyself is a sufficient atonement for thy former presumption    dialogue xiv   boileaupope  boileaumr pope you have done me great honour  i am told that you made me your model in poetry and walked on parnassus in the same paths which i had trod  popewe both followed horace but in our manner of imitation and in the turn of our natural genius there was i believe much resemblance we both were too irritable and too easily hurt by offences even from the lowest of men  the keen edge of our wit was frequently turned against those whom it was more a shame to contend with than an honour to vanquish  boileauyes  but in general we were the champions of good morals good sense and good learning  if our love of these was sometimes heated into anger against those who offended them no less than us is that anger to be blamed  popeit would have been nobler if we had not been parties in the quarrel  our enemies observe that neither our censure nor our praise was always impartial  boileauit might perhaps have been better if in some instances we had not praised or blamed so much  but in panegyric and satire moderation is insipid  popemoderation is a cold unpoetical virtue  mere historical truth is better written in prose  and therefore i think you did judiciously when you threw into the fire your history of louis le grand and trusted his fame to your poems  boileauwhen those poems were published that monarch was the idol of the french nation  if you and i had not known in our occasional compositions how to speak to the passions as well as to the sober reason of mankind we should not have acquired that despotic authority in the empire of wit which made us so formidable to all the inferior tribe of poets in england and france  besides sharp satirists want great patrons  popeall the praise which my friends received from me was unbought in this at least i may boast a superiority over the pensioned boileau  boileaua pension in france was an honourable distinction  had you been a frenchman you would have ambitiously sought it had i been an englishman i should have proudly declined it  if our merit in other respects be not unequal this difference will not set me much below you in the temple of virtue or of fame  popeit is not for me to draw a comparison between our works  but if i may believe the best critics who have talked to me on the subject my rape of the lock is not inferior to your lutrin and my art of criticism may well be compared with your art of poetry my ethic epistles are esteemed at least equal to yours and my satires much better  boileauhold mr pope  if there is really such a sympathy in our natures as you have supposed there may be reason to fear that if we go on in this manner comparing our works we shall not part in good friendship  popeno no the mild air of the elysian fields has mitigated my temper as i presume it has yours  but in truth our reputations are nearly on a level  our writings are admired almost equally as i hear for energy and justness of thought  we both of us carried the beauty of our diction and the harmony of our numbers to the highest perfection that our languages would admit  our poems were polished to the utmost degree of correctness yet without losing their fire or the agreeable appearance of freedom and ease  we borrowed much from the ancients though you i believe more than i but our imitations to use an expression of your own had still an original air  boileaui will confess sir to show you that the elysian climate has had its effects upon me i will fairly confess without the least ill humour that in your eloisa to abelard your verses to the memory of an unfortunate lady and some others you wrote in your youth there is more fire of poetry than in any of mine  you excelled in the pathetic which i never approached  i will also allow that you hit the manner of horace and the sly delicacy of his wit more exactly than i or than any other man who has written since his time  nor could i nor did even lucretius himself make philosophy so poetical and embellish it with such charms as you have given to that of plato or to speak more properly of some of his modern disciples in your celebrated essay on man  popewhat do you think of my homer  boileauyour homer is the most spirited the most poetical the most elegant and the most pleasing translation that ever was made of any ancient poem though not so much in the manner of the original or so exactly agreeable to the sense in all places as might perhaps be desired  but when i consider the years you spent in this work and how many excellent original poems you might with less difficulty have produced in that time i cant but regret that your talents were thus employed  a great poet so tied down to a tedious translation is a columbus chained to an oar  what new regions of fancy full of treasures yet untouched might you have explored if you had been at liberty to have boldly expanded your sails and steered your own course under the conduct and direction of your own genius  but i am still more angry with you for your edition of shakespeare  the office of an editor was below you and your mind was unfit for the drudgery it requires  would anybody think of employing a raphael to clean an old picture  popethe principal cause of my undertaking that task was zeal for the honour of shakespeare and if you knew all his beauties as well as i you would not wonder at this zeal  no other author had ever so copious so bold so creative an imagination with so perfect a knowledge of the passions the humours and sentiments of mankind  he painted all characters from kings down to peasants with equal truth and equal force  if human nature were destroyed and no monument were left of it except his works other beings might know what man was from those writings  boileauyou say he painted all characters from kings down to peasants with equal truth and equal force  i cant deny that he did so but i wish he had not jumbled those characters together in the composition of his pictures as he has frequently done  popethe strange mixture of tragedy comedy and farce in the same play nay sometimes in the same scene i acknowledge to be quite inexcusable  but this was the taste of the times when shakespeare wrote  boileaua great genius ought to guide not servilely follow the taste of his contemporaries  popeconsider from how thick a darkness of barbarism the genius of shakespeare broke forth  what were the english and what let me ask you were the french dramatic performances in the age when he nourished the advances he made towards the highest perfection both of tragedy and comedy are amazing  in the principal points in the power of exciting terror and pity or raising laughter in an audience none yet has excelled him and very few have equalled  boileaudo you think that he was equal in comedy to moliere  popein comic force i do but in the fine and delicate strokes of satire and what is called genteel comedy he was greatly inferior to that admirable writer  there is nothing in him to compare with the misanthrope the ecole des femmes or tartuffe  boileauthis mr pope is a great deal for an englishman to acknowledge  a veneration for shakespeare seems to be a part of your national religion and the only part in which even your men of sense are fanatics  popehe who can read shakespeare and be cool enough for all the accuracy of sober criticism has more of reason than taste  boileaui join with you in admiring him as a prodigy of genius though i find the most shocking absurdities in his playsabsurdities which no critic of my nation can pardon  popewe will be satisfied with your feeling the excellence of his beauties  but you would admire him still more if you could see the chief characters in all his test tragedies represented by an actor who appeared on the stage a little before i left the world  he has shown the english nation more excellencies in shakespeare than the quickest wits could discern and has imprinted them on the heart with a livelier feeling than the most sensible natures had ever experienced without his help  boileauthe variety spirit and force of mr garricks action have been much praised to me by many of his countrymen whose shades i converse with and who agree in speaking of him as we do of baron our most natural and most admired actor  i have also heard of another who has now quitted the stage but who had filled with great dignity force and elevation some tragic parts and excelled so much in the comic that none ever has deserved a higher applause  popemr quin was indeed a most perfect comedian  in the part of falstaff particularly wherein the utmost force of shakespeares humour appears he attained to such perfection that he was not an actor he was the man described by shakespeare he was falstaff himself  when i saw him do it the pleasantry of the fat knight appeared to me so bewitching all his vices were so mirthful that i could not much wonder at his having seduced a young prince even to rob in his company  boileauthat character is not well understood by the french they suppose it belongs not to comedy but to farce whereas the english see in it the finest and highest strokes of wit and humour  perhaps these different judgments may be accounted for in some measure by the diversity of manners in different countries  but dont you allow mr pope that our writers both of tragedy and comedy are upon the whole more perfect masters of their art than yours  if you deny it i will appeal to the athenians the only judges qualified to decide the dispute  i will refer it to euripides sophocles and menander  popei am afraid of those judges for i see them continually walking handinhand and engaged in the most friendly conversation with corneille racine and moliere  our dramatic writers seem in general not so fond of their company they sometimes shove rudely by them and give themselves airs of superiority  they slight their reprimands and laugh at their preceptsin short they will be tried by their country alone and that judicature is partial  boileaui will press this question no further  but let me ask you to which of our rival tragedians racine and corneille do you give the preference  popethe sublimest plays of corneille are in my judgment equalled by the athalia of racine and the tender passions are certainly touched by that elegant and most pathetic writer with a much finer hand  i need not add that he is infinitely more correct than corneille and more harmonious and noble in his versification  corneille formed himself entirely upon lucan but the master of racine was virgil  how much better a taste had the former than the latter in choosing his model  boileaumy friendship with racine and my partiality for his writings make me hear with great pleasure the preference given to him above corneille by so judicious a critic  popethat he excelled his competitor in the particulars i have mentioned cant i think be denied  but yet the spirit and the majesty of ancient rome were never so well expressed as by corneille  nor has any other french dramatic writer in the general character of his works shown such a masculine strength and greatness of thought  racine is the swan described by ancient poets which rises to the clouds on downy wings and sings a sweet but a gentle and plaintive note  corneille is the eagle which soars to the skies on bold and sounding pinions and fears not to perch on the sceptre of jupiter or to bear in his pounces the lightning of the god  boileaui am glad to find mr pope that in praising corneille you run into poetry which is not the language of sober criticism though sometimes used by longinus  popei caught the fire from the idea of corneille  boileauhe has bright flashes yet i think that in his thunder there is often more noise than fire  dont you find him too declamatory too turgid too unnatural even in his best tragedies  popei own i do yet the greatness and elevation of his sentiments and the nervous vigour of his sense atone in my opinion for all his faults  but let me now in my turn desire your opinion of our epic poet milton  boileaulonginus perhaps would prefer him to all other writers for he surpasses even homer in the sublime but other critics who require variety and agreeableness and a correct regularity of thought and judgment in an epic poem who can endure no absurdities no extravagant fictions would place him far below virgil  popehis genius was indeed so vast and sublime that his poem seems beyond the limits of criticism as his subject is beyond the limits of nature  the bright and excessive blaze of poetical fire which shines in so many parts of the paradise lost will hardly permit the dazzled eye to see its faults  boileauthe taste of your countrymen is much changed since the days of charles ii when dryden was thought a greater poet than milton  popethe politics of milton at that time brought his poetry into disgrace for it is a rule with the english they see no good in a man whose politics they dislike but as their notions of government are apt to change men of parts whom they have slighted become their favourite authors and others who have possessed their warmest admiration are in their turn undervalued  this revolution of favour was experienced by dryden as well as milton he lived to see his writings together with his politics quite out of fashion  but even in the days of his highest prosperity when the generality of the people admired his almanzor and thought his indian emperor the perfection of tragedy the duke of buckingham and lord rochester the two wittiest noblemen our country has produced attacked his fame and turned the rants of his heroes the jargon of his spirits and the absurdity of his plots into just ridicule  boileauyou have made him good amends by the praise you have given him in some of your writings  popei owed him that praise as my master in the art of versification yet i subscribe to the censures which have been passed by other writers on many of his works  they are good critics but he is still a great poet  you sir i am sure must particularly admire him as an excellent satirist his absalom and achitophel is a masterpiece in that way of writing and his mac flecno is i think inferior to it in nothing but the meanness of the subject  boileaudid not you take the model of your dunciad from the latter of those very ingenious satires  popei did but my work is more extensive than his and my imagination has taken in it a greater scope  boileausome critics may doubt whether the length of your poem was so properly suited to the meanness of the subject as the brevity of his three cantos to expose a dunce crowned with laurel  i have not given above three lines to the author of the pucelle  popemy intention was to expose not one author alone but all the dulness and false taste of the english nation in my times  could such a design be contracted into a narrower compass  boileauwe will not dispute on this point nor whether the hero of your dunciad was really a dunce  but has not dryden been accused of immorality and profaneness in some of his writings  popehe has with too much reason and i am sorry to say that all our best comic writers after shakespeare and johnson except addison and steele are as liable as he to that heavy charge  fletcher is shocking etheridge wycherley congreve vanbrugh and farquhar have painted the manners of the times in which they wrote with a masterly hand but they are too often such manners that a virtuous man and much more a virtuous woman must be greatly offended at the representation  boileauin this respect our stage is far preferable to yours  it is a school of morality  vice is exposed to contempt and to hatred  no false colours are laid on to conceal its deformity but those with which it paints itself are there taken off  popeit is a wonderful thing that in france the comic muse should be the gravest lady in the nation  of late she is so grave that one might almost mistake her for her sister melpomene  moliere made her indeed a good moral philosopher but then she philosophised like democritus with a merry laughing face  now she weeps over vice instead of showing it to mankind as i think she generally ought to do in ridiculous lights  boileauher business is more with folly than with vice and when she attacks the latter it should be rather with ridicule than invective  but sometimes she may be allowed to raise her voice and change her usual smile into a frown of just indignation  popei like her best when she smiles  but did you never reprove your witty friend la fontaine for the vicious levity that appears in many of his tales  he was as guilty of the crime of debauching the muses as any of our comic poets  boileaui own he was and bewail the prostitution of his genius as i should that of an innocent and beautiful country girl  he was all nature all simplicity yet in that simplicity there was a grace and unaffected vivacity with a justness of thought and easy elegance of expression that can hardly be found in any other writer  his manner is quite original and peculiar to himself though all the matter of his writings is borrowed from others  popein that manner he has been imitated by my friend mr prior  boileauhe has very successfully  some of priors tales have the spirit of la fontaines with more judgment but not i think with such an amiable and graceful simplicity  popepriors harp had more strings than la fontaines  he was a fine poet in many different ways la fontaine but in one  and though in some of his tales he imitated that author his alma was an original and of singular beauty  boileauthere is a writer of heroic poetry who lived before milton and whom some of your countrymen place in the highest class of your poets though he is little known in france  i see him sometimes in company with homer and virgil but oftener with tasso ariosto and dante  popei understand you mean spenser  there is a force and beauty in some of his images and descriptions equal to any in those writers you have seen him converse with  but he had not the art of properly shading his pictures  he brings the minute and disagreeable parts too much into sight and mingles too frequently vulgar and mean ideas with noble and sublime  had he chosen a subject proper for epic poetry he seems to have had a sufficient elevation and strength in his genius to make him a great epic poet but the allegory which is continued throughout the whole work fatigues the mind and cannot interest the heart so much as those poems the chief actors in which are supposed to have really existed  the syrens and circe in the odyssey are allegorical persons but ulysses the hero of the poem was a man renowned in greece which makes the account of his adventures affecting and delightful  to be now and then in fairyland among imaginary beings is a pleasing variety and helps to distinguish the poet from the orator or historian but to be always there is irksome  boileauis not spenser likewise blamable for confounding the christian with the pagan theology in some parts of his poem  popeyes he had that fault in common with dante with ariosto and with camoens  boileauwho is the poet that arrived soon after you in elysium whom i saw spenser lead in and present to virgil as the author of a poem resembling the georgics  on his head was a garland of the several kinds of flowers that blow in each season with evergreens intermixed  popeyour description points out thomson  he painted nature exactly and with great strength of pencil  his imagination was rich extensive and sublime his diction bold and glowing but sometimes obscure and affected  nor did he always know when to stop or what to reject  boileaui should suppose that he wrote tragedies upon the greek model  for he is often admitted into the grove of euripides  popehe enjoys that distinction both as a tragedian and as a moralist  for not only in his plays but all his other works there is the purest morality animated by piety and rendered more touching by the fine and delicate sentiments of a most tender and benevolent heart  boileaust evremond has brought me acquainted with waller  i was surprised to find in his writings a politeness and gallantry which the french suppose to be appropriated only to theirs  his genius was a composition which is seldom to be met with of the sublime and the agreeable  in his comparison between himself and apollo as the lover of daphne and in that between amoret and sacharissa there is a finesse and delicacy of wit which the most elegant of our writers have never exceeded  nor had sarrazin or voiture the art of praising more genteelly the ladies they admired  but his epistle to cromwell and his poem on the death of that extraordinary man are written with a force and greatness of manner which give him a rank among the poets of the first class  popemr waller was unquestionably a very fine writer  his muse was as well qualified as the graces themselves to dress out a venus and he could even adorn the brows of a conqueror with fragrant and beautiful wreaths  but he had some puerile and low thoughts which unaccountably mixed with the elegant and the noble like schoolboys or a mob admitted into a palace  there was also an intemperance and a luxuriancy in his wit which he did not enough restrain  he wrote little to the understanding and less to the heart but he frequently delights the imagination and sometimes strikes it with flashes of the highest sublime  we had another poet of the age of charles i extremely admired by all his contemporaries in whose works there is still more affectation of wit a greater redundancy of imagination a worse taste and less judgment but he touched the heart more and had finer feelings than waller  i mean cowley  boileaui have been often solicited to admire his writings by his learned friend dr spratt  he seems to me a great wit and a very amiable man but not a good poet  popethe spirit of poetry is strong in some of his odes but in the art of poetry he is always extremely deficient  boileaui hear that of late his reputation is much lowered in the opinion of the english  yet i cannot but think that if a moderate portion of the superfluities of his wit were given by apollo to some of their modern bards who write commonplace morals in very smooth verse without any absurdity but without a single new thought or one enlivening spark of imagination it would be a great favour to them and do them more service than all the rules laid down in my art of poetry and yours of criticism  popei am much of your mind  but i left in england some poets whom you i know will admire not only for the harmony and correctness of style but the spirit and genius you will find in their writings  boileaufrance too has produced some very excellent writers since the time of my death  of one particularly i hear wonders  fame to him is as kind as if he had been dead a thousand years  she brings his praises to me from all parts of europe  you know i speak of voltaire  popei do the english nation yields to none in admiration of his extensive genius  other writers excel in some one particular branch of wit or science but when the king of prussia drew voltaire from paris to berlin he had a whole academy of belles lettres in him alone  boileauthat prince himself has such talents for poetry as no other monarch in any age or country has ever possessed  what an astonishing compass must there be in his mind what an heroic tranquillity and firmness in his heart that he can in the evening compose an ode or epistle in the most elegant verse and the next morning fight a battle with the conduct of caesar or gustavus adolphus  popei envy voltaire so noble a subject both for his verse and his prose  but if that prince will write his own commentaries he will want no historian  i hope that in writing them he will not restrain his pen as caesar has done to a mere account of his wars but let us see the politician and the benignant protector of arts and sciences as well as the warrior in that picture of himself  voltaire has shown us that the events of battles and sieges are not the most interesting parts of good history but that all the improvements and embellishments of human society ought to be carefully and particularly recorded there  boileauthe progress of arts and knowledge and the great changes that have happened in the manners of mankind are objects far more worthy of a leaders attention than the revolutions of fortune  and it is chiefly to voltaire that we owe this instructive species of history  popehe has not only been the father of it among the moderns but has carried it himself to its utmost perfection  boileauis he not too universal  can any writer be exact who is so comprehensive  popea traveller round the world cannot inspect every region with such an accurate care as exactly to describe each single part  if the outlines are well marked and the observations on the principal points are judicious it is all that can be required  boileaui would however advise and exhort the french and english youth to take a fuller survey of some particular provinces and to remember that although in travels of this sort a lively imagination is a very agreeable companion it is not the best guide  to speak without a metaphor the study of history both sacred and profane requires a critical and laborious investigation  the composer of a set of lively and witty remarks on facts illexamined or incorrectly delivered is not an historian  popewe cannot i think deny that name to the author of the life of charles xii king of sweden  boileauno certainly  i esteem it the very best history that this age has produced  as full of spirit as the hero whose actions it relates it is nevertheless most exact in all matters of importance  the style of it is elegant perspicuous unaffected the disposition and method are excellent the judgments given by the writer acute and just  popeare you not pleased with that philosophical freedom of thought which discovers itself in all the works of voltaire but more particularly in those of an historical nature  boileauif it were properly regulated i should reckon it among their highest perfections  superstition and bigotry and party spirit are as great enemies to the truth and candour of history as malice or adulation to think freely is therefore a most necessary quality in a perfect historian  but all liberty has its bounds which in some of his writings voltaire i fear has not observed  would to heaven he would reflect while it is yet in his power to correct what is faulty that all his works will outlive him that many nations will read them and that the judgment pronounced here upon the writer himself will be according to the scope and tendency of them and to the extent of their good or evil effects on the great society of mankind  popeit would be well for all europe if some other wits of your country who give the tone to this age in all polite literature had the same serious thoughts you recommend to voltaire  witty writings when directed to serve the good ends of virtue and religion are like the lights hung out in a pharos to guide the mariners safe through dangerous seas but the brightness of those that are impious or immoral shines only to betray and lead men to destruction  boileauhas england been free from all seductions of this nature  popeno  but the french have the art of rendering vice and impiety more agreeable than the english  boileaui am not very proud of this superiority in the talents of my countrymen  but as i am told that the good sense of the english is now admired in france i hope it will soon convince both nations that true wisdom is virtue and true virtue is religion  popei think it also to be wished that a taste for the frivolous may not continue too prevalent among the french  there is a great difference between gathering flowers at the foot of parnassus and ascending the arduous heights of the mountain  the palms and laurels grow there and if any of your countrymen aspire to gain them they must no longer enervate all the vigour of their minds by this habit of trifling  i would have them be perpetual competitors with the english in manly wit and substantial learning  but let the competition be friendly  there is nothing which so contracts and debases the mind as national envy  true wit like true virtue naturally loves its own image in whatever place it is found    dialogue xv   octaviaportiaarria  portiahow has it happened octavia that arria and i who have a higher rank than you in the temple of fame should have a lower here in elysium  we are told that the virtues you exerted as a wife were greater than ours  be so good as to explain to us what were those virtues  it is the privilege of this place that one can bear superiority without mortification  the jealousy of precedence died with the rest of our mortal frailties  tell us then your own story  we will sit down under the shade of this myrtle grove and listen to it with pleasure  octavianoble ladies the glory of our sex and of rome i will not refuse to comply with your desire though it recalls to my mind some scenes my heart would wish to forget  there can be only one reason why minos should have given to my conjugal virtues a preference above yours which is that the trial assigned to them was harder  arriahow madam harder than to die for your husband  we died for ours  octaviayou did for husbands who loved yon and were the most virtuous men of the ages they lived inwho trusted you with their lives their fame their honour  to outlive such husbands is in my judgment a harder effort of virtue than to die for them or with them  but mark antony to whom my brother octavius for reasons of state gave my hand was indifferent to me and loved another  yet he has told me himself i was handsomer than his mistress cleopatra  younger i certainly was and to men that is generally a charm sufficient to turn the scale in ones favour  i had been loved by marcellus  antony said he loved me when he pledged to me his faith  perhaps he did for a time a new handsome woman might from his natural inconstancy make him forget an old attachment he was but too amiable  his very vices had charms beyond other mens virtues  such vivacity such fire such a towering pride  he seemed made by nature to command to govern the world to govern it with such ease that the business of it did not rob him of an hour of pleasure nevertheless while his inclination for me continued this haughty lord of mankind who could hardly bring his high spirit to treat my brother his partner in empire with the necessary respect was to me as submissive as obedient to every wish of my heart as the humblest lover that ever sighed in the vales of arcadia  thus he seduced my affection from the manes of marcellus and fixed it on himself  he fixed it ladies i own it with some confusion more fondly than it had ever been fixed on marcellus  and when he had done so he scorned me he forsook me he returned to cleopatra  think who i wasthe sister of caesar sacrificed to a vile egyptian queen the harlot of julius the disgrace of her sex every outrage was added that could incense me still more  he gave her at sundry times as public marks of his love many provinces of the empire of rome in the east  he read her loveletters openly in his tribunal itselfeven while he was hearing and judging the causes of kings  nay he left his tribunal and one of the best roman orators pleading before him to follow her litter in which she happened to be passing by at that time  but what was more grievous to me than all these demonstrations of his extravagant passion for that infamous woman he had the assurance in a letter to my brother to call her his wife  which of you ladies could have patiently borne this treatment  arrianot i madam in truth  had i been in your place the dagger with which i pierced my own bosom to show my dear paetus how easy it was to die that dagger should i have plunged into antonys heart if piety to the gods and a due respect to the purity of my own soul had not stopped my hand  but i verily believe i should have killed myself not as i did out of affection to my husband but out of shame and indignation at the wrongs i endured  portiai must own octavia that to bear such usage was harder to a woman than to swallow fire  octaviayet i did bear it madam without even a complaint which could hurt or offend my husband  nay more at his return from his parthian expedition which his impatience to bear a long absence from cleopatra had made unfortunate and inglorious i went to meet him in syria and carried with me rich presents of clothes and money for his troops a great number of horses and two thousand chosen soldiers equipped and armed like my brothers praetorian bands  he sent to stop me at athens because his mistress was then with him  i obeyed his orders but i wrote to him by one of his most faithful friends a letter full of resignation and such a tenderness for him as i imagined might have power to touch his heart  my envoy served me so well he set my fidelity in so fair a light and gave such reasons to antony why he ought to see and receive me with kindness that cleopatra was alarmed  all her arts were employed to prevent him from seeing me and to draw him again into egypt  those arts prevailed  he sent me back into italy and gave himself up more absolutely than ever to the witchcraft of that circe  he added africa to the states he had bestowed on her before and declared caesario her spurious son by julius caesar heir to all her dominions except phoenicia and cilicia which with the upper syria he gave to ptolemy his second son by her and at the same time declared his eldest son by her whom he had espoused to the princess of media heir to that kingdom and king of armenia nay and of the whole parthian empire which he meant to conquer for him  the children i had brought him he entirely neglected as if they had been bastards  i wept  i lamented the wretched captivity he was in but i never reproached him  my brother exasperated at so many indignities commanded me to quit the house of my husband at rome and come into his  i refused to obey him  i remained in antonys house i persisted to take care of his children by fulvia the same tender care as of my own  i gave my protection to all his friends at rome  i implored my brother not to make my jealousy or my wrongs the cause of a civil war  but the injuries done to rome by antonys conduct could not possibly be forgiven  when he found he should draw the roman arms on himself he sent orders to me to leave his house  i did so but carried with me all his children by fulvia except antyllus the eldest who was then with him in egypt  after his death and cleopatras i took her children by him and bred them up with my own  arriais it possible madam the children of cleopatra  octaviayes the children of my rival  i married her daughter to juba king of mauritania the most accomplished and the handsomest prince in the world  arriatell me octavia did not your pride and resentment entirely cure you of your passion for antony as soon as you saw him go back to cleopatra  and was not your whole conduct afterwards the effect of cool reason undisturbed by the agitations of jealous and tortured love  octaviayou probe my heart very deeply  that i had some help from resentment and the natural pride of my sex i will not deny  but i was not become indifferent to my husband  i loved the antony who had been my lover more than i was angry with the antony who forsook me and loved another woman  had he left cleopatra and returned to me again with all his former affection i really believe i should have loved him as well as before  arriaif the merit of a wife is to be measured by her sufferings your heart was unquestionably the most perfect model of conjugal virtue the wound i gave mine was but a scratch in comparison to many you felt yet i dont know whether it would be any benefit to the world that there should be in it many octavias  too good subjects are apt to make bad kings  portiatrue arria the wives of brutus and cecinna paetus may be allowed to have spirits a little rebellious  octavia was educated in the court of her brother  subjection and patience were much better taught there than in our houses where the roman liberty made its last abode and though i will not dispute the judgment of minos i cant help thinking that the affection of a wife to her husband is more or less respectable in proportion to the character of that husband  if i could have had for antony the same friendship as i had for brutus i should have despised myself  octaviamy fondness for antony was illplaced but my perseverance in the performance of all the duties of a wife notwithstanding his illusage a perseverance made more difficult by the very excess of my love appeared to minos the highest and most meritorious effort of female resolution against the seductions of the most dangerous enemy to our virtue offended pride    dialogue xvi   louise de coligni princess of orangefrances walsingham countess of essex and of clanricarde before lady sidney  princess of orangeour destinies madam had a great and surprising conformity  i was the daughter of admiral coligni you of secretary walsingham two persons who were the most consummate statesmen and ablest supports of the protestant religion in france and in england  i was married to teligni the finest gentleman of our party the most admired for his valour his virtue and his learning you to sir philip sidney who enjoyed the same preeminence among the english  both these husbands were cut off in the flower of youth and of glory by violent deaths and we both married again with still greater men i with william prince of orange the founder of the dutch commonwealth you with devereux earl of essex the favourite of elizabeth and of the whole english nation  but alas to complete the resemblance of our fates we both saw those second husbands who had raised us so high destroyed in the full meridian of their glory and greatness mine by the pistol of an assassin yours still more unhappily by the axe as a traitor  countess of clanricardethere was indeed in some principal events of our lives the conformity you observe  but your destiny though it raised you higher than me was more unhappy than mine  for my father lived honourably and died in peace yours was assassinated in his old age how madam did you support or recover your spirits under so rainy misfortunes  princess of orangethe prince of orange left an infant son to my care  the educating of him to be worthy of so illustrious a father to be the heir of his virtue as well as of his greatness and the affairs of the commonwealth in which i interested myself for his sake so filled my mind that they in some measure took from me the sense of my grief which nothing but such a great and important scene of business such a necessary talk of private and public duty could have ever relieved  but let me inquire in my turn how did your heart find a balm to alleviate the anguish of the wounds it had suffered  what employed your widowed hours after the death of your essex  countess of clanricardemadam i did not long continue a widow i married again  princess of orangemarried again  with what prince what king did you marry  the widow of sir philip sidney and of my lord essex could not descend from them to a subject of less illustrious fame and where could you find one that was comparable to either  countess of clanricardei did not seek for one madam the heroism of the former and the ambition of the latter had made me very unhappy  i desired a quiet life and the joys of wedded love with an agreeable virtuous wellborn unambitious unenterprising husband  all this i found in the earl of clanricarde and believe me madam i enjoyed more solid felicity in ireland with him than i ever had possessed with my two former husbands in the pride of their glory when england and all europe resounded with their praise  princess of orangecan it be possible that the daughter of walsingham and the wife of sidney and essex should have sentiments so inferior to the minds from which she sprang and to which she was matched  believe me madam there was no hour of the many years i lived after the death of the prince of orange in which i would have exchanged the pride and joy i continually had in hearing his praise and seeing the monuments of his glory in the free commonwealth his wisdom had founded for any other delights the world could give  the cares that i shared with him while he remained upon earth were a happiness to my mind because they exalted its powers  the remembrance of them was dear to me after i had lost him  i thought his great soul though removed to a higher sphere would look down upon mine with some tenderness of affection as its fellowlabourer in the heroic and divine work of delivering and freeing his country  but to be divorced from that soul to be no longer his wife to be the comfort of an inferior inglorious husband  i had much rather have died a thousand deaths than that my heart should one moment have conceived such a thought  countess of clanricardeyour highness must not judge of all hearts by your own  the ruling passion of that was apparently ambition  my inclinations were not so noble as yours but better suited perhaps to the nature of woman  i loved sir philip sidney i loved the earl of essex rather as amiable men than as heroes and statesmen  they were so taken up with their wars and stateaffairs that my tenderness for them was too often neglected  the earl of clanricarde was constantly and wholly mine  he was brave but had not that spirit of chivalry with which sir philip sidney was absolutely possessed  he had in a high degree the esteem of elizabeth but did not aspire to her love nor did he wish to be the rival of carr or of villiers in the affection of james such madam was the man on whom my last choice bestowed my hand and whose kindness compensated for all my misfortunes  providence has assigned to different tempers different comforts  to you it gave the education of a prince the government of a state the pride of being called the wife of a hero to me a goodliving husband quiet opulence nobility and a fair reputation though not in a degree so exalted as yours  if our whole sex were to choose between your consolations and mine your highness i think would find very few of your taste  but i respect the sublimity of your ideas  now that we have no bodies they appear less unnatural than i should have thought them in the other world  princess of orangeadieu madam  our souls are of a different order and were not made to sympathise or converse with each other    dialogue xvii   marcus brutuspomponius atticus  brutuswell atticus i find that notwithstanding your friendship for cicero and for me you survived us both many years with the same cheerful spirit you had always possessed and by prudently wedding your daughter to agrippa secured the favour of octavius caesar and even contracted a close alliance with him by your granddaughters marriage with tiberius nero  atticusyou know brutus my philosophy was the epicurean  i loved my friends and i served them in their wants and distresses with great generosity but i did not think myself obliged to die when they died or not to make others as occasions should offer  brutusyou did i acknowledge serve your friends as far as you could without bringing yourself on their account into any great danger or disturbance of mind but that you loved them i much doubt  if you loved cicero how could you love antony  if you loved me how could you love octavius  if you loved octavius how could you avoid taking part against antony in their last civil war  affection cannot be so strangely divided and with so much equality among men of such opposite characters and who were such irreconcilable enemies to each other  atticusfrom my earliest youth i possessed the singular talent of ingratiating myself with the heads of different parties and yet not engaging with any of them so far as to disturb my own quiet  my family was connected with the marian party and though i retired to athens that i might not be unwillingly involved in the troubles which that turbulent faction had begun to excite yet when young marius was declared an enemy by the senate i sent him a sum of money to support him in his exile  nor did this hinder me from making my court so well to sylla upon his coming to athens that i obtained from him the highest marks of his favour nevertheless when he pressed me to go with him to rome i declined it being as unwilling to fight for him against the marian party as for them against him  he admired my conduct and at his departure from athens ordered all the presents made to him during his abode in that city to be carried to me  i remind you of this only to show that moderation in all contentions of this kind had been always my principle and that in the instances you mentioned i did not act from any levity or inconstancy in my nature but from a regular consistent plan of conduct which my reason convinced me was the wisest i could follow  brutusi remember indeed that you observed the same neutrality between pompey and julius caesar  atticusi did soand that i might be able to do it with dignity and without the reproach of ingratitude i never would accept any office or honour from either of those great men nor from cicero though my sister had married his brother nor from you marcus brutus whose friendship i thought the greatest honour of my life  brutusare there no obligations to a good heart pomponius but honours and offices  or could you by refusing to encumber yourself with these dissolve all other ties  but setting aside any considerations of private affection or esteem how was you able to reconcile your conduct with that which is the ruling principle in the heart of every virtuous man and more especially a virtuous roman the love of the public  atticusthe times i lived in were so bad and the conflict of parties had so little to do in reality with the love of the public that i thought my virtue much safer and purer by avoiding than mixing in the fray  brutuspossibly in the dispute between marius and sylla and even in that between pompey and caesar a virtuous man might see so much to blame on both sides and so much to fear whichever faction should overcome the other as to be justified in not engaging with either  but let me say without vanity in the war which i waged against antony and octavius you could have nothing to blame for i know you approved the principle upon which i killed julius caesar  nor had you anything to fear if our arms had succeeded for you know that my intentions were upright and pure nor was it doubtful that cassius was as much determined as i to restore the republic  how could you then with any sense of virtue in your heart maintain an indifference and neutrality between the deliverers and the tyrants of your country  atticusmy answer to this will necessarily require explanations which my respect to the manes of brutus makes me wish to avoid  brutusin the other world i loved truth and was desirous that all might speak it with freedom but here even the tender ears of a tyrant are compelled to endure it  if i committed any faults or erred in my judgment the calamities i have suffered are a punishment for it  tell me then truly and without fear of offending what you think were my failings  atticusyou said that the principle upon which you killed julius caesar had my approbation  this i do not deny but did i ever declare or give you reason to believe that i thought it a prudent or welltimed act  i had quite other thoughts  nothing ever seemed to me worse judged or worse timed and these brutus were my reasons  caesar was just setting out to make war on the parthians  this was an enterprise of no little difficulty and no little danger but his unbounded ambition and that restless spirit which never would suffer him to take any repose did not intend to stop there  you know very well for he hid nothing from you that he had formed a vast plan of marching after he had conquered the whole parthian empire along the coast of the caspian sea and the sides of mount caucasus into scythia in order to subdue all the countries that border on germany and germany itself from whence he proposed to return to rome by gaul  consider now i beseech you how much time the execution of this project required  in some of his battles with so many fierce and warlike nations the bravest of all the barbarians he might have been slain but if he had not disease or age itself might have ended his life before he could have completed such an immense undertaking  he was when you killed him in his fiftysixth year and of an infirm constitution  except his bastard by cleopatra he had no son nor was his power so absolute or so quietly settled that he could have a thought of bequeathing the empire like a private inheritance to his sisters grandson octavius  while he was absent there was no reason to fear any violence or maladministration in italy or in rome  cicero would have had the chief authority in the senate  the praetorship of the city had been conferred upon you by the favour of caesar and your known credit with him added to the high reputation of your virtues and abilities gave you a weight in all business which none of his party left behind him in italy would have been able to oppose what a fair prospect was here of good order peace and liberty at home while abroad the roman name would have been rendered more glorious the disgrace of crassus revenged and the empire extended beyond the utmost ambition of our forefathers by the greatest general that ever led the armies of rome or perhaps of any other nation  what did it signify whether in asia and among the barbarians that general bore the name of king or dictator  nothing could be more puerile in you and your friends than to start so much at the proposition of his taking that name in italy itself when you had suffered him to enjoy all the power of royalty and much more than any king of rome had possessed from romulus down to tarquin  brutuswe considered that name as the last insult offered to our liberty and our laws it was an ensign of tyranny hung out with a vain and arrogant purpose of rendering the servitude of rome more apparent we therefore determined to punish the tyrant and restore our country to freedom  atticusyou punished the tyrant but you did not restore your country to freedom  by sparing antony against the opinion of cassius you suffered the tyranny to remain  he was consul and from the moment that caesar was dead the chief power of the state was in his hands  the soldiers adored him for his liberality valour and military frankness his eloquence was more persuasive from appearing unstudied  the nobility of his house which descended from hercules would naturally inflame his heart with ambition  the whole course of his life had evidently shown that his thoughts were high and aspiring and that he had little respect for the liberty of his country  he had been the second man in caesars party by saving him you gave a new head to that party which could no longer subsist without your ruin  many who would have wished the restoration of liberty if caesar had died a natural death were so incensed at his murder that merely for the sake of punishing that they were willing to confer all power upon antony and make him absolute master of the republic  this was particularly true with respect to the veterans who had served under caesar and he saw it so plainly that he presently availed himself of their dispositions  you and cassius were obliged to fly out of italy and cicero who was unwilling to take the same part could find no expedient to save himself and the senate but the wretched one of supporting and raising very high another caesar the adopted son and heir of him you had slain to oppose antony and to divide the caesarean party  but even while he did this he perpetually offended that party and made them his enemies by harangues in the senate which breathed the very spirit of the old pompeian faction and made him appear to octavius and all the friends of the dead dictator no less guilty of his death than those who had killed him  what could this end in but that which you and your friends had most to fear a reunion of the whole caesarean party and of their principal leaders however discordant the one with the other to destroy the pompeians  for my own part i foresaw it long before the event and therefore kept myself wholly clear of those proceedings  you think i ought to have joined you and cassius at philippi because i knew your good intentions and that if you succeeded you designed to restore the commonwealth  i am persuaded you did both agree in that point but you differed in so many others there was such a dissimilitude in your tempers and characters that the union between you could not have lasted long and your dissension would have had most fatal effects with regard both to the settlement and to the administration of the republic  besides the whole mass of it was in such a fermentation and so corrupted that i am convinced new disorders would soon have arisen  if you had applied gentle remedies to which your nature inclined those remedies would have failed if cassius had induced you to act with severity your government would have been stigmatised with the name of a tyranny more detestable than that against which you conspired and caesars clemency would have been the perpetual topic of every factious oration to the people and of every seditious discourse to the soldiers  thus you would have soon been plunged in the miseries of another civil war or perhaps assassinated in the senate as julius was by you  nothing could give the roman empire a lasting tranquillity but such a prudent plan of a mitigated imperial power as was afterwards formed by octavius when he had ably and happily delivered himself from all opposition and partnership in the government  those quiet times i lived to see and i must say they were the best i ever had seen far better than those under the turbulent aristocracy for which you contended  and let me boast a little of my own prudence which through so many storms could steer me safe into that port  had it only given me safety without reputation i should not think that i ought to value myself upon it  but in all these revolutions my honour remained as unimpaired as my fortune  i so conducted myself that i lost no esteem in being antonys friend after having been ciceros or in my alliance with agrippa and augustus caesar after my friendship with you  nor did either caesar or antony blame my inaction in the quarrels between them but on the contrary they both seemed to respect me the more for the neutrality i observed  my obligations to the one and alliance with the other made it improper for me to act against either and my constant tenor of life had procured me an exemption from all civil wars by a kind of prescription  brutusif man were born to no higher purpose than to wear out a long life in ease and prosperity with the general esteem of the world your wisdom was evidently as much superior to mine as my life was shorter and more unhappy than yours  nay i verily believe it exceeded the prudence of any other man that ever existed considering in what difficult circumstances you were placed and with how many violent shocks and sudden changes of fortune you were obliged to contend  but here the most virtuous and publicspirited conduct is found to have been the most prudent  the motives of our actions not the success give us here renown  and could i return to that life from whence i am escaped i would not change my character to imitate yours i would again be brutus rather than atticus  even without the sweet hope of an eternal reward in a more perfect state which is the strongest and most immovable support to the good under every misfortune i swear by the gods i would not give up the noble feelings of my heart that elevation of mind which accompanies active and suffering virtue for your seventyseven years of constant tranquillity with all the praise you obtained from the learned men whom you patronised or the great men whom you courted    dialogue xviii   william iii king of englandjohn de witt pensioner of holland  williamthough i had no cause to love you yet believe me i sincerely lament your fate  who could have thought that de witt the most popular minister that ever served a commonwealth should fall a sacrifice to popular fury  such admirable talents such virtues as you were endowed with so clear so cool so comprehensive a head a heart so untainted with any kind of vice despising money despising pleasure despising the vain ostentation of greatness such application to business such ability in it such courage such firmness and so perfect a knowledge of the nation you governed seemed to assure you of a fixed and stable support in the public affection  but nothing can be durable that depends on the passions of the people  de wittit is very generous in your majesty not only to compassionate the fate of a man whose political principles made him an enemy to your greatness but to ascribe it to the caprice and inconstancy of the people as if there had been nothing very blamable in his conduct i feel the magnanimity of this discourse from your majesty and it confirms what i have heard of all your behaviour after my death  but i must frankly confess that although the rage of the populace was carried much too far when they tore me and my unfortunate brother to pieces yet i certainly had deserved to lose their affection by relying too much on the uncertain and dangerous friendship of france and by weakening the military strength of the state to serve little purposes of my own power and secure to myself the interested affection of the burgomasters or others who had credit and weight in the faction the favour of which i courted  this had almost subjected my country to france if you great prince had not been set at the head of the falling republic and had not exerted such extraordinary virtues and abilities to raise and support it as surpassed even the heroism and prudence of william our first stadtholder and equalled yon to the most illustrious patriots of greece or rome  williamthis praise from your mouth is glorious to me indeed  what can so much exalt the character of a prince as to have his actions approved by a zealous republican and the enemy of his house  de wittif i did not approve them i should show myself the enemy of the republic  you never sought to tyrannise over it you loved you defended you preserved its freedom  thebes was not more indebted to epaminondas or pelopidas for its independence and glory than the united provinces were to you  how wonderful was it to see a youth who had scarce attained to the twentysecond year of his age whose spirit had been depressed and kept down by a jealous and hostile faction rising at once to the conduct of a most arduous and perilous war stopping an enemy victorious triumphant who had penetrated into the heart of his country driving him back and recovering from him all he had conquered to see this done with an army in which a little before there was neither discipline courage nor sense of honour  ancient history has no exploit superior to it and it will ennoble the modern whenever a livy or a plutarch shall arise to do justice to it and set the hero who performed it in a true light  williamsay rather when time shall have worn out that malignity and rancour of party which in free states is so apt to oppose itself to the sentiments of gratitude and esteem for their servants and benefactors  de witthow magnanimous was your reply how much in the spirit of true ancient virtue when being asked in the greatest extremity of our danger how you intended to live after holland was lost you said you would live on the lands you had left in germany and had rather pass your life in hunting there than sell your country or liberty to france at any rate  how nobly did you think when being offered your patrimonial lordships and lands in the county of burgundy or the full value of them from france by the mediation of england in the treaty of peace your answer was that to gain one good town more for the spaniards in flanders you would be content to lose them all  no wonder after this that you were able to combine all europe in a league against the power of france that you were the centre of union and the directing soul of that wise that generous confederacy formed by your labours that you could steadily support and keep it together in spite of repeated misfortunes that even after defeats you were as formidable to louis as other generals after victories and that in the end you became the deliverer of europe as you had before been of holland  williami had in truth no other object no other passion at heart throughout my whole life but to maintain the independence and freedom of europe against the ambition of france  it was this desire which formed the whole plan of my policy which animated all my counsels both as prince of orange and king of england  de wittthis desire was the most noble i speak it with shame that could warm the heart of a prince whose ancestors had opposed and in a great measure destroyed the power of spain when that nation aspired to the monarchy of europe  france sir in your days had an equal ambition and more strength to support her vast designs than spain under the government of philip ii  that ambition you restrained that strength you resisted  i alas was seduced by her perfidious court and by the necessity of affairs in that system of policy which i had adopted to ask her assistance to rely on her favour and to make the commonwealth whose counsels i directed subservient to her greatness  permit me sir to explain to you the motives of my conduct  if all the princes of orange had acted like you i should never have been the enemy of your house  but prince maurice of nassau desired to oppress the liberty of that state which his virtuous father had freed at the expense of his life and which he himself had defended against the arms of the house of austria with the highest reputation of military abilities  under a pretence of religion the most execrable cover of a wicked design he put to death as a criminal that upright minister barneveldt his fathers best friend because he refused to concur with him in treason against the state  he likewise imprisoned several other good men and lovers of their country confiscated their estates and ruined their families  yet after he had done these cruel acts of injustice with a view to make himself sovereign of the dutch commonwealth he found they had drawn such a general odium upon him that not daring to accomplish his iniquitous purpose he stopped short of the tyranny to which he had sacrificed his honour and virtue a disappointment so mortifying and so painful to his mind that it probably hastened his death  williamwould to heaven he had died before the meeting of that infamous synod of dort by which he not only dishonoured himself and his family but the protestant religion itself  forgive this interruptionmy grief forced me to iti desire you to proceed  de wittthe brother of maurice prince henry who succeeded to his dignities in the republic acted with more moderation  but the son of that good prince your majestys father i am sorry to speak what i know you hear with pain resumed in the pride and fire of his youth the ambitious designs of his uncle  he failed in his undertaking and soon afterwards died but left in the hearts of the whole republican party an incurable jealousy and dread of his family  full of these prejudices and zealous for liberty i thought it my duty as pensionary of holland to prevent for ever if i could your restoration to the power your ancestors had enjoyed which i sincerely believed would be inconsistent with the safety and freedom of my country  williamlet me stop you a moment here  when my greatgrandfather formed the plan of the dutch commonwealth he made the power of a stadtholder one of the principal springs in his system of government  how could you imagine that it would ever go well when deprived of this spring so necessary to adjust and balance its motions  a constitution originally formed with no mixture of regal power may long be maintained in all its vigour and energy without such a power but if any degree of monarchy was mixed from the beginning in the principles of it the forcing that out must necessarily disorder and weaken the whole fabric this was particularly the case in our republic  the negative voice of every small town in the provincial states the tedious slowness of our forms and deliberations the facility with which foreign ministers may seduce or purchase the opinions of so many persons as have a right to concur in all our resolutions make it impossible for the government even in the quietest times to be well carried on without the authority and influence of a stadtholder which are the only remedy our constitution has provided for those evils  de witti acknowledge they are but i and my party thought no evil so great as that remedy and therefore we sought for other more pleasing resources  one of these upon which we most confidently depended was the friendship of france  i flattered myself that the interest of the french would secure to me their favour as your relation to the crown of england might naturally raise in them a jealousy of your power  i hoped they would encourage the trade and commerce of the dutch in opposition to the english the ancient enemies of their crown and let us enjoy all the benefits of a perpetual peace unless we made war upon england or england upon us in either of which cases it was reasonable to presume we should have their assistance  the french minister at the hague who served his court but too well so confirmed me in these notions that i had no apprehensions of the mine which was forming under my feet  williamyou found your authority strengthened by a plan so agreeable to your party and this contributed more to deceive your sagacity than all the art of destrades  de wittmy policy seemed to me entirely suitable to the lasting security of my own power of the liberty of my country and of its maritime greatness for i made it my care to keep up a very powerful navy well commanded and officered for the defence of all these against the english but as i feared nothing from france or any power on the continent i neglected the army or rather i destroyed it by enervating all its strength by disbanding old troops and veteran officers attached to the house of orange and putting in their place a trading militia commanded by officers who had neither experience nor courage and who owed their promotions to no other merit but their relation to or interest with some leading men in the several oligarchies of which the government in all the dutch towns is composed  nevertheless on the invasion of flanders by the french i was forced to depart from my close connection with france and to concur with england and sweden in the triple alliance which sir william temple proposed in order to check her ambition but as i entered into that measure from necessity not from choice i did not pursue it  i neglected to improve our union with england or to secure that with sweden i avoided any conjunction of counsels with spain i formed no alliance with the emperor or the germans i corrupted our army more and more till a sudden unnatural confederacy struck up against all the maxims of policy by the court of england with france for the conquest of the seven provinces brought these at once to the very brink of destruction and made me a victim to the fury of a populace too justly provoked  williami must say that your plan was in reality nothing more than to procure for the dutch a licence to trade under the good pleasure and gracious protection of france  but any state that so entirely depends on another is only a province and its liberty is a servitude graced with a sweet but empty name  you should have reflected that to a monarch so ambitious and so vain as louis le grand the idea of a conquest which seemed almost certain and the desire of humbling a haughty republic were temptations irresistible  his bigotry likewise would concur in recommending to him an enterprise which he might think would put heresy under his feet  and if you knew either the character of charles ii or the principles of his government you ought not to have supposed his union with france for the ruin of holland an impossible or even improbable event  it is hardly excusable in a statesman to be greatly surprised that the inclinations of princes should prevail upon them to act in many particulars without any regard to the political maxims and interests of their kingdoms  de witti am ashamed of my error but the chief cause of it was that though i thought very ill i did not think quite so ill of charles ii and his ministry as they deserved  i imagined too that his parliament would restrain him from engaging in such a war or compel him to engage in our defence if france should attack us  these i acknowledge are excuses not justifications  when the french marched into holland and found it in a condition so unable to resist them my fame as a minister irrecoverably sank for not to appear a traitor i was obliged to confess myself a dupe  but what praise is sufficient for the wisdom and virtue you showed in so firmly rejecting the offers which i have been informed were made to you both by england and france when first you appeared in arms at the head of your country to give you the sovereignty of the seven provinces by the assistance and under the protection of the two crowns  believe me great prince had i been living in those times and had known the generous answers you made to those offers which were repeated more than once during the course of the war not the most ancient and devoted servant to your family would have been more your friend than i  but who could reasonably hope for such moderation and such a right sense of glory in the mind of a young man descended from kings whose mother was daughter to charles i and whose father had left him the seducing example of a very different conduct  happy indeed was the english nation to have such a prince so nearly allied to their crown both in blood and by marriage whom they might call to be their deliverer when bigotry and despotism the two greatest enemies to human society had almost overthrown their whole constitution in church and state  williamthey might have been happy but were not  as soon as i had accomplished their deliverance for them many of them became my most implacable enemies and even wished to restore the unforgiving prince whom they had so unanimously and so justly expelled from his kingdom such levity seems incredible  i could not myself have imagined it possible in a nation famed for good sense if i had not had proofs of it beyond contradiction  they seemed as much to forget what they called me over for as that they had called me over  the security of their religion the maintenance of their liberty were no longer their care all was to yield to the incomprehensible doctrine of right divine and passive obedience  thus the tories grew jacobites after having renounced both that doctrine and king james by their opposition to him by their invitation of me and by every act of the parliament which gave me the crown  but the most troublesome of my enemies were a set of republicans who violently opposed all my measures and joined with the jacobites in disturbing my government only because it was not a commonwealth  de wittthey who were republicans under your government in the kingdom of england did not love liberty but aspired to dominion and wished to throw the nation into a total confusion that it might give them a chance of working out from that anarchy a better state for themselves  williamyour observation is just  a proud man thinks himself a lover of liberty when he is only impatient of a power in government above his own and were he a king or the first minister of a king would be a tyrant  nevertheless i will own to you with the candour which becomes a virtuous prince that there were in england some whigs and even some of the most sober and moderate tories who with very honest intentions and sometimes with good judgments proposed new securities to the liberty of the nation against the prerogative or influence of the crown and the corruption of ministers in future times  to some of these i gave way being convinced they were right but others i resisted for fear of weakening too much the royal authority and breaking that balance in which consists the perfection of a mixed form of government  i should not perhaps have resisted so many if i had not seen in the house of commons a disposition to rise in their demands on the crown had they found it more yielding  the difficulties of my government upon the whole were so great that i once had determined from mere disgust and resentment to give back to the nation assembled in parliament the crown they had placed on my head and retire to holland where i found more affection and gratitude in the people  but i was stopped by the earnest supplications of my friends and by an unwillingness to undo the great work i had done especially as i knew that if england should return into the hands of king james it would be impossible in that crisis to preserve the rest of europe from the dominion of france  de wittheaven be praised that your majesty did not persevere in so fatal a resolution  the united provinces would have been ruined by it together with england  but i cannot enough express my astonishment that you should have met with such treatment as could suggest such a thought the english must surely be a people incapable either of liberty or subjection  williamthere were i must acknowledge some faults in my temper and some in my government which are an excuse for my subjects with regard to the uneasiness and disquiet they gave me  my taciturnity which suited the genius of the dutch offended theirs  they love an affable prince it was chiefly his affability that made them so fond of charles ii  their frankness and goodhumour could not brook the reserve and coldness of my nature  then the excess of my favour to some of the dutch whom i had brought over with me excited a national jealousy in the english and hurt their pride  my government also appeared at last too unsteady too fluctuating between the whigs and the tories which almost deprived me of the confidence and affection of both parties  i trusted too much to the integrity and the purity of my intentions without using those arts that are necessary to allay the ferment of factions and allure men to their duty by soothing their passions  upon the whole i am sensible that i better understood how to govern the dutch than the english or the scotch and should probably have been thought a greater man if i had not been king of great britain  de wittit is a shame to the english that gratitude and affection for such merit as yours were not able to overcome any little disgusts arising from your temper and enthrone their deliverer in the hearts of his people  but will your majesty give me leave to ask you one question  is it true as i have heard that many of them disliked your alliances on the continent and spoke of your war with france as a dutch measure in which you sacrificed england to holland  williamthe cry of the nation at first was strong for the war but before the end of it the tories began publicly to talk the language you mention  and no wonder they did for as they then had a desire to set up again the maxims of government which had prevailed in the reign of their beloved charles ii they could not but represent opposition to france and vigorous measures taken to restrain her ambition as unnecessary for england because they well knew that the counsels of that king had been utterly averse to such measures that his whole policy made him a friend to france that he was governed by a french mistress and even bribed by french money to give that court his assistance or at least his acquiescence in all their designs  de witta king of england whose cabinet is governed by france and who becomes a vile pensioner to a french king degrades himself from his royalty and ought to be considered as an enemy to the nation  indeed the whole policy of charles ii when he was not forced off from his natural bias by the necessity he lay under of soothing his parliament was a constant designed systematical opposition to the interest of his people  his brother though more sensible to the honour of england was by his popery and desire of arbitrary power constrained to lean upon france and do nothing to obstruct her designs on the continent or lessen her greatness  it was therefore necessary to place the british crown on your head not only with a view to preserve the religious and civil rights of the people from internal oppressions but to rescue the whole state from that servile dependence on its natural enemy which must unquestionably have ended in its destruction  what folly was it to revile your measures abroad as sacrificing the interest of your british dominions to connections with the continent and principally with holland  had great britain no interest to hinder the french from being masters of all the austrian netherlands and forcing the seven united provinces her strongest barrier on the continent against the power of that nation to submit with the rest to their yoke  would her trade would her coasts would her capital itself have been safe after so mighty an increase of shipping and sailors as france would have gained by those conquests  and what could have prevented them but the war which you waged and the alliances which you formed  could the dutch and the germans unaided by great britain have attempted to make head against a power which even with her assistance strong and spirited as it was they could hardly resist  and after the check which had been given to the encroachments of france by the efforts of the first grand alliance did not a new and greater danger make it necessary to recur to another such league  was not the union of france and spain under one monarch or even under one family the most alarming contingency that ever had threatened the liberty of europe  williami thought so and i am sure i did not err in my judgment  but folly is blind and faction wilfully shuts her eyes against the most evident truths that cross her designs as she believes any lies however palpable and absurd that she thinks will assist them  de wittthe only objection which seems to have any real weight against your system of policy with regard to the maintenance of a balance of power in europe is the enormous expense that must necessarily attend it an expense which i am afraid neither england nor holland will be able to bear without extreme inconvenience  williami will answer that objection by asking a question  if when you were pensionary of holland intelligence had been brought that the dykes were ready to break and the sea was coming in to overwhelm and to drown us what would you have said to one of the deputies who when you were proposing the proper repairs to stop the inundation should have objected to the charge as too heavy on the province  this was the case in a political sense with both england and holland  the fences raised to keep out superstition and tyranny were all giving way those dreadful evils were threatening with their whole accumulated force to break in upon us and overwhelm our ecclesiastical and civil constitutions  in such circumstances to object to a necessary expense is folly and madness  de wittit is certain sir that the utmost abilities of a nation can never be so well employed as in the unwearied pertinacious defence of their religion and freedom  when these are lost there remains nothing that is worth the concern of a good or wise man  nor do i think it consistent with the prudence of government not to guard against future dangers as well as present which precaution must be often in some degree expensive  i acknowledge too that the resources of a commercial country which supports its trade even in war by invincible fleets and takes care not to hurt it in the methods of imposing or collecting its taxes are immense and inconceivable till the trial is made especially where the government which demands the supplies is agreeable to the people  but yet an unlimited and continued expense will in the end be destructive  what matters it whether a state is mortally wounded by the hand of a foreign enemy or dies by a consumption of its own vital strength  such a consumption will come upon holland sooner than upon england because the latter has a greater radical force but great as it is that force at last will be so diminished and exhausted by perpetual drains that it may fail all at once and those efforts which may seem most surprisingly vigorous will be in reality the convulsions of death i dont apply this to your majestys government but i speak with a view to what may happen hereafter from the extensive ideas of negotiation and war which you have established they have been salutary to your kingdom but they will i fear be pernicious in future times if in pursuing great plans great ministers do not act with a sobriety prudence and attention to frugality which very seldom are joined with an extraordinary vigour and boldness of counsels    dialogue xix   m apiciusdarteneuf  darteneufalas poor apicius i pity thee from my heart for not having lived in my age and in my country  how many good dishes unknown at rome in thy days have i feasted upon in england  apiciuskeep your pity for yourself  how many good dishes have i feasted upon in rome which england does not produce or of which the knowledge has been lost with other treasures of antiquity in these degenerate days  the fat paps of a sow the livers of scari the brains of phoenicopters and the tripotanum which consisted of three excellent sorts of fish for which you english have no names the lupus marinus the myxo and the muraena  darteneufi thought the muraena had been our lamprey  we have delicate ones in the severn  apiciusno the muraena so respected by the ancient roman senators was a saltwater fish and kept by our nobles in ponds into which the sea was admitted  darteneufwhy then i dare say our severn lampreys are better  did you ever eat any of them stewed or potted  apiciusi was never in britain  your country then was too barbarous for me to go thither  i should have

were brought to rome in my time  darteneufthey could not be fresh they were good for nothing there you should have come to sandwich to eat them  it is a shame for you that you did not  an epicure talk

cant blame me for any want of alertness in seeking fine fishes  i sailed to the coast of africa from minturnae in campania only to taste of one species which i heard was larger there than it was on our coast and finding that i had received a false information i returned immediately without even deigning to land  darteneufthere was some sense in that  but why did not you also make a voyage to sandwich  had you once tasted those oysters in their highest perfection you would never have come back you would have eaten till you burst  apiciusi wish i had  it would have been better than poisoning myself as i did at rome because i found upon the balance of my accounts i had only the pitiful sum of fourscore thousand pounds left which would not afford me a table to keep me from starving  darteneufa sum of fourscore thousand pounds not keep you from starving  would i had had it  i should have been twenty years in spending it with the best table in london  apiciusalas poor man  this shows that you english have no idea of the luxury that reigned in our tables  before i died i had spent in my kitchen  0     pounds   s  d  darteneufi dont believe a word of it  there is certainly an error in the account  apiciuswhy the establishment of lucullus for his suppers in the apolloi mean for every supper he sat down to in the room which he called by that namewas  000 drachms which is in your money      pounds   s  d  darteneufwould i had supped with him there  but are you sure there is no blunder in these calculations  apiciusask your learned men that  i reckon as they tell me  but you may think that these feasts were made only by great men by triumphant generals like lucullus who had plundered all asia to help him in his housekeeping  what will you say when i tell you that the player aesopus had one dish that cost him  000 sestertiathat is      pounds  0s english  darteneufwhat will i say  why that i pity my worthy friend mr gibber and that if i had known this when alive i should have hanged myself for vexation that i did not live in those days  apiciuswell you might well you might  you dont know what eating is  you never could know it  nothing less than the wealth of the roman empire is sufficient to enable a man of taste to keep a good table  our players were infinitely richer than your princes  darteneufoh that i had but lived in the blessed reign of caligula or of vitellius or of heliogabalus and had been admitted to the honour of dining with their slaves  apiciusay there you touch me  i am miserable that i died before their good times  they carried the glories of their table much farther than the best eaters of the age in which i lived  vitellius spent in feasting within the compass of one year what would amount in your money to above   00000 pounds  he told me so himself in a conversation i had with him not long ago  and the two others you mentioned did not fall very short of his royal magnificence  darteneufthese indeed were great princes  but what most affects me is the luxury of that upstart fellow aesopus  pray of what ingredients might the dish he paid so much for consist  apiciuschiefly of singing birds  it was that which so greatly enhanced the price  darteneufof singing birds  choke him  i never ate but one which i stole out of its cage from a lady of my acquaintance and all london was in an uproar as if i had stolen and roasted an only child  but upon recollection i doubt whether i have really so much cause to envy aesopus for the singing bird which i ate was not so good as a wheatear or becafigue  and therefore i suspect that all the luxury you have bragged of was nothing but vanity  it was like the foolish extravagance of the son of aesopus who dissolved pearls in vinegar and drank them at supper i will stake my credit that a haunch of good buck venison and my favourite ham pie were much better dishes than any at the table of vitellius himself  it does not appear that you ancients ever had any good soups without which a man of taste cannot possibly dine  the rabbits in italy are detestable  but what is better than the wing of one of our english wild rabbits  i have been told you had no turkeys  the mutton in italy is illflavoured  and as for your boars roasted whole they were only fit to be served up at a corporation feast or election dinner  a small barbecued hog is worth a hundred of them  and a good collar of canterbury or shrewsbury brawn is a much better dish  apiciusif you had some meats that we wanted yet our cookery must have been greatly superior to yours  our cooks were so excellent that they could give to hogs flesh the taste of all other meats  darteneufi should never have endured their imitations  you might as easily have imposed on a good connoisseur in painting the copy of a fine picture for the original  our cooks on the contrary give to all other meats and even to some kinds of fish a rich flavour of bacon without destroying that which makes the distinction of one from another  it does not appear to me that essence of hams was ever known to the ancients  we have a hundred ragouts the composition of which surpasses all description  had yours been as good you could not have lain indolently lolling upon couches while you were eating  they would have made you sit up and mind your business  then you had a strange custom of hearing things read to you while you were at supper  this demonstrates that you were not so well entertained as we are with our meat  when i was at table i neither heard nor saw nor spoke i only tasted  but the worst of all is that in the utmost perfection of your luxury you had no wine to be named with claret burgundy champagne old hock or tokay  you boasted much of your falernum but i have tasted the lachrymae christi and other wines of that coast not one of which would i have drunk above a glass or two of if you would have given me the kingdom of naples  i have read that you boiled your wines and mixed water with them which is sufficient evidence that in themselves they were not fit to drink  apiciusi am afraid you do really excel us in wines not to mention your beer your cider and your perry of all which i have heard great fame from your countrymen and their report has been confirmed by the testimony of their neighbours who have travelled into england  wonderful things have been also said to me of an english liquor called punch  darteneufay to have died without tasting that is miserable indeed there is rum punch and arrack punch  it is difficult to say which is best but jupiter would have given his nectar for either of them upon my word and honour  apiciusthe thought of them puts me into a fever with thirst  darteneufthose incomparable liquors are brought to us from the east and west indies of the first of which you knew little and of the latter nothing  this alone is sufficient to determine the dispute  what a new world of good things for eating and drinking has columbus opened to us think of that and despair  apiciusi cannot indeed but exceedingly lament my ill fate that america was not discovered before i was born  it tortures me when i hear of chocolate pineapples and a number of other fine fruits or delicious meats produced there which i have never tasted  darteneufthe single advantage of having sugar to sweeten everything with instead of honey which you for want of the other were obliged to make use of is inestimable  apiciusi confess your superiority in that important article  but what grieves me most is that i never ate a turtle  they tell me that it is absolutely the best of all foods  darteneufyes i have heard the americans say so but i never ate any for in my time they were not brought over to england  apiciusnever ate any turtle  how couldst thou dare to accuse me of not going to sandwich to eat oysters and didst not thyself take a trip to america to riot on turtles  but know wretched man i am credibly informed that they are now as plentiful in england as sturgeons  there are turtleboats that go regularly to london and bristol from the west indies  i have just received this information from a fat alderman who died in london last week of a surfeit he got at a turtle feast in that city  darteneufwhat does he say  does he affirm to you that turtle is better than venison  apiciushe says there was a haunch of the fattest venison untouched while every mouth was employed on the turtle alone  darteneufalas how imperfect is human felicity  i lived in an age when the noble science of eating was supposed to have been carried to its highest perfection in england and france  and yet a turtle feast is a novelty to me  would it be impossible do you think to obtain leave from pluto of going back for one day to my own table at london just to taste of that food  i would promise to kill myself by the quantity of it i would eat before the next morning  apiciusyou have forgot you have no body  that which you had has long been rotten and you can never return to the earth with another unless pythagoras should send you thither to animate a hog  but comfort yourself that as you have eaten dainties which i never tasted so the next age will eat some unknown to this  new discoveries will be made and new delicacies brought from other parts of the world  but see who comes hither  i think it is mercury  mercurygentlemen i must tell you that i have stood near you invisible and heard your discoursea privilege which you know we deities use as often as we please  attend therefore to what i shall communicate to you relating to the subject upon which you have been talking  i know two men one of whom lived in ancient and the other in modern times who had much more pleasure in eating than either of you through the whole course of your lives  apiciusone of these happy epicures i presume was a sybarite and the other a french gentleman settled in the west indies  mercuryno one was a spartan soldier and the other an english farmer  i see you both look astonished  but what i tell you is truth labour and hunger gave a relish to the black broth of the former and the salt beef of the latter beyond what you ever found in the tripotanums or ham pies that vainly stimulated your forced and languid appetites which perpetual indolence weakened and constant luxury overcharged  darteneufthis apicius is more mortifying than not to have shared a turtle feast  apiciusi wish mercury you had taught me your art of cookery in my lifetime but it is a sad thing not to know what good living is till after one is dead    dialogue xx   alexander the greatcharles xii king of sweden  alexanderyour majesty seems in great wrath  who has offended you  charlesthe offence is to you as much as me  here is a fellow admitted into elysium who has affronted us bothan english poet one pope  he has called us two madmen  alexanderi have been unlucky in poets  no prince ever was fonder of the muses than i or has received from them a more ungrateful return when i was alive i declared that i envied achilles because he had a homer to celebrate his exploits and i most bountifully rewarded choerilus a pretender to poetry for writing verses on mine  but my liberality instead of doing me honour has since drawn upon me the ridicule of horace a witty roman poet and lucan another versifier of the same nation has loaded my memory with the harshest invectives  charlesi know nothing of these but i know that in my time a pert french satirist one boileau made so free with your character that i tore his book for having abused my favourite hero  and now this saucy englishman has libelled us both  but i have a proposal to make to you for the reparation of our honour  if you will join with me we will turn all these insolent scribblers out of elysium and throw them down headlong to the bottom of tartarus in spite of pluto and all his guards  alexanderthis is just such a scheme as that you formed at bender to maintain yourself there with the aid of three hundred swedes against the whole force of the ottoman empire  and i must say that such follies gave the english poet too much cause to call you a madman  charlesif my heroism was madness yours i presume was not wisdom  alexanderthere was a vast difference between your conduct and mine let poets or declaimers say what they will history shows that i was not only the bravest soldier but one of the ablest commanders the world has ever seen  whereas you by imprudently leading your army into vast and barren deserts at the approach of the winter exposed it to perish in its march for want of subsistence lost your artillery lost a great number of your soldiers and was forced to fight with the muscovites under such disadvantages as made it almost impossible for you to conquer  charlesi will not dispute your superiority as a general  it is not for me a mere mortal to contend with the son of jupiter ammon  alexanderi suppose you think my pretending that jupiter was my father as much entitles me to the name of a madman as your extravagant behaviour at bender does you  but you are greatly mistaken  it was not my vanity but my policy which set up that pretension  when i proposed to undertake the conquest of asia it was necessary for me to appear to the people something more than a man  they had been used to the idea of demigod heroes  i therefore claimed an equal descent with osiris and sesostris with bacchus and hercules the former conquerors of the east the opinion of my divinity assisted my arms and subdued all nations before me from the granicus to the ganges  but though i called myself the son of jupiter and kept up the veneration that name inspired by a courage which seemed more than human and by the sublime magnanimity of all my behaviour i did not forget that i was the son of philip  i used the policy of my father and the wise lessons of aristotle whom he had made my preceptor in the conduct of all my great designs  it was the son of philip who planted greek colonies in asia as far as the indies who formed projects of trade more extensive than his empire itself who laid the foundations of them in the midst of his wars who built alexandria to be the centre and staple of commerce between europe asia and africa who sent nearchus to navigate the unknown indian seas and intended to have gone himself from those seas to the pillars of herculesthat is to have explored the passage round africa the discovery of which has since been so glorious to vasco de gama  it was the son of philip who after subduing the persians governed them with such lenity such justice and such wisdom that they loved him even more than ever they had loved their natural kings and who by intermarriages and all methods that could best establish a coalition between the conquerors and the conquered united them into one people  but what sir did you do to advance the trade of your subjects to procure any benefit to those you had vanquished or to convert any enemy into a friend  charleswhen i might easily have made myself king of poland and was advised to do so by count piper my favourite minister i generously gave that kingdom to stanislas as you had given a great part of you conquests in india to porus besides his own dominions which you restored to him entire after you had beaten his army and taken him captive  alexanderi gave him the government of those countries under me and as my lieutenant which was the best method of preserving my power in conquests where i could not leave garrisons sufficient to maintain them the same policy was afterwards practised by the romans who of all conquerors except me were the greatest politicians  but neither was i nor were they so extravagant as to conquer only for others or dethrone kings with no view but merely to have the pleasure of bestowing their crowns on some of their subjects without any advantage to ourselves nevertheless i will own that my expedition to india was an exploit of the son of jupiter not of the son of philip  i had done better if i had stayed to give more consistency to my persian and grecian empires instead of attempting new conquests and at such a distance so soon  yet even this war was of use to hinder my troops from being corrupted by the effeminacy of asia and to keep up that universal awe of my name which in those countries was the great support of my power  charlesin the unwearied activity with which i proceeded from one enterprise to another i dare call myself your equal  nay i may pretend to a higher glory than you because you only went on from victory to victory but the greatest losses were not able to diminish my ardour or stop the efforts of my daring and invincible spirit  alexanderyou showed in adversity much more magnanimity than you did in prosperity  how unworthy of a prince who imitated me was your behaviour to the king your arms had vanquished  the compelling augustus to write himself a letter of congratulation to one of his vassals whom you had placed in his throne was the very reverse of my treatment of porus and darius  it was an ungenerous insult upon his illfortune  it was the triumph of a little and a low mind  the visit you made him immediately after that insult was a further contempt offensive to him and both useless and dangerous to yourself  charlesi feared no danger from it  i knew he durst not use the power i gave him to hurt me  alexanderif his resentment in that instant had prevailed over his fear as it was likely to do you would have perished deservedly by your insolence and presumption  for my part intrepid as i was in all dangers which i thought it was necessary or proper for me to meet i never put myself one moment in the power of an enemy whom i had offended  but you had the rashness of folly as well as of heroism  a false opinion conceived of your enemys weakness proved at last your undoing  when in answer to some reasonable propositions of peace sent to you by the czar you said you would come and treat with him at moscow he replied very justly that you affected to act like alexander but should not find in him a darius  and doubtless you ought to have been better acquainted with the character of that prince  had persia been governed by a peter alexowitz when i made war against it i should have acted more cautiously and not have counted so much on the superiority of my troops in valour and discipline over an army commanded by a king who was so capable of instructing them in all they wanted  charlesthe battle of narva won by eight thousand swedes against fourscore thousand muscovites seemed to authorise my contempt of the nation and their prince  alexanderit happened that their prince was not present in that battle  but he had not as yet had the time which was necessary to instruct his barbarous soldiers  you gave him that time and he made so good a use of it that you found at pultowa the muscovites become a different nation  if you had followed the blow you gave them at narva and marched directly to moscow you might have destroyed their hercules in his cradle  but you suffered him to grow till his strength was mature and then acted as if he had been still in his childhood  charlesi must confess you excelled me in conduct in policy and in true magnanimity  but my liberality was not inferior to yours and neither you nor any mortal ever surpassed me in the enthusiasm of courage  i was also free from those vices which sullied your character i never was drunk i killed no friend in the riot of a feast i fired no palace at the instigation of a harlot  alexanderit may perhaps be admitted as some excuse for my drunkenness that the persians esteemed it an excellence in their kings to be able to drink a great quantity of wine and the macedonians were far from thinking it a dishonour  but you were as frantic and as cruel when sober as i was when drunk  you were sober when you resolved to continue in turkey against the will of your host the grand signor  you were sober when you commanded the unfortunate patkull whose only crime was his having maintained the liberties of his country and who bore the sacred character of an ambassador to be broken alive on the wheel against the laws of nations and those of humanity more inviolable still to a generous mind  you were likewise sober when you wrote to the senate of sweden who upon a report of your death endeavoured to take some care of your kingdom that you would send them one of your boots and from that they should receive their orders if they pretended to meddle in governmentan insult much worse than any the macedonians complained of from me when i was most heated with wine and with adulation  as for my chastity it was not so perfect as yours though on some occasions i obtained great praise for my continence but perhaps if you had been not quite so insensible to the charms of the fair sex it would have mitigated and softened the fierceness the pride and the obstinacy of your nature  charlesit would have softened me into a woman or what i think still more contemptible the slave of a woman  but you seem to insinuate that you never were cruel or frantic unless when you were drunk  this i absolutely deny  you were not drunk when you crucified hephaestions physician for not curing a man who killed himself by his intemperance in his sickness nor when you sacrificed to the manes of that favourite officer the whole nation of the cusseansmen women and childrenwho were entirely innocent of his deathbecause you had read in homer that achilles had immolated some trojan captives on the tomb of patroclus  i could mention other proofs that your passions inflamed you as much as wine but these are sufficient  alexanderi cant deny that my passions were sometimes so violent as to deprive me for a while of the use of my reason especially when the pride of such amazing successes the servitude of the persians and barbarian flattery had intoxicated my mind  to bear at my age with continual moderation such fortune as mine was hardly in human nature as for you there was an excess and intemperance in your virtues which turned them all into vices  and one virtue you wanted which in a prince is very commendable and beneficial to the publici mean the love of science and of the elegant arts  under my care and patronage they were carried in greece to their utmost perfection  aristotle apelles and lysippus were among the glories of my reign  yours was illustrated only by battles  upon the whole though from some resemblance between us i should naturally be inclined to decide in your favour yet i must give the priority in renown to your enemy peter alexowitz  that great monarch raised his country you ruined yours  he was a legislator you were a tyrant    dialogue xxi   cardinal ximenescardinal wolsey  wolseyyou seem to look on me ximenes with an air of superiority as if i was not your equal  have you forgotten that i was the favourite and first minister of a great king of england that i was at once lord high chancellor bishop of durham bishop of winchester archbishop of york and cardinal legate  on what other subject were ever accumulated so many dignities such honours such power  ximenesin order to prove yourself my equal you are pleased to tell me what you had not what you did  but it is not the having great offices it is the doing great things that makes a great minister  i know that for some years you governed the mind of king henry viii and consequently his kingdom with the most absolute sway  let me ask you then what were the acts of your reign  wolseymy acts were those of a very skilful courtier and able politician  i managed a temper which nature had made the most difficult to manage of any perhaps that ever existed with such consummate address that all its passions were rendered entirely subservient to my inclinations  in foreign affairs i turned the arms of my master or disposed of his friendship whichever way my own interest happened to direct  it was not with him but with me that treaties were made by the emperor or by france and none were concluded during my ministry that did not contain some article in my favour besides secret assurances of aiding my ambition or resentment which were the real springs of all my negotiations  at home i brought the pride of the english nobility which had resisted the greatest of the plantagenets to bow submissively to the son of a butcher of ipswich  and as my power was royal my state and magnificence were suitable to it my buildings my furniture my household my equipage my liberalities and my charities were above the rank of a subject  ximenesfrom all you have said i understand that you gained great advantages for yourself in the course of your ministrytoo great indeed for a good man to desire or a wise man to accept  but what did you do for your sovereign and for the state  you make me no answer  what i did is well known  i was not content with forcing the arrogance of the spanish nobility to stoop to my power but used that power to free the people from their oppressions  in you they respected the royal authority i made them respect the majesty of the laws  i also relieved my countrymen the commons of castile from a most grievous burden by an alteration in the method of collecting their taxes  after the death of isabella i preserved the tranquillity of aragon and castile by procuring the regency of the latter for ferdinand a wise and valiant prince though he had not been my friend during the life of the queen  and when after his decease i was raised to the regency by the general esteem and affection of the castilians i administered the government with great courage firmness and prudence with the most perfect disinterestedness in regard to myself and most zealous concern for the public  i suppressed all the factions which threatened to disturb the peace of that kingdom in the minority and the absence of the young king and prevented the discontents of the commons of castile too justly incensed against the flemish ministers who governed their prince and rapaciously pillaged their country from breaking out during my life into open rebellion as they did most unhappily soon after my death  these were my civil acts but to complete the renown of my administration i added to it the palm of military glory  at my own charges and myself commanding the army i conquered oran from the moors and annexed it with its territory to the spanish dominions  wolseymy soul was as elevated and noble as yours my understanding as strong and more refined but the difference of our conduct arose from the difference of our objects  to raise your reputation and secure your power in castile by making that kingdom as happy and as great as you could was your object  mine was to procure the triple crown for myself by the assistance of my sovereign and of the greatest foreign powers each of us took the means that were evidently most proper to the accomplishment of his ends  ximenescan you confess such a principle of your conduct without a blush  but you will at least be ashamed that you failed in your purpose and were the dupe of the powers with whom you negotiated after having dishonoured the character of your master in order to serve your own ambition  i accomplished my desire with glory to my sovereign and advantage to my country  besides this difference there was a great one in the methods by which we acquired our power  we both owed it indeed to the favour of princes but i gained isabellas by the opinion she had of my piety and integrity  you gained henrys by a complaisance and course of life which were a reproach to your character and sacred orders  wolseyi did not as you ximenes did carry with me to court the austerity of a monk nor if i had done so could i possibly have gained any influence there  isabella and henry were different characters and their favour was to be sought in different ways  by making myself agreeable to the latter i so governed his passions unruly as they were that while i lived they did not produce any of those dreadful effects which after my death were caused by them in his family and kingdom  ximenesif henry viii your master had been king of castile i would never have been drawn by him out of my cloister  a man of virtue and spirit will not be prevailed with to go into a court where he cannot rise without baseness  wolseythe inflexibility of your mind had like to have ruined you in some of your measures and the bigotry which you had derived from your long abode in a cloister and retained when a minister was very near depriving the crown of castile of the newconquered kingdom of granada by the revolt of the moors in that city whom you had prematurely forced to change their religion  do you not remember how angry king ferdinand was with you on that account  ximenesi do and must acknowledge that my zeal was too intemperate in all that proceeding  wolseymy worst complaisances to king henry viii were far less hurtful to england than the unjust and inhuman court of inquisition which you established in granada to watch over the faith of your unwilling converts has been to spain  ximenesi only revived and settled in granada an ancient tribunal instituted first by one of our saints against the albigenses and gave it greater powers  the mischiefs which have attended it cannot be denied but if any force may be used for the maintenance of religion and the church of rome has you know declared authoritatively that it may none could be so effectual to answer the purpose  wolseythis is an argument rather against the opinion of the church than for the inquisition  i will only say i think myself very happy that my administration was stained with no action of cruelty not even cruelty sanctified by the name of religion  my temper indeed which influenced my conduct more than my principles was much milder than yours  to the proud i was proud but to my friends and inferiors benevolent and humane had i succeeded in the great object of my ambition had i acquired the popedom i should have governed the church with more moderation and better sense than probably you would have done if you had exchanged the see of toledo for that of rome  my goodnature my policy my taste for magnificence my love of the fine arts of wit and of learning would have made me the delight of all the italians and have given me a rank among the greatest princes  whereas in you the sour bigot and rigid monk would too much have prevailed over the prince and the statesman  ximeneswhat either of us would have been in that situation does not appear but if you are compared to me as a minister you are vastly inferior  the only circumstance in which you can justly pretend to any equality is the encouragement you gave to learning and your munificence in promoting it which was indeed very great  your two colleges founded at ipswich and oxford may vie with my university at alcala de henara  but in our generosity there was this differenceall my revenues were spent in wellplaced liberalities in acts of charity piety and virtue whereas a great part of your enormous wealth was squandered away in luxury and vain ostentation  with regard to all other points my superiority is apparent  you were only a favourite i was the friend and the father of the people  you served yourself i served the state  the conclusion of our lives was also much more honourable to me than you  wolseydid not you die as i did in disgrace with your master  ximenesthat disgrace was brought upon me by a faction of foreigners to whose power as a good spaniard i would not submit  a minister who falls a victim to such an opposition rises by his fall  yours was not graced by any public cause any merit to the nation  your spirit therefore sank under it you bore it with meanness  mine was unbroken superior to my enemies superior to fortune and i died as i had lived with undiminished dignity and greatness of mind    dialogue xxii   lucianrabelais  lucianfriend rabelais well metour souls are very good company for one another we both were great wits and most audacious freethinkers  we laughed often at folly and sometimes at wisdom  i was indeed more correct and more elegant in my style but then in return you had a greater fertility of imagination  my true history is much inferior in fancy and invention in force of wit and keenness of satire to your history of the acts of gargantua and pantagruel  rabelaisyou do me great honour but i may say without vanity that both those compositions entitle the authors of them to a very distinguished place among memoirwriters travellers and even historians ancient and modern  luciandoubtless they do but will you pardon me if i ask you one question  why did you choose to write such absolute nonsense as you have in some places of your illustrious work  rabelaisi was forced to compound my physic for the mind with a large dose of nonsense in order to make it go down  to own the truth to you if i had not so frequently put on the foolscap the freedoms i took in other places with cowls with red hats and the triple crown itself would have brought me into great danger  not only my book but i myself should in all probability have been condemned to the flames and martyrdom was an honour to which i never aspired  i therefore counterfeited folly like junius brutus from the wisest of all principlesthat of selfpreservation  you lucian had no need to use so much caution  your heathen priests desired only a sacrifice now and then from an epicurean as a mark of conformity and kindly allowed him to make as free as he pleased in conversation or writings with the whole tribe of gods and goddessesfrom the thundering jupiter and the scolding juno down to the dog anubis and the fragrant dame cloacina  luciansay rather that our government allowed us that liberty for i assure you our priests were by no means pleased with itat least they were not in my time  rabelaisthe wiser men they for in spite of the conformity required by the laws and enforced by the magistrate that ridicule brought the system of pagan theology into contempt not only with the philosophical part of mankind but even with the vulgar  lucianit did so and the ablest defenders of paganism were forced to give up the poetical fables and allegorise the whole  rabelaisan excellent way of drawing sense out of absurdity and grave instructions from lewdness  there is a great modern wit sir francis bacon lord verulam who in his treatise entitled the wisdom of the ancients has done more for you that way than all your own priests  lucianhe has indeed shown himself an admirable chemist and made a fine transmutation of folly into wisdom  but all the later platonists took the same method of defending our faith when it was attacked by the christians and certainly a more judicious one could not be found  our fables say that in one of their wars with the titans the gods were defeated and forced to turn themselves into beasts in order to escape from the conquerors  just the reverse happened here for by this happy art our beastly divinities were turned again into rational beings  rabelaisgive me a good commentator with a subtle refining philosophical head and you shall have the edification of seeing him draw the most sublime allegories and the most venerable mystic truths from my history of the noble gargantua and pantagruel  i dont despair of being proved to the entire satisfaction of some future ape to have been without exception the profoundest divine and metaphysician that ever yet held a pen  luciani shall rejoice to see you advanced to that honour  but in the meantime i may take the liberty to consider you as one of our class there you sit very high  rabelaisi am afraid there is another and a modern author too whom you would bid to sit above me and but just below yourselfi mean dr swift  lucianit was not necessary for him to throw so much nonsense into his history of lemuel gulliver as you did into that of your two illustrious heroes and his style is far more correct than yours  his wit never descended as yours frequently did into the lowest of taverns nor ever wore the meanest garb of the vulgar  rabelaisif the garb which it wore was not as mean i am certain it was sometimes as dirty as mine  lucianit was not always nicely clean yet in comparison with you he was decent and elegant  but whether there was not in your compositions more fire and a more comic spirit i will not determine  rabelaisif you will not determine it een let it remain a matter in dispute as i have left the great question whether panurge should marry or not  i would as soon undertake to measure the difference between the height and bulk of the giant gargantua and his brobdignagian majesty as the difference of merit between my writings and swifts  if any man takes a fancy to like my book let him freely enjoy the entertainment it gives him and drink to my memory in a bumper  if another likes gulliver let him toast dr swift  were i upon earth i would pledge him in a bumper supposing the wine to be good  if a third likes neither of us let him silently pass the bottle and be quiet  lucianbut what if he will not be quiet  a critic is an unquiet creature  rabelaiswhy then he will disturb himself not me  lucianyou are a greater philosopher than i thought you  i knew you paid no respect to popes or kings but to pay none to critics is in an author a magnanimity beyond all example  rabelaismy life was a farce my death was a farce and would you have me make my book a serious affair  as for you though in general you are only a joker yet sometimes you must be ranked among grave authors you have written sage and learned dissertations on history and other weighty matters  the critics have therefore an undoubted right to maul you they find you in their province  but if any of them dare to come into mine i will order gargantua to swallow them up as he did the six pilgrims in the next salad he eats  lucianhave i not heard that you wrote a very good serious book on the aphorisms of hippocrates  rabelaisupon my faith i had forgot it  i am so used to my fools coat that i dont know myself in my solemn doctors gown  but your information was right that book was indeed a very respectable work  yet nobody reads it and if i had writ nothing else i should have been reckoned at best a lackey to hippocrates whereas the historian of panurge is an eminent writer  plain good sense like a dish of solid beef or mutton is proper only for peasants but a ragout of folly well dressed with a sharp sauce of wit is fit to be served up at an emperors table  lucianyou are an admirable pleasant fellow  let me embrace you  how apollo and the muses may rank you on parnassus i am not very certain but if i were master of the ceremonies on mount olympus you should be placed with a full bowl of nectar before you at the right hand of momus  rabelaisi wish you were but i fear the inhabitants of those sublime regions will like your company no better than mine  indeed how momus himself could get a seat at that table i cant well comprehend  it has been usual i confess in some of our courts upon earth to have a privileged jester called the kings fool  but in the court of heaven one should not have supposed such an officer as jupiters fool  your allegorical theology in this point is very abstruse  luciani think our priests admitted momus into our heaven as the indians are said to worship the devil through fear  they had a mind to keep fair with him  for we may talk of the giants as much as we please but to our gods there is no enemy so formidable as he  ridicule is the terror of all false religion  nothing but truth can stand its lash  rabelaistruth advantageously set in a good and fair light can stand any attacks but those of ridicule are so teasing and so fallacious that i have seen them put her ladyship very much out of humour  lucianay friend rabelais and sometimes out of countenance too  but truth and wit in confederacy will strike momus dumb  united they are invincible and such a union is necessary upon certain occasions  false reasoning is most effectually exposed by plain sense but wit is the best opponent to false ridicule as just ridicule is to all the absurdities which dare to assume the venerable names of philosophy or religion  had we made such a proper use of our agreeable talents had we employed our ridicule to strip the foolish faces of superstition fanaticism and dogmatical pride of the serious and solemn masks with which they are covered at the same time exerting all the sharpness of our wit to combat the flippancy and pertness of those who argue only by jests against reason and evidence in points of the highest and most serious concern we should have much better merited the esteem of mankind    dialogue xxiii   periclescosmo de medicis the first of that name  periclesin what i have heard of your character and your fortune illustrious cosmo i find a most remarkable resemblance with mine  we both lived in republics where the sovereign power was in the people and by mere civil arts but more especially by our eloquence attained without any force to such a degree of authority that we ruled those tumultuous and stormy democracies with an absolute sway turned the tempests which agitated them upon the heads of our enemies and after having long and prosperously conducted the greatest affairs in war and peace died revered and lamented by all our fellowcitizens  cosmowe have indeed an equal right to value ourselves on that noblest of empires the empire we gained over the minds of our countrymen  force or caprice may give power but nothing can give a lasting authority except wisdom and virtue  by these we obtained by these we preserved in our respective countries a dominion unstained by usurpation or blooda dominion conferred on us by the public esteem and the public affection  we were in reality sovereigns while we lived with the simplicity of private men and athens and florence believed themselves to be free though they obeyed all our dictates  this is more than was done by philip of macedon or sylla or caesar  it is the perfection of policy to tame the fierce spirit of popular liberty not by blows or by chains but by soothing it into a voluntary obedience and bringing it to lick the hand that restrains it  periclesthe task can never be easy but the difficulty was still greater to me than to you  for i had a lion to tame from whose intractable fury the greatest men of my country and of the whole world with all their wisdom and virtue could not save themselves  themistocles and aristides were examples of terror that might well have deterred me from the administration of public affairs at athens  another impediment in my way was the power of cimon who for his goodness his liberality and the lustre of his victories over the persians was much beloved by the people and at the same time by being thought to favour aristocracy had all the noble and rich citizens devoted to his party  it seemed impossible to shake so well established a greatness  yet by the charms and force of my eloquence which exceeded that of all orators contemporary with me by the integrity of my life my moderation and my prudence but above all by my artful management of the people whose power i increased that i might render it the basis and support of my own i gained such an ascendant over all my opponents that having first procured the banishment of cimon by ostracism and then of thucydides another formidable antagonist set up by the nobles against my authority i became the unrivalled chief or rather the monarch of the athenian republic without ever putting to death in above forty years that my administration continued one of my fellowcitizens a circumstance which i declared when i lay on my deathbed to be in my own judgment more honourable to me than all my prosperity in the government of the state or the nine trophies erected for so many victories obtained by my conduct  cosmoi had also the same happiness to boast of at my death  and some additions were made to the territories of florence under my government but i myself was no soldier and the commonwealth i directed was never either so warlike or so powerful as athens  i must therefore not pretend to vie with you in the lustre of military glory and i will moreover acknowledge that to govern a people whose spirit and pride were exalted by the wonderful victories of marathon mycale salamis and plataea was much more difficult than to rule the florentines and the tuscans  the liberty of the athenians was in your time more imperious more haughty more insolent than the despotism of the king of persia how great then must have been your ability and address that could so absolutely reduce it under your power  yet the temper of my countrymen was not easy to govern for it was exceedingly factious  the history of florence is little else for several ages than an account of conspiracies against the state  in my youth i myself suffered much by the dissensions which then embroiled the republic  i was imprisoned and banished but after the course of some years my enemies in their turn were driven into exile  i was brought back in triumph and from that time till my death which was above thirty years i governed the florentines not by arms or evil arts of tyrannical power but with a legal authority which i exercised so discreetly as to gain the esteem of all the neighbouring potentates and such a constant affection of all my fellowcitizens that an inscription which gave me the title of father of my country was engraved on my monument by an unanimous decree of the whole commonwealth  periclesyour end was incomparably more happy than mine  for you died rather of age than any violent illness and left the florentines in a state of peace and prosperity procured for them by your counsels  but i died of the plague after having seen it almost depopulate athens and left my country engaged in a most dangerous war to which my advice and the power of my eloquence had excited the people  the misfortune of the pestilence with the inconveniences they suffered on account of the war so irritated their minds that not long before my death they condemned me to a fine  cosmoit is wonderful that when once their anger was raised it went no further against you  a favourite of the people when disgraced is in still greater danger than a favourite of a king  periclesyour surprise will increase at hearing that very soon afterwards they chose me their general and conferred on me again the principal direction of all their affairs  had i lived i should have so conducted the war as to have ended it with advantage and honour to my country  for having secured to her the sovereignty of the sea by the defeat of the samians before i let her engage with the power of sparta i knew that our enemies would be at length wearied out and compelled to sue for a peace because the city from the strength of its fortifications and the great army within it being on the land side impregnable to the spartans and drawing continual supplies from the sea suffered not much by their ravages of the country about it from whence i had before removed all the inhabitants whereas their allies were undone by the descents we made on their coasts  cosmoyou seem to have understood beyond all other men what advantages are to be drawn from a maritime power and how to make it the surest foundation of empire  penniesi followed the plan traced out by themistocles the ablest politician that greece had ever produced  nor did i begin the peloponnesian war as some have supposed only to make myself necessary and stop an inquiry into my public accounts  i really thought that the republic of athens could no longer defer a contest with sparta without giving up to that state the precedence in the direction of greece and her own independence  to keep off for some time even a necessary war with a probable hope of making it more advantageously at a favourable opportunity is an act of true wisdom but not to make it when you see that your enemy will be strengthened and your own advantages lost or considerably lessened by the delay is a most pernicious imprudence with relation to my accounts i had nothing to fear  i had not embezzled one drachma of public money nor added one to my own paternal estate and the people had placed so entire a confidence in me that they had allowed me against the usual forms of their government to dispose of large sums for secret service without account  when therefore i advised the peloponnesian war i neither acted from private views nor with the inconsiderate temerity of a restless ambition but as became a wise statesman who having weighed all the dangers that may attend a great enterprise and seeing a reasonable hope of good success makes it his option to fight for dominion and glory rather than sacrifice both to the uncertain possession of an insecure peace  cosmohow were you sure of inducing so volatile a people to persevere in so steady a system of conduct as that which you had laid downa system attended with much inconvenience and loss to particulars while it presented but little to strike or inflame the imagination of the public bold and arduous enterprises great battles much bloodshed and a speedy decision are what the multitude desire in every war but your plan of operation was the reverse of all this and the execution of it required the temper of the thebans rather than of the athenians  periclesi found indeed many symptoms of their impatience but i was able to restrain it by the authority i had gained for during my whole ministry i never had stooped to court their favour by any unworthy means never flattered them in their follies nor complied with their passions against their true interests and my own better judgment but used the power of my eloquence to keep them in the bounds of a wise moderation to raise their spirits when too low and show them their danger when they grew too presumptuous the good effects of which conduct they had happily experienced in all their affairs  whereas those who succeeded to me in the government by their incapacity their corruption and their servile complaisance to the humour of the people presently lost all the fruits of my virtue and prudence  xerxes himself i am convinced did not suffer more by the flattery of his courtiers than the athenians after my decease by that of their orators and ministers of state  cosmothose orators could not gain the favour of the people by any other methods  your arts were more noblethey were the arts of a statesman and of a prince  your magnificent buildings which in beauty of architecture surpassed any the world had ever seen the statues of phidias the paintings of zeuxis the protection you gave to knowledge genius and abilities of every kind added as much to the glory of athens as to your popularity  and in this i may boast of an equal merit to florence  for i embellished that city and the whole country about it with excellent buildings i protected all arts and though i was not myself so eloquent or so learned as you i no less encouraged those who were eminent in my time for their eloquence or their learning  marcilius ficinus the second father of the platonic philosophy lived in my house and conversed with me as intimately as anaxagoras with you  nor did i ever forget and suffer him so to want the necessaries of life as you did anaxagoras who had like to have perished by that unfriendly neglect but to secure him at all times from any distress in his circumstances and enable him to pursue his sublime speculations unmolested by low cares i gave him an estate adjacent to one of my favourite villas  i also drew to florence argiropolo the most learned greek of those times that under my patronage he might teach the florentine youth the language and sciences of his country  but with regard to our buildings there is this remarkable differenceyours were all raised at the expense of the public mine at my own  periclesmy estate would bear no profuseness nor allow me to exert the generosity of my nature  your wealth exceeded that of any particular or indeed of any prince who lived in your days  the vast commerce which after the example of your ancestors you continued to carry on in all parts of the world even while you presided at the helm of the state enabled you to do those splendid acts which rendered your name so illustrious  but i was constrained to make the public treasure the fund of my bounties and i thought i could not possibly dispose of it better in time of peace than in finding employment for that part of the people which must else have been idle and useless to the community introducing into greece all the elegant arts and adorning my country with works that are an honour to human nature for while i attended the most to these civil and peaceful occupations i did not neglect to provide with timely care against war nor suffer the nation to sink into luxury and effeminate softness  i kept our fleets in continual exercise maintained a great number of seamen in constant pay and disciplined well our land forces  nor did i ever cease to recommend to all the athenians both by precepts and example frugality temperance magnanimity fortitude and whatever could most effectually contribute to strengthen their bodies and minds  cosmoyet i have heard you condemned for rendering the people less sober and modest by giving them a share of the conquered lands and paying them wages for their necessary attendance in the public assemblies and other civil functions but more especially for the vast and superfluous expense you entailed on the state in the theatrical spectacles with which you entertained them at the cost of the public  periclesperhaps i may have been too lavish in some of those bounties  yet in a popular state it is necessary that the people should be amused and should so far partake of the opulence of the public as not to suffer any want which would render their minds too low and sordid for their political duties  in my time the revenues of athens were sufficient to bear this charge but afterwards when we had lost the greatest part of our empire it became i must confess too heavy a burden and the continuance of it proved one cause of our ruin  cosmoit is a most dangerous thing to load the state with largesses of that nature or indeed with any unnecessary but popular charges because to reduce them is almost impossible though the circumstances of the public should necessarily demand a reduction  but did not you likewise in order to advance your own greatness throw into the hands of the people of athens more power than the institutions of solon had entrusted them with and more than was consistent with the good of the state  pericleswe are now in the regions where truth presides and i dare not offend her by playing the orator in defence of my conduct  i must therefore acknowledge that by weakening the power of the court of areopagus i tore up that anchor which solon had wisely fixed to keep his republic firm against the storms and fluctuations of popular factions this alteration which fundamentally injured the whole state i made with a view to serve my own ambition the only passion in my nature which i could not contain within the limits of virtue  for i knew that my eloquence would subject the people to me and make them the willing instruments of all my desires whereas the areopagus had in it an authority and a dignity which i could not control  thus by diminishing the counterpoise our constitution had settled to moderate the excess of popular power i augmented my own  but since my death i have been often reproached by the shades of some of the most virtuous and wisest athenians who have fallen victims to the caprice or fury of the people with having been the first cause of the injustice they suffered and of all the mischiefs perpetually brought on my country by rash undertakings bad conduct and fluctuating councils  they say i delivered up the state to the government of indiscreet or venal orators and to the passions of a misguided infatuated multitude who thought their freedom consisted in encouraging calumnies against the best servants of the commonwealth and conferring power upon those who had no other merit than falling in with and soothing a popular folly  it is useless for me to plead that during my life none of these mischiefs were felt that i employed my rhetoric to promote none but good and wise measures that i was as free from any taint of avarice or corruption as aristides himself they reply that i am answerable for all the great evils occasioned afterwards by the want of that salutary restraint on the natural levity and extravagance of a democracy which i had taken away  socrates calls me the patron of anytus and solon himself frowns upon me whenever we meet  cosmosolon has reason to do so for tell me pericles what opinion would you have of the architect you employed in your buildings if he had made them to last no longer than during the term of your life  periclesthe answer to your question will turn to your own condemnation  your excessive liberalities to the indigent citizens and the great sums you lent to all the noble families did in reality buy the republic of florence and gave your family such a power as enabled them to convert it from a popular state into an absolute monarchy  cosmothe florentines were so infested with discord and faction and their commonwealth was so void of military virtue that they could not have long been exempt from a more ignominious subjection to some foreign power if those internal dissensions with the confusion and anarchy they produced had continued  but the athenians had performed very glorious exploits had obtained a great empire and were become one of the noblest states in the world before you altered the balance of their government and after that alteration they declined very fast till they lost all their greatness  periclestheir constitution had originally a foul blemish in iti mean the ban of ostracism which alone would have been sufficient to undo any state  for there is nothing of such important use to a nation as that men who most excel in wisdom and virtue should be encouraged to undertake the business of government  but this detestable custom deterred such men from serving the public or if they ventured to do so turned even their own wisdom and virtue against them so that in athens it was safer to be infamous than renowned  we are told indeed by the advocates for this strange institution that it was not a punishment but meant as a guard to the equality and liberty of the state for which reason they deem it an honour done to the persons against whom it was used as if words could change the real nature of things and make a banishment of ten years inflicted on a good citizen by the suffrages of his countrymen no evil to him or no offence against justice and the natural right every freeman may claimthat he shall not be expelled from any society of which he is a member without having first been proved guilty of some criminal action  cosmothe ostracism was indeed a most unpardonable fault in the athenian constitution  it placed envy in the seat of justice and gave to private malice and public ingratitude a legal right to do wrong  other nations are blamed for tolerating vice but the athenians alone would not tolerate virtue  periclesthe friends to the ostracism say that too eminent virtue destroys that equality which is the safeguard of freedom  cosmono state is well modelled if it cannot preserve itself from the danger of tyranny without a grievous violation of natural justice nor would a friend to true freedom which consists in being governed not by men but by laws desire to live in a country where a cleon bore rule and where an aristides was not suffered to remain  but instead of remedying this evil you made it worse  you rendered the people more intractable more adverse to virtue less subject to the laws and more to impressions from mischievous demagogues than they had been before your time  periclesin truth i did so and therefore my place in elysium notwithstanding the integrity of my whole public conduct and the great virtues i excited is much below the rank of those who have governed commonwealths or limited monarchies not merely with a concern for their present advantage but also with a prudent regard to that balance of power on which their permanent happiness must necessarily depend    dialogue xxiv   lockebayle  bayleyes we both were philosophers but my philosophy was the deepest  you dogmatised

vain and idle efforts  lockei agree with you that human nature should know its own weakness but it should also feel its strength and try to improve it this was my employment as a philosopher  i endeavoured to discover the real powers of the mind to see what it could do and what it could not to restrain it from efforts beyond its ability but to teach it how to advance as far as the faculties given to it by nature with the utmost exertion and most proper culture of them would allow it to go  in the vast ocean of philosophy i had the line and the plummet always in my hands  many of its depths i found myself unable to fathom but by caution in sounding and the careful observations i made in the course of my voyage i found out some truths of so much use to mankind that they acknowledge me to have been their benefactor  bayletheir ignorance makes them think so  some other philosopher will come hereafter and show those truths to be falsehoods  he will pretend to discover other truths

without proof like theories to explain the phenomena of nature built on suppositions instead of experiments must perpetually change and destroy one another  but some opinions there are even in matters not obvious to the common sense of mankind which the mind has received on such rational grounds of assent that they are as immovable as the pillars of heaven or to speak philosophically as the great laws of nature by which under god the universe is sustained  can you seriously think that because the hypothesis of your countryman descartes which was nothing but an ingenious wellimagined romance has been lately exploded the system of newton which is built on experiments and geometrythe two most certain methods of discovering truthwill ever fail  or that because the whims of fanatics and the divinity of the schoolmen cannot now be supported the doctrines of that religion which i the declared enemy of all enthusiasm and false reasoning firmly believed and maintained will ever be shaken

suppose he would have returned  lockecome come monsieur bayle you yourself know the difference between the foundations on which the credit of those systems and that of newton is placed  your scepticism is more affected than real  you found it a shorter way to a great reputation the only wish of your heart to object than to defend to pull down than to set up  and your talents were admirable for that kind of work  then your huddling together in a critical dictionary a pleasant tale or obscene jest and a grave argument against the christian religion a witty confutation of some absurd author and an artful sophism to impeach some respectable truth was particularly commodious to all our young smarts and smatterers in freethinking  but what mischief have you not done to human society  you have endeavoured and with some degree of success to shake those foundations on which the whole moral world and the great fabric of social happiness entirely rest  how could you as a philosopher in the sober hours of reflection answer for this to your conscience even supposing you had doubts of the truth of a system which gives to virtue its sweetest hopes to impenitent vice its greatest fears and to true penitence its best consolations which restrains even the least approaches to guilt and yet makes those allowances for the infirmities of our nature which the stoic pride denied to it but which its real imperfection and the goodness of its infinitely benevolent creator so evidently require  baylethe mind is free and it loves to exert its freedom  any restraint upon it

zeal of a sectary and a total indifference to all religion  baylewith regard to morality i was not indifferent  lockehow could you then be indifferent with regard to the sanctions religion gives to morality  how could you publish what tends so directly and apparently to weaken in mankind the belief of those sanctions  was not this sacrificing the great interests of virtue to the little motives

judgment can have no such excuse  i know very well there are passages in all your works and those not a few where you talk like a rigid moralist  i have also heard that your character was

appeared to respect them  how many who have stronger passions than you had and are desirous to get rid of the curb that restrains them will lay hold of your scepticism to set themselves loose from all obligations of virtue what a misfortune is it to have made such a use of such talents  it would have been better for you and for mankind if you had been one of the dullest of dutch theologians or the most credulous monk in a portuguese convent  the riches of the mind like those of fortune may be employed so perversely as to become a nuisance and pest instead of an ornament and support to society  bayleyou are very severe upon me  but do you count it no merit no service to mankind to deliver them from the frauds and fetters of priestcraft from the deliriums of fanaticism and from the terrors and follies of superstition  consider how much mischief these have done to the world  even in the last age what massacres what civil wars what convulsions of government what confusion in society did

root of these evils  lockethe root of these evils you well know was false religion but you struck at the true  heaven and hell are not more different than the system of faith i defended and that which produced the horrors of which you speak  why would you so fallaciously confound them together in some of your writings that it requires much more judgment and a more diligent attention than ordinary readers have to separate them again and to make the proper distinctions  this indeed is the great art of the most celebrated freethinkers  they recommend themselves to warm and ingenuous minds by lively strokes of wit and by arguments really strong against superstition enthusiasm and priestcraft but at the same time they insidiously throw the colours of these upon the fair face of true religion and dress her out in their garb with a malignant intention to render her odious or despicable to those who have not penetration enough to discern the impious fraud  some of them may have thus deceived themselves as well as others  yet it is certain no book that ever was written by the most acute of these gentlemen is so repugnant to priestcraft to spiritual tyranny to all absurd

greenwich fieldmarshal of his britannic majestys forces  argyleyes noble douglas it grieves me that you and your son together with the brave earl of buchan should have employed so much valour and have thrown away your lives in fighting the battles of that state which from its situation and interests is the perpetual and most dangerous enemy to great britain  a british nobleman serving france appears to me as unfortunate and as much out of his proper sphere as a grecian commander engaged in the service of persia would have appeared to aristides or agesilaus  douglasin serving france i served scotland  the french were the natural allies to the scotch and by supporting their crown i enabled my countrymen to maintain their independence against the english  argylethe french indeed from the unhappy state of our country were ancient allies to the scotch but that they ever were our natural allies i deny  their alliance was proper and necessary for us because we were then in an unnatural state disunited from england  while that disunion continued our monarchy was compelled to lean upon france for assistance and support  the french power and policy kept us i acknowledge independent of the english but dependent on them and this dependence exposed us to many grievous calamities by drawing on our country the formidable arms of the english whenever it happened that the french and they had a quarrel  the succours they afforded us were distant and uncertain  our enemy was at hand superior to us in strength though not in valour  our borders were ravaged our kings were slain or led captive we lost all the advantage of being the inhabitants of a great island we had no commerce no peace no security no degree of maritime power  scotland was a backdoor through which the french with our help made their inroads into england if they conquered we obtained little benefit from it but if they were defeated we were always the devoted victims on whom the conquerors severely wreaked their resentment  douglasthe english suffered as much in those wars as we  how terribly were their borders laid waste and depopulated by our sharp incursions  how often have the swords of my ancestors been stained with the best blood of that nation  were not our victories at bannockburn and at otterburn as glorious as any that with all the advantage of numbers they have ever obtained over us  argylethey were but yet they did us no lasting good  they left us still dependent on the protection of france  they left us a poor a feeble a distressed though a most valiant nation  they irritated england but could not subdue it nor hinder our feeling such effects of its enmity as gave us no reason to rejoice in our triumphs  how much more happily in the auspicious reign of that queen who formed the union was my sword employed in humbling the foes of great britain  with how superior a dignity did i appear in the combined british senate maintaining the interests of the whole united people of england and scotland against all foreign powers who attempted to disturb our general happiness or to invade our common rights  douglasyour eloquence and your valour had unquestionably a much nobler and more spacious field to exercise themselves in than any of those who defended the interests of only a part of the island  argylewhenever i read any account of the wars between the scotch and the english i think i am reading a melancholy history of civil dissensions  whichever side is defeated their loss appears to me a loss to the whole and an advantage to some foreign enemy of great britain  but the strength of that island is made complete by the union and what a great english poet has justly said in one instance is now true in all     the hotspur and the douglas both together    are confident against the world in arms  who can resist the english and scotch valour combined  when separated and opposed they balanced each other united they will hold the balance of europe  if all the scotch blood that has been shed for the french in unnatural wars against england had been poured out to oppose the ambition of france in conjunction with the englishif all the english blood that has been spilt as unfortunately in useless wars against scotland had been preserved france would long ago have been rendered incapable of disturbing our peace and great britain would have been the most powerful of nations  douglasthere is truth in all you have said  but yet when i reflect on the insidious ambition of king edward i on the ungenerous arts he so treacherously employed to gain or rather to steal the sovereignty of our kingdom and the detestable cruelty he showed to wallace our brave champion and martyr my soul is up in arms against the insolence of the english and i adore the memory of those patriots who died in asserting the independence of our crown and the liberty of our nation  argylehad i lived in those days i should have joined with those patriots and been the foremost to maintain so noble a cause  the scotch were not made to be subject to the english  their souls are too great for such a timid submission  but they may unite and incorporate with a nation they would not obey  their scorn of a foreign yoke their strong and generous love of independence and freedom make their union with england more natural and more proper  had the spirit of the scotch been servile or base it could never have coalesced with that of the english  douglasit is true that the minds of both nations are congenial and filled with the same noble virtues the same impatience of servitude the same magnanimity courage and prudence the same genius for policy for navigation and commerce for sciences and arts  yet notwithstanding this happy conformity when i consider how long they were enemies to each other what an hereditary hatred and jealousy had subsisted for many ages between them what private passions what prejudices what contrary interests must have necessarily obstructed every step of the treaty and how hard it was to overcome the strong opposition of national pride i stand astonished that it was possible to unite the two kingdoms upon any conditions and much more that it could be done with such equal regard and amicable fairness to both  argyleit was indeed a most arduous and difficult undertaking  the success of it must i think be thankfully ascribed not only to the great firmness and prudence of those who had the management of it but to the gracious assistance of providence for the preservation of the reformed religion amongst us which in that conjuncture if the union had not been made would have been ruined in scotland and much endangered in england  the same good providence has watched over and protected it since in a most signal manner against the attempts of an infatuated party in scotland and the arts of france who by her emissaries laboured to destroy it as soon as formed because she justly foresaw that the continuance of it would be destructive to all her vast designs against the liberty of europe  i myself had the honour to have a principal share in subduing one rebellion designed to subvert it and since my death it has been i hope established for ever not only by the defeat of another rebellion which came upon us in the midst of a dangerous war with france but by measures prudently taken in order to prevent such disturbances for the future  the ministers of the crown have proposed and the british legislature has enacted a wise system of laws the object of which is to reform and to civilise the highlands of scotland to deliver the people there from the arbitrary power and oppression of their chieftains to carry the royal justice and royal protection into the wildest parts of their mountains to hinder their natural valour from being abused and perverted to the detriment of their country and to introduce among them arts agriculture commerce tranquillity with all the improvements of social and polished life  douglasby what you now tell me you give me the highest idea of the great prince your master who after having been provoked by such a wicked rebellion instead of enslaving the people of the highlands or laying the hand of power more heavily upon them which is the usual consequence of unsuccessful revolts has conferred on them the inestimable blessings of liberty justice and good order  to act thus is indeed to perfect the union and make all the inhabitants of great britain acknowledge with gratitude and with joy that they are subjects of the same wellregulated kingdom and governed with the same impartial affection by the sovereign and father of the whole commonwealth  argylethe laws i have mentioned and the humane benevolent policy of his majestys government have already produced very salutary effects in that part of the kingdom and if steadily pursued will produce many more  but no words can recount to you the infinite benefits which have attended the union in the northern counties of england and the southern of scotland  douglasthe fruits of it must be doubtless most sensible there where the perpetual enmity between the two nations had occasioned the greatest disorder and desolation  argyleoh douglas could you revive and return into scotland what a delightful alteration would you see in that country  all those great tracts of land which in your time lay untilled on account of the inroads of the bordering english or the feuds and discords that raged with perpetual violence within our own distracted kingdom you would now behold cultivated and smiling with plenty  instead of the castles which every baron was compelled to erect for the defence of his family and where he lived in the barbarism of gothic pride among miserable vassals oppressed by the abuse of his feudal powers your eyes would be charmed with elegant country houses adorned with fine plantations and beautiful gardens while happy villages or gay towns are rising about them and enlivening the prospect with every image of rural wealth  on our coasts trading cities full of new manufactures and continually increasing the extent of their commerce  in our ports and harbours innumerable merchant ships richly loaded and protected from all enemies by the matchless fleet of great britain  but of all improvements the greatest is in the minds of the scotch  these have profited even more than their lands by the culture which the settled peace and tranquillity produced by the union have happily given to them and they have discovered such talents in all branches of literature as might render the english jealous of being excelled by their genius if there could remain a competition when there remains no distinction between the two nations  douglasthere may be emulation without jealousy and the efforts which that emulation will excite may render our island superior in the fame of wit and good learning to italy or to greece a superiority which i have learnt in the elysian fields to prefer even to that which is acquired by arms  but one doubt still remains with me concerning the union  i have been informed that no more than sixteen of our peers except those who have english peerages which some of the noblest have not now sit in the house of lords as representatives of the rest  does not this in a great measure diminish those peers who are not elected  and have you not found the election of the sixteen too dependent on the favour of a court  argyleit was impossible that the english could ever consent in the treaty of union to admit a greater number to have places and votes in the upper house of parliament but all the scotch peerage is virtually there by representation  and those who are not elected have every dignity and right of the peerage except the privilege of sitting in the house of lords and some others depending thereon  douglasthey have so but when parliaments enjoy such a share in the government of a country as ours do at this time to be personally there is a privilege and a dignity of the highest importance  argylei wish it had been possible to impart it to all  but your reason will tell you it was not  and consider my lord that till the revolution in      the power vested by our government in the lords of the articles had made our parliaments much more subject to the influence of the crown than our elections are now  as by the manner in which they were constituted those lords were no less devoted to the king than his own privy council and as no proposition could then be presented in parliament if rejected by them they gave him a negative before debate this indeed was abolished upon the accession of king william iii with many other oppressive and despotical powers which had rendered our nobles abject slaves to the crown while they were allowed to be tyrants over the people  but if king james or his son had been restored the government he had exercised would have been reestablished and nothing but the union of the two kingdoms could have effectually prevented that restoration  we likewise owe to the union the subsequent abolition of the scotch privy council which had been the most grievous engine of tyranny and that salutary law which declared that no crimes should be high treason or misprision of treason in scotland but such as were so in england and gave us the english methods of trial in cases of that nature whereas before there were so many species of treasons the construction of them was so uncertain and the trials were so arbitrary that no man could be safe from suffering as a traitor  by the same act of parliament we also received a communication of that noble privilege of the english exemption from torturea privilege which though essential both to humanity and to justice no other nation in europe not even the freest republics can boast of possessing  shall we then take offence at some inevitable circumstances which may be objected to on our part in the treaty of union when it has delivered us from slavery and all the worst evils that a state can suffer  it might be easily shown that in his political and civil condition every baron in scotland is much happier now and much more independent than the highest was under that constitution of government which continued in scotland even after the expulsion of king james ii  the greatest enemies to the union are the friends of that king in whose reign and in his brothers the kingdom of scotland was subjected to a despotism as arbitrary as that of france and more tyrannically administered  douglasall i have heard of those reigns makes me blush with indignation at the servility of our nobles who could endure them so long  what then was become of that undaunted scotch spirit which had dared to resist the plantagenets in the height of their power and pride could the descendants of those who had disdained to be subjects of edward i submit to be slaves of charles ii or james  argylethey seemed in general to have lost every characteristic of their natural temper except a desire to abuse the royal authority for the gratification of their private resentments in family quarrels  douglasyour grandfather my lord has the glory of not deserving this censure  argylei am proud that his spirit and the principles he professed drew upon him the injustice and fury of those times  but there needs no other proof than the nature and the manner of his condemnation to show what a wretched state our nobility then were in and what an inestimable advantage it is to them that they are now to be tried as peers of great britain and have the benefit of those laws which imparted to us the equity and the freedom of the english constitution  upon the whole as much as wealth is preferable to poverty liberty to oppression and national strength to national weakness so much has scotland incontestably gained by the union  england too has secured by it every public blessing which was before enjoyed by her and has greatly augmented her strength  the martial spirit of the scotch their hardy bodies their acute and vigorous minds their industry their activity are now employed to the benefit of the whole island  he is now a bad scotchman who is not a good englishman and he is a bad englishman who is not a good scotchman  mutual intercourse mutual interests mutual benefits must naturally be productive of mutual affection  and when that is established when our hearts are sincerely united many great things which some remains of jealousy and distrust or narrow local partialities may hitherto have obstructed will be done for the good of the whole united kingdom  how much may the revenues of great britain be increased by the further increase of population of industry and of commerce in scotland  what a mighty addition to the stock of national wealth will arise from the improvement of our most northern counties which are infinitely capable of being improved  the briars and thorns are in a great measure grubbed up the flowers and fruits may soon be planted  and what more pleasing or what more glorious employment can any government have than to attend to the cultivating of such a plantation  douglasthe prospect you

argylethat history does in truth present to the mind a long series of the most direful objects assassinations rebellions anarchy tyranny and religion itself either cruel or gloomy and unsocial  an historian who would paint it in its true colours must take the pencil of guercino or salvator rosa  but the most agreeable imagination can hardly figure to itself a more pleasing scene of private and public felicity than will naturally result from the union if all the prejudices against it and all distinctions that may tend on either side to keep up an idea of separate interests or to revive a sharp remembrance of national animosities can be removed  douglasif they can be removed  i think it impossible they can be retained  to resist the union is indeed to rebel against nature  she has

strength of civil community men have been enabled to subdue the whole race of lions bears and serpents and what is more to bind in laws and wholesome regulations the ferocious violence and dangerous treachery of the human disposition  had lions been destroyed only in single combat men had had but a bad time of it and what but laws could awe the men who killed the lions  the genuine glory the proper distinction of the rational species arises from the perfection of the mental powers  courage is apt to be fierce and strength is often exerted in acts of oppression  but wisdom is the associate of justice it assists her to form equal laws to pursue right measures to correct power protect weakness and to unite individuals in a common interest and general welfare  heroes may kill tyrants but it is wisdom and laws that prevent tyranny and oppression  the operations of policy far surpass the labours of hercules preventing many evils which valour and might cannot even redress  you heroes consider nothing but glory and hardly regard whether the conquests which raise your fame are really beneficial to your country  unhappy are the people who are governed by valour not directed by prudence and not mitigated by the gentle arts  herculesi do not expect to find an admirer of my strenuous life in the man who taught his countrymen to sit still and read and to lose the hours of youth

as well as entertain the hours of repose and i think you should honour them for presenting to heroes such a noble recreation as may prevent their taking up the distaff when they lay down the club  herculeswits as well as heroes can take up the distaff  what think you of their thinspun systems of philosophy or lascivious poems or milesian fables  nay what is still worse are there not panegyrics on tyrants and books that blaspheme the gods and perplex the natural sense of right and wrong  i believe if eurystheus was to set me to work again he would find me a worse task than any he imposed he would make me read through a great library and i would serve it as i did the hydra i would burn as i went on that one chimera might not rise from another to plague mankind  i should have valued myself more on clearing the library than on cleansing the augean stables  cadmusit is in those libraries only that the memory of your labours exists  the heroes of marathon the patriots of thermopylae owe their immortality to me  all the wise institutions of lawgivers and all the doctrines of sages had perished in the ear like a dream related if letters had not preserved them  oh hercules it is not for the man who preferred virtue to pleasure to be an enemy to the muses  let sardanapalus and the silken sons of luxury who have wasted life in inglorious ease despise the records of action which bear no honourable testimony to their lives  but true merit heroic virtue each genuine offspring of immortal jove should honour the sacred source of lasting fame  herculesindeed if writers employed themselves only in recording the acts of great men much might be said in their favour  but why do they trouble people with their meditations  can it signify to the world what an idle man has been thinking  cadmusyes it may  the most important and extensive advantages mankind enjoy are greatly owing to men who have never quitted their closets  to them mankind is obliged for the facility and security of navigation  the invention of the compass has opened to them new worlds the knowledge of the mechanical powers has enabled them to construct such wonderful machines as perform what the united labour of millions by the severest drudgery could not accomplish  agriculture too the most useful of arts has received its share of improvement from the same source  poetry likewise is of excellent use to enable the memory to retain with more ease and to imprint with more energy upon the heart precepts of virtue and virtuous actions  since we left the world from the little root of a few letters science has spread its branches over all nature and raised its head to the heavens  some philosophers have entered so far into the counsels of divine wisdom as to explain much of the great operations of nature  the dimensions and distances of the planets the causes of their revolutions the path of comets and the ebbing and flowing of tides are understood and explained  can anything raise the glory of the human species more than to see a little creature inhabiting a small spot amidst innumerable worlds taking a survey of the universe comprehending its arrangement and entering into the scheme of that wonderful connection and correspondence of things so remote and which it seems the utmost exertion of omnipotence to have established what a volume of wisdom what a noble theology do these discoveries open to us  while some superior geniuses have soared to these sublime subjects other sagacious and diligent minds have been inquiring into the most minute works of the infinite artificer the same care the same providence is exerted through the whole and we should learn from it that to true wisdom utility and fitness appear perfection and whatever is beneficial is noble  herculesi approve of science as far as it is assistant to action  i like the improvement of navigation and the discovery of the greater part of the globe because it opens a wider field for the master spirits of the world to bustle in  cadmusthere spoke the soul of hercules  but if learned men are to be esteemed for the assistance they give to active minds in their schemes they are not less to be valued for their endeavours to give them a right direction and moderate their too great ardour  the study of history will teach the warrior and the legislator by what means armies have been victorious and states have become powerful and in the private citizen they will inculcate the love of liberty and order  the writings of sages point out a private path of virtue and show that the best empire is selfgovernment and subduing our passions the noblest of conquests  herculesthe true spirit of heroism acts by a sort of inspiration and wants neither the experience of history nor the doctrines of philosophers to direct it  but do not arts and sciences render men effeminate luxurious and inactive and can you deny that wit and learning are often made subservient to very bad purposes  cadmusi will own that there are some natures so happily formed they hardly want the assistance of a master and the rules of art to give them force or grace in everything they do  but these heaveninspired geniuses are few  as learning flourishes only where ease plenty and mild government subsist in so rich a soil and under so soft a climate the weeds of luxury will spring up among the flowers of art but the spontaneous weeds would grow more rank if they were allowed the undisturbed possession of the field  letters keep a frugal temperate nation from growing ferocious a rich one from becoming entirely sensual and debauched  every gift of the gods is sometimes abused but wit and fine talents by a natural law gravitate towards virtue accidents may drive them out of their proper direction but such accidents are a sort of prodigies and like other prodigies it is an alarming omen and of dire portent to the times  for if virtue cannot keep to her allegiance those men who in their hearts confess her divine right and know the value of her laws on whose fidelity and obedience can she depend  may such geniuses never descend to flatter vice encourage folly or propagate irreligion but exert all their powers in the service of virtue and celebrate the noble choice of those who like you preferred her to pleasure    dialogue xxvii   mercuryand a modern fine lady  mrs modishindeed mr

is rich has a great deal of business in the other world and must needs return to it he is so troublesome and obstreperous i know not what to do with him  take him under your care therefore good plutarch you will easily awe him into order and decency by the superiority an author has over a bookseller  bookselleram i got into a world so absolutely the reverse of that i left that here authors domineer over booksellers  dear charon let me go back and i will pay any price for my passage but if i must stay leave me not with any of those who are styled classical authors  as to you plutarch i have a particular animosity against you for having almost occasioned my ruin  when i first set up shop understanding but little of business i unadvisedly bought an edition of your lives a pack of old greeks and romans which cost me a great sum of money  i could never get off above twenty sets of them  i sold a few to the universities and some to eton and westminster for it is reckoned a pretty book for boys and undergraduates but unless a man has the luck to light on a pedant he shall not sell a set of them in twenty years  plutarchfrom the merit of the subjects i had hoped another reception for my works  i will own indeed that i am not always perfectly accurate in every circumstance nor do i give so exact and circumstantial a detail of the actions of my heroes as may be expected from a biographer who has confined himself to one or two characters  a zeal to preserve the memory of great men and to extend the influence of such noble examples made me undertake more than i could accomplish in the first degree of perfection but surely the characters of my illustrious men are not so imperfectly sketched that they will not stand forth to all ages as patterns of virtue and incitements to glory  my reflections are allowed to be deep and sagacious and what can be more useful to a reader than a wise mans judgment on a great mans conduct in my writings you will find no rash censures no undeserved encomiums no mean compliance with popular opinions no vain ostentation of critical skill nor any affected finesse  in my parallels which used to be admired as pieces of excellent judgment i compare with perfect impartiality one great man with another and each with the rule of justice  if indeed latter ages have produced greater men and better writers my heroes and my works ought to give place to them  as the world has now the advantage of much better rules of morality than the unassisted reason of poor pagans could form i do not wonder that those vices which appeared to us as mere blemishes in great characters should seem most horrid deformities in the purer eyes of the present agea delicacy i do not blame but admire and commend  and i must censure you for endeavouring if you could publish better examples to obtrude on your countrymen such as were defective  i rejoice at the preference which they give to perfect and unalloyed virtue and as i shall ever retain a high veneration for the illustrious men of every age i should be glad if you would give me some account of those persons who in wisdom justice valour patriotism have eclipsed my solon numa camillus and other boasts of greece or rome  booksellerwhy master plutarch you are talking greek indeed  that work which repaired the loss i sustained by the costly edition of your books was the lives of the highwaymen but i should never have grown rich if it had not been by publishing the lives of men that never lived  you must know that though in all times it was possible to have a great deal of learning and very little wisdom yet it is only by a modern improvement in the art of writing that a man may read all his life and have no learning or knowledge at all which begins to be an advantage of the greatest importance  there is as natural a war between your men of science and fools as between the cranes and the pigmies of old  most of our young men having deserted to the fools the party of the learned is near being beaten out of the field and i hope in a little while they will not dare to peep out of their forts and fastnesses at oxford and cambridge  there let them stay and study old musty moralists till one falls in love with the greek another with the roman virtue but our men of the world should read our new books which teach them to have no virtue at all  no book is fit for a gentlemans reading which is not void of facts and of doctrines that he may not grow a pedant in his morals or conversation  i look upon history i mean real history to be one of the worst kinds of study  whatever has happened may happen again and a wellbred man may unwarily mention a parallel instance he had met with in history and be betrayed into the awkwardness of introducing into his discourse a greek a roman or even a gothic name but when a gentleman has spent his time in reading adventures that never occurred exploits that never were achieved and events that not only never did but never can happen it is impossible that in life or in discourse he should ever apply them  a secret history in which there is no secret and no history cannot tempt indiscretion to blab or vanity to quote and by this means modern conversation flows gentle and easy unencumbered with matter and unburdened of instruction  as the present studies throw no weight or gravity into discourse and manners the women are not afraid to read our books which not only dispose to gallantry and coquetry but give rules for them  caesars commentaries and the account of xenophons expedition are not more studied by military commanders than our novels are by the fairto a different purpose indeed for their military maxims teach to conquer ours to yield  those inflame the vain and idle love of glory these inculcate a noble contempt of reputation the women have greater obligations to our writers than the men  by the commerce of the world men might learn much of what they get from books but the poor women who in their early youth are confined and restrained if it were not for the friendly assistance of books would remain long in an insipid purity of mind with a discouraging reserve of behaviour  plutarchas to your men who have quitted the study of virtue for the study of vice useful truth for absurd fancy and real history for monstrous fiction i have neither regard nor compassion for them but i am concerned for the women who are betrayed into these dangerous studies and i wish for their sakes i had expatiated more on the character of lucretia and some other heroines  bookselleri tell you our women do not read in order to live or to die like lucretia  if you would inform us that a billetdoux was found in her cabinet after her death or give a hint as if tarquin really saw her in the arms of a slave and that she killed herself not to suffer the shame of a discovery such anecdotes would sell very well  or if even by tradition but better still if by papers in the portian family you could show some probability that portia died of dram drinking you would oblige the world very much for you must know that next to newinvented characters we are fond of new lights upon ancient characters i mean such lights as show a reputed honest man to have been a concealed knave an illustrious hero a pitiful coward c  nay we are so fond of these kinds of information as to be pleased sometimes to see a character cleared from a vice or crime it has been charged with provided the person concerned be actually dead  but in this case the evidence must be authentic and amount to a demonstration in the other a detection is not necessary a slight suspicion will do if it concerns a really good and great character  plutarchi am the more surprised at what you say of the taste of your contemporaries as i met with a frenchman who assured me that less than a century ago he had written a much admired life of cyrus under the name of artamenes in which he ascribed to him far greater actions than those recorded of him by xenophon and herodotus and that many of the great heroes of history had been treated in the same manner that empires were gained and battles decided by the valour of a single man imagination bestowing what nature has denied and the system of human affairs rendered impossible  bookselleri assure you those books were very useful to the authors and their booksellers and for whose benefit besides should a man write these romances were very fashionable and had a great sale they fell in luckily with the humour of the age  plutarchmonsieur scuderi tells me they were written in the times of vigour and spirit in the evening of the gallant days of chivalry which though then declining had left in the hearts of men a warm glow of courage and heroism and they were to be called to books as to battle by the sound of the trumpet  he says too that if writers had not accommodated themselves to the prejudices of the age and written of bloody battles and desperate encounters their works would have been esteemed too effeminate an amusement for gentlemen  histories of chivalry instead of enervating tend to invigorate the mind and endeavour to raise human nature above the condition which is naturally prescribed to it but as strict justice patriotic motives prudent counsels and a dispassionate choice of what upon the whole is fittest and best do not direct these heroes of romance they cannot serve for instruction and example like the great characters of true history  it has ever been my opinion that only the clear and steady light of truth can guide men to virtue and that the lesson which is impracticable must be unuseful  whoever shall design to regulate his conduct by these visionary characters will be in the condition of superstitious people who choose rather to act by intimations they receive in the dreams of the night than by the sober counsels of morning meditation  yet i confess it has been the practice of many nations to incite men to virtue by relating the deeds of fabulous heroes but surely it is the custom only of yours to incite them to vice by the history of fabulous scoundrels men of fine imagination have soared into the regions of fancy to bring back astrea you go thither in search of pandora  oh disgrace to letters  oh shame to the muses  bookselleryou express great indignation at our present race of writers but believe me the fault lies chiefly on the side of the readers  as monsieur scuderi observed to you authors must comply with the manners and disposition of those who are to read them  there must be a certain sympathy between the book and the reader to create a good liking  would you present a modern fine gentleman who is negligently lolling in an easy chair with the labours of hercules for his recreation or make him climb the alps with hannibal when he is expiring with the fatigue of last nights ball  our readers must be amused flattered soothed such adventures must be offered to them as they would like to have a share in  plutarchit should be the first object of writers to correct the vices and follies of the age  i will allow as much compliance with the mode of the times as will make truth and good morals agreeable  your love of fictitious characters might be turned to good purpose if those presented to the public were to be formed on the rules of religion and morality  it must be confessed that history being employed only about illustrious persons public events and celebrated actions does not supply us with such instances of domestic merit as one could wish  our heroes are great in the field and the senate and act well in great scenes on the theatre of the world but the idea of a man who in the silent retired path of life never deviates into vice who considers no spectator but the omniscient being and solicits no applause but his approbation is the noblest model that can be exhibited to mankind and would be of the most general use  examples of domestic virtue would be more particularly useful to women than those of great heroines  the virtues of women are blasted by the breath of public fame as flowers that grow on an eminence are faded by the sun and wind which expand them but true female praise like the music of the spheres arises from a gentle a constant and an equal progress in the path marked out for them by their great creator and like the heavenly harmony it is not adapted to the gross ear of mortals but is reserved for the delight of higher beings by whose wise laws they were ordained to give a silent light and shed a mild benignant influence on the world  booksellerwe have had some english and french writers who aimed at what you suggest  in the supposed character of clarissa said a clergyman to me a few days before i left the world one finds the dignity of heroism tempered by the meekness and humility of religion a perfect purity of mind and sanctity of manners  in that of sir charles grandison a noble pattern of every private virtue with sentiments so exalted as to render him equal to every public duty  plutarchare both these characters by the same author  bookselleray master plutarch and what will surprise you more this author has printed for me  plutarchby what you say it is pity he should print any work but his own  are there no other authors who write in this manner  bookselleryes we have another writer of these imaginary histories one who has not long since descended to these regions  his name is fielding and his works as i have heard the best judges say have a true spirit of comedy and an exact representation of nature with fine moral touches  he has not indeed given lessons of pure and consummate virtue but he has exposed vice and meanness with all the powers of ridicule and we have some other good wits who have exerted their talents to the purposes you approve  monsieur de marivaux and some other french writers have also proceeded much upon the same plan with a spirit and elegance which give their works no mean rank among the belles lettres i will own that when there is wit and entertainment enough in a book to make it sell it is not the worse for good morals  charoni think plutarch you have made this gentleman a little more humble and now i will carry him the rest of his journey  but he is too frivolous an animal to present to wise minos  i wish mercury were here he would damn him for his dulness  i have a good mind to carry him to the danaides and leave him to pour water into their vessels which like his late readers are destined to eternal emptiness  or shall i chain him to the rock side to side by prometheus not for having attempted to steal celestial fire in order to animate human forms but for having endeavoured to extinguish that which jupiter had imparted  or shall we constitute him friseur to tisiphone and make him curl up her locks with his satires and libels  plutarchminos does not esteem anything frivolous that affects the morals of mankind  he punishes authors as guilty of every fault they have countenanced and every crime they have encouraged and denounces heavy vengeance for the injuries which virtue or the virtuous have suffered in consequence of their writings    dialogue xxix   publius cornelius scipio africanuscaius julius caesar  scipioalas caesar how unhappily did you end a life made illustrious by the greatest exploits in war and most various civil talents  caesarcan scipio wonder at the ingratitude of rome to her generals did not he reproach her with it in the epitaph he ordered to be inscribed upon his tomb at liternum that mean village in campania to which she had driven the conqueror of hannibal and of carthage  i also after subduing her most dangerous enemies the helvetians the gauls and the germans after raising her name to the highest pitch of glory should have been deprived of my province reduced to live as a private man under the power of my enemies and the enviers of my greatness nay brought to a trial and condemned by the judgment of a faction if i had not led my victorious troops to rome and by their assistance after all my offers of peace had been iniquitously rejected made myself master of a state which knew so ill how to recompense superior merit  resentment of this together with the secret machinations of envy produced not long afterwards a conspiracy of senators and even of some whom i had most obliged and loved against my life which they basely took away by assassination  scipioyou say you led your victorious troops to rome  how were they your troops  i thought the roman armies had belonged to the republic not to their generals  caesarthey did so in your time  but before i came to command them marius and sylla had taught them that they belonged to their generals and i taught the senate that a veteran army affectionately attached to its leader could give him all the treasures and honours of the state without asking their leave  scipiojust gods did i then deliver my country from the invading carthaginian did i exalt it by my victories above all other nations that it might become a richer prey to its own rebel soldiers and their ambitious commanders  caesarhow could it be otherwise  was it possible that the conquerors of europe asia and africa could tamely submit to descend from their triumphal chariots and become subject to the authority of praetors and consuls elected by a populace corrupted by bribes or enslaved to a confederacy of factious nobles who without regard to merit considered all the offices and dignities of the state as hereditary possessions belonging to their families  scipioif i thought it no dishonour after triumphing over hannibal to lay down my fasces and obey as all my ancestors had done before me the magistrates of the republic such a conduct would not have dishonoured either marius or sylla or caesar  but you all dishonoured yourselves when instead of virtuous romans superior to your fellowcitizens in merit and glory but equal to them in a due subjection to the laws you became the enemies the invaders and the tyrants of your country  caesarwas i the enemy of my country in giving it a ruler fit to support all the majesty and weight of its empire  did i invade it when i marched to deliver the people from the usurped dominion and insolence of a few senators  was i a tyrant because i would not crouch under pompey and let him be thought my superior when i felt he was not my equal  scipiopompey had given you a noble example of moderation in twice dismissing the armies at the head of which he had performed such illustrious actions and returning a private citizen into the bosom of his country  caesarhis moderation was a cheat  he believed that the authority his victories had gained him would make him effectually master of the commonwealth without the help of those armies  but finding it difficult to subdue the united opposition of crassus and me he leagued himself with us and in consequence of that league we three governed the empire but after the death of crassus my glorious achievements in subduing the gauls raised such a jealousy in him that he could no longer endure me as a partner in his power nor could i submit to degrade myself into his subject  scipioam i then to understand that the civil war you engaged in was really a mere contest whether you or pompey should remain sole lord of rome  caesarnot so for i offered in my letters to the senate to lay down my arms if pompey at the same time would lay down his and leave the republic in freedom  nor did i resolve to draw the sword till not only the senate overpowered by the fear of pompey and his troops had rejected these offers but two tribunes of the people for legally and justly interposing their authority in my behalf had been forced to fly from rome disguised in the habit of slaves and take refuge in my camp for the safety of their persons  my camp was therefore the asylum of persecuted liberty and my army fought to avenge the violation of the rights and majesty of the people as much as to defend the dignity of their general unjustly oppressed  scipioyou would therefore have me think that you contended for the equality and liberty of the romans against the tyranny of pompey and his lawless adherents  in such a war i myself if i had lived in your times would have willingly been your lieutenant  tell me then on the issue of this honourable enterprise when you had subdued all your foes and had no opposition remaining to obstruct your intentions did you establish that liberty for which you fought  did you restore the republic to what it was in my time  caesari took the necessary measures to secure to myself the fruits of my victories and gave a head to the empire which could neither subsist without one nor find another so well suited to the greatness of the body  scipiothere the true character of caesar was seen unmasked  you had managed so skilfully in the measures which preceded the civil war your offers were so specious and there appeared so much violence in the conduct of your enemies that if you had fallen in that war posterity might have doubted whether you were not a victim to the interests of your country  but your success and the despotism you afterwards exorcised took off those disguises and showed clearly that the aim of all your actions was tyranny  caesarlet us not deceive ourselves with sounds and names  that great minds should aspire to sovereign power is a fixed law of nature  it is an injury to mankind if the highest abilities are not placed in the highest stations  had you scipio been kept down by the republican jealousy of cato the censor hannibal would have never been recalled out of italy nor defeated in africa  and if i had not been treacherously murdered by the daggers of brutus and cassius my sword would have avenged the defeat of crassus and added the empire of parthia to that of rome  nor was my government tyrannical  it was mild humane and bounteous  the world would have been happy under it and wished its continuance but my death broke the pillars of the public tranquillity and brought upon the whole empire a direful scene of calamity and confusion  scipioyou say that great minds will naturally aspire to sovereign power  but if they are good as well as great they will regulate their ambition by the laws of their country  the laws of rome permitted me to aspire to the conduct of the war against carthage but they did not permit you to turn her arms against herself and subject her to your will  the breach of one law of liberty is a greater evil to a nation than the loss of a province and in my opinion the conquest of the whole world would not be enough to compensate for the total loss of their freedom  caesaryou talk finely africanus but ask yourself whether the height and dignity of your mindthat noble pride which accompanies the magnanimity of a herocould always stoop to a nice conformity with the laws of your country  is there a law of liberty more essential more sacred than that which obliges every member of a free community to submit himself to a trial upon a legal charge brought against him for a public misdemeanour  in what manner did you answer a regular accusation from a tribune of the people who charged you with embezzling the money of the state  you told your judges that on that day you had vanquished hannibal and carthage and bade them follow you to the temples to give thanks to the gods  nor could you ever be brought to stand a legal trial or justify those accounts which you had torn in the senate when they were questioned there by two magistrates in the name of the roman people  was this acting like the subject of a free state  had your victory procured you an exemption from justice  had it given into your hands the money of the republic without account  if it had you were king of rome  pharsalia thapsus and munda could do no more for me  scipioi did not question the right of bringing me to a trial but i disdained to plead in vindication of a character so unspotted as mine  my whole life had been an answer to that infamous charge  caesarit may be so and for my part i admire the magnanimity of your behaviour  but i should condemn it as repugnant and destructive to liberty if i did not pay more respect to the dignity of a great general than to the forms of a democracy or the rights of a tribune  scipioyou are endeavouring to confound my cause with yours but they are exceedingly different  you apprehended a sentence of condemnation against you for some part of your conduct and to prevent it made an impious war on your country and reduced her to servitude  i trusted the justification of my affronted innocence to the opinion of my judges scorning to plead for myself against a charge unsupported by any other proof than bare suspicions and surmises  but i made no resistance i kindled no civil war i left rome undisturbed in the enjoyment of her liberty  had the malice of my accusers been ever so violent had it threatened my destruction i should have chosen much rather to turn my sword against my own bosom than against that of my country  caesaryou beg the question in supposing that i really hurt my country by giving her a master  when cato advised the senate to make pompey sole consul he did it upon this principle that any kind of government is preferable to anarchy  the truth of this i presume no man of sense will contest and the anarchy which that zealous defender of liberty so much apprehended would have continued in rome if that power which the urgent necessity of the state conferred upon me had not removed it  scipiopompey and you had brought that anarchy on the state in order to serve your own ends  it was owing to the corruption the factions and the violence which you had encouraged from an opinion that the senate would be forced to submit to an absolute power in your hands as a remedy against those intolerable evils  but cato judged well in thinking it eligible to make pompey sole consul rather than you dictator because experience had shown that pompey respected the forms of the roman constitution and though he sought by bad means as well as good to obtain the highest magistracies and the most honourable commands yet he laid them down again and contented himself with remaining superior in credit to any other citizen  caesarif all the difference between my ambition and pompeys was only as you represent it in a greater or less respect for the forms of the constitution i think it was hardly becoming such a patriot as cato to take part in our quarrel much less to kill himself rather than yield to my power  scipioit is easier to revive the spirit of liberty in a government where the forms of it remain unchanged than where they have been totally disregarded and abolished  but i readily own that the balance of the roman constitution had been destroyed by the excessive and illegal authority which the people were induced to confer upon pompey before any extraordinary honours or commands had been demanded by you  and that is i think your best excuse  caesaryes surely  the favourers of the manilian law had an ill grace in desiring to limit the commissions i obtained from the people according to the rigour of certain absolute republican laws no more regarded in my time than the sybilline oracles or the pious institutions of numa  scipioit was the misfortune of your time that they were not regarded  a virtuous man would not take from a deluded people such favours as they ought not to bestow  i have a right to say this because i chid the roman people when overheated by gratitude for the services i had done them they desired to make me perpetual consul and dictator hear this and blush  what i refused to accept you snatched by force  caesartiberius gracchus reproached you with the inconsistency of your conduct when after refusing these offers you so little respected the tribunitian authority  but thus it must happen  we are naturally fond of the idea of liberty till we come to suffer by it or find it an impediment to some predominant passion and then we wish to control it as you did most despotically by refusing to submit to the justice of the state  scipioi have answered before to that charge  tiberius gracchus himself though my personal enemy thought it became him to stop the proceedings against me not for my sake but for the honour of my country whose dignity suffered with mine  nevertheless i acknowledge my conduct in that business was not absolutely blameless  the generous pride of virtue was too strong in my mind  it made me forget i was creating a dangerous precedent in declining to plead to a legal accusation brought against me by a magistrate invested with the majesty of the whole roman people  it made me unjustly accuse my country of ingratitude when she had shown herself grateful even beyond the true bounds of policy and justice by not inflicting upon me any penalty for so irregular a proceeding  but at the same time what a proof did i give of moderation and respect for her liberty when my utmost resentment could impel me to nothing more violent than a voluntary retreat and quiet banishment of myself from the city of rome  scipio africanus offended and living a private man in a countryhouse at liternum was an example of more use to secure the equality of the roman commonwealth than all the power of its tribunes  caesari had rather have been thrown down the tarpeian rock than have retired as you did to the obscurity of a village after acting the first part on the greatest theatre of the world  scipioa usurper exalted on the highest throne of the universe is not so glorious as i was in that obscure retirement  i hear indeed that you caesar have been deified by the flattery of some of your successors  but the impartial judgment of history has consecrated my name and ranks me in the first class of heroes and patriots whereas the highest praise her records even under the dominion usurped by your family have given to you is that your courage and talents were equal to the object your ambition aspired to the empire of the world and that you exercised a sovereignty unjustly acquired with a magnanimous clemency  but it would have been better for your country and better for mankind if you had never existed    dialogue xxx   platodiogenes  diogenesplato stand off  a true philosopher as i was is no company for a courtier of the tyrant of syracuse  i would avoid you as one infected with the most noisome of plaguesthe plague of slavery  platohe who can mistake a brutal pride and savage indecency of manners for freedom may naturally think that the being in a court however virtuous ones conduct however free ones language there is slavery  but i was taught by my great master the incomparable socrates that the business of true philosophy is to consult and promote the happiness of society  she must not therefore be confined to a tub or a cell  her sphere is in senates or the cabinets of kings  while your sect is employed in snarling at the great or buffooning with the vulgar she is counselling those who govern nations infusing into their minds humanity justice temperance and the love of true glory resisting their passions when they transport them beyond the bounds of virtue and fortifying their reason by the antidotes she administers against the poison of flattery  diogenesyou mean to have me understand that you went to the court of the younger dionysius to give him antidotes against the poison of flattery  but i say he sent for you only to sweeten the cup by mixing it more agreeably and rendering the flavour more delicate  his vanity was too nice for the nauseous common draught but your seasoning gave it a relish which made it go down most delightfully and intoxicated him more than ever  oh there is no flatterer half so dangerous to a prince as a fawning philosopher  platoif you call it fawning that i did not treat him with such unmannerly rudeness as you did alexander the great when he visited you at athens i have nothing to say  but in truth i made my company agreeable to him not for any mean ends which regarded only myself but that i might be useful both to him and to his people  i endeavoured to give a right turn to his vanity and know diogenes that whosoever will serve mankind but more especially princes must compound with their weaknesses and take as much pains to gain them over to virtue by an honest and prudent complaisance as others do to seduce them from it by a criminal adulation  diogenesa little of my sagacity would have shown you that if this was your purpose your labour was lost in that court  why did not you go and preach chastity to lais  a philosopher in a brothel reading lectures on the beauty of continence and decency is not a more ridiculous animal than a philosopher in the cabinet or at the table of a tyrant descanting on liberty and public spirit  what effect had the lessons of your famous disciple aristotle upon alexander the great a prince far more capable of receiving instruction than the younger dionysius  did they hinder him from killing his best friend clitus for speaking to him with freedom or from fancying himself a god because he was adored by the wretched slaves he had vanquished  when i desired him not to stand between me and the sun i humbled his pride more and consequently did him more good than aristotle had done by all his formal precepts  platoyet he owed to those precepts that notwithstanding his excesses he appeared not unworthy of the empire of the world  had the tutor of his youth gone with him into asia and continued always at his ear the authority of that wise and virtuous man might have been able to stop him even in the riot of conquest from giving way to those passions which dishonoured his character  diogenesif he had gone into asia and had not flattered the king as obsequiously as haephestion he would like callisthenes whom he sent thither as his deputy have been put to death for high treason  the man who will not flatter must live independent as i did and prefer a tub to a palace  platodo you pretend diogenes that because you were never in a court you never flattered  how did you gain the affection of the people of athens but by soothing their ruling passionthe desire of hearing their superiors abused  your cynic railing was to them the most acceptable flattery  this you well understood and made your court to the vulgar always envious and malignant by trying to lower all dignity and confound all order  you made your court i say as servilely and with as much offence to virtue as the basest flatterer ever did to the most corrupted prince  but true philosophy will disdain to act either of these parts  neither in the assemblies of the people nor in the cabinets of kings will she obtain favour by fomenting any bad dispositions  if her endeavours to do good prove unsuccessful she will retire with honour as an honest physician departs from the house of a patient whose distemper he finds incurable or who refuses to take the remedies he prescribes  but if she succeedsif like the music of orpheus her sweet persuasions can mitigate the ferocity of the multitude and tame their minds to a due obedience of laws and reverence of magistrates or if she can form a timoleon or a numa pompilius to the government of a statehow meritorious is the work  one kingnay one minister or counsellor of stateimbued with her precepts is of more value than all the speculative retired philosophers or cynical revilers of princes and magistrates that ever lived upon earth  diogenesdont tell me of the music of orpheus and of his taming wild beasts  a wild beast brought to crouch and lick the hand of a master is a much viler animal than he was in his natural state of ferocity  you seem to think that the business of philosophy is to polish men into slaves but i say it is to teach them to assert with an untamed and generous spirit their independence and freedom  you profess to instruct those who want to ride their fellowcreatures how to do it with an easy and gentle rein but i would have them thrown off and trampled under the feet of all their deluded or insulted equals on whose backs they have mounted  which of us two is the truest friend to mankind  platoaccording to your notions all government is destructive to liberty but i think that no liberty can subsist without government  a state of society is the natural state of mankind  they are impelled to it by their wants their infirmities their affections  the laws of society are rules of life and action necessary to secure their happiness in that state  government is the due enforcing of those laws  that government is the best which does this post effectually and most equally and that people is the freest which is most submissively obedient to such a government  diogenesshow me the government which makes no other use of its power than duly to enforce the laws of society and i will own it is entitled to the most absolute submission from all its subjects  platoi cannot show you perfection in human institutions  it is far more easy to blame them than it is to amend them much may be wrong in the best but a good man respects the laws and the magistrates of his country  diogenesas for the laws of my country i did so far respect them as not to philosophise to the prejudice of the first and greatest principle of nature and of wisdom selfpreservation  though i loved to prate about high matters as well as socrates i did not choose to drink hemlock after his example  but you might as well have bid me love an ugly woman because she was dressed up in the gown of lais as respect a fool or a knave because he was attired in the robe of a magistrate  platoall i desired of you was not to amuse yourself and the populace by throwing dirt upon the robe of a magistrate merely because he wore that robe and you did not  diogenesa philosopher cannot better display his wisdom than by throwing contempt on that pageantry which the ignorant multitude gaze at with a senseless veneration  platohe who tries to make the multitude venerate nothing is more senseless than they  wise men have endeavoured to excite an awful reverence in the minds of the vulgar for external ceremonies and forms in order to secure their obedience to religion and government of which these are the symbols  can a philosopher desire to defeat that good purpose  diogenesyes if he sees it abused to support the evil purposes of superstition and tyranny  platomay not the abuse be corrected without losing the benefit  is there no difference between reformation and destruction  diogeneshalfmeasures do nothing  he who desires to reform must not be afraid to pull down  platoi know that you and your sect are for pulling down everything that is above your own level  pride and envy are the motives that set you all to work  nor can one wonder that passions the influence of which is so general should give you many disciples and many admirers  diogeneswhen you have established your republic if you will admit me into it i promise you to be there a most respectful subject  platoi am conscious diogenes that my republic was imaginary and could never be established  but they show as little knowledge of what is practicable in politics as i did in that book who suppose that the liberty of any civil society can be maintained by the destruction of order and decency or promoted by the petulance of unbridled defamation  diogenesi never knew any government angry at defamation when it fell on those who disliked or obstructed its measures  but i well remember that the thirty tyrants at athens called opposition to them the destruction of order and decency  platothings are not altered by names  diogenesno but names have a strange power to impose on weak understandings  if when you were in egypt you had laughed at the worship of an onion the priests would have called you an atheist and the people would have stoned you  but i presume that to have the honour of being initiated into the mysteries of that reverend hierarchy you bowed as low to it as any of their devout disciples  unfortunately my neck was not so pliant and therefore i was never initiated into the mysteries either of religion or government but was feared or hated by all who thought it their interest to make them be respected  platoyour vanity found its account in that fear and that hatred  the high priest of a deity or the ruler of a state is much less distinguished from the vulgar herd of mankind than the scoffer at all religion and the despiser of all dominion  but let us end our dispute  i feel my folly in continuing to argue with one who in reasoning does not seek to come at truth but merely to show his wit  adieu diogenes i am going to converse with the shades of pythagoras solon and bias  you may jest with aristophanes or rail with thersites    dialogue xxxi   aristidesphociondemosthenes  aristideshow could it happen that athens after having recovered an equality with sparta should be forced to submit to the dominion of macedon when she had two such great men as phocion and demosthenes at the head of her state  phocionit happened because our opinions of her interests in foreign affairs were totally different which made us act with a constant and pernicious opposition the one to the other  aristidesi wish to hear from you both if you will indulge my curiosity on what principles you could form such contrary judgments concerning points of such moment to the safety of your country which you equally loved  demosthenesmy principles were the same with yours aristides  i laboured to maintain the independence of athens against the encroaching ambition of macedon as you had maintained it against that of persia  i saw that our own strength was unequal to the enterprise but what we could not do alone i thought might be done by a union of the principal states of greecesuch a union as had been formed by you and themistocles in opposition to the persians  to effect this was the great the constant aim of my policy and though traversed in it by many whom the gold of macedon had corrupted and by phocion whom alone of all the enemies to my system i must acquit of corruption i so far succeeded that i brought into the field of chaeronea an army equal to philips  the event was unfortunate but aristides will not judge of the merits of a statesman by the accidents of war  phociondo not imagine aristides that i was less desirous than demosthenes to preserve the independence and liberty of my country  but before i engaged the athenians in a war not absolutely necessary i thought it proper to consider what the event of a battle would probably be  that which i feared came to pass the macedonians were victorious and athens was ruined  demostheneswould athens not have been ruined if no battle had been fought  could you phocion think it safety to have our freedom depend on the moderation of philip  and what had we else to protect us if no confederacy had been formed to resist his ambition  phocioni saw no wisdom in accelerating the downfall of my country by a rash activity in provoking the resentment of an enemy whose arms i foretold would in the issue prove superior not only to ours but to those of any confederacy we were able to form  my maxim was that a state which cannot make itself stronger than any of its neighbours should live in friendship with that power which is the strongest  but the more apparent it was that our strength was inferior to that of macedon the more you laboured to induce us by all the vehemence of your oratory to take such measures as tended to render philip our enemy and exasperate him more against us than any other nation  this i thought a rash conduct  it was not by orations that the dangerous war you had kindled could finally be determined nor did your triumphs over me in an assembly of the people intimidate any macedonian in the field of chaeronea or stop you yourself from flying out of that field  demosthenesmy flight from thence i must own was ignominious to me but it affects not the question we are agitating now whether the counsels i gave to the people of athens as a statesman and a public minister were right or wrong  when first i excited them to make war against philip the victories gained by chabrias in which you phocion had a share particularly that of naxos which completely restored to us the empire of the sea had enabled us to maintain not only our own liberty but that of all greece in the defence of which we had formerly acquired so much glory and which our ancestors thought so important to the safety and independence of athens  philips power was but beginning and supported itself more by craft than force  i saw and i warned my countrymen in due time how impolitic it would be to suffer his machinations to be carried on with success and his strength to increase by continual acquisitions without resistance  i exposed the weakness of that narrow that shortsighted policy which looked no farther than to our own immediate borders and imagined that whatsoever lay out of those bounds was foreign to our interests and unworthy of our care  the force of my remonstrances roused the athenians to a more vigilant conduct  then it was that the orators whom philip had corrupted loudly inveighed against me as alarming the people with imaginary dangers and drawing them into quarrels in which they had really no concern  this language and the fair professions of philip who was perfectly skilled in the royal art of dissembling were often so prevalent that many favourable opportunities of defeating his designs were unhappily lost  yet sometimes by the spirit with which i animated the athenians and other neighbouring states i stopped the progress of his arms and opposed to him such obstacles as cost him much time and much labour to remove  you yourself phocion at the head of fleets and armies sent against him by decrees which i had proposed vanquished his troops in eubaea and saved from him byzantium with other cities of our allies on the coasts of the hellespont from which you drove him with shame  phocionthe proper use of those advantages was to secure a peace to athens which they inclined him to keep  his ambition was checked but his forces were not so much diminished as to render it safe to provoke him to further hostilities  demostheneshis courage and policy were indeed so superior to ours that notwithstanding his defeats he was soon in a condition to pursue the great plan of conquest and dominion which he had formed long before and from which he never desisted  thus through indolence on our side and activity on his things were brought to such a crisis that i saw no hope of delivering all greece from his yoke but by confederating against him the athenians and the thebans which league i effected  was it not better to fight for the independence of our country in conjunction with thebes than alone  would a battle lost in boeotia be so fatal to athens as one lost in our own territory and under our own walls  phocionyou may remember that when you were eagerly urging this argument i desired you to consider not where we should fight but how we should be conquerors for if we were vanquished all sorts of evils and dangers would be instantly at our gates  aristidesdid not you tell me demosthenes when you began to speak upon this subject that you brought into the field of chaeronea an army equal to philips  demosthenesi did and believe that phocion will not contradict me  aristidesbut though equal in number it was perhaps much inferior to the macedonians in valour and military discipline  demosthenesthe courage shown by our army excited the admiration of philip himself and their discipline was inferior to none in greece  aristideswhat then occasioned their defeat  demosthenesthe bad conduct of their generals  aristideswhy was the command not given to phocion whose abilities had been proved on so many other occasions  was it offered to him and did he refuse to accept it  you are silent demosthenes  i understand your silence  you are unwilling to tell me that having the power by your influence over the people to confer the command on what athenian you pleased you were induced by the spirit of party to lay aside a great general who had been always successful who had the chief confidence of your troops and of your allies in order to give it to men zealous indeed for your measures and full of military ardour but of little capacity or experience in the conduct of a war  you cannot plead that if phocion had led your troops against philip there was any danger of his basely betraying his trust  phocion could not be a traitor  you had seen him serve the republic and conquer for it in wars the undertaking of which he had strenuously opposed in wars with philip  how could you then be so negligent of the safety of your country as not to employ him in this the most dangerous of all she ever had waged  if chares and lysicles the two generals you chose to conduct it had commanded the grecian forces at marathon and plataea we should have lost those battles  all the men whom you sent to fight the macedonians under such leaders were victims to the animosity between you and phocion which made you deprive them of the necessary benefit of his wise direction this i think the worst blemish of your administration  in other parts of your conduct i not only acquit but greatly applaud and admire you  with the sagacity of a most consummate statesman you penetrated the deepest designs of philip you saw all the dangers which threatened greece from that quarter while they were yet at a distance you exhorted your countrymen to make a timely provision for their future security you spread the alarm through all the neighbouring states you combined the most powerful in a confederacy with athens you carried the war out of attica which let phocion say what he will was safer than meeting it there you brought it after all that had been done by the enemy to strengthen himself and weaken us after the loss of amphipolis olynthus and potidaea the outguards of athens you brought it i say to the decision of a battle with equal forces  when this could be effected there was evidently nothing so desperate in our circumstances as to justify an inaction which might probably make them worse but could not make them better  phocion thinks that a state which cannot itself be the strongest should live in friendship with that power which is the strongest  but in my opinion such friendship is no better than servitude  it is more advisable to endeavour to supply what is wanting in our own strength by a conjunction with others who are equally in danger  this method of preventing the ruin of our country was tried by demosthenes  nor yet did he neglect by all practicable means to augment at the same time our internal resources  i have heard that when he found the public treasure exhausted he replenished it with very great peril to himself by bringing into it money appropriated before to the entertainment of the people against the express prohibition of a popular law which made it death to propose the application thereof to any other use  this was virtue this was true and genuine patriotism  he owed all his importance and power in the state to the favour of the people yet in order to serve the state he did not fear at the evident hazard of his life to offend their darling passion and appeal against it to their reason  phocionfor this action i praise him  it was indeed far more dangerous for a minister at athens to violate that absurd and extravagant law than any of those of solon  but though he restored our finances he could not restore our lost virtue he could not give that firm health that vigour to the state which is the result of pure morals of strict order and civil discipline of integrity in the old and obedience in the young  i therefore dreaded a conflict with the solid strength of macedon where corruption had yet made but a very small progress and was happy that demosthenes did not oblige me against my own inclination to be the general of such a people in such war  aristidesi fear that your just contempt of the greater number of those who composed the democracy so disgusted you with this mode and form of government that you were as averse to serve under it as others with less ability and virtue than you were desirous of obtruding themselves into its service  but though such a reluctance proceeds from a very noble cause and seems agreeable to the dignity of a great mind in bad times yet it is a fault against the highest of moral obligationsthe love of our country  for how unworthy soever individuals may be the public is always respectable always dear to the virtuous  phociontrue but no obligation can lie upon a citizen to seek a public charge when he foresees that his obtaining of it will be useless to his country  would you have had me solicit the command of an army which i believed would be beaten  aristidesit is not permitted to a state to despair of its safety till its utmost efforts have been made without success  if you had commanded the army at chaeronea you might possibly have changed the event of the day but if you had not you would have died more honourably there than in a prison at athens betrayed by a vain confidence in the insecure friendship of a perfidious macedonian    dialogue xxxii   marcus aurelius philosophusservius tullius  servius tulliusyes marcus though i own you to have been the first of mankind in virtue and goodnessthough while you governed philosophy sat on the throne and diffused the benign influences of her administration over the whole roman empireyet as a king i might perhaps pretend to a merit even superior to yours  marcus aureliusthat philosophy you ascribe to me has taught me to feel my own defects and to venerate the virtues of other men  tell me therefore in what consisted the superiority of your merit as a king  servius tulliusit consisted in thisthat i gave my people freedom i diminished i limited the kingly power when it was placed in my hands i need not tell you that the plan of government instituted by me was adopted by the romans when they had driven out tarquin the destroyer of their liberty and gave its form to that republic composed of a due mixture of the regal aristocratical and democratical powers the strength and wisdom of which subdued the world  thus all the glory of that great people who for many ages excelled the rest of mankind in the arts of war and of policy belongs originally to me  marcus aureliusthere is much truth in what you say  but would not the romans have done better if after the expulsion of tarquin they had vested the regal power in a limited monarch instead of placing it in two annual elective magistrates with the title of consuls  this was a great deviation from your plan of government and i think an unwise one  for a divided royalty is a solecisman absurdity in politics  nor was the regal power committed to the administration of consuls continued in their hands long enough to enable them to finish any difficult war or other act of great moment  from hence arose a necessity of prolonging their commands beyond the legal term of shortening the interval prescribed by the laws between the elections to those offices and of granting extraordinary commissions and powers by all which the republic was in the end destroyed  servius tulliusthe revolution which ensued upon the death of lucretia was made with so much anger that it is no wonder the romans abolished in their fury the name of king and desired to weaken a power the exercise of which had been so grievous though the doing this was attended with all the inconveniences you have justly observed  but if anger acted too violently in reforming abuses philosophy might have wisely corrected that error  marcus aurelius might have newmodelled the constitution of rome  he might have made it a limited monarchy leaving to the emperors all the power that was necessary to govern a wideextended empire and to the senate and people all the liberty that could be consistent with order and obedience to governmenta liberty purged of faction and guarded against anarchy  marcus aureliusi should have been happy indeed if it had been in my power to do such good to my country  but the gods themselves cannot force their blessings on men who by their vices are become incapable to receive them  liberty like power is only good for those who possess it when it is under the constant direction of virtue  no laws can have force enough to hinder it from degenerating into faction and anarchy where the morals of a nation are depraved and continued habits of vice will eradicate the very love of it out of the hearts of a people  a marcus brutus in my time could not have drawn to his standard a single legion of romans  but further it is certain that the spirit of liberty is absolutely incompatible with the spirit of conquest  to keep great conquered nations in subjection and obedience great standing armies are necessary  the generals of those armies will not long remain subjects and whoever acquires dominion by the sword must rule by the sword  if he does not destroy liberty liberty will destroy him  servius tulliusdo you then justify augustus for the change he made in the roman government  marcus aureliusi do not for augustus had no lawful authority to make that change  his power was usurpation and breach of trust  but the government which he seized with a violent hand came to me by a lawful and established rule of succession  servius tulliuscan any length of establishment make despotism lawful  is not liberty an inherent inalienable right of mankind  marcus aureliusthey have an inherent right to be governed by laws not by arbitrary will  but forms of government may and must be occasionally changed with the consent of the people  when i reigned over them the romans were governed by laws  servius tulliusyes because your moderation and the precepts of that philosophy in which your youth had been tutored inclined you to make the laws the rules of your government and the bounds of your power  but if you had desired to govern otherwise had they power to restrain you  marcus aureliusthey had not  the imperial authority in my time had no limitations  servius tulliusrome therefore was in reality as much enslaved under you as under your son and you left him the power of tyrannising over it by hereditary right  marcus aureliusi did and the conclusion of that tyranny was his murder  servius tulliusunhappy father unhappy king what a detestable
