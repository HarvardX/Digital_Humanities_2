the poetical works of david garrick esquire  vol i  the poetical works of david garrick esquire  now first collected into two volumes with explanatory notes  vol i  printers device for george kearsley  london printed for george kearsley at johnsons head fleet street mdcclxxxv  to richard brinsley sheridan esquire whose dramatick performances have been the chief supports of the english stage since the death of mr garrick  this collection of the poetical works of his celebrated predecessor is inscribed  by his most obedient and most humble servant george kearsley fleet street april         preface the publisher of the present volumes has long observed with surprise the total neglect shown to the works of mr garrick though six years are now elapsed since his death no one step has been taken toward giving an edition of them neither gratitude friendship affection nor interest have in the slightest manner interposed his pieces have been suffered to remain in the same state in which the author left them a prey to time subject to every accident and as it should seem doomed in a few years to be buried in oblivion  the author careless and indifferent about his smaller productions dispersed them in such a variety of publications that had he been now living he would probably have found some difficulty in assembling them together or even without assistance to recollect them this difficulty is increasing every day by the death of friends by the forgetfulness of contemporaries and by the loss of fugitive pieces a complete collection of them already a task not easy to be accomplished will in a few years become impossible  it is a consideration which may not be thought very honorable to human nature that a man who contributed as much as any one of his time to the innocent amusement of life whose performances on the stage must be always remembered with delight by those who had the happiness of seeing them who had both the inclination and ability to confer favors who let behind him many living memorials of his friendship and generosity and whose death as has been truly said eclipsed the gaiety of nations and impoverished the public stock of innocent pleasure dr johnsons life of edmund smith should hitherto have found no person attentive to the calls of respect no one alive to the remonstrances of gratitude to erect a monument to his fame by collecting and publishing his fugitive performances  abandoned and neglected as these have been both by their author and his representatives the publisher has been prevailed upon to solicit the assistance of many of mr garricks friends and by their aid he has been enabled to present to the public a collection which has been long enquired after and which from the care with which it has been formed he trusts will not disgrace the memory of the author should the sources from whence the several pieces have been drawn be enumerated he is certain that he should be allowed some merit from his industry as almost every performance has been selected from a different publication most of them very difficult to be procured and some from their scarcity equal in value to manuscripts  it would be impertinent to take up the readers time in recommending what has been so long and so universally approved mr garricks writings do not want any such assistance their merit has been already fully acknowledged and require only to be more diffused to be more applauded they are here classed in some measure according to their subjects and for the most part in chronological order by this means the prologues and epilogues which generally turn on the fashions or incidents of the day will serve to illustrate and keep in memory the foibles virtues vices and habits of the times and exhibit no unfaithful picture of the good sense or folly which has prevailed heretofore compared with the present or any future period  to render the present edition as complete as possible the publisher has added a short account of mr garricks life and writings together with two lists one of his dramatick works and the other of the characters he performed both these he is informed are compiled with accuracy and will be allowed to have their use to them he has subjoined mr sheridans elegant monody a composition which is entitled to equal praise in the closet that it was honored with on the theater to conclude he feels some satisfaction in reflecting that through his endeavors the works and literary fame of mr garrick will be redeemed from that fate into which a few years more would have involved so excellent a writer and so valuable a man  a short account of the life and writings of david garrick esquire a short account etc david garrick was born at hereford about the month of february      his grandfather was a merchant of french extraction as it is said who left his native country on the revocation of the edict of nantz in the year      this gentleman had two sons and two daughters one of the former became a winemerchant at lisbon and the other whose name was peter the father of the late mr garrick followed the military profession and had at the time of his death been advanced to a majority in the army he married a daughter of mr clough one of the vicars in litchfield cathedral and happened to be quartered at the angelinn in hereford where his son david who was baptized the following is an extract from the register book of the parish of all saints in the city of hereford david garrick the son of peter and arabella garrick was baptized the   th of february       it is remarkable that the late mr powell was also born in the city of hereford   the   th of february      was born mr garrick the father afterward settled at litchfield and resided there several years a short time before his death he determined to sell his commission and for that purpose entered into a treaty with a gentleman who had agreed to give him   00l for it but unfortunately before the sale was completed he died and left a numerous family in a great measure unprovided for  his son david received the first part of his education at the free school of litchfield under mr hunter who had the honor of numbering amongst his scholars doctor johnson chief justice wills doctor newton bishop of bristol and other men of eminence very early in life our roscius found a friend in gilbert walmsley esquire register of the ecclesiastical court there a gentleman then unmarried and well advanced in years whose partiality seemed to authorize some favorable expectations of a permanent provision all which were destroyed by mr walmsleys unexpectedly taking a wife he however recommended his young friend to mr colson master of the academy at rochester in order to complete his education and accordingly in the month of march      mr garrick left litchfield in company with doctor samuel johnson a character of mr walmsley who died august        aged    is given by doctor johnson n his elegant life of edmund smith which accompanies the works of the english poets the following epitaph was written on him by mr seward reader if science honor reason charm if social charities thy bosom warm if smiling bounty open thy heart and door if justice style thee  guardian of the poor firm to britannias prince and church and laws if freedom fire thee in thy countrys cause with sympathetic love these relics see but think not walmsley dead  he lives in thee but if regardless of strong reasons voice in wine and noise and faction thou rejoice if thou thy faith and liberties betray and barter laws for arbitrary sway if briton born thy souls a gallick slave start from his tomb he would  and call thee  fool and knave   mr walmsley translated into latin  doctor byroms celebrated song beginning my time oye muses etc it is in the gentlemans magazine february         who at the same time quitted his profession of a schoolmaster and came to london where he afterward became one of the first ornaments of literature  at the age of about eleven years mr garrick went over to lisbon and was received by his uncle with great kindness but that strictness of morals which a fond relation wished to see in his nephew not being observed at that place to prevent his being corrupted it was thought proper to send him back to england his uncle still preserving a great regard for him which he showed at his death by leaving him a legacy of  000l  it appears from mr walmsleys letters that mr garrick was intended for the profession of the law and accordingly on the  th day of march      playhouse dictionary  immediately on his arrival in london he was entered of the society of lincolns end but it is certain he never paid any attention to the study of that science and indeed it is within the memory of many yet living that his employment for a short time in the interval between his leaving school and his appearance on the stage was of a nature very different from what he was first destined to and what he afterward pursued with so much reputation and success we are credibly informed that he followed the business of a winemerchant somewhere in or near durhamyard being induced thereto it may be presumed by the encouragement and support of his uncle  to whatever cause it was owing we are not informed but his success in business was not sufficient to engage his continuance in it and this want of success might perhaps arise from his attention to a more pleasing pursuit he had at school performed the part of sergeant kite with applause and he was now prompted to employ the talents which he possessed for his immediate support chetwood mentions that his facetious good humor gained him entrance behind the scenes two or three years in drury lane before he commenced actor and it is certain that he produced there his first drama called lethe in april    0 for mr giffards benefit determining to try his fortune on the stage he went down to ipswich under the name of lyddel and performed in a strolling company there the part in which he first appeared was that of aboan from the information of a contemporary comedian in oroonoko and the approbation he met with in this country excursion encouraged him to pursue his plan in london he therefore after being as it is reported rejected by the manager of covent garden to whom he had offered his service engaged with mr giffard at the theater in goodmans fields in the year      the character he then attempted was that of richard the third and he performed it october   th      in a manner which fixed his reputation on that basis upon which it stood as the first actor of the times during the rest of his life two circumstances were observed on his first nights performance one that on his entrance on the stage he was under so much embarrassment that for some time he was unable to speak the other that having exerted himself with much vehemence in the first two acts he became so hoarse as to be almost incapable of finishing the character this difficulty was obviated by a person behind the scenes recommending him to take the juice of a seville orange which he fortunately had in his pocket and which enabled him to go through the remainder of the character with that degree of excellence which he always afterward showed in the performance of it and which produced the applause which ever after uniformly attended him in it the person to whom he owed this seasonable relief was the late mr dryden leach printer who used often to tell the story to his friends  it was during this first year of his theatrical life that he produced the farce of the lying valet a performance which has given pleasure to numberless spectators even after the principal character ceased to be performed by its author at the end of the season he went over to ireland and in that kingdom added both to his fortune and his fame the next year      to      he performed at drury lane and the year after      to      at the same theater at the beginning of this season he was involved in a dispute with mr macklin who had joined with him in opposing the oppressions of the managers that gentleman complained that he was deserted in the agreement made with the managers and published a state of his case in a pamphlet entitled mr macklins reply to mr garricks answer to which are prefixed all the papers which have publicly appeared in regard to this important dispute the next year      to      he continued at drury lane but the succeeding season      to      he went again to dublin and engaged with mr sheridan as joint sharer and adventurer in the theater there in may      he returned to london and performed in six plays at the end of that month at covent garden by which we are told he added  00l to a great sum acquired in ireland victors history of the theaters vol i p     he performed but one year more as an hired actor      to      which was at covent garden theater where he produced miss in her teens  the mismanagement of the patentees of drury lane theater after the deaths of booth and wilks and the retirement of cibber from the stage had ruined every person concerned in it at this period the successors of mr fleetwood charles fleetwood esquire the history of this gentleman is very remarkable it affords so striking a moral and at the same time so important a lesson that though not strictly connected with the life of mr garrick we hope to be pardoned for inserting the following particulars concerning him at the age of twentyone he came to a landed estate of six thousand pounds a year he was says mr victor history of the theaters vol i p    agreeable in his person and the qualities of his mind and amiableness of his disposition carried with them irresistible attractions all the nobility of the kingdom seemed fond of cultivating an acquaintance with a young man of his extensive fortune right disposition and sweetness of temper he was affable and engaging in his address which was the last and only remaining quality that he kept with him to his death and no doubt that would have vanished with the rest if he had not found it of constant use to him in his business with the world as that address enabled him to deceive even persons that thought themselves armed against him he purchased the patent of drury lane theater in the year      and continued in the management of it until      when he left the kingdom and some time after died a bankrupt both in fortune and reputation mr victor says he was a ruined man before he engaged in theatrical concerns and that for some years he profited by his purchase it was his misfortune early in life to be thwarted in a design which he entertained of uniting himself to a young lady of inferior fortune the disappointment of which threw him into that habit of dissipation which rendered him an easy prey to a set of sharpers who first deprived him of his fortune and afterward of his integrity the present duke of norfolk in his thoughts essays and maxims published in   mo      p    relates the following fact which happened in the presence of his wife at either bruges or ghent before he was married or at all acquainted with her viz mrs fleetwood daughter to lord gerrard and mother to mr fleetwood who was master manager of drury lane playhouse a gentleman of a very ancient good family unhappily known came upon a visit and flung herself upon her knees to ask pardon of a baronets daughter who was then companion to mrs howard as the only atonement left in her power for having prevented her only son from marrying her to whom there could be no objection but that her fortune was not as great as another ladys she had in view for him by which means she was the occasion indirectly of the unhappiness of the young lady by unhinging her mind and souring her temper and of her only sons rum both in fortune and reputation by flinging him into a round of dissipation and pleasure in order to eradicate his strongest affections this kind of life had such an effect on him that he contracted that baneful habit of gaming so that in the course of a few years he ruined his fortune a very noble one as most gamesters do first by setting out a dupe and afterward turning sharper at length he died unpitied and it is said of a broken heart being a little before reduced to a wretched annuity in some part of france he left several children two of them appeared on the stage as actors and one is but lately dead this gentleman was two seasons      and      at drury lane theater and received a considerable share of applause he however afterward declined the pursuit and went to the east indies where he acquired a genteel fortune the other son died at edinburgh a few years since became involved in so many difficulties that it was no longer possible for them to continue the conduct of a business to which they were strangers and which they were never likely to succeed in in      that gentleman had left the theater to his creditors to manage after making the best terms he was able for himself they conducted the business of it for two seasons when unable to continue the management any longer the property of the patent house and scenes was offered to several persons but so apprehensive was every on become of the hazard of intermeddling with the theater that no purchaser was for some time to be found at this juncture the late mr lacy stepped forward and boldly ventured to engage for the purchase having the reputation of a man of integrity he soon found friends among the monied men to support him in his undertaking the success of it he prudently concluded must depend in some measure on the abilities of the person with whom he should connect himself in the scheme mr garricks reputation both as a man and an actor naturally led him to wish for his junction a treaty was soon begun and an agreement between them afterward took place application was made for a new patent which was obtained and both their names inserted in it victors history of the theaters vol i p     the season which began in      was the first of their management and was opened with an admirable prologue written by doctor johnson and spoken by mr garrick see doctor johnsons poems published by kearsley  from this time drury lane theater which had been so fatal to many adventurers became the source of wealth and independence to both partners who jointly exerted their several abilities in the management of the undertaking with a degree of harmony which did credit to their understandings and with a share of success which in some measure must be ascribed to that good correspondence which subsisted between them mr laceys memory as an honest and worthy man to whose assiduity and attention we are partly indebted for the present regularity of the theater deserves a few words he was originally a manufacturer at norwich but unsuccessful in his connexions with trade he afterward came on the stage and performed at the haymarket in pasquin and other pieces which were brought out at that theater when under the direction of the late henry fielding esquire he then read lectures in york buildings and engaged in the scheme of building ranelagh which the knavery of the person with whom he associated rendered unsuccessful the confidence which was reposed in his integrity enabled him without money to become the purchaser of drury lane theater at the juncture abovementioned and his prudence was the means of his amassing a considerable fortune which however would have been much larger had not an unhappy propensity to scheming taken possession of him and induced him to launch into undertakings by which he was a great loser we are informed his property was much lessened by searching for coalmines in oxfordshire he was however still rich and at his death january      left a very handsome estate to an only son whom he had by mrs willoughby an actress of drury lane theater this gentleman has since sold his share in the theater   after he had been a manager two years and the dissipation of youth had subsided the charms of a lady who then lived with the countess of barlington as a companion made a conquest of him it is unnecessary to add that this lady is at present his widow she is we are informed by birth a german her parents lived at vienna and she appeared on the stage there as a dancer in the year      she came to england and performed one season at drury lane theater she was then called madame eva maria violetti the union between them took place on the   d day of june      and we may add that no marriage ever was attended with more happiness to both parties than this for near thirty years during which time it is on good authority asserted they scarce passed a day separate from each other  the theatrical season which commenced in the year    0 was rendered remarkable by the spirit of rivalship which prevailed at both houses at the beginning of mr garricks management he had engaged barry macklin pritchard woffington cibber and clive and with these excellent performers it may be imagined the profits of the house were very considerable soon after mr barry who was under articles refused to continue any longer at drury lane and when sued for the breach of his contract escaped from the penalty by means no way redounding to his honor macklin and mrs cibber likewise went over to covent garden as did mrs woffington who is said to have entertained expectations of being united in marriage with mr garrick with these deserters aided by the veteran quin mr rich opened covent garden theater mr garrick not intimidated by the strength of the opposition took the field on the  th of september with an occasional prologue spoken by himself see p  0   which was answered by another delivered by mr barry and this again replied to by a very humourous epilogue admirably repeated by mrs clive see p  0   the play of romeo and juliet had lain dormant many years this was now revived at both houses at drury lane with alterations by mr garrick who performed the principal character mr woodward playing mercutio and mrs bellamy juliet against them at covent garden were mr barry and mrs cibber in the principal characters and mr macklin in mercutio both houses began on the first of october and continued to perform it for twelve successive nights when covent garden gave up the contention and its rival kept the field one night more with the credit of holding out longer than its opponent though it is supposed neither side reaped much advantage from the spirit of perseverance which had governed them both in this contest  in the year      on the  th day of march died mr pelham who had conducted the business of government for some years before with candor ability and integrity he was sincerely lamented both by prince and people and on this occasion mr garrick displayed his poetic talents in an ode which we are told ran through four editions in a few weeks it is a performance which does credit to him both as a man and a poet and is the first in the present volumes  the objectors to mr garricks management of the theater had a long time complained that he had conducted himself with too strict an attention to economy in the ornamental and decorative parts of theatrical exhibitions they were perpetually throwing out insinuations that the manager relying on his own powers was determined to regulate the entertainments of the stage with an eye only to his own advantage and without any regard to the satisfaction of the public these murmurs had continued some time when at last mr garrick determined to meet the wishes of his friends and to silence the discontents of his enemies for this purpose he applied to mr denoyer sen to recommend some person of genius to superintend and contrive a splendid spectacle to be exhibited at drury lane the person fixed upon for the purpose was mr noverre a swiss who immediately received orders to engage the best troop of dancers that could be procured these he selected from the foreign theaters and they consisted of swiss italians germans and some french the entertainment in which they were employed was soon afterward produced it was called the chinese festival and was in the theatrical phrase got up with great magnificence and at a very considerable expense the expectations of the managers were however wholly disappointed in the success of the performance although but few of the french nation were employed in it yet a report had been industriously spread that not only french dancers had been sent for over but french dresses also and even french carpenters and tailors the nation was then on the eve of a war and this afforded an opportunity for engaging the passions of those who professed themselves antigallicans they accordingly formed associations to discourage the several performers and suppress the obnoxious performance whenever it should appear at length after having taken up more than eighteen months in preparing it was brought before the public and received with all the virulence and opposition which might be expected from the violence and heat of the times the first performance of it was on the  th day of november      and was honored with the presence of his late majesty yet notwithstanding that circumstance it did not even then escape ill treatment on the second third fourth and fifth nights the riots continued with increasing strength though opposed each evening by several young men of fashion who had determined to support the performance on the sixth evening the opposition acquired fresh vigor and increasing numbers they frustrated every attempt to proceed in the exhibition and committed every excess which a mob subject to no control is apt to indulge itself in that evening was the last representation after receiving assurance that the piece should be acted no more the heroes who had signalized themselves in this important business proceeded to mr garricks house in southamptonstreet where they broke his windows and did other damages they then dispersed and the proprietors of the theater were obliged to submit to the loss of more than four thousand pounds  it would be impossible to enumerate the several small pieces of poetry which mr garrick used to throw out from time to time as his leisure permitted to compliment his friends or to celebrate public events we shall however just mention here that in      he wrote some verses on mr masons taking orders see p  0   and in      he appears to have been one of the few who had taste enough to relish the beauties of mr grays celebrated odes masons life of gray p   0  in      dr hill wrote a pamphlet entitled to david garrick esquire the petition of i in behalf of herself and her sisters the purport of it was to charge mr garrick with mispronouncing some words including the letter i as furm for firm vurtue for virtue and others the pamphlet is now forgotten but the epigram which mr garrick wrote on the occasion deserves to be preserved as one of the best in the english language  from this period no event of importance occurs in the annals of mr garricks life until the year      the business of the theater went on without interruption and he continued to acquire both reputation and fortune in that year however he found himself obliged to exert his poetical talents in order to correct the impertinence of an insignificant individual a mr fitzpatrick who without provocation and in defiance of decency carried on a weekly attack against him in a paper called the craftsman the original cause of the quarrel we are informed was grounded on some illiberal reflections which mr fitzpatrick threw out against mr garrick and which the latter resented with spirit and propriety though a considerable time had elapsed before he was provoked to take public notice of him as mr fitzpatricks writings are now entirely forgotten the revenge which mr garrick took of him must from that circumstance alone be involved in some obscurity those however who are unacquainted with either persons or facts will receive pleasure in reading mr garricks admirable satire published on this occasion entitled the fribbleriad a poem which had the honor of being highly commended by churchill who has also given a very severe correction to the same person  however unequal mr fitzpatrick was to the task of contending with mr garrick in a literary warfare yet the rancour which his defeat had engendered pointed out a new mode of attack to distress his antagonist it had been customary on the representation of a new performance to refuse admittance at any part of the evening unless the whole price of the entertainment was paid this had almost invariably been the rule and it had hitherto been submitted to as a reasonable demand from the managers to compensate for the extraordinary expense which new dresses and scenes occasioned to gratify his resentment mr fitzpatrick seized on this circumstance as a ground to disturb the peace of the theater and to involve the managers in a contest with the public for this purpose handbills were dispersed about the coffee houses in the neighborhood of drury lane recommending a peremptory demand to be made and requiring an absolute promise to be given that no more than half the usual price should be taken on any evening of performance after the third act unless at the representation of a new pantomime a kind of association was entered into by several young men to obtain a redress of this grievance as it was called and mr fitzpatrick put himself at the head of it the evening on which the attack was made happened to be when the the two gentlemen of verona was performed for the alterers benefit the performance accordingly was interrupted after several attempts to proceed in it and the proprietors of the house thinking the requisition an unjust one and the manner of making it improper to be acceded to refused to submit to it in consequence whereof no play was acted that night and the audience received their money again at the doors having first amused themselves with doing all the mischief they were able by this trial the malcontents had discovered their strength and determined to carry their point in humbling the pride of the manager on the next performance which was at the tragedy of elvira they collected their whole force and again prevented the actors proceeding in the play it was in vain that mr garrick desired to be heard in defense of the ancient customs of the theater the opposition insisted on a peremptory answer to their demand in the new regulation which after some time the proprietors of the house were obliged to agree to and once more peace was restored to the theater after a considerable loss had been sustained and obliged to be submitted to see an account of this riot gentlemans magazine vol xxiii p      this season was the last in which mr garrick could be said to have acted in the regular course of his profession from this time he declined performing any new characters and finding his health unsettled by the advice of his physician he determined to give himself some relaxation from care and fatigue he therefore made the arrangements necessary for carrying on the public entertainments during his absence and on the   th of september      the day on which the house opened he left london in order to make the tour of france and italy to supply his place he engaged the late mr powell who had received his instructions the preceding summer and whose success was equal to the abilities he possessed to the honor of his employers it may be added that his abilities were not higher than the encouragement he received for the exertion of them although he was engaged for a term of years at a small salary yet he was before the season closed generously allowed an appointment equal to the first performer in the house we are credibly informed the prosits that year exceeded even those in which mr garrick performed in the height of his reputation  the interval from this period until the month of april      mr garrick employed in traveling through the principal parts of europe and was at every place where he resided and at most of the courts to which he was introduced received in the most honorable and cordial manner by the great as well as by men of letters each vying with the other in showing respect to the greatest dramatic character of the age while he stayed at paris he amused himself with reading fontaines fables which pleased him so much that he was induced to attempt an imitation of them he accordingly wrote one called the sick monkey which he transmitted over to a friend to be ready for publication immediately on his arrival it accordingly made its appearance in two or three days after with the following motto thursday afternoon david garrick esquire arrived at his house in southamptonstreet covent garden public advertiser april         and he had the pleasure of hearing the sentiments of his friends upon it many of whom mistook it for a satire upon him and accordingly expressed themselves in very warm terms on the occasion  immediately on his arrival he resumed the management of the theater and introduced some improvements which had been suggested by his observations on the conduct of the foreign stages from the list of his works it will be seen that he had not been idle while abroad he produced the next season several new pieces and in the beginning of      the excellent comedy of the clandestine marriage written in concert with mr colman he also at the request of his majesty appeared again upon the stage and on that occasiou spoke see page  0  a new prologue replete with those strokes of humor in which in that species of composition he manifested a superiority over all his contemporaries  in that year died mr quin mr quin died the   st day of january      and mrs cibber on the  0th of the same month and mrs cibber their deaths were very pathetically taken notice of in the prologue to the clandestine marriage and for the former mr garrick wrote an epitaph which was placed over his tomb in the cathedral church of bath mr quin was the only performer of any reputation when mr garrick first appeared on the stage and he had likewise been one of his earliest opposers for several years however before mr quins death great cordiality had subsisted between him and mr garrick at whose house at hampton he spent some time a few months before his death and there first discovered the symptoms of that disorder which carried him to his grave  the year      was remarkable for the celebration of a jubilee at stratford upon avon the  th  th and  th of september in honor of shakespeare a ceremony which very much engaged the public attention although it was treated by some as a subject worthy only of ridicule yet by others it was deemed a just compliment due to the great writer whose memory was intended to be honored by it the circumstance which gave rise to it happened some time before and was as follows a clergyman into whose possession the house once belonging to our great poet had come found that a mulberrytree which grew in the garden and which had been planted according to tradition by shakespeare himself overshadowed his mansion and made it damp to remedy this inconvenience he caused it to be cut down to the great mortification of his neighbors who were so enraged at him that they soon rendered the place out of revenge too disagreeable for him to remain in it he therefore was obliged to quit it and the tree being purchased by a carpenter was retailed and cut out in various relics of standdishes teachests tobaccostoppers and other things some of which were obtained by the corporation of stratford the gentlemen belonging to this body soon after agreed to present mr garrick with the freedom of their borough and their steward communicated their intentions to him in a letter from whence the following extract is taken the corporation of stratford ever desirous of expressing their gratitude to all who do honor and justice to the memory of shakespeare and highly sensible that no person in any age has excelled you therein would think themselves much honored if you would become one of their body though this borough does not now send members to parliament perhaps the inhabitants may not be less virtuous and to render the freedom of this place the more acceptable to you the corporation propose to send it in a box made of that very mulberry tree planted by shakespeares own hand the story of that valuable relick is too long to be here inserted but the gentleman who is so obliging as to convey this to you will acquaint you therewith as also that the corporation would be happy in receiving from your hands some statue bust or picture of shakespeare to be placed within their new town hall they would be equally pleased to have some picture of yourself that the memory of both may be perpetuated together in that place which gave him birth and where he still lives in the mind of every inhabitant  the honor proposed in this letter to be conferred on mr garrick was accepted by him and the same compliment was paid to george keate esquire who had some time before produced a poem which contained an excellent eulogium on our admirable dramatick bard  yes jealous wits for empire still may strive  still keep the flames of critic rage alive  our shakespeare yet shall all his rights maintain  and crown the triumphs of elizas reign  above control above each classic rule  his tutress nature and the world his school  on pinions fancyplumd to him was given  the power to scale inventions brightest heaven  bid the

pictures fade ferney  to       in the month of may the persons deputed by the corporation waited on mr garrick and presented him with the freedom of their borough accompanied with the following letter to david garrick esquire sir the mayor aldermen and burgesses of the ancient borough of stratford upon avon a town that glories in giving birth to the immortal shakespeare whose memory you have so highly honored and whose conceptions you have ever so happily expressed  rejoice in an opportunity of adding their mite to that universal applause your inimitable powers have most justly merited and as a mark of their esteem and gratitude have respectfully transmitted to you the freedom of their borough in a box made from a mulberry tree undoubtedly planted by shakespeares own hand which they

entertainment was to have been performed the disappointments it sustained and the several occurrences which took place at it are all so recent in the memories of most of our readers and were so accurately related at the time they happened see victors history of the theaters vol iii  that we shall not recapitulate them here it is sufficient to observe that accident deprived those who were present of part of their entertainment that all which was exhibited gave general satisfaction and mr garrick who was a great sum of money out of pocket by it framed an entertainment which was performed at drury lane theater    nights with great applause to very crowded audiences the ode which was spoken by him at stratford was also repeated at the same theater but not with much success being performed only seven times this ode was parodied in an admirable burlesque called an ode on dedicating a building and erecting a statue to le stue cook to the duke of newcastle at clermont reprinted with mr garricks ode in dillys repository vol i   the management of a theater is always attended with anxiety and vexation the difficulty of satisfying the several candidates for theatrical fame is so great that he who can preserve the friendship of those whose pieces he rejects must be allowed to possess very extraordinary abilities in the year      it was mr garricks misfortune to be embroiled with a very irascible and troublesome person who claimed the representation of one of his pieces at drury lane and he enforced his demand in a manner that will stamp indelible disgrace on his memory he published a poem to intimidate the manager called love in the suds containing insinuations of the basest kind and which he afterward denied having had any intentions to convey as this writer is dead those reflections on his conduct which had he been living might have appeared here and which the subject naturally suggests shall be suppressed it will be sufficient to observe that mr garrick had recourse to the court of kings bench to punish the infamous libeller of his reputation and notwithstanding he had been a second time insulted by another publication conceived with equal malignity he was weak enough to stop the prosecution he had commenced on his adversarys signing an acknowledgment of his offense which was printed in all the public papers it cannot be denied but that the interests of society demanded that so gross an offender should meet with punishment and that no concessions ought to have been allowed to deprecate that stroke which the law would have inflicted on so heinous a crime  from this time no event of importance happened until the resolution which mr garrick had begun to form of quitting the stage was to the concern of every one carried into execution in the beginning of the year      he entered into an agreement with some of the present patentees for the sale of his interest in the theater but continued to act during the remainder of that season the last night of his performance was for the theatrical fund on the  0th day of june in that year when he represented the character of don felix in the wonder at the conclusion of the play he came forward and addressed the audience in a short speech wherein he said it had been usual for persons in his situation to address the public in an epilogue and that he had accordingly turned his thoughts that way but found it as impossible to write as it would be to speak a studied composition the jingle of rhyme and the language of fiction ill suiting his then feelings that the moment in which he then spoke was an awful one to him that he had received innumerable favors and took his leave on the spot where those favors were conferred he then said that whatever the events of his future life might be he should ever remember those favors with the highest satisfaction and deepest gratitude and though he admitted the superior skill and abilities of his successors he defied them to exert themselves with more industry zeal and attention than he had done this speech which was delivered with all that emotion which the particular situation of the speaker rendered very interesting and affecting was received with the loudest bursts of applause and he left the stage with the acclamations of a numerous and polite audience who were unable to forbear expressing the deepest concern for the loss of their favorite performer  mr garrick now retired to the enjoyment of his friends the most respectable in the kingdom and of a large fortune acquired in the course of more than thirty years but the stone which he had been afflicted with some time had already made such inroads on his constitution that he was unable to communicate or receive from his friends that pleasure which his company afforded except at times and in a very partial manner it is supposed that he injured his health by the application of quack medicines and often experienced the most violent torments from the severity of his disorder at christmas      he went to visit lord spencer at althorp in northamptonshire during the holidays he there was taken ill but recovered so far that he was removed to town where growing worse he died in a few days afterward at his house in the adelphi on the  0th day of january      at the age of    years leaving behind him the character of a friendly humane charitable and

tears and join a nations woe see  as you pass the crowded street despondence clouds each face you meet all their lost friend deplore you read in every pensive eye you hear in every broken sigh that pelham is no more if thus each briton be alarmed whom but his distant influence warmed what grief their breasts must rend who in his private virtues blessed by natures dearest ties possessed the husband father friend what mute ye bards  no mournful verse no chaplets to adorn his hearse to crown the good and just your flowers in warmer regions bloom you seek no pensions from the tomb no laurels from the dust when power departed with his breath the sons of flattery fled from death such insects swarm at noon not for herself my muse is grieved she never asked nor ever received one ministerial boon has some peculiar strange offense against us armed omnipotence to check the nations pride behold the appointed punishment at length the vengeful bolt is sent it fell when pelham died uncheckd by shame unawed by dread when vice triumphant rears her head vengeance can sleep no more the evil angel stalks at large the good submits resigns his charge and quits the unhallowed shore the same sad morn the  th of march      was remarkable for the publication of the works of a late lord and the death of mr pelbam to church and state so for our sins twas fixed by fate a double stroke was given black as the whirlwinds of the north st johns fell genius issued forth and pelham fled to heaven by angels watched in edens bowers our parents passed their peaceful hours nor guilt nor pain they knew but on the day which ushered in the hellborn train of mortal sin the heavenly guards withdrew look down muchhonord shade below still let thy pity aid our woe stretch out thy healing hand resume those feelings which on earth proclaimed thy patriot love and worth and saved sinking land search with thy more than mortal eye the breasts of all thy friends descry what there has got possession see

his sight drag forth the vipers into light and crush them ere they sting if such his trust and honors share again exert thy guardian care each venomed heart disclose on him on him our all depends oh save him from his treacherous friends he cannot fear his foes whoever shall at the helm preside still let thy prudence be his guide to stem the troubled wave but chiefly whisper in his ear  that george is open just sincere  and dares to scorn a knave no selfish views to oppress mankind no mad ambition fired thy mind to purchase fame with blood thy bosom glowed with purer heat convinced that to be truly great is only to be good to hear no lawless passions call to serve thy king yet feel for all such was thy glorious plan wisdom with generous love took part together worked thy head and heart the minister and man unite ye kindred sons of worth strangle bold faction in its birth be britains weal your view for this great end let all combine let virtue link each fair design and pelham live in you advertisement to the second edition the author of the foregoing ode has heard with pleasure that what he had written from his concern for the death of a good and great man has been favorably received he is not vain enough to think that the poem has any merit but what results from the truth and mere feeling of the subject matter  in this edition he has altered some stanzas which were too hastily published in the first and hopes he has now made it more worthy of his readers  the fribbleriad foemina vir neutrum pull in hermoph first printed in the year       advertisement be it known unto you gentle or ungentle reader that the author of the following poem is a volunteer in the service or rather a poetical knight errant who according to the oath taken at the late installation is exhortca and admonished by apollo to be sure to use his sword in defense of all equity and justice to the utmost of his power his brother quixote of immortal memory tried his prowess upon sheep and windmills  our champion does the very same and calls forth to the field an unknown knight who has the formidable x y z in his train  and that he may not be thought to engage with too great odds on his side he opposes to them his own three trusty squires a b c who are resolved to stand by him and fight all the weapons through from epic poetry to epigram as long as there is a letter left standing in the english alphabet  and now mr churchill may know that there is  a quixote of the age will dare to wage a war with dirt and fight with air when the aforesaid unknown knight shall please to appear with his beaver up he may expect that our adventurer will show his face too  in the mean time we will divert him in our turn with a little bushfighting which he has been endeavoring to entertain the town with for more than a twelvemonth past  it is therefore proper to inform thee reader for as yet perhaps thou have not heard of it that there is a certain weekly paper called the craftsman still existing if it may be called existence to crawl about from week to week and be kept alive by those last resources of hungry ingenuity falsehood and defamation in this said paper a certain gentleman who subscribes himself x y z a volunteer too in the service has thrown about his dirt in a most extraordinary manner and has attacked our stage hero with unwearied malevolence both in his public and private character but indeed his rancour being too much for his wit he has let his heart indulge itself at the expense of his head and has most imprudently made assertions in the bitterness of his spirit which can be contradicted by every attender upon the theater  it would be endless and out of place here to point out his want of taste and even common truth in his account of the manner of mr garricks speaking and acting in his various characters of his most ungentlemanlike as well as unjust abuse of his person voice age etc etc etc for there is no kind of meanness as montaigne well observes that a true malignant spirit will not descend to  to give one instance among a thousand of his upright intentions  this worthy gentleman mr x y z not content with exposing his impotent malice weekly to the public was at the pains and expense to collect his papers into one volume the title of which was an enquiry into the real merit of a certain popular performer in a series of letters first published in the craftsman or grays inn journal with an introduction to david garrick esquire  vo  and even send them to some of mr garricks friends left the obscurity and disreputation of the paper in which they first made their appearance should have kept his malice totally a secret  the reviewers gave their sentiments of this curious collection in the following manner   these are the overflowings of spleen ignorance conceit and disappointment crit rev jan       the design of publishing these important pieces of criticism is to prevent the sad misfortune of their sinking into oblivion with a last years newspaper if we believe the author all the praises that have hitherto been given to mr garrick as an actor are so entirely without foundation that he never did nornever could speak ten successive lines of shakespeare with grammatical propriety this is an assertion so contrary to the opinion of many better critics than this author shows himself to be and in reality so opposite to truth that it is alone sufficient to invalidate all his reasonings upon the subject monthly rev dec    0  it would take up too much time at present to exhibit our hero x y z in all his proper colors we shall leave that task to a much abler hand who will very soon more fully detect and expose him and his designs this was soon after executed in the following severe character drawn by mr churchill of the hero of this poem first inserted in the eighth edition of the rosciad with that low cunning which in fools supplies and amply too the place of being wife which nature kind indulgent parent gave to qualify the blockhead for a knave with that smooth falsehood whose appearance charms and reason of each wholesome doubt disarms which to the lowest depths of guile descends by vilest means pursues the vilest ends wears friendships mask for purposes of spite fawns in the day and butchers in the night with that malignant envy which turns pale and sickens even if a friend prevail which merit and success pursues with hate and damns the worth it cannot imitate with the cold caution of a cowards spleen which fears not guilt but always seeks a screen which keeps this maxim ever in her view  what is basely done should be done safely too with that dull rooted callous impudence which dead to shame and every nicer sense never blushed unless in spreading vices snares she blunderd on some virtue unawares with all these blessings which we seldom find lavished by nature on one happy mind a motley figure of the fribble tribe which heart can searce conceive or pen describe came simpering on to ascertain whose sex twelve sage impanelld matrons would perplex nor male nor female neither and yet both of neuter gender though of irish growth a sixfoot sackling mincing in his gait affected peevish prim and delicate fearful it seemed though of athletic make lest brutal breezes should too roughly shake its tender form and savage motion spread over its pale cheeks the horrid manly red much did it talk in its own pretty phrase of genius and of time of players and plays much too of writings which itself had wrote of special merit though of little note for fate in a strange humor had decreed that what it wrote none but itself should read much too it chatterd of dramatic laws misjudging critics and misplaced applause then with a selfcomplacent jutting air it smiled it smirkd it wriggled to the chair and with an awkward briskness not his own looking around and perking on the throne triumphant seemed when that strange savage dame known but to few or only known by name plain common sense appeared by nature there appointed with plain truth to guard the chair the pageant saw and blasted with her frown to its first state of nothing melted down nor shall the muse for even there the pride of this vain nothing shall be mortified nor shall the muse should fate ordain her rhimes fond pleasing thought to live in aftertimes with such a triflers name her pages blot known be the character the thing forgot let it to disappoint each future aim live without sex and die without a name    but to return to our poem   it may properly be called an iliad in a nutshell for though it does not consist of many more than four hundred lines it contains all the essential epic properties  the plan sentiments character diction moral meter and even the heroes themselves all in miniature  the following epigram printed in the ledger was the cornerstone of the whole and furnished us with ideas of the redoubted fitzgig the achilles of the fribbleriad   to x y z inded most severely poor garrick you handle not bigots damn more with their bell book and candle though you with the town about him disagree he joins with the town in their judgment of thee so dainty so devilish is all that you scribble not a soul but can see it is the spite of a fribble and all will expect you when forth you shall come with a round smirking face and a jut with your bum if x y z is really such a thing as here represented he is most welcome to the honor we have done him if he is not he may thank his own malignant d sposition that made it natural to suppose that such poor spite could proceed from no one who was not in his person manners mind and heart an arrant fribble  the fribbleriad who is the scribbler x y z who still writes on though little read whose falsehood malice envy spite so often grin yet se dom bite say garrick does he write for bread this friend of yours this x y z for pleasure sure not bread  twere vain to write for that he never could gain no calls of nature to excuse him he deals in rancour to amuse him a man it seems  it is hard to say  a woman then  a moment pray  unknown as yet by sex or feature suppose we try to guess the creature whether a wit or a pretender of masculine or female gender some things it does may pass for either and some it does belong to neither it is so fibbing slandering spiteful in phrase so dainty so delightful so fond of all it reads add writes so waggish when the maggot bites such spleen such wickedness and whim it must be woman and a brim but then the learning and the latin the ends of horace come so pat in and wanting wit it makes such shift to fill up gaps with pope and swift as cunning housewives bait their traps and take their game with bits and scraps for playhouse critics keen as mice are ever greedy ever nice and rank abuse like toasted cheese will catch as many as you please in short it is easily discerning by here and there a patch of learning the creatures male  say all we can it must be something like a man  what like a man from day to shrink and seek revenge with pen and ink on mischief bent his name conceal and like a toad in secret steal there swell with venom inward pent till out he crawls to give it vent hate joined with fear will shun the light but hate and manhood fairly fight  it is manhoods mark to face the foe and not in ambush give the blow the savage thus less man than beast upon his foe will fall and feast from bush or hole his arrows send to wound his prey then tear and rend for fear and hatred in conjunction make wretches that feel no compunction with colors flying beat of drum unlike to this see churchill come and now like hercules he stands unmasked his face but armed his hands alike prepared to write or drub this holds a pen and that a club a club which nerves like his can wield and formed a wit like his to shield  mine is the rosciad mine he cries who says it is not i say he lies to falsehood and to fear a stranger not one shall fear my fame or danger let those who write with fear or shame those craftsmen scribblers hide their name my name is churchill  thus he spoke and thrice he waved his knotted oak that done he paused  prepared the blow impartial bard for friend and foe if such are manhoods feats and plan poor x y z will prove no man nor male nor female  then on oath we safely may pronounce it both what of that wriggling fribbling race the curse of nature and disgrace that mixture base with fiends set forth to taint and vilify all worth  whose rancour knows nor bounds nor measure feels every passion tastes no pleasure the want of power all peace destroying for ever wishing never enjoying  so smiling smirking soft in feature you would swear it was the gentlest creature  but touch its pride the ladyfellow from sickly pale turns deadly yellow  male female vanish  fiends appear  and all is malice rage and fear what in the heart breeds all this evil makes man on earth a very devil corrupts the mind and tortures sense malignity with impotence say gossip muse who love to prattle and fill the town with tittletattle to tell a secret such a bliss is say for what cause these mastermisses to garrick such a hatred bore that long they wished to pinch him sore to bind the monster hand and foot like gulliver in lilliput with birchin twigs to flea his skin and each to stick him with a pin  are things so delicate so fell can cherubims be imps of hell tell us how spite a scheme begot who laid the eggs who hatched the plot o sing in nambypamby feet like to the subject tripping neat snatch every grace that fancy reaches relate their passions plottings speeches you when their panfribblerium sat saw them convened and heard their chat saw all their wriggling fuming fretting their nodding frisking and curvetting each minute saw their rage grow stronger till the dear things could hold no longer but out burst forth the dreadful vow to do a deed  but when and how and where  o muse thy lyre newstring the how the where the when to sing say in what sign the sun had entered when these sweet souls on plotting ventured  twas when the balmy breath of may makes tender lambkins sport and play when tenderer fribbles walk and dare to gather nosegays in the air  twas at that time of all the year when flowers and butterflies appear when brooding warmth on nature lies and circulates the blood of flies  then fribbles were with fribbles leaguing and met for plotting and intriguing there is a place upon a hill where cits of pleasure take their fill where hautboys scream and fiddles squeak to sweat the ditto once a week where joy of late unmixed with noise of romping girls and drunken boys where decency sweet maid appeared and in her hand brought johnny beard twas here  for public rooms are free they met to plot and drink their tea each on a satin stool was seated which nicely quilted curtaind pleated did all their various skill display each worked his own to grace the day  above the rest and set apart a chair was placed where curious art with lace and fringe to honor meant him they should choose their president no longer now the kettle simmers the smoke ascends or cotton glimmers the tea was done the cups reversed lord trip began  may i be cursed  may this right hand grow brown and speckled  this nose be pimpled face be freckled  may my sick monkey never get up  may my sweet dido die in pup  nay may i meet a worse disaster  my finger cut and have no plaster   no cordial drops when dead with vapor  be taken short and have no paper   if i dont feel your wrongs and shame  with such a zeal for fribble fame   so much my heart for vengeance thumps  you see it raging through my jumps  then opening wide his milkwhite vest they saw it fluttering in its nest some felt his heart and some propose their drops  his lordship to compose  the perturbation all agree was partly fidgets partly tea while some the drops some water get sir cockadoodle baronet arose  let not this accident  the business of the day prevent  that lords my friend my near relation  but what is one lord to all our nation  friendship to patriot eyes looks small  and cockadoodle feels for all  shall one though great increase your care  while still unhonourd stands that chair  might i presume to name a creter  formed for the place by art and nater  i would a dainty wit propose  to serve our friends destroy our foes  to fill the chair so nicely it  his pride and passion match his wit  his wit has so much power and might  it yields to nothing but his spite   for wit may have its ebbs and flows  but malice no abatement knows propose they cried we trust in you  name him sir cockadoodle  do   would you have one can joke and scribble  whose heart and very soul is fribble   would you have one can smile be civil  yet all within a very devil   lay pretty schemes like cobwebs spin em  to catch your hated foe within em  let him a thousand times break through em  the ingenious creter shall renew em   if mischief is your wish and plan  let some say fitzgig  the reader may take his choice fizgig fizgig be the man  what say you  brethren shall it be  has he your voice  all cried ouy ouy at which one larger than the rest with visage sleek and swelling chest with stretchdout fingers and a thumb stuck to his hips and jutting bum rose up  all knew his smirking air they clapped and cried  the chair the chair he smiled and to the honored seat paddled away with mincing feet so have i seen on dovehouse top with cockdup tail and swelling crop a pouting pigeon waddling run shuffling riggling noddling on some minutes passed in forms and greeting phil whiffle opened the cause of meeting  in fortyeight  i well remember   twelve years or more the month november  may we no more such misery know  since garrick made our sex a show  and gave us up to such rude laughter  that few twas said could hold their water  for he that player so mocked our motions  our dress amusements fancies notions  so lispd our words and minced our steps  he made us pass for demireps  though wisely then we laughed it off  well now return his wicked scoff  genteel revenge is ever slow  the dear italians poison so   but how attack him far or near  in front my friends or in the rear all started up at once to speak as if they felt some sudden tweak twas quick resentment caused the smart and piered them in the tenderest part for these dear souls are like a spinnet which has both sharp and sweet within it press but the keys up start the quills and thus perkd up these jackmygills each touching brushing as they rose together rustled all their clothes thus when all hushed at handels air sit book in hand the british fair a sudden whiz the car receives when rustling bustling turn the leaves in all the dignity of form the chairman rose to hush the storm to order called and tried to frown  as all got up so all sat down sir diddle then he thus addressed   it is yours to speak be mute the rest when thus the knight  can i dissemble conceal my rage while thus i tremble  o fizgig it is that garricks name  now stops my voice and shakes my frame   his pangs would please  his death  oh lud  blood mr fizgig blood blood blood the thought too mighty for his mind oercame his powers he stard grew blind cold sweat his faded cheek overspread like dew upon the lilys head he squeakd and sighed  no more could say but blood  bloo  blo  and died away thus when in war a hero swoons with loss of blood or fear of wounds they bear him off  and thus they bore sir diddle to the gardendoor where sat lord trip  where stood for use salts hartshorn peppermint and eau de luce a pause ensued  at length began the valiant captain pattypan with kimbowd arm and tossing head he bridled up  wear i this red  shall blood be named and i be dumb  for that and that alone i come  glorys my call and blood my trade and thus  then forth he drew his blade at once the whole assembly shrieks at once the roses quit their cheeks each face overcast with deadly white nor paint itself could stand the fright the roof with order order rings and all cry out  no naked things the captain sheathed his wrath in pride and stuck the bodkin by his side more soft more gentle than a lamb the reverend mister marjoram arose  but first with fingers tip he pats the patch upon his lip then over it glides his healing tongue and thus he said  or rather sung  sure it is the error of the moon  what fight a mimic a buffoon  in france he has the churchs curse  and englands church is ten times worse  have you not read the holy writ  just published by a reverend wit  that every actor is a thing  a merry andrew paper king  a puppet made of rags and wood  the lowest son of earth mere mud  mere public game wherever you meet him  and cobblers as they please may treat him  slave coxcomb venal and what not  ten thousand names that i have forgot   then risque not thus a precious life  in such a low unnatural strife  and sure to stab him would be cruel   i vote for  arsenick in his gruel he said and smiled then sunk with grace licked the patched lip and wiped his face a buz of rapture filled the room like bees about a shrub in bloom all whispered round  was it not fine  o very  very  twas divine but soon as from the chair was seen a waving hand and speaking mein a calm came on  the chairman bowed  and smirking spoke  i am pleased and proud  to mix my sentiments with yours  it is prudence every point secures  two friends with rapture i have heard  one favors arsenick one the sword   in both there is danger  but succeeding  short pangs in poisoning less in bleeding  a sudden deaths not worth a shilling   i would have our foe nine years a killing then from his bosom forth he drew a crowquill pen  behold for you  and your revenge this instrument  from hell it came to me twas sent  within is poison sword and all  its point a dagger dipped in gall  keen lingering pangs the foe shall feel  while clouds the hand that stabs conceal  with this while living i will dissect him  create his errors then detect em  swell tiny faults to monstrous size  then point them out to purblind eyes  which like polonious gaze in air  for ouzel camel whale or bear  his very merit i will pervert  and swear the ore is sand and dirt   i know his quick and warm sensations  and thence will work him more vexations   attended with some noisy cit  of strong belief but puny wit  i will take my seat be rude and loud  that each remark may reach the crowd  at lear will laugh be hard as rocks  and sit at scrub like barbers blocks  when all is still well roar like thunder  when all applause  be mute and wonder  in this i boast uncommon merit   i like have praised his genius spirit  his various powers i own divert me   it is his success alone has hurt me   my patriot hand like brutus strikes  and stabs and wounds where most it likes  he as a roman gave the blow  i as a fribble stab your foe  he mourned the deed would not prevent it  i will do the deed  and then some mss read repent it lament it  at this all tongues their hearts obey a burst of rapture forced its way bravo  bravissimo  huzza all rose at once  then hand in hand each linked to each the heroes stand  like fairies form a magic round  then vow and tremble at the sound  by all that is dear to human kind by every tie can fribbles bind they vow that with their latest breath they will stand by fizgig  life or death the kiss goes round the parting friends  the chair is left  the assembly ends then each his spirit to recruit for biscuits call and candied fruit and sip his fluttered nerves to heal warm water sack and orangepeel  then made as warm as warmth could make them all to their several homes betake them  save one who harrassd with the chair remained at hampstead for the air now garrick for the future know where most you have deserved a foe  can you their rage with justice blame to you they owe their public shame though long they slept they were not dead their malice wakes in x y z  and now bursts forth their treasured gall through him  cock fribble of them all the sick monkey after mr garrick had been abroad about a year and half satiated with the amusements and pleasures of the continent he turned his thoughts toward his native country but before he would set out for calais he was resolved to put in practice his usual method of preventing censure and blunting the edge of ridicule by anticipation for this purpose before he left paris he sat down very seriously to write a kind of satirical poem on himself it was called the sick monkey and the plan of it was the talk or censure of other animals and reptiles on him and his travels and this poem he sent from paris to a friend mr colman with a request that he would get it printed to prepare his reception in london daviess life of garrick vol   p     a fable thursday afternoon david garrick esquire arrived at his house in southamptonstreet covent garden public advertiser april         first published       the sick monkey a fable addressed to mr garrick upon his arrival returned from travel to your native shore again to make us laugh or cry to turn your back we hope no more nor from your colors fly whether you fled for health or quiet harrassd with rule or sick with riot or whether you have kept us lean as slander says with lenten plays to make our appetites more keen whether it be or this or that no matter what for we before the curtain see but blindly now you are come to us and home we greet you sir and greet you kindly my muse is honest as she is bold a forward miss who loves to prate  but hold  i quite forgot before i tell you what she is i will tell you what she is not no bird of prey with wild uproar like churchill to disturb the grove nor comes she like the harmless dove to bill and coo and love  and nothing more in short to speak more plainly nor be it thought i speak it vainly averse to flattery and spite she is a modest sober dame i wish all females were the same and will not scratch or bite she is not one of those who show their genius in their dress whose inky fingers unpinnd clothes the slipshod shoe and snuffy nose denote her wit and sluttishness who with a play like pistol cocked in hand bid managers to stand  deliver sir  your thoughts on this  before you stir    but madam  miss   your answer strait  i will not wait   it is fit you know   i will hear no reason  this very season  ay or no not to kill more precious time in dropping sense to pick up rhyme or like friend shandy rattle and lose my matter in my prattle without much wit digressions tame so i shall give it over and beat about the bush no more but start my game the criticks pen has various uses it praises now and now abuses does this and that or both together as fancy strikes or rhimes come pat stabs with the point or tickles with the feather authors like bees buz round and round dramatic ground for all they meet have sharp and sweet they do no ill would fools fit still provoke em and they are dangerous things and every player should equally beware their honey as their stings garrick thou mighty chief of kings and queens despotic tyrant of the scenes think thou all human race to mock in buskin and in sock and will not fools thy mockry ridicules from chalkstones lord to dainty fribble rave chatter write in various ways display their spite for all can talk and some can scribble others again take up the pen in panegyricks gaudy colors paint thee as humor flows now friends now foes in prose and verse and verse and prose bedevil thee and saint thee and can such critics teaze thee and can such praises please thee o if they can alas poor man no more deride thy neighbors weakness folly pride but cure thy own if thou art able while i make known my friendship to thee in a fable an ape there was an ape of merit a lively sportive pleasant thing had so much fancy whim and spirit and made such sport he got to court and showed his tricks before the lionking such honor gave him fame and raised his name from far and near they came to see this monkeyprodigy though none were more expert and quick in tumbling backward over a stick though none with a more lordly pride and happy ease did ever bestride the rugged russian bear though he could skip it up and down and pick the pocket of a clown or whip away his hat or fondle with a cat the wonder of the fair this was not all  he had the art of acting still a higher part to each profession that he saw physic divinity or law he ludicrously shaped him so much possessed of all their notions their humors oddities and motions that not a soul escaped him in ridicules enchanted glass whatever forms are shown we all can see anothers face but never find our own to flatter self we all incline for self we plan and labor  pluck not good sir a hair of mine  and you may scalp my neighbor each laughed to see his friend the jest and praised the monkey highly not openly but slily at court you find a thousand such but what was best though there were none by turns he did not fall upon each thought himself the only one the mimic could not touch blessed fools who boast your happy lot from ridicule secure though leopardstaind you see no spot inimitably pure whether the jackanapes was clever or the court not over nice by various tricks he crept in favor and for those tricks had double price thus fortune in a whim resolved to turn his brain and filled his cup up to the brim the in toxicating cup of joy which better heads than his destroy no wonder he was vain whenever gossip fame prates loud envy in turn as loud will tattle and scribblers to her standard crowd cry havoc and prepare for battle malevolence with lynxs eye the most minute defects will spy and even friendship shame upon our kind is to those faults not always blind the looking up fatigues the sight and mortals when they soar should they once reach a certain height all wish to have them lower and friends there are in this good town will lend a hand to help them down about about my pen nor lose the fable in thy railing but to our monkey back again who found that brutes as well as men have this same cursed failing the moment he got fame and wealth how ill exchanged for ease and health the envious crew poor pug pursue abuse his active pliant spirit but chiefly those were marked his foes who felt a satire in his merit the dull and sluggish were the first to show their teeth if not to bite the hog the bear the ass had burst had they not grunted roared and brayed their spite this furious stir awaked the critic cur hound greyhound mastiff answer to the call the little dogs and all the games in view for man and beast scandals a feast where both with appetite fall to the bloated toad in silence stole to gather poison in her hole as mischief never knows delay she roused the viper in her way a neighbor and her bosom friend for though she crawled and could not run she kept this maxim stricty ye sons of law attend that mischief if it must be done twere well it were done quickly but then his friends  did they oppose a lukewarm friends the worst of foes the goat looked wife and waggd his beard the spaniel shook his ears the fox turned up his pointed nose thoughtful and dull the cat appeared or else in whispers purrd her fears the steed a lone was firm and fast the generous steed stood by him to the last pug sickens mopes and looks like death speaks faintly and scarce draws his breath some call it megrim some the spleen words often used that little mean but scandal with her face demure hints it is heat of blood by which is understood an old amor in short they ransack all diseases and give him that their fancy pleases among the rest that fits him best which best the doctor serves of which he most avails him when knowledge fails him and with a face of wisdom calls it  nerves the horse who saw his friends distress did thus his honest mind express  come prithee rouse this lifes the devil  what sigh and sob and keep within  what you who used to frisk and revel  for ever chatter and for ever grin  zounds  it would make a parson swear   get on my back and take the air away they went and as they pass the hog the dog the bear the ass pugs different foes in different places if in the least they showed their spite the horse would winny snort and bite and throw the dirt into their faces for all this care this exercise and air yet still the monkey pined for well we are assured that when the grief is in the mind it is sooner got than cured in this condition what to prescribe him  a physician there is a certain way of life which all must take for fashions sake or be with all the world at strife the rich must to the doctor give the poor to nature trust and live it must be so  or could the tribe of those who quack or who prescribe in folly find fuch ample gain could nostrums swell the advertiser or the wise heads of warwick lane buy wig enough to make them wiser our patient cannot wait  send for a doctor strait but not a formal halfbred fool who cures by chance and kills by rule a perriwigpated block physicians for the brutes were fowls and though the sworn practitioners were owls they chose a neighboring cock he enters with a stately tread his comb and wattles dignify his head no outward sign was ever seen that promised half so much within and yet  ye sons of physic blush the wine was better than the bush his learning backed by penetration a kind of radcliffeinspiration bound by no partial pedant laws shot through each symptom to its cause a rarity without dispute he was an honest cock to boot yet with this genius worth and knowledge he had a stain a deep disgrace no mortal merit could efface   he was not of the college but hold  our hero out of sight must now again be brought to light we left him in the doctors care who with a serious face attending to the case did thus his mind declare  i could like any learned brother  with a hard name my ignorance smother  it is one of our established laws  which daily we fulfill  whenever our skill cannot find a cause  to make a cause to suit our skill  thus we seldom meet disgrace  we only can mistake the case  what are these papers by your side  it is physic sir to cure my pride  this heap of papers verse and prose  is the joint malice of my foes  there is not a day but somethings sent me  to fret me and torment me this said the conversation stops for pug was faint and calls for drops with rage subdued the patient panted which struck a light the doctor wanted who thus pronounced  i know your ail  it is not in your heart or head  as some have said  where then good doctor  in your tail his tail of most uncommon make in action like the serpent kind a thousand different forms could take twirl twist and vary to his mind if lords were apd  this pliant queue was cross his breast a ribbon blue or green or red  and then slapdash a chaplains scarf or colnels sash whenever the city struck his brain twas round his neck a lord mayors chain or were his part to lisp and trip it hey presto  twas a ladys tippet but now deprived of spirit life and strength it lies a languid lank inanimated length the doctor paused  then silence broke  i will strike a master stroke  this tail of yours we must amend  give it new life and force  and if we gain that end  the rest will come of course  with that same malice of your foes  both verse and prose  curl it each night and morning  but then take warning   never again to cast your eyes  on what is wrote or may be writ  whether it is or is not wit  for there the magic lies it is best by craft and not by book to cure these mental fevers  the monkey all for gospel took the sick are great believers so well the doctors words he noted his tail that night was papilloted his greedy eyes to cure his head no more on paperdiet fed the cause removed effects will cease deprived of oil the flame goes out our ape began to be at peace his tail to move about the more twas curled the more twas twirld with head and heart the tail took part life frisks in every vein  pug was himself again  the monkey got his health the doctor wealth of patients he had plenty for though the cure was half a joke twas wondered at by silly folk and that is nineteen in twenty to fix his cure historians say that like sir wilful in the play he talked of foreign parts left all his griefs and cares behind sailed with the first fair wind and hey for italy and arts what he got there no creature knows nor he himself can tell us what lightly comes as lightly goes with all such pretty fellows he skipd the country over and then returned with what he learned a greater monkey than before the fable told the moral comes  garrick dont fret and bite your thumbs but take the monkeys place the sames your case the same prescription we advise should spleen and spite nay though critic truth should write for who is always in the right shut your ears and close your eyes whatever is published buy the heap you will have it cheap but not to read or hear it read would you strike detraction dead the doctors method cannot fail keep the poison from your head and clap it to your tail an ode upon dedicating a building and erecting a statue to shakespeare at stratford upon avon this ode was spoken by mr garrick  th september      at stratford upon avon and the ensuing winter at drury lane theater  advertisement could some gentlemen of approved ability have been prevailed upon to do justice to the subject of the following ode the present apology would have been unnecessary  but as it was requisite to produce something of this kind upon the occasion and the lot having unluckily fallen on the person perhaps the least qualified to succeed in the attempt it is hoped the candor of the public will esteem the performance rather as an act of duty than vanity in the author  as some newspaper writers have illiberally endeavored to shake the poetic character of our immortal bard too deeply indeed rooted in the heart to be affected by them it is recommended to those who are not sufficiently established in their dramatic faith to peruse a work lately published called an essay on the genius and writings of shakespeare by which they will with much satisfaction be convinced that england may justly boast the honor of producing the greatest dramatic poet in the world  to strengthen and justify the general admiration of this astonishing genius it has been thought proper to subjoin to the ode some undeniable testimonies both in prose and verse of his unequalled original talents these are extracted from the works of ben jonson milton dryden pope thomson johnson warton seward akenside gray mason churchill jago whitehead addison row voltaire theobald hanmer lyttelton warburton dodd steevens capel hurd murphy colman walpole and mrs montague in the present collection they are omitted   if it shall be found that speaking that part of the ode which has usually been conveyed in recitative produces a better effect the author flatters himself he may lay claim to some little merit on that account as to the ode itself he presents it to the public as an object of their goodnature  to his friends as an exercise of their partiality  to his enemies as a lucky opportunity of venting their wit humor criticism spleen or whatever else they please should they think it worthy of their notice  ode to what blessed genius of the isle shall gratitude her tribute pay decree the festive day erect the statue and devote the pile do not your sympathetic hearts accord to own the bosoms lord it is he it is he  that demigod who avons flowery margin trod while sportive fancy round him flew where nature led him by the hand instructed him in all she knew and gave him absolute command it is he it is he  the god of our idolatry to him the song the edifice we raise he merits all our wonder all our praise yet ere impatient joy break forth in sounds that lift the soul from earth and to our spellbound minds impart some faint idea of his magic art let awful silence still the air from the dark cloud the hidden light bursts tenfold bright prepare prepare prepare now swell at once the choral song roll the full tide of harmony along let rapture sweep the trembling strings and fame expanding all her wings with all her trumpettongues proclaim the loved revered immortal name shakespeare shakespeare shakespeare let the enchanting found from avons shores rebound through the air let it bear the precious freight the envious nations round chorus swell the choral song roll the tide of harmony along let rapture sweep the strings fame expand her wings with her trumpettongues proclaim the loved revered immortal name shakespeare shakespeare shakespeare air i sweetest bard that ever sung natures glory fancys child never sure did witching tongue warble forth such woodnotes wild ii come each muse and sister grace loves and pleasures hither come well you know this happy place avons banks were once your home iii bring the laurel bring the flowers songs of triumph to him raise he united all your powers all uniting sing his praise though philips famed unconquered son had every bloodstained laurel won he sighed  that his creative word like that which rules the skies could not bid other nations rise to glut his yet unsated sword but when our shakespeares matchless pen like alexanders sword had done with men he heaved no sigh he made no moan not limited to human kind he fired his wonderteeming mind raised other worlds and beings of his own air when nature smiling hailed his birth to him unbounded power was given the whirlwinds wing to sweep the sky  the frenzyrowling eye to glance from heaven to earth from earth to heaven o from his muse of fire could but one spark be caught then might these humble strains aspire to tell the wonders he has wrought to tell  how fitting on his magic throne unaided and alone in dreadful state the subject passions round him wait who though unchaind and raging there he checks inflames or turns their mad career with that superior skill which winds the fiery steed at will he gives the awful word  and they all foaming trembling own him for their lord with these his slaves he can control or charm the soul so realizd are all his golden dreams of terror pity love and grief though conscious that the vision only seems the woestruck mind finds no relief ingratitude would drop the tear coldblooded age take fire to see the thankless children of old lear spurn at their king and fire with his our reason too grows wild what nature had disjoined the poets power combined madness and age ingratitude and child ye guilty lawless tribe escaped from punishment by art or bribe at shakespeares bar appear no bribing shuffling there  his genius like a rushing flood cannot be withstood out bursts the penitential tear the look appalled the crime reveals the marblehearted monster feels whose hand is stained with blood semichorus when law is weak and justice fails the poet holds the sword and scales air though crimes from death and torture fly the swifter muse their flight pursues guilty mortals more than die they live indeed but live to feel the scourge and wheel  on the torture of the mind they lie should harrassd nature sink to rest the poet wakes the scorpion in the breast guilty mortals more than die when our magician more inspired by charms and spells and incantations fired exerts his most tremendous power the thunder growls the heavens lower and to his darkened throne repair the demons of the deep and spirits of the air but soon these horrors pass away through storms and night breaks forth the day he smiles  they vanish into air the buskined warriors disappear mute the trumpets mute the drums the scene is changed  thalia comes leading the nymph euphrosyne goddess of joy and liberty she and her sisters hand in hand linked to a numerous frolic band with roses and with myrtle crowned over the green velvet lightly bound circling the monarch of the enchanted land air i wild frantic with pleasure they trip it in measure to bring him their treasure the treasure of joy ii how gay is the measure how sweet is the pleasure how great is the treasure the treasure of joy iii like roses fresh blowing their dimpledcheeks glowing his mind is overflowing a treasure of joy iv his rapture perceiving they smile while they are giving he smiles at receiving a treasure of joy with kindling cheeks and sparkling eyes surrounded thus the bard in transport dies the little loves like bees clustring and climbing up his knees his brows with roses bind while fancy wit and humor spread their wings and hover round his head impregnating his mind which teeming soon as soon brought forth not a tiny spurious birth but out a mountain came a mountain of delight laughter roared out to see the sight and falstaff was his name with sword and shield he puffing strides the joyous revelrout receive him with a shout and modest nature holds her sides no single power the deed had done but great and small wit fancy humor whim and jest the huge misshapen heap impressed and lo  sir john a compound of

is genenerally imagined wrote the character of jack spatter pamela spoken by mr garrick as in the airy regions of romance the adventurous knight sets out with shield and lance strait his disinterested valor flies to helpless damsels and to beautys cries this only motive rising in his breast the godlike plea  of innocence distressed thus dares our author errant of tonight in virtues aid romantically fight sacred to her the champion pen he draws enough rewarded  to support her cause tonight his honest labor means to prove a lowborn virtue worth a great mans love an honest pride where conscious honor glows an artless innocence  whence truth still flows a sense proceeding but from natures light for little knowledge serves us to be right a merit greatly poor that far outshines the glare of titles or the wealth of mines such steadfast honesty should find success over the abandoned authors of distress over those who glory to betray a maid who welcome guilt and make deceit a trade yet some there are less liable to blame who only want reflection to reclaim who bend unthinking to the syrens voice the reprobates of custom not of choice who deaf to precept plead example still and think the mode indemnifies the ill to such our author offers this address not certain nor despairing of success amongst this cast of men he hopes to find some converts  for the honor of mankind on minds like these his morals may prevail and who escaped a sermon feel this tale  iv epilogue to the lying valet farce by mr garrick first acted in goodmans fields nov       spoken by mr garrick that i am a lying rogue you all agree and yet look round the world and you will see how many more my betters lie as fast as me against this vice we all are ever railing and yet so tempting is it so prevailing you will find but few without this useful failing lady or abigail my lord or will the lie goes round and the balls never still my lies were harmless told to show my parts and not like those when tongues belie their hearts in all professions you will find this flaw and in the greatest too in physic and in law the gouty sergeant cries with formal pause  your plea is good my friend dont starve the cause but when my lord decrees for the other side your costs of suit convince you  that he lyd a doctor comes with formal wig and face first feels your pulse then thinks and knows your case  your fevers slight not dangerous i assure you  keep warm and repetatur baustus sir will cure you around the bed next day his friends are crying the patient dies the doctors paid for lying the poet willing to secure the pit gives out his play has humor taste and wit the cause comes on and while the judges try each groan and catcall gives the bard the lie now let us ask pray what the ladies do they too will fib a little enter nous  lord says the prude her face behind her fan  how can our sex have any joy in man  as for my part the best could never deceive me  and were the race extinct twould never grieve me  their sight is odious but their touch  o gad  the thought of that is enough to drive one mad thus rails at man the squeamish lady dainty yet weds at fiftyfive a rake of twenty in short a beaus intrigues a lovers sighs the courtiers promise the rich widows cries and patriots zeal are seldom more than lies sometimes you will see a man belie his nation nor to his country show the least relation for instance now  a cleanly dutchman or a frenchman grave a sober german or a spaniard brave an englishman a coward or a slave mine though a fibbing was an honest art i served my master played a faithful part rank me not therefore amongst the lying crew for though my tongue was false my heart was true  v epilogue to regulus a tragedy by mr havard acted first time february      at drury lane theater  spoken by mrs woffington if one could credit what these poets tell us these greeks and romans were surprising fellows but when compared with heroes nowadays who can believe one word our author says tonight famed regulus appeared before ye brimfull of honor and his countrys glory so fraught with virtue and with patriot zeal he laid down life to serve the public weal bless me was ever man so wildly frantic we have no patriots now are so romantic we have no state quixotes as they had of yore our patriots huff it is true and rant and roar and talk of this and that  but nothing more their ladies too were formed with strange ingredients they loved their husbands and were all obedience and though their mates for many years would roam the constant doves would stay till they come home martia if what they say can gain belief for loss of husband almost died with grief and what is stranger still they all agree that regulus was turned of sixtythree would any modern lady break her heart because an aged spouse resolves to part would she to thwart his will be so uncivil o no  the man might go to carthage  or the devil what mighty stuff composed these sons of freedom the classicks say i am told by those that read em that they were mortals of such wondrous merit that even when old they fought and lived with spirit romans at sixtythree as i am alive were better men than ours at thirtyfive in short if all that is said and wrote be true and they when old such mighty feats could do o lord they played the devil sure at twentytwo thus far with trifling jests to please the age and to preserve the custom of the stage  and now let serious nobler thoughts impart the warmest wishes to each english heart may every matron marcias truth approve and every maid like constant clelia love may every decius find a faithful friend and every corvus meet the villains end may every briton hold his country dear and truth not party every action steer may reguluss conduct point the way and no false glitter lead our youths astray may every virtue be transplanted home and britain boast the worth of ancient rome  vi epilogue to the astrologer a comedy by mr ralph acted at drury lane april      in an advertisement prefixed to this play the author complains that ten years had elapsed before it could obtain the favor of a representation that he was not unknown to the great nor destitute of private friends and having devoted the most serious of his studies to the service of the public he had some reason to expect the public favor yet that the receipts of the house upon the first night were but twentyone pounds and when the manager risqued a second to give the author a chance for a benefit he was obliged to shut up his doors for want of an audience biog dramatica vol ii p     spoken by mrs woffington well what is the sentence what is our authors fate i fear his conjring scheme is out of date for look but round amongst men of all conditions you will find no conjrers now but politicians consulting stars is now quite out of fashion our wiser dames consult their inclination and as a sure defense against all ills are led by those unerring guides  their wills no planets aspect now controuls your birth we are the stars alone preside on earth i told our author so  twas true he swore the man is married  and could say no more  long have our senseless playwrights void of spirit from molieres humor pilferd all their merit our author scorned in foreign climes to roam he thought some merit might be found at home upon the patriot principle he stood and though his head may fail his heart is good but leaving him to mourn for scribbling crimes i will take his hint and warn the present times a modish frenzy so corrupts the town that naught but alamode de france goes down we all submit to this fantastic yoke like them we dress we dance we eat we joke from top to toe they change us at their will all but our hearts  and those are british still rouse rouse for shame this modish pest oppose nor meanly ape your vain insulting foes to kill this fatal weed for ever toil nor let it ever take root in british soil let low inglorious arts to france belong the close deceit false heart and double tongue let us by noble generous arts be known by valor wit and honesty our own produce your worthies britain and be taught that none like shakespeare writ or marlbrough fought by these to former heights your glories raise nor yield to france the laurels or the bays  vii prologue to the suspicious husband a comedy by dr benjamin hoadley acted first time at covent garden theater feb       spoken by mr ryan while other culprits brave it to the last nor beg for mercy till the judgments past poets alone as conscious of their crimes open their trials with imploring rhymes thus crammed with flattery and low submission each trite dull prologue is the bards petition a stale device to calm the criticks fury and bribe at once the judges and the jury but what avail such poor repeated arts the whimpring scribbler never can touch your hearts nor ought an illtimed pity to take place  fast as they rise destroy the increasing race the vermin else will run the nation over  by saving one you breed a million more though disappointed authors rail and rage at fancied parties and a senseless age yet still has justice triumphed on the stage thus speaks and thinks the author of today and saying this has little more to say he asks no friend his partial zeal to show nor fears the groundless censures of a foe he knows no friendship can protect the fool nor will an audience be a partys tool it is inconsistent with a freeborn sprit to side with folly or to injure merit by your decision he must fall or stand nor though he feels the lash will blame the hand  viii epilogue to the same play spoken by mrs pritchard though the young smarts i see begin to sneer and the old sinners cast a wicked leer be not alarmed ye fair  you have naught to fear no wanton hint no loose ambiguous sense shall flatter vicious taste at your expense leaving for once those shameless arts in vogue we give a fable for the epilogue an ass there was our author bid me say who needs must write  he did  and wrote a play the parts were cast to various beasts and fowl their stage a barn  the manager an owl the house was crammed at fix with friends and foes rakes wits and critics citizens and beaux these characters appeared in different shapes of tigers foxes horses bulls and apes with others too of lower rank and station  a perfect abstract of the brute creation each as he felt marked out the authors faults and thus the connoisseurs expressed their thoughts the critickcurs first snarld  the rules are broke time place and action sacrificed to joke the goats cried out twas formal dull and chaste  not writ for beasts of gallantry and taste the hornedcattle were in piteous taking at fornication rapes and cuckoldmaking the tigers swore he wanted fire and passion the apes condemned  because it was the fashion the generous steeds allow him proper merit here marked his faults and there approved his spirit while brother bards brayed forth with usual spleen and as they heard exploded every scene when reynards thoughts were asked the shrugging sage famed for hypocrisy and worn with age condemned the shameless license of the stage at which the monkey skippd from box to box and whispered round the judgment of the fox abused the moderns talked of rome and greece bilkd every boxkeeper and damned the piece now every fable has a moral to it be churchman statesman any thing  but poet in law or physic quack in what you will cant and grimace conceal the want of skill secure in these his gravity may pass  but here no artifice can hide the ass  ix epilogue this epilogue in a late collection has been erroneously ascribed to dr johnson who wrote only the prologue on this occasion  spoken by mrs woffington at the opening of drury lane theater      sweet doings truly we are finely fobbd and at one stroke of all our pleasures robbed no beaux behind the scenes it is innovation under the specious name of reformation public complaint forsooth is made a puff sense order decency and such like stuff but arguments like these are mere pretense the beaux it is known never give the least offense are men of chastest conduct and amazing sense each actress now a lockdup nun must be and priestly managers must keep the key i know their selfish reasons though they tell us while smarts and wits and other pretty fellows murmur their passions to our fluttering hearts the stage stands still and we neglect our parts but how mistaken in this silly notion we hear em talk without the least emotion just as our tea we sip each tender strain too weak to warm the heart or reach the brain if harmless why are we debarred our rights damsels distressed have ever found their knights shall we the dulcineas of the stage in vain ask succor in this fighting age will you choice spirits who direct the town suffer such impositions to go down can it be thought this law will ever pass while doors are only wood and windows glass besides our playhouse guards are pamve men strike without fear they must not strike again even fribble here to draw his sword may venture may curse the creters beat his man and enter  the jealous moor not roars in louder strains than all our nymphs for loss of absent swains  we had been happy though the house had failed  masters and all had not this scheme prevailed  for ever now farewell the plumed beaux  who make ambition  to consist in clothes  farewell conquetry and all greenroom joys  earthrilling whispers a famous toyman in pall mall  deards deluding toys  soulmelting flattery which even prudes can move  sighs  tears  and all the circumstance of love  farewell   but oh ye dreadful critics whose rude throats  can make both playrs and masters change their notes  it is in your power  you any lengths will run  help us or else  our occupations gone  x epilogue to the foundling a comedy by mr moore acted at drury lane february       spoken by mrs cibber i know you all expect from seeing me an epilogue of strictest purity some formal lecture spoke with prudish face to show our present joking giggling race true joy consists in  gravity and grace but why am i for ever made the tool of every squeamish moralizing fool condemned to sorrow all my life must i never make you laugh because i make you cry madam say they your face denotes your heart it is yours to melt us in the mournful part so from the looks our hearts they prudish deem alas poor souls  we are not what we seem though prudence often our inclination smothers we grave ones love a joke  as well as others from such dull stuff what profit can you reap you cry  it is very fine  yawns and fall asleep appy that bard blessed with uncommon art whose wit can cheer and not corrupt the heart happy that playr whose skill can chase the spleen and leave no worse inhabitant within amongst friends our author is a modest man but wicked wits will cavil at his plan damn it says one this stuff will never pass the girl wants nature and the rakes an ass had i like belmont heard a damsels cries i would have pinkd her keeper seized the prize whipped to a coach not valued tears a fardin but drove away like smoke  to covent garden there to some house convenient would have carried her and then  dear soul  the devil should have married her but this our author thought too hard upon her besides his spark forsooth must have some honor mr moore was the author of the fables for the female sex the fools a fabulist  and deals in fiction or he had given him vice  without restriction of fable all his characters partake sir charles is virtuous  and for virtues sake nor vain nor blustering is the soldier writ his rake has conscience modesty and wit the ladies too  how oddly they appear his prude is chaste and his coquet sincere in short so strange a group never trod the stage at once to please and satirize the age for you ye fair his muse has chiefly sung it is you have touched his heart and tuned his tongue the sexs champion let the sex defend a soothing poet is a charming friend your favors here bestowed will meet reward so as you love dear flattery  save your bard  xi occasional prologue spoken by mr garrick at the opening of drury lane theater   sept    0 as heroes states and kingdoms rise and sall so with the mighty to compare the small through interest whim or if you please through fate we feel commotions in our mimic state the sock and buskin fly from stage to stage a years alliance is with us  an age and where is the wonder all surprise must cease when we reflect how interest or caprice makes real kings break articles of peace strengthened by new allies our foes prepare cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war to shake our souls the in which papers was this paragraph  we hear that mr quin mrs cibber mr barry mr macklin and mrs woffington are engaged at covent garden theater for the ensuing season  on the part of drury lane theater it was notified that two celebrated actors from dublin were engaged to perform there also miss bellamy and a new actress signor fausan the comic dancer and his wife and a gentleman to sing who has not been on any stage papers of the day drew forth the adverse power in dread array a power might strike the boldest with dismay yet fearless still we take the field with spirit armed capape in selfsufficient merit our ladies too with souls and tongues untamed fire up like britons when the battles named each female heart pants for the glorious strife from hamlets mrs pritchard mother to the coblers wife mrs clive  some few there are whom paltry passions guide desert each day and sly from side to side others like swiss love fighting as their trade for beat or beating  they must all be paid sacred to shakespeare was this spot designed to pierce the heart and humanize the mind but if an empty house the actors curse shows us our lears and hamlets lose their force unwilling we must change the nobler scene and in our turn present you harlequin quit poets and set carpenters to work show gaudy scenes or mount the vaulting turk for though we actors one and all agree boldly to struggle for our  vanity if want comes on importance must retreat our first great ruling passion is  to eat to keep the field all methods well pursue the conflict glorious for we fight for you and should we fail to gain the wished applause at least we are vanquished in a noble cause  xii an occasional epilogue spoken by mrs clive at drury lane theater october    0 enters hastily as if speaking to one who would oppose her i will do it by heaven i will  pray get you gone what all these janglings and i not make one was ever woman offered so much wrong these creatures here would have me hold my tongue i am so provoked  i hope you will excuse me i must be heard  and beg you will not refuse me while our mock heroes not so wise as rash with indignation hold the vengeful lash and at each other throw alternate squibs composed of little wit  and some few fibs i catherine clive come here to attack em all and aim alike at little mr garrick  and at tall mr barry  but first ere with the buskin chiefs i brave it a story is at hand and you shall have it once on a time two boys were throwing dirt a gentle youth was one and one was somewhat pert each to his master with his tale retreated who gravely heard their different parts repeated how tom was rude and jack poor lad illtreated the master paused  to be unjust was loath called for a rod and fairly whipped them both in the same masters place lo here i stand and for each culprit hold the lash in hand first for our own  oh it is a pretty youth but out of fifty lies i will sift some truth it is true he is of a choleric disposition and fiery parts make up his composition how have i seen him rave when things miscarried indeed he is grown much tamer since he married if he succeeds what joys his fancy strike and then he gets  to which he is no dislike faults he has many  but i know no crimes yes he has one  he contradicts sometimes and when he falls into his frantic fit he blusters so he makes even me submit so much for him  the other youth comes next who shows by what he says poor soul he is vexed he tells you tales how cruelly this treats us to make you think the little monster beats us would i have whind in melancholy phrase a line in the prologue spoken at covent garden by mr barry how bouncing bajazet retreats from bays i who am woman would have stood the fray at least not snivelld thus and run away should any manager lift arm at me i have a tyrant arm as well as he  in fact there has some little bouncing been but who the bouncer was enquire within no matter who i now proclaim a peace and hope henceforth hostilities will cease no more shall either rack his brains to tease ye but let the contest be  who most shall please ye  xiii epilogue to gil blas a comedy by mr moore acted at drury lane february       spoken by mrs pritchard as the success of authors is uncertain till all is over and down drops the curtain poets are puzzled in our dangerous times how to address you in their afterrhymes if they implore and beg with abject mind their meaness rather makes you sick than kind and if they bounce and huff it to the town then you are up  and take the bullies down of beaux and politics and such like stuff and even of tawdry too you have had enough  on all degrees from courtier to the cit such stale dull jokes have been so often writ that nothing can be new  but decency and wit thus far our bard  the rest is mine to say i am his friend so will attack his play how could his thoughtless head with any truth if spanish dons are like our english youth make his wild rake so sink from upper life to quit his mistress for a lawful wife the author might have married him  but then he should have had his mistress back again this is the scheme our english dons pursue though ones too much there is taste in having two as for the lady i dislike her plan with you i am sure she had not passed for man had she with our young bloods contrived this freak she had been blown and ruined in a week and if of virtue they could not have tricked her they would damned her for a fool  perhaps have kicked her but jest apart  for all our bard has wrote our most alluring baits the petticoat before that magic shrine the proudest fall it is that enchanting circle draws in all let fools say what they will

auctionhunting by his jokes should this odd doctrine spread throughout the land before you buy be sure to understand oh think on us what various ills will flow when great ones only purchase  what they know why laugh at taste it is a harmless fashion and quite subdues each detrimental passion the fair ones hearts will never incline to man while thus they rage for  china and japan the virtuoso too and connoisseur are ever decent delicate and pure the smallest hair their looser thoughts might hold just warm when single  and when married cold their blood at sight of beauty gently flows their venus must be old and want a nose no amorous passion with deep knowledge thrives it is the complaint indeed of all our wives it is said virtu to such a height is grown all artists are encouraged  but our own be not deceived i here declare on oath i never yet sold goods of foreign growth never sent commissions out to greece or rome my best antiquities are made at home i have romans greeks italians

worse for going there though she has dealt before in sportive song this is her first stageflight and twould be wrong nay poaching too to kill your bards too young poets like foxes make best sport when

to die  to sleep  no more the ladies too were carpd at and their dress he wants em all ruffd up like good queen bess they are forsooth too much exposed and free were more exposed no ill effects i see for more or less it is all the same to me poor gaming too was mauled among the rest that precious cordial to a highlife breast when thoughts arise i always game or drink an english gentleman should never think  the reasons plain which every soul might hit on  what trims a frenchman oversets a briton in us reflection breeds a sober sadness which always ends in politics or madness i therefore now

steal forth incog to hear what critics croak of me  king log three nights ago i heard a tete a tete which sixd at once our english operas sat one was a youth born here but flush from rome the other born abroad but here his home and first the english foreigner began who thus addressed the foreign englishman an english opera it is not to be borne i both my country and their music scorn oh damn their ally croakers and their early horn signor si  bat sons  wors recitativo il tutto e bestiale e cativo this said i made my exit full of terrors and now ask mercy for the following errors excuse us first for foolishly supposing it was composed by mr smith your countryman could please you in composing an opra too  played by an english band wrote in a language which you understand  i dare not say who wrote it  i could tell ye to soften matters  signor shakespearelli this awkward drama i confess the offense is guilty too of poetry and sense and then the price we take  you will all abuse it so low so unlike opras  but excuse it well mend that fault whenever you shall choose it our last mischance and worse than all the rest which turns the whole performance to a jest our singers are all well and all will do their best but why should this rash fool this englishman attempt an opra  it is the strangest plan struck with the wonders of his masters art mr smith was a pupil of handell and afterward his successor in the management of the oratorios  whose sacred dramas shake and melt the heart whose heavenborn strains the coldest breast inspire whose chorusthunder sets the soul on fire inflamed astonished at those magic airs when sampson groans and frantic saul despairs the pupil wrote  his work is now before ye and waits your stamp of infamy or glory yet ere his errors and his faults are known he says those faults those errors are his own if through the clouds appear some glimmering rays they are sparks he caught from his great masters blaze  xxiii this prologue was written

wormwood the critic mr yates wormwood and heartly worm i say it is a shame mr heartly and i am amazed that you let your goodnature talk thus against the conviction of your understanding   heart you will not let me talk sir if you would but have patience and hear reason a little   worm i wish i could sir but you put me out of all patience by having no reason to give me i say that this frittering and sol faing our best poets is a damned thing i have yet heard no reason to justify it and i have no patience when i think of it   heart i see you have not    worm what are we to be quivered and quavered out of our senses give me shakespeare in all his force vigor and spirit what would you make an eunuch of him no shakesporellis for my money   heart nay but dear sir hear me in my turn or the truth for which we are or ought to be so warmly fighting will slip through our fingers   worm will you hold it when you have it i say mr heartly while you let your goodnature    heart and i say mr wormwood while you are to be influenced and blown up by paragraphs in newspapers and insinuations in coffeehouses we can never come to a fair debate they who write upon all subjects without understanding any or will talk about music without ears or taste for it are but very indifferent judges in our dispute   worm well come on mr solfa then  let you and i fight it out or to speak in the musical phrase let us have a duette together i will clear up my pipes and have at you  hem hem    heart with all my heart though i am afraid you will make it a solo for you have not yet suffered the second part to come in   worm ho play away sir  i will be dumb    heart let us calmly consider this complaint of yours if it is well founded i will submit with pleasure if not you will   worm not submit with pleasure i assure you i never do   heart you will at least have this satisfaction that the sentence which will be given whether for or against you will be as indisputable as it will be just   worm i dont know what you mean nothings indisputable that i please to contradict and nothings just that i please to call in question   heart look round upon the court and if you can reasonably except against any one of the jury i will give up the cause before trial   worm o ho what you are bribing the court beforehand with your flattery are you   heart there you are out again our countrymen in a body are no more to be flattered than bullyd which i hope their enemies who can do both will be convinced of before they have done with them but i wander from the question to the point sir what are your objections to this nights entertainment   worm i hate an opera   heart i dislike tyewigs but should i throw yours into the fire because i choose to wear a bag   worm woe be to your bag if you did   heart you hate music perhaps   worm damnably and dancing too   heart but why pray   worm they pervert nature legs are made for walking tongues for speaking and therefore capering and quavering are unnatural and abominable   heart you like shakespeare   worm like him adore him worship him there is no capering and quavering in his works   heart have a care   the man that has no music in himself  nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds  is fit for treason stratagems and spoils  the motions of his spirit are dull as night  and his affections dark as erebus  let no such man be trusted  worm fit for treason dull as night not to be trusted  so you have proved me both a fool and a rebel  dont provoke me mr heartly shakespeare never wrote such stuff as that it is foisted in by some fiddler or other   heart you pay the fiddlers as you call them a very great compliment   worm did i i am sorry for it i did not mean it were i to pay em  crabsticks the word   heart for shame mr wormwood let me ask you a question would you choose that your country should be excelled in any thing by your neighbors   worm in manufactures  no  from the casting of cannon to the making of pins from the weaving of velvets to the making of hopsacks but your capering and quavering only spoil us and make us the jests who should be the terrors of europe   heart but english music mr wormwood    worm english music or any music enervates the body weakens the mind and lessens the courage   heart quite the contrary   worm prove that and i will learn the gamut immediately nay bespeak me a pair of pumps and i will make one at the dancing academy for grown gentlemen   heart let us suppose an invasion   worm ha ha ha an invasion  music and an invasion they are well coupled truly   heart patience sir  i say let us suppose ten thousand french landed   worm i had rather suppose em at the bottom of the sea   heart so had i  but that ten thousand are upon the coast   worm the devil they are what then   heart why then i say let but britons strike home or god save the king be sounded in the ears of five thousand brave englishmen with a protestant prince at the head of em and they will drive every monsieur into the sea and make em food for sprats and mackarel   worm huzza and so they will  egad youre right i will say no more britons strike home you have warmed me and pleased me nay you have converted me i will get a place in the house and be as hearty as the best of em for the music of old england sprats and mackarel ha ha ha that is good excellent i thank you for it music for ever britons strike home god save the king   heart the last thing i have to say will touch you as nearly mr wormwood    worm you have touched me enough already say no more i am satisfied i shall never forget sprats and mackarel   heart we may boast sincerely boast of many excellent english composers and would not you permit your countrymen to have the same encouragement as foreigners   worm encouragement why i will encourage them myself man   heart where can they show their talents unless upon the english stages and if the managers of them will not give up a few nights to encourage english music our musical countrymen mr wormwood would be of the number of those persons of merit who are undeservedly neglected in this kingdom   worm but they shall not i will support em i will never more hearken to your clubspeeches and your dissertations and newspaper essays i see my error but i will make amends let us meet after it is over and take a bottle to sprats and mackarel eh master heartly at the shakespeare i will be with you britons strike home  exit singing heart ha ha ha mr wormwood is now as much too violent in his zeal as he was before in his prejudice we expect not ladies and gentlemen that this nights performance should meet with success merely because it is english you would be as incapable of conceiving as we of urging such false and contracted notions yet on the other hand let not our musical brethren be cast off because fashion caprice or manners too refined may have given you prejudices against them  music is the younger sister of poetry and can boast her charms and accomplishments suffer not the younger then to be turned out of doors while the elder is so warmly and deservedly cherished  if worthy you will protect her though distressed it is the known maxim of a british breast those to befriend the most who are most oppressed  xxvii epilogue to athelstan a tragedy by dr brown acted at drury lane feb       spoken by mrs cibber to speak ten words again i have fetched my breath the tongue of woman struggles hard with death ten words will that suffice ten words  no more we always give a thousand to the score what can provoke these wits their time to waste to please that fickle fleeting thing called taste it mocks all search for substance has it none like hamlets ghost  it is here  it is there  it is gone how very few about the stage agree as men with different eyes a beauty see so judge they of that stately dame  queen tragedy the greekread critic as his mistress holds her and having little love for trifles scolds her excuses want of spirit beauty grace but never forgives her failing time and place how do our sex of taste and judgment vary miss bell adores what is loathed by lady mary the first in tenderness a very dove melts like the feathered snow at juliets love then sighing turns to romeo by her side  can you believe that men for love have died her ladyship who vaults the coursers back leaps the barred gate and calls you tom and jack detests these whinings like a true virago she is all for daggers blood blood blood iago a third whose heart defies all perturbations yet dies for triumphs funerals coronations never asks which tragedies succeed or fail but whose procession has the longest tail the youths to whom france gives a new belief who look with horror on a rump of beef on shakespeares plays with shruggdup shoulders stare these plays they are bloody murders o barbare and yet the man has merit  enter nous he would been damned clever had he read bossu shakespeare read french roars out a surly cit when shakespeare wrote our valor matched our wit had britons then been fops queen bess had hanged em those days they never read the french  they banged em if taste evaporates by too high breeding and eke is overlaid by too deep reading left then in search of this you lose your feeling and barter native sense in foreign dealing be this neglected truth to britons known no tastes no modes become you but your own  xxviii prologue to lilliput a farce by mr garrick acted at drury lane december       spoken by mr woodward behold a conjuror  that is something new  for as times go my brethren are

register of fashions of follies frailties favorite passions or is it designed to make appear how happy good and wise you were in this same memorable year sure with our author wit was scarce to crowd so many virtues in a farce perhaps it is made to make you stare like cloths hung out at country fair on which strange monsters glare and grin to draw the gaping bumpkins in though it is the genius of the age to catch the eye with title page yet here we dare not so abuse ye  we have some monsters to amuse ye ye slaves to fashion dupes of chance whom fortune leads her fickle dance who as the dice shall smile or frown are rich and poor and up and down whose minds eternal vigils keep who like macbeth have murdered sleep each modish vice this night shall rise like banquos ghost before your eyes

half an eye peruse us embrace us eat our meat and then  abuse us when this same play was writ that is now before ye the english stage had reached its point of glory no paltry thefts disgraced this authors pen he painted english manners englishmen and formed his taste on shakespeare and old ben then were french fashions farces quite unknown our wits wrote well and all they writ their own these were the times when no infatuation no vicious modes no zeal for imitation had changed deformed and sunk the british nation should you be ever from yourselves estranged the cock will crow to see the lion changed to boast our liberty is weak and vain while tyrant vices in our bosoms reign not liberty alone a nation saves corrupted freemen are the worst of slaves let prussias sons each english breast inflame o be our spirit as our cause the same and as our hearts with one religion glow let us with all their ardour drive the foe as heaven had raised our arm as heaven had given the blow would you rekindle all your ancient fires extinguish first your modern vain desires still it is yours your glories to retrieve lop but the branches and the tree shall live with these erect a pile for sacrifice and in the midst  throw all your cards and dice then fire the heap and as it sinks to earth the british genius shall have second birth shall phoenixlike rise perfect from the flame spring
