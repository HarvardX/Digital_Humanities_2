a dissertation on the gout and all chronic diseases  price one shilling and sixpence  a dissertation on the gout and all chronic diseases jointly considered as proceeding from the same causes what those causes are and a rational and natural method of cure proposed  addressed to all invalids  by william cadogan fellow of the college of physicians  the second edition  quod petis in te est london printed for j dodsley in pall mall mdcclxxi  preface to enjoy good health is better than to command the world says a celebrated practical philosopher st evremond  who understood the use and value of life and health better than most men for in exile with a small income and no very good constitution he cultivated an uncommon length of days into a rational series of pleasures and what is much more an uninterrupted course of happiness but as far as i can find he was almost the only man that did so the generality of men seem to me not to bestow a thought upon either till it be too late to reap the benefit of their conviction so that health like time becomes valuable only when it is lost and we can no longer think of it but with retrospect and regret  that men in good health the young and gay in their career should be negligent of it or abuse it refusing to stop and listen to or take warning from others is no great wonder but it is very surprising that mankind in general should be mistaken and misled for ever in the same perpetual round of fruitless attempts to repair and establish it not the ignorant vulgar only but the sensible the judicious men of parts and knowledge in other things in this case equally blind should pursue with the same vain hope after repeated disappointments the thousand and ten thousand idle arts and tricks of medication and quackery never once lifting up their eyes to nature or consulting her book open as it lies for the perusal conviction and benefit of all  some industrious men fancying that whatever is valuable must lie deep have with the greatest alacrity in sinking plunged into the immense abyss of ancient greek roman and arabic learning in hopes to find good precepts of health and sure remedy for disease but after all their pioneering into endless heaps of rubbish what have they found at last but this that some of the ancients were very ingenious in guessing wrong for guess was all they did they never studied nature at all and therefore knew nothing of her but either blindly followed or combated each others opinions school against school and sect against sect waged equal and endless war in the art of physic it was impossible for them to know much for before our immortal harveys discovery of the circulation there could be no physiology at all nor any knowledge either of the internal structure or action of any one part of the body before the justly celebrated asellius and pequet there could be no idea of nourishment nor was it known how our food passed into the blood whether it went there or not or what became of it but now since these lights have shone in upon us all the ancient conjectures reasonings and systems must vanish like morning clouds before the sun besides all this there are some of our diseases which the ancients had not nor have we all theirs some few and very few useful discoveries they made in medicine which have descended to us and with some late tricks in chemistry are the chief foundation of modern quackery thus have men of deep learning if the knowledge of ancient errors can be called so sunk far out of sight of truth which in things of general use and necessity particularly the health of mankind lies most commonly upon the surface  it has been of great disservice as well as discredit to the art of physic and every fair practiser of it that mens expectations have been raised by the ignorant and presuming or the dishonest and artful to hope for too much from it more than it ever did or can do respite and relief may be had in most chronic cases remedy i fear but in very few if it be expected from art alone but a skilful and honest physician unless he be sent for too late and dismissed too soon which is generally the case will employ those intervals of relief to introduce the powers of life and nature to act for themselves and insensibly withdrawing all his medicines and watching carefully over his patients whole conduct leave him confirmed from conviction of their necessity in such good and salutary habits as cannot fall to establish his health for life  possibly if men were better informed of the real causes of their diseases they might be less unreasonable in their demands and learn to be contented with present relief submitting with patience to that plan of life which alone can lead them to and preserve them in permanent health with this view of engaging mens attention to their own happiness and undeceiving them in their vain and groundless hopes of remedy and diverting them from the delusions of art to the realities of nature i have ventured to publish the following dissertation which i must beg the reader to consider as what it really is a hasty extract of a much larger work intended to take in the whole circle of chronic diseases here comprehended only in their representative the gout if what i have said may seem to want farther illustration or more demonstrative proof he will look upon it only as a sketch to furnish hints for his own thoughts and reflections either to improve mine or reject them entirely as may seem good unto him if he thinks from what i have said here or in the brochure itself that i mean to impeach the practice of physic in general i say that it is not my intention i would decry all quacks from aesculapius to the present either as ignorant fools or selfconvicted impostors advertising daily lies whether mounted on stages or riding in chariots but the art of physic fairly and honestly practiced i honor as the first of professions comprehending the most useful the most extensive and universal knowledge of nature i think a real physician the most liberal of characters upon earth by which i do not mean every doctor that goes about taking guineas but him who will neither flatter the great nor deceive the ignorant and who would prefer the satisfaction of making one invalid a healthy man to the wealth of radcliff or the vogue of ward but there is an evil spirit of quackery gone forth that has possessed all orders of men among us i would lay it if i could together with every demon of superstition and error and restore the world to truth and nature  a dissertation on the gout etc however common it may be for men that suffer to complain of the evils of life as the unavoidable lot of humanity would they stop but for a moment to consider them in the light of reason and philosophy they would find little or no foundation for them in nature but that every man was the real author of all of most of his own miseries whatever doubts may be entertained of moral evils the natural for the most part such as bodily infirmity sickness and pain all that class of complaints which the learned call chronic diseases we most undoubtedly bring upon ourselves by our own indulgences excesses or mistaken habits of life or by suffering our illconducted passions to lead us astray or disturb our peace of mind whatever notions men have been taught or have received of other causes such as accidental colds or particularities of constitution this or that thing disagreeing or surfeiting etc these are too trifling to produce diseases that commonly last for life there must be something more substantial something more constant and permanent in our daily habits to produce such inveterate evils though if you read authors or consult practitioners what do you find but that you have taken cold though you know not how or that your complaints are gouty rheumatic bilious nervous etc words that satisfy though they give no kind of idea and seem to have gained credit and assent only by the politeness of physicians who while they are taking their patients money are too well bred to tell them disagreeable truths and that it is by their own faults they are ill to enquire a little further into this matter may be well worth our trouble the task seems to have been left for me and i will perform it most sincerely  i have long had it in my mind to write upon chronic diseases in general in the hope of giving mankind what most assuredly they have never yet had a few rational ideas about them thinking that if the true original causes of them were fully and fairly set forth men could not be so capitally mistaken to impute them as they do to the false and imaginary and therefore apply false and imaginary remedies nor think that the general health of mankind were to be overset by every trifle and the recovery of it lay hid in a few drops or powders of any kind did they better understand the nature of chronic diseases in general and whence they proceed they could not be so unreasonable to think they might live as they list with impunity expecting repeated remedy from art or did they know any thing of the nature of medicine they would find that though fits of pain have been relieved or sickness cured by it for a time the establishment of health is a very different thing depending upon other powers and principles the first may be and often is done by medicine the other never that their opinion of medicine is vain and ridiculous must appear i think very evidently to any one who recollects collects that the art of physic has now been practiced more or less regularly above two thousand years and most assuredly there is not yet discovered any one certain remedy for any disease ought not this to make us suspect that there is no such thing how can it be when different degrees of the very same disease require various means and methods and the same thing that in one degree would relieve or perhaps cure in another might kill it is by plan by regimen and successive intention that diseases must be cured when they are curable or relieved and palliated when they are not the skilful in medicine and learned in nature know well that health is not to be established by medicine for its effects are but momentary and the frequent repetition of it destructive to the strongest frames that if it is to be restored it must be by gently calling forth the powers of the body to act for themselves introducing gradually a little more and more activity chosen diet and above all peace of mind changing entirely that course of life which first brought on the disease medicine cooperating a little that this is the truth all who know any thing of nature or art must know and i may safely take upon me to say that though i firmly believe health may be restored in most cases that are not absolutely mortal i am very sure that no invalid was ever made a healthy man by the mere power of medicine if this be the case how must the initiated according as their humanity is touched either laugh at or pity the poor foolish world surrendering at discretion to the most ignorant of quacks pretending to infallible remedies which are not in nature but what is still more ridiculous the patients themselves are often so ashamed to own they have been deluded that they favor the cheat by pretending to relief which they never felt  i have collected a few materials for this work which i intend to put in order as soon as i can find time and industry enough to set about it in earnest and if i can finish it to my own satisfaction perhaps i may some time or other trouble the world with it at present i think myself particularly called upon to say something of the gout as that disease was to make a considerable part of my plan and as i see now so many and hear of more who are throwing away not only their money very foolishly but as i verily believe the future health of their lives also in hopes of a medical cure for it to show that such hopes are chimerical and contradictory to every idea of true philosophy and common sense  i shall therefore take a few extracts from this general plan sufficient to show the real original causes of all chronic diseases which though they have been multiplied without end and numberless causes been assigned them are certainly not many and their first causes very few i think they may very fairly be reduced to these three indolence intemperance and vexation  from one or more of these three causes i have undertaken to prove that all or mos chronic diseases are produced for different diseases may have the same original cause the difference proceeding from the various degree of strength and vigor in bodies so that wha would be gout in one in another might b rheumatism stone colic jaundice palsy etc the gout is manifestly and i think confessedly a disease of the best constitution and man therefore fairly stand as a representative of a the rest as such i shall consider it for the present and speak of these causes in their order but it may be necessary to say a word or two of the gout itself before we enquire into its cause  the gout is so common a disease that there is scarcely a man in the world whether he has had it or not but thinks he knows perfectly what it is so does a cookmaid think she knows what fire is as well as sir isaac newton it may therefore seem needless at present to trouble ourselves about a definition to say what it is but i will venture to say what i am persuaded it is not though contrary to the general opinion it is not hereditary it is not periodical and it is not incurable  if it were hereditary it would be necessarily transmitted from father to son and no man whose father had it could possibly be free from it but this is not the case there are many instances to the contrary it is therefore not necessarily so but the fathers having it inclines or disposes the son to it this is the causa proegumena or praedisponent of the learned which of itself never produced any effect at all there must be joined the causa procatarctica or active efficient cause that is our own intemperance or mistaken habit of life to produce it and accordingly as this operates more or less so will the gout be our parents undoubtedly give us constitutions similar to their own and if we live in the same manner they did we shall very probably be troubled with the same diseases but this by no means proves them to be hereditary it is what we do ourselves that will either bring them on or keep us free  if it were hereditary it would appear in infancy and in women which in general it does not i may be told of some women who have had it i believe never very young nor till they had contributed to it themselves for women as well as men may abuse a good constitution i have heard likewise of a boy or two out of a million that had it or something like it but these boys had been suffered to sip wine very early and been fed and indulged every way most unwholsomely  those who insist that the gout is hereditary because they think they see it so sometimes must argue very inconclusively for if we compute the number of children who have it not and women who have it not together with all those active and temperate men who are free from it though born of gouty parents the proportion will be found at least a hundred to one against that opinion and surely i have a greater right from all these instances to say that it is not hereditary than they have from a few to contend that it is what is all this but to pronounce a disease hereditary and prove it by saying that it is sometimes so but oftener not so can there be a greater absurdity  no diseases are hereditary but those of taint or infection and maleformation the gout is none of these and therefore is not hereditary  if the gout be a disease of indigestion and therefore of our own acquiring we must reason very ill or rather not reason at all when we say it is hereditary for surely no man will say that indigestion is hereditary any more than intemperance there are whole nations of active people knowing no luxury who for ages have been free from it but have it now since the europeans have brought them wine and spirits  if the gout be thought hereditary because it is incurable by medicine the same may be sd of every other chronic disease none of which ever are cured by it i mean so as not to return again when was there a man who having had one fit of rheumatism stone colic etc however happily relieved by art for a time had it not again and again or something worse in the place of it till he became a confirmed invalid and died long before his time unless some very remarkable alteration took place in the course of his life to confirm his health so it is in the gout a man gets a fit of it and by abstinence patience time and nature the crude acrimony producing it is subdued and exhausted and he is relieved for that time he might be so much sooner and very safely too by the assistance of art judiciously employed he recovers however and in a few months is taken again why not from any thing inherent in his constitution but because he returned to his former habit of life that produced it at first and will for ever produce it while the strength of his body lasts  the truth is we breed it at first we renew it again and again and bring it on ourselves by our own mistakes or faults which we would fain excuse by throwing them back upon our parents that our complaints may be more justly founded and as bankrupts undone by idleness and extravagance for ever plead losses and misfortunes so do we inheritance to exculpate ourselves  it is natural enough for those who believe the gout hereditary to think it also periodical as if something innate and inherent in our constitutions produced it at certain times but this is a great nistake for if it were periodical it must be regularly so the only periodical disease i know is the intermittent fever which till it be disturbed by the bark or any other febrifuge is as regular as a good clock the returns of the gout are always very uncertain according to the quantity or quality of accumulated indigestion within and the strength of our bodies  i come now to show that the gout is not incurable if by the cure of it be meant the administering a pill or a powder or medicine of any kind to do it i fear it is and ever will be incurable it has been long and often attempted in vain from the origin of physic to this day from the first quack to the present indeed there is a most glaring absurdity at first sight that must stop any man of common sense who has the least insight into nature or knowledge of the human frame for if the gout be the necessary effect of intemperance as i hope to show very evidently that it is a medicine to cure it must be something that will enable a man to bear the daily intemperance of his future life unhurt by the gout or any other disease that is something given now that will take away the effect of a future cause as well might a medicine be given now to prevent a mans breaking his leg or his neck seven years hence one would think the utmost that any rational man could expect from medicine was that it should have power to relieve and remove present disorders leaving the body quite free without pretending to insure it from future injuries here lies the error men think the gout to be something latent in the body now which once well eradicated would never return not suspecting it to be no more than each days indigestion accumulated to a certain pitch that as long as the vigor of life lasts always brings on every fit which once well over the man has no more gout nor seeds of gout in him than he who never had it and if he did not breed it again most certainly would never have it again a proof of this is that the gout has been often cured by a milk diet which as long as it lasted has generally kept the patient free but this method of cure i cannot approve because it relaxes and enervates the man and does not sufficiently support the health and vigor of his body  though i think the gout incurable by medicine it is so far from being incurable in its nature that i am firmly persuaded it may be more easily and more perfectly cured than almost any other chronic disease and this is another strong argument that proves it not hereditary my reason is that it is confessedly a disease of the strongest and best constitution relieving itself by throwing off harsh and bad humors from the vitals and out of the blood upon the extremities where they do least harm to the powers and principles of life and health and as these humors can be nothing more than the daily accumulations of indigestion if a man can live without breeding constantly this indigested acrimony he may most undoubtedly live free not only from the gout but every other chronic disease also and that he may live so not in a perpetual state of mortification and selfdenial but with great ease and comfort to himself in the truest most philosophic luxury i shall endeavor to prove i hope to the satisfaction of all thinking reasonable men  i have said that indolence intemperance and vexation are the original causes of all or most of our chronic diseases perhaps a few accidents must be excepted to which the strongest and healthiest are most liable and the effects of fevers not happily ended and which i except to obviate all cavil and dispute with the men of art i believe to every considerate man whose eyes have been opened so as to give him the least insight into nature the truth of this proposition will be so selfevident that he must instantly perceive it and every invalid that will be candid enough to do it may fairly trace all his complaints up to one or other of these causes but it may require some explanation to the generality of men who are so shortsighted as never to look back or forward far beyond the ken of their nose and therefore never see either distant causes or effects and when they are sick seldom enquire more than for some cold or surfeit of yesterday and to some such trifling cause impute diseases that last for life an accidental cold or even debauch that happens but seldom can have no such effect and men otherwise healthy living in good habits soon get rid of both it is the constant course of life we lead what we do or neglect to do habitually every day that if right establishes our health if wrong makes us invalids for life  men ignorant of the ways of nature in the production and support of animals not knowing what she requires to preserve them in health and vigor to their utmost period have conceived very strange and most assuredly very false ideas of diseases in general and seem to think every disease a distinct kind of being or thing and that there are medicines opposed to each that will certainly remove and cure it this makes them so solicitous to know the name of their complaint which once ascertained they think the remedy not far off poor men is not the gout sufficiently distinguished but where is the remedy certainly not in the precarious skill of prescribing doctors or the secret of ignorant and enterprizing quacks they fancy too that there is great variety of constitution with diseases unavoidably peculiar to each that certain times of life must produce many and that it is impossible to grow old without sickness of some kind or other there is certainly no foundation in nature for any of these opinions nor is there any real essential difference of constitution but of strong or weak and this is produced more by habit than nature the strong by bad habits will become weaker and by good the weak stronger but the most delicate frames may be as healthy as the strongest for the same reason that a squirrel may be as healthy as an elephant there is no disease necessarily peculiar to any time of life however the changes into the different stages of it may affect the valetudinary and it is possible for men to live to great age without any disease at all for many have lived to upwards of an hundred with uninterrupted health  not from the natural defects of our constitutions therefore but the abuse of them proceed all our chronic diseases that is from indolence intemperance or vexation  let us now proceed to enquire what must be the necessary effect of one or more of these causes acting daily upon the body whether in the strongest and most vigorous frames it must not be the gout in weaker rheumatism colic stone palsy etc or any or all of the nervous and hysterical class  first of indolence by which i do not mean insensibility but an inactive habit of life taking the word in the general common sense it is now used  of indolence it seems to have been the design of providence that all men should labor every one for himself that some are rich enough to purchase the labor of others is a mere accident with regard to individuals in which the care of providence appears to be no otherwise concerned than having unequally distributed those powers and abilities by which active and fiery spirits rise uppermost to preserve the harmony of subordination without which society could never exist the rich and great have so far forgot this first principle of nature that they renounce all bodily labor as unworthy their condition and are either too lazy or too inattentive to substitute exercise instead of it thus sacrificing health to indulgence and dignity they do not enjoy those advantages their superior stations and fortunes give them but in happiness fall often below the laboring hind i remember to have seen a very ingenious little book upon the origin of evil in which labor is considered as a great evil the agreeable author must surely mean when it is excessive and urged on to the wearing and wasting the body for in general labor is the first principle of good to mankind and to none more than the laborious themselves does he mean that it would be better for us all did the earth spontaneously bring forth her fruits in such abundance that we should no more labor or contend for them than we do for the air and have nothing to do but bask in ease and riot in enjoyment if so i can by no means agree with him for soon very soon in such a state of things there would not be one healthy man upon the earth and the whole race must quickly perish indeed i am afraid notwithstanding all our unreasonable and unphilosophical complainings the utmost wit of man cannot remove the least evil out of nature without taking with it all the good but begging pardon for this little digression and to come back to my own purpose i think he had been nearer the truth had he put indolence in its stead which is a source of great evil nothing undermines the foundation of all our happiness the health and vigor of the body like it or lays such a train of diseases to come but i must endeavor to show in what manner  it is upon the minutest and almost invisible parts of the body our best health strength and spirits depend these fine parts commonly called capillaries are little pipes or tubes the extended continuations of the larger blood vessels through which the finest parts of the blood must constantly pass not only to keep these very small channels always free and open but also that the particles of the blood may in their passage be attenuated broken and rubbed into globules perfectly smooth and round and easily divisible into still less and less till they escape the sight assisted even by the microscope which gives ocular demonstration of this most amazingly minute circulation i have observed myself and any curious patient man may see with a good microscope in the pellucid membrane of any living animal this surprising minuteness he may select and observe one single vessel the smallest of those that convey red blood many of which would not equal the smallest hair in size through which the blood may be seen passing not like a fluid but a number of little red solid balls pushing one another on till they come to the extremity or ramification of the vessel where it divides into two still less there the first globule stopping a little and recoiling is pushed on again till it divides into two and losing its red color passes on in the smaller pipes fitted only to receive the serum which undergoes the same circulation till it be refined into lymph and this into still finer fluids which being thus prepared escape into a subtility beyond all possible observation now the strength of the heart and arteries alone in a sedentary course of life is by no means sufficient to keep up and perpetuate this motion through these capillaries but requires the assistance and joint force of all the muscles of the body to act by intervals compress the veins propel and accelerate the circulation of the whole mass of blood in order to force and clear these pipes and to triturate cribrate and purify the fluid passing through forming every particle of it into a perfect globule which is the form all the atoms of matter must take from much agitation without this extraordinary occasional aid the little vessels would by their natural elasticity close up into fibers or be obstructed by rough angular particles sticking in them and stopping all passage numberless evils of the chronic kind especially all nervous diseases owe their origin to this cause alone accordingly we see most of those who have lived for any time in a state of indolence grow emaciated and pale by the drying up of these fine vessels or if they happen to be of a lax habit having a good appetite and nothing to vex them they may be loaded with fat but they grow pale withal many of those fine pipes being nevertheless closed up so that they appear bloated and their fat unwholesome having much less blood in their veins than thinner people hence we may learn why these languid pale persons upon the least motion become faint and breathless the blood hurrying through the larger vessels yet free and like a crowd obstructing its own passage causing a dangerous suffocation or if they have not been long in this state nor the capillaries quite closed they glow especially young women with a momentary red the fine vessels being for that time expanded thus inactivity first forms obstructions in these exquisitely fine parts upon which the health and vigor both of body and mind depend entirely and lays the foundation of many diseases to come which other concomitant circumstances such as a violent cold excess of any kind infection from without or a particular disposition of the body within make often fatal to many in this habit of life and which the industrious and active never feel  now i would ask any reasonable person capable of considering this operation of nature with the least glimmering of philosophy or even the attention of common sense and most assuredly it concerns every man to consider it well whether he can conceive it possible to substitute any medicine to be swallowed that shall act upon the blood and vessels like the joint force of all the muscles of the body acting and reacting occasionally in a regular course of moderate daily labor or exercise unless this can be done i will venture to pronounce that there is no such thing as a lasting cure either for the gout or any other chronic disease yes sir says a common practitioner cordials volatiles bracers strengtheners will do this will keep up an increased circulation possibly they may for a few hours by doing mischief for many days but their action soon subsides and the stimulus ceases they must therefore be repeated and repeated for life woe be to him that takes them and to him that leaves them off unless it be done with great judgment while they act they coagulate the juices and corrupt the whole mass of blood and when omitted the patient must feel all the languors and horrors of a crapulary fever after repeated debauch and must have recourse to them again and again like a dramdrinker who cannot bear his existence but in a state of intoxication no art can never come up to nature in this most salutary of all her operations  but these obstructions from crude particles of the blood and this inanition of the capillaries are not all the evils produced by indolence that sprightly vigor and alacrity of health which we feel and enjoy in an active course of life that zest in appetite and refreshment after eating which sated luxury seeks in vain from art is owing wholly to new blood made every day from fresh food prepared and distributed by the joint action of all the parts of the body no man can have these delightful sensations who lives two days with the same blood but must be languid and spiritless to introduce new juices the old must be first thrown off or there will be no room there will be too great a plethora or fullness the first cause of disease in many cases in a state of inactivity the old humors pass off so slowly the insensible perspiration is so inconsiderable that there is no void to be filled consequently by degrees the appetite which is the last thing that decays that is the desire of supply must daily diminish and at last be totally lost here art can do wonders it can procure evacuations we can bleed purge and vomit but then to do any good by these the case must be recent before the humors are vitiated by too long a stay in the body which will be the case very soon for they are all in a perishable state which makes their daily renewal so essentially necessary to health but then these artificial evacuations discharge all alike the new the middle and the old juices that is the chyle the blood the serum and lymph and by this indiscriminate action make strange confusion in those that remain whereas in natures course there is a constant regular transmutation and succession from one state to another that is from chyle into blood and blood into serum serum into lymph and so on till they are all in their turn like wave impelling wave having done their office in various shapes elaborated and ground to such a minute subtility and fineness that they pass off in the vapor of insensible perspiration in a state of indolence they do not pass off either so soon or so regularly as they ought because there is not motion nor consequently heat enough to throw off the vapor they lodge in the body too long grow putrid acrimonious and hurtful many ways like the matter formed in an ulcer which while it is yet sweet is more healing than any balsam the surgeon can apply but when confined it soon becomes corrosive and like a caustic eats it is way all round in fistulas to find vent this shows the virulent acrimony of these confined and stagnating humors hence the breath and perspiration what there is of it occasionally of indolent people is never sweet and hence in jails where these noxious vapors are collected and condensed from crowded wretches languishing in indolence very malignant and pestilential fevers arise  perpetual blisters have been often thought and sometimes found to be serviceable in draining off some of these superfluous juices before they are much corrupted and making by a faint resemblance of natures action a little more room for new and it is for this reason they do any good at all by increasing the general circulation and forcing off a few of those humors that had circulated too long in the body and were becoming acrid for the quantity they discharge is so trifling that there could be no physiology nor even common sense in supposing the evacuation to be the benefit procured by a vomit or a purge the discharge is a hundred fold more but the good obtained not always so great because by these the humors are indiscriminately thrown off and much more of the new than the old many have used frequent bleeding to renew their blood and i have known it answer very well to some especially old people who had been long accustomed to it whom it preserved to great age but then it must be begun in time before the whole mass of humors be vitiated and continued for life is it not strange that men should seek and prefer these violent artificial methods to the simple easy pleasant and constant action of nature and choose rather to take a vomit or a purge than a walk and wear a perpetual blister than make the least use of their limbs  thus indolence must inevitably lay the foundation of general disease and according to the constitution and a few concomitant circumstances will be the kind of the disease in the very best it may be gout or rheumatism in the weaker habits colic jaundice palsy stone etc with all of the hysterical and hypochondriacal class in vain have ingenious men of reading and study mental labor and sedentary life who are more subject to disease in general than the gay and thoughtless endeavored to obviate the evil by abstinence an excellent means of remedy in many cases and which few practice but true philosophers who are not the most likely to want it but yet even they do not find it answer and for the reasons which i have just given that we cannot live two days in health and spirits with the same blood there must be a new daily supply of that ethereal part of our food called up to the brain to support its own as well as the labor of the whole body by this i mean the most elaborated refined part of all our juices which constantly repairs and nourishes the smallest vessels and fibers whether i may be allowed to call it animal spirits or not is not material whenever this ether fails we must necessarily feel languor and lassitude both of body and mind with this difference that in weariness of the limbs from much action the lees and coarser parts are thrown off also and the first meal and first sleep soon supplies the defect in mental labor the feculence remains to obstruct all appetite there is no room and therefore no call for supply the whole man suffers and sinks  of intemperance i come now to speak of intemperance for indolence blunting all our sensations naturally leads us to intemperance we want the whip and spur of luxury to excite our jaded appetites there is no enduring the perpetual moping languor of indolence we fly to the stimulating sensualities of the table and the bottle friend provokes friend to exceed and accumulate one evil upon another a joyous momentary relief is obtained to be paid for severely soon after the next morning our horrors increase and in this course there is no remedy but repetition thus whoever is indolent is intemperate also and partly from necessity and the evils necessarily following both these causes often make the rich and great more wretched than the poor and the balance of happiness is held more equally between them for however other things may be distributed happiness like water always finds its level among men i wish this observation might cure these of their envy and teach the others how to enjoy their wealth  before i return to my subject i fear i must make an apology for what i am going to say and hope no one will be offended when i venture to say that nine in ten of all the chronic diseases in the world particularly the gout owe their first rise to intemperance many a good man who piques himself upon being the most sober regular creature alive and never eats but of one or two plain dishes as he calls them nor exceeds his pint of wine at any meal keeps good hours and never sleeps above eight or nine may be surprised if not affronted to have his diseases imputed to intemperance which he considers as a great crime and yet he is often ill sick in his stomach troubled with indigestion and crippled by the gout the case is we judge of temperance and intemperance from our own habits without any just idea of either what we are used to do and see others do we think right and never go up to nature for our knowledge the best way to explain what i mean by intemperance may be to inquire what is natures law of temperance and to deviate from that must be considered as intemperance and here i must beg leave to observe that temperance is a thing of which no englishman has or can have the least idea if he judges from his own or his neighbors habits to form some notion of it he must have seen other countries particularly spain portugal or italy and observed how men live there what they call temperance or even tolerable living with us would be thought downright starving in this view temperance is local and comparative but what i mean is natural temperance not depending upon place or custom for i do not mean fasting or abstinence which can never be salutary but after repletion and we must not judge of it from countries where a piece of bad bread and an onion with a draught of water is thought a tolerable meal nor from our own where beggars live better than the nobles of some countries and where we riot in the choice of plenty native and exotic every day  to come then to my idea of it i think there is an absolute determined temperance to be measured by every mans natural unprovoked appetite digestion and consumption while he continues in a good state of health and right habit of life as long as a man eats and drinks no more than his stomach calls for and will bear without the least pain distention eructation or uneasiness of any kind nor than his body consumes and throws off to the last grain he may be said to live in a very prudent wellregulated state of temperance that will probably preserve him in health and spirits to great old age  this is natures law and the reverse of it or indeed any great deviation from it must be intemperance when we eat without appetite or urge beyond moderate satiety provoked by incentives of any kind when we drink without thirst for the sake of the liquor indeed i cannot allow him to be strictly temperate who drinks any wine or strong liquor at all unless it be medicinally or now and then for the sake of society and good humor but by no means every day  now let us compare this simple idea of temperance with the common course of most mens lives and observe their progress from health to sickness for i fear we shall find but very few who have any pretensions to real temperance in early youth we are insensibly led into intemperance by the indulgence and mistaken fondness of parents and friends wishing to make us happy by anticipation having thus exhausted the first degrees of luxury before we come to the dominion of ourselves we should find no pleasure in our liberty did we not advance in new sensations nor feel ourselves free but as we abuse it thus we go on till some friendly pain or disease bids or rather forces us to stop but in youth all the parts of our bodies are strong and flexible and bear the first loads of excess with less hurt and throw them off soon by their own natural vigor and action or with very little assistance from artificial evacuations as we grow older either by nature in due time or repeated excesses before our time the body is less able to free itself and wants more aid from art the man however goes on taking daily more than he wants or can possibly get rid of he feels himself replete and oppressed and his appetite failing his spirits sink for want of fresh supply he has recourse to dainties sauces pickles provocatives of all sorts these soon lose their power and though he washes down each mouthful with a glass of wine he can relish nothing what is to be done send for a physician doctor i have lost my stomach pray give me says he with great innocence and ignorance something to give me an appetite as if want of appetite was a disease to be cured by art in vain would the physician moved by particular friendship to the man or that integrity he owes to all men give him the best advice in two words quaere sudando seek it by labor he would be thought a man void of all knowledge and skill in his profession if he did not immediately or after a few evacuations prescribe stomachics bitter spicy infusions in wine or brandy vitriolic elixirs bark steel etc by the use of these things the stomach roused to a little extraordinary action frees itself by discharging it is crude austere coagulated contents into the bowels to be thence forwarded into the blood the man is freed for a time finds he can eat again and thinks all well but this is a shortlived delusion if he is robust the acrimony floating in the blood will be thrown out and a fit of gout succeeds if less so rheumatism or colic etc as i have already said but let us suppose it to be the gout which if he bears patiently and lives moderately drinking no madeira or brandy to keep it out of his stomach nature will relieve him in a certain time and the gouty acrimony concocted and exhausted by the symptomatic fever that always attends he will recover into health if assisted by judicious mild and soft medicines his pains might be greatly assuaged and mitigated and he would recover sooner but however he recovers it is but for a short time for he returns to his former habits and quickly brings on the same round of complaints again and again all aggravated by each return and he less able to bear them till he becomes a confirmed invalid and cripple for life which with a great deal of useless medication and a few journies to bath he drags on till in spite of all the doctors he has consulted and the infallible quack medicines he has taken lamenting that none have been lucky enough to hit his case he sinks below opium and brandy and dies long before his time this is the course i have lived to see many take and believe it to be the case of more whom i have never heard of and which any one may observe in the circle of his acquaintance all this chain of evils is brought on and accumulated by indolence and intemperance or mistaken choice of diet how easily might they have been remedied had the real causes been known and attended to in time  i believe i must here explain a little more fully what i mean by provoking the appetite which i take to be the general mode of intemperance among men for custom has made all kinds of incentives to excess so common that those of daily use far from being considered in the class of intemperance are by most people thought to be not only salutary but necessary and they never suspect the least evil from the common decoraments of the table salt pepper mustard vinegar and yet however extraordinary it may seem i will venture to pronounce that excess in any of these must be doubly prejudicial to health hurtful in themselves by their acrimony they provoke the appetite beyond natural satiety to receive an oppressive load which the stomach itself would soon feel were it not artificially stimulated to discharge it into the blood by wine and strong liquors immediately after thus one error brings on another and when men have eaten too much they drink too much also by a kind of necessity he will certainly be a healthier man who is very moderate in the use of these things than he who exceeds they may he sometimes useful as medicines but can never add to the wholsomeness of our daily food to give some weight to what i say there are whole nations in the world that have never known any of them and are healthy strong and vigorous  if this be true of the common provocatives at every poor mans board who is there that exceeds not natures law who is truly temperate what shall we say of that studied labored refined extravagance at the tables of the rich where the culinary arts are pushed to that excess that luxury is become false to itself and things are valued not as they are good and agreeable to the natural and undebauchd appetite but high inflammatory rare out of season and costly where though variety is aimed at every thing has the same taste and nothing it is own i am sorry and ashamed that men professing luxury should understand it so little as to think it lies in the dish or the sauce or multitude of either or that urging beyond natural satiety can afford any real enjoyment but this they do by all the researches of culinary and medical art introducing all the foreign aids to luxury every stimulating provocative that can he found in acids salts fiery spices and essences of all kinds to rouse their nerves to a little feeling not knowing the more they are chafed and irritated the more callous they still grow and the same things must now be more frequently repeated increased in quantity and exalted in quality till they know not where to stop and every meal they make serves only to overload and oppress the stomach to foul and inflame the blood obstruct and choke all the capillary channels bring on a hectic fever of irritation that though it raise the spirits for the evening leaves behind it all the horrid sensations of inanition and crapula the next morning and but that nature is so kind as to stop them in their career with a painful fit of gout or some other illness in which she gets a little respite they would soon be at the end of their course  men bring all these evils upon themselves either not knowing or not attending to two things the one that pleasure is a coy coquet and to be enjoyed must not always be pursued we must sometimes sit still that she may come and court us in her turn the other that pleasure and happiness are as distinct things as riot and enjoyment besides pleasure is not infinite and our sensations are limited we can bear but a certain measure and all urging beyond it infallibly brings pain in it is stead let the men of high experience bear me testimony that this is true of all the luxuries of the table wine music women and every sensuality  these men may tell me perhaps that i have made a mighty fine declamation against luxury and intemperance but what is this to the purpose they desire not to be told of their faults nor to hear disagreeable truths which they know already have i no art or skill to reconcile health and luxury no remedy no rare secret to repair and restore sensation and vigor worn to rags no medeas kettle to boil anew if not do not describe to us a life of moderation temperance and exercise it is not worth having upon these terms i am aware of the unreasonable expectations of many that their demands would rise high some of them to the impossible at present i am only setting forth the causes when i come to talk of remedy i will endeavor to convince them that the artificial helps they expect are not in nature but that there are in nature ways and means by which many gouty broken constitutions that have been despaired of might be repaired and restored to a very desirable degree of health and enjoyment but i must first say a word or two to the intemperate or mistaken in the middle class of life  in england all degrees of men are furnished with the means of intemperance and therefore it is no wonder that most men are intemperate if they are less so in other countries it is not that they have more virtue but they want the means their oppressive governments the precarious state of property and their superstitious religion keep them so poor that luxury is not in their power they have however this advantage from their poverty that they are much less afflicted with chronic diseases than we are i verily believe there are more gouts in england than in all the rest of europe a proof that good living is more universal but not to the advocates for this good living do i wish to address myself i fear they will be as incorrigible as their superiors in higher and more refined luxury but there are some not intemperate from choice but example habit custom mistake not knowing their daily diet to be unwholesome and productive of their diseases to these it may be of some use to have the unwholesome pointed out and their choice directed to better things men of laborious occupations who work in the open air can and do bear great excesses and much unwholesome diet without much hurt i never knew a sick or gouty gardener that was not a remarkable sot but men of sedentary trades and business shopkeepers of all kinds feel much sooner and more heavily the ill effects of intemperance or mistaken choice in their meat and drink their first care therefore ought to be not to add the diseases of intemperance to those of inactivity but proportion what they take as well in quantity as in quality to their consumption but let us see how well they do this they all say they live upon plain things and never indulge in made dishes but they will eat heartily of a goose or duck with a large quantity of sage onion pepper and salt a pig with similar preparation and a hare with higher and more compounded seasoning do they ever eat veal without stuffing or even a leg of mutton without capersauce if ever they eat a steak or a chop if it is sometimes without pepper i believe it is never without pickles the worst of all poisons they are surprised that such meals should rise on their stomachs with flatulence sour and bitter hiccups and eructations which if they did not keep them down with a sufficient quantity of wine or sometimes a dram they would be troubled with all the time of digestion if this method succeeds so far as to quiet their stomachs for the present they go on with it regardless or ignorant of future and distant consequences thus are these sharp harsh hot and inflammatory things forced out of the stomach into the blood before it has had time to dilute and subdue or reject them and the superfluous load they bring along with them and thus is laid the foundation of every disease that appears when these acrid and fiery particles are accumulated in the blood to a certain degree  there are others whose pretensions to plain diet may seem better founded but who nevertheless eat and are fond of things unwholesome and very unfit for men of sedentary lives such as salted and smoked flesh and fish of all kinds hams tongues heavy flour puddings toasted cheese etc all which are of such hard and indissoluble texture that they never dissolve well in the stomach of a plowman the same salt seasoning and smoke which harden and preserve them from putrefaction before they are eaten keep them from dissolution afterward so that they never are digested at all nor is it possible any good nourishment should ever come from them the salts they contain are indeed melted in the intestinal juices and get into the blood producing in the best constitutions those tettery itchy or scaly eruptions commonly but very erroneously called the scurvy which is quite another kind of disease to this kind of food is owing the bad health of country people and their childrens rickety heads and limbs and big and hard bellies  another capital mistake many people fall into who in other respects are very moderate in their diet is that the fleshmeat they eat is always overdone if boiled too much the juices are lost if overroasted fried or broiled the action of the fire continued too long changes the mild animal flesh into something of another quality the fat is made bitter and rancid which fire will always do by the sweetest oil and the scorched outside of the lean dry and acrimonious the less therefore all fleshmeat undergoes the power of fire the milder and wholsomer it is i do not mean by this to recommend the customs of cannibals and tartars who eat raw flesh or beasts of prey that devour animals alive but it may be observed that the first are free from our diseases and the others amazingly strong and vigorous we may learn this from them at least that our meat cannot be the wholsomer for being as some call it thoroughly done and that we should learn to like it with some of its red juices unspoiled by the fire upon this principle the english cookery is to be preferred to the french who stew and roast to rags and of english cookery broiling must be the best  this leads me to another observation which perhaps none but physicians or those who have studied well the nature of man and his aliments are able to make it is this that man being born to devour most of the fruits and animals of the earth and water there ought to be a certain proportion of animal and vegetable substances in his food the animal tending spontaneously to putrefaction the vegetable correcting that tendency from going too far thus from the due mixture of both qualities results that neutral property equally distant from acid as alkali that is essentially necessary to produce good blood this is so manifest that whoever will observe attentively may see whenever either of these prevails in the body there is so strong a desire and longing for things of the other sort as well as pleasing sensation in the palate and stomach when they are taken as plainly indicate the natural want let a man have lived long upon fleshmeat wholly he will have a most eager appetite for fruit and vegetables and if kept too long without them as is the case with those who have lived some time at sea will grow sick of the real scurvy but if before they are too far gone they reach the land they will eat the first common grass they can come at with more avidity than a horse or ox and be perfectly cured by it in like manner they who have lived long upon vegetables which regimen is often prescribed to invalids especially in the gout will have great craving for fleshmeat we ought to learn from all this to attend diligently to the calls of nature and balance the mixture with due proportion not only that our vitals may have the less labor in preparing and making our juices fit for nourishment but to prevent the diseases that are peculiar to the predominancy of either and here i may observe that the error of most mens diet in every class of life is that the acid crude and austere almost always abound not that they do not eat fleshmeat enough but they spoil it in the preparation and cookery changing its animal nature into something worse than vegetable taking off entirely all its tendency to dissolution and putrefaction by salting smoking pickling potting and preserving things that in their own simple nature would soon corrupt and dissolve but by these preparations are hardened and embalmed to keep for years like mummies the same may be said of every kind of made dishes the salts spices hot herbs and acids with which they are seasoned and compounded preserve and harden them to keep for ever the sauces and gravies they swim in have the same effect as so much pickle the things we feed upon ought all to be in a perishable state or they will never furnish the materials of good blood and whatever is hardened or seasoned so as to keep long before it be eaten ought not to be eaten at all for it will never dissolve in the stomach  the nature of most chronic diseases and their first symptom heartburn as it is commonly called plainly show the original cause to be acid crudity prevailing in the juices producing coagulations concretions and obstructions of various kinds all which are very manifest in the gout rheumatism stone and most nervous cases the remedies also that sometimes relieve and palliate confirm this such as the volatile alkalies hartshorn salt ammoniac testaceous powders soap etc many may be surprised at this and say it cannot be for though they have these diseases they take little or no acids but there are many things they take that are acescent that is liable to become acid especially by the heat of the stomach this they are not aware of but they are in their nature much more prejudicial than things already sour for besides that people take not these in any quantity the acescent never become sour but by the act of fermentation which being raised in the stomach where it ought never to happen produces strange tumults wind vapor gas that is that fume arising from fermenting liquors of any kind which has been known sometimes to kill at a stroke it may here be necessary to enumerate some of those things called acescent these are sweets of every kind puddings cakes pastry creams confections etc and every thing made of flour especially fermented bread in particular so far from being the wholesome thing many imagine is not only unwholesome by its acescency but by the strong ferment it contains it forces into fermentation every thing capable of it that it meets with in the stomach whoever requires proof of this may have it by the following experiment put a common toast into half a pint of water and let it stand six or eight hours near the fire so as to be kept in the heat of the human stomach and it will be sour as vinegar  the bread of london i fear is particularly so partly by being robbed of its bran which in some degree would soften and correct it but chiefly by having in it besides its usual ferment a great quantity of sour alum most absurdly added to make it unnaturally white to be convinced of this boil a pound of common london bread in a sufficient quantity of water to make it thick as gruel let it stand to subside pour off the clear and boil away all the water the alum will be found at bottom in this light we must also consider most sorts of seasonings stuffings forcemeats and compounded sauces but the greatest acescent or rather bane of all high and low rich or otherwise whoever they are that take it constantly is wine wine alone produces more diseases than all the other causes put together all men allow that wine taken to excess is hurtful they see the immediate evils that follow but distant effects that require more attentive and deducive observation very few see or believe and judging from present and agreeable feelings they say that a little wine is wholesome and good for every one and accordingly take it every day give it their children and teach them to like it by debauching their natural taste in the earliest infancy thus they come to relish it by habit and to be uneasy without it like snufftakers without their tobacco the want is equally habitual and unnatural in both cases for the stomach wants wine no more than the nose does snuff the immediate sensation of both after a little use is pleasant but the remote effect of the wine taken constantly infinitely more pernicious than of the snuff this hurts the nose only the other accumulating a little indigestion every day corrupts all the juices of the body most essentially and though it be often taken with a view to promote digestion and assist the operations of the stomach it manifestly does harm to both instead of digesting and dissolving it hardens and prevents dissolution and curdles and corrupts the milky chyle and first juices produced from our food it warms indeed and stimulates the stomach to greater exertion than is natural or necessary and thereby enables it to discharge it is contents the sooner whence that agreeable feel of warmth and comfort from it is immediate action but by this extraordinary action it forces our food out of the stomach too soon before it is softened dissolved and properly prepared and sends it into the bowels crude hard and austere in that state to be carried into the blood there to produce every kind of disease whatever therefore the advocates for a little wine every day may think or argue in favor of it they are most undoubtedly in a very great error and it were certainly much better and safer to drink a bottle and get a little merry once a week drinking water only or small beer at all other times in which interval nature might totally subdue it and recover entirely water is the only liquor nature knows of or has provided for all animals and whatever nature gives us we may depend upon if is safest and best for us accordingly we see that when we have committed any excesses or mistakes of any kind and suffer from them it is water that relieves hence the chief good of bath spa and many other medicinal waters especially to hard drinkers it is the element that dilutes and carries off crudities and indigestions etc the mineral virtues they contain may make them tolerable to the stomach in their passage but do as i believe little more in the body it is the water that cures wine if it be not one of our own inventions was given us as a cordial in sickness weariness sorrow and old age and a most salutary charm it would be for most of these evils did we not exhaust it is power by daily use and instead of taking it as such drink it up as common draught in youth and health to make us mad i know this is a very tender topic to touch upon and too favorite a pleasure to argue against with any reasonable hope of convincing most men having so indulged themselves in this bewitching habit that they think they cannot live without a little wine every day and their very existence depends upon it their stomachs require it nature calls for it st paul advises it it must be good thus men catch at every shadow of an argument that favors their inclinations st paul advises it as a medicine sometimes but certainly not every day there is no medicine i know of that taken every day will not either cease to act entirely or by acting too much do harm it will be said that many drink wine every day without gout stone or any disease at all in consequence of it i believe not many or i should know some of them if any are so strong as to bear it to old age unhurt they must be very active as well as strong to subdue it but i have nothing to say to these my business is with invalids who complain and certainly ought not to measure constitutions with those above their match the same arguments will hold equally in favor of every other bad habit your nose will want it is snuff your palate it is spices and when the fashion was for women to be small waisted their galled sides grown callous by the long compression of the stays wanted their support nature like a true female cries out at the first violence but submits in time is reconciled and grows fond of the ravisher but it is the business of philosophers to distinguish carefully between the real wants of nature and the artificial calls of habit and when we find these begin to hurt us we ought to make the utmost persevering efforts to break the enchantment of bad customs and though it cost us some uneasy sensations at first we must bear them patiently they will not kill and a very little time will reconcile us to better modes of life  there is another capital mistake many labor under in the choice of their wine preferring the strong hot and coarse sorts madeira port mountain etc to the milder more elegant and certainly less unwholesome french and italian wines accounting them better for the stomach and good against wind etc my observation has been that they who use these strong stomach wines to cure wind are never free from it and all the gouty disorders of indigestion indeed it cannot well be otherwise for there is nothing so repugnant to natural digestion as the use of these strong liquors which instead of dissolving harden every thing and thus for ever when the first warmth is gone off leave a crapulary crude sour load of yesterday to ferment fret and irritate the stomach and bowels every day  thus have i endeavored to point out two of the true primary capital causes of the gout and most other chronic diseases and most sincerely wish that what i have said may engage those whom it mostly concerns the gouty the infirm and valetudinary of every class to observe reflect and think for themselves upon the hints i have thrown out in which light what i have said must be considered rather than as logical or demonstrative proof i know the reasoning and arguments may be much improved and carried farther and if i had more leisure i might have attempted it but i am well aware of the unsurmountable difficulty of convincing men against their will by any arguments at all i choose therefore at present to invite them to selfconviction from their own observations and experience i flatter myself they will find it well worth their pains to reason a little more than they do with and for themselves and it will be a great point gained for them if it turn their misled opinions from all that imaginary power of restoring health in any of that multitude of ridiculous and most truly contemptible medicines that are daily obtruded upon the public with endless lies to recommend them by a set of the poorest most ignorant and paultry rogues in the nation and engage their attention to their true remedy a right institution of life in judging of which if they find themselves unequal to the task they may be assisted by men of humanity skill and honesty  of vexation i come now to the last general cause of chronic diseases vexation a very fruitful parent of many bodily evils producing generally diseases of inanition much more difficult not only to be cured but relieved than those we suffer either from indolence or intemperance but as it is not so common a cause of the gout as the other two it may not be necessary to consider it very minutely at present i shall not therefore enter deeply into the regions of metaphysical conjecture nor run wild after my own conceits or theirs who have gone astray before me in guessing at the incomprehensible union of soul and body and their mutual powers of acting upon each other i shall content myself with observing only what may be of some use that every great degree of vexation whether in the shape of anger envy resentment discontent or sorrow has most destructive and deleterious effects upon the vitals of the body whether sudden and violent or slow and lasting  the first immediate effect of violent grief or vexation is to take off the action of the stomach entirely let us suppose a man in the best health the highest good humor and spirits as well as good stomach sitting down to dinner with his friends receives suddenly some very afflicting news instantly his appetite is gone and he can neither eat nor swallow a morsel let the same thing happen after he has made a hearty cheerful meal as suddenly the action of his stomach the whole power of digestion is out off totally as if it were become paralytic and what he has eaten lies a most oppressive load perhaps as the excess of weakness is often convulsion it may be rejected by a violent vomit or do greater mischief for which reason such strokes of distress are less hurtful received upon an empty than a full stomach but why is this what connection is there between a piece of bad news and a mans stomach full or empty whatever the cause be the effect is certain and invariable is it because the animal spirits or the action of the nerves whatever be the secret cause of their power is called off to supply and support the tumultuous agitation of the brain and the stomach with all its appendages and their secretions is left powerless and paralytic and must therefore either act convulsively or not at all  besides this pernicious effect of perverting the natural action of the stomach and intestines the whole circulation of the blood is disturbed the contraction and dilatation of the heart that is the alternate action by which it opens to receive the blood from the veins and closes again to force it out through the arteries which operation ought to be as true and certain as the vibrations of a pendulum are broken and uneven the heart flutters palpitates now is overloaded with blood and in danger of suffocation now receives none at all consequently all the secretions must be as irregular some of the glands receiving too abundant a supply that either hurries through or oppresses and overpowers them others none at all hence that hasty gushing of pale limpid urine in amazing quantities those sudden bursts of unmeaning tears sometimes great dryness and choking thirst sometimes the overflowing of the mouth with water instead of saliva and many other nervous and hysterical affections fits syncope epilepsy etc all which indicate the greatest tumults and perturbations in the inmost recesses of the nervous and vital frame many kinds of disease have sprung from this fountain of such unaccountably horrid and terrifying appearances that formerly they could no otherwise account for them but by the malefice of sorcery and the immediate possession of devils  in slower more silent but longer continued grief the effects are similar but not so violent many little strokes repeated will do the same thing in time that a great blow does at once the function of the stomach will be more gently disturbed and perverted its juices vitiated and all its contents will for ever turn sour bitter or rancid so that no mild milky chyle or wholesome material of nourishment can ever come into the blood the patient must languish with cachectic inanition universal bad habit of body or pine and waste with atrophy the want of nourishing supply whence arise complications of various diseases succeeding each other always from bad to worse and unless he can subdue his anxiety and restore peace of mind he must in time sink under it and die as it is said of a broken heart  whoever vexes long must certainly want nourishment for besides the disturbed state of the stomach it is broken appetite and bad digestion from whence what supply there is must come not only illprepared but vitiated into the blood there can be no sleep in this state of mind the perturbed spirit cannot rest and it is in sleep that all nourishment is performed and the finer parts of the body chafed and worn with the fatigue of the day are repaired and restored to their natural vigor while we are awake this cannot so well be done because the incessant action of the body or mind being always partial and irregular prevents that equal distribution of the blood to all parts alike from which each fiber and filament receives that share or portion that suits it best in sleep when it is quiet and natural all the muscles of the body that is all its active powers that are subject to our will are lulled to rest composed and relaxed into a genial temporary kind of palsy that leaves not the least obstruction or hindrance of the passage of the blood to every atom accordingly the pulse is always slower and more equal the respiration deeper and more regular and the same degree of vital warmth diffused alike through every part so that the extremities are equally warm with the heart  vexation operating in this manner upon the organs of digestion and concoction and disturbing and obstructing the natural progress of nutrition must often produce diseases similar to those of longcontinued intemperance it is first effect being indigestion with all it is symptoms wind eructation heartburn hiccup etc it is no wonder therefore it should sometimes bring on a fit of gout which as i have said is manifestly a disease of crudity and indigestion and often the gout in the stomach and bowels indeed most cold crude colics are of this kind schirrous concretions will also be formed in the spleen liver glands of the mesentery and throughout the whole system of the belly many of these indurated tumors will appear outwardly so as to be felt by the hand these in time will degenerate into cancers and cancerous ulcerations and many fatal evils not the least of which in my opinion is that the patient will suffer a long time before he dies  all the passions when they are inordinate may have injurious effects upon the vital frame excessive joy has sometimes given a fatal blow and sudden bursts of laughter done great mischiefs especially to delicate or weakly people who have often been thrown into spasms cramps convulsions hysteric sits and haemorrhages by them but as i think the word vexation comprehends the chief of those passions that hurt us most and mean not to make a metaphysical enquiry about them it is needless to be particular upon each it may suffice to have shown the immediate and remote influence of vexation upon die human body  whatever men may think of their diseases their strange symptoms and appearances and their unaccountable causes these are the three original great sources of most of the chronic diseases of mankind which i have endeavored to set forth and explain in so familiar a manner that i hope i have been perfectly intelligible to every one who will venture to think and judge for himself to such rational people only i address myself and to enable them to do this the better i have furnished these hints and observations which may be extended improved and applied to particular cases i want not nor wish to obtrude my ideas upon any man however warranted i may think myself from the observation and experience of my whole life my principal aim has been only to make men stop a little in their career and consider with themselves whether it may not be possible for them to be mistaken even in that course of diet and those habits of life which they never suspected if they are ill and for any time there must be a more substantial cause for it than they are in general willing to allow it is not always catching cold for we do not catch cold so often as we think we do and when a healthy robust person takes cold which can happen but rarely if this be the whole of the disease it cannot last long but the truth is when the crudity superfluity and acrimony of an indolent intemperate life have accumulated to such a degree as to make us sick then we say we have taken cold or complain of a bad constitution when we have spoiled perhaps a very good one or with sydenham that the epidemic constitution of the air has infected us or that this or that trifle has disagreed i am fully and firmly persuaded that whoever will reflect with some degree of intelligence and sanity be just to himself and candid with his physician will in general be able to trace his complaints and diseases up to one or other of these three causes and whoever does this must infallibly see how vain and idle all his hopes and expectations of lasting remedy and established health must be from any kind of quack medicines or indeed the common and too general practice of physic when the whole is rested upon something given to swallow how inadequate the means are to the end proposed and hoped for how ill vomiting and purging can supply the place of temperance bleeding blistering and all artificial evacuation of activity cordials and opium of peace of mind is not this to fill the body with harsh and unwholesome juices and then tear it to pieces to get them out again to make artificial holes and sores in the skin to renew the blood and discharge superfluities instead of employing muscular motion to rub off and grind down all the acrimony of angular aculeated particles and make them smooth and round and easily divisible and to employ intoxication and stupefaction to take off the sense of pain and leave the cause where it was or fix it faster can any reasonable person hope for health or long life by any of these unnatural methods when these only are employed let him look round among his neighbors and acquaintance and tell me whether not only all the gouty but rheumatic colicky jaundiced paralytic dropsical hysterical people he has ever seen are not either always so or by fits so and whether those returning paroxysms or sits of these disorders do not always grow worse and worse in spite of all their medication and quackery till a complication or apoplexy comes on that at last though long before their time puts an end to their miserable lives these evils are considered as the inheritance of human nature unavoidable and incurable and submitted to in absolute despair though there has not one rational attempt that i know of ever yet been made to remedy them in earnest all the methods hitherto employed have only been to relieve and those often so perniciously that the future health has been sacrificed to obtain present relief or ease this must for ever be the case when in chronic cases it is obtained by art and nature has no share or where the physician does all and the patient nothing for himself  of the cure of the gout and all other chronic diseases and the repair of a broken constitution having set forth the real causes of the gout and all it is congenial diseases i come now to the most essential part to administer all possible comfort to those whom great pain and long suffering may have made attentive and docile and willing to take health upon the terms it is possible to have it to the young and voluptuous who are yet in their career and declare for a short life and a merry one i have nothing to say but this that a short life is very seldom a merry one on the contrary is generally made up of a few years of riotous pleasure without happiness to be severely paid for by as many more of pain sickness regret and despair  having shown that the gout is not hereditary not inherent in our constitutions but produced by the daily accumulations of indigested unsubdued acrimony and superfluity which when they abound to a certain degree must end either in a fit of the gout or some other disease according to the constitution as long as any vigor is left in the body for nature will for ever free or endeavor to free itself and purge the blood of its impurities by gout by fever by pain of one kind or other that takes off the appetite and for a time gives respite and prevents the pouring in of more and more enemies to disturb it is operation and make it ineffectual thus young people after a fit of gout is happily and well gone off are as free from it as if they had never had it and if they would take warning and be careful not to breed it again most certainly would for ever remain free how absurd therefore how ridiculously ignorant must be every attempt to cure the gout in futuro by medicine before it be yet formed before it has any existence can such a medicine give supernatural strength and enable an old man living in indolence to digest and consume or discharge the superfluities of his daily intemperance that is to give him more vigorous powers than nature gave him at oneandtwenty or when the gout came first upon him the duke of portlands powder promised to do something like this and most certainly kept off the gout for two or three years but what was it and what did it really do it was a strong spicy bitter taken in substance in a large quantity for a long time it is effect was to keep up a constant fever as long as it was taken this kept the gouty matter always afloat and prevented it is fixing any where but there was no living long with a constant fever accordingly many of those who took it died very soon i myself observed between fifty and sixty of it is advocates some my patients some my acquaintance or neighbors who were apparently cured by it for a little while but in less than six years time omnes ad internecionem caesi they all died to a man  many similar attempts have been made with other medicines to cure not only the gout but most other chronic diseases and with the same fatal effects antimony and mercury elaborated into poisons by chemistry have been administered particularly the solution of sublimate has torn many a stomach to rags so that it could never bear common food afterward the deadly nightshade and hemlock and many such dreadful poisons have been given as alteratives to restore health the intention here seems to be kill or cure to raise a violent agitation or fever in the body in hopes it may prove strong enough to throw off the disease and medicine together the effect has ever been notwithstanding a little apparent and deceitful relief may have been perceived from the first efforts that it has sunk under both loads and exhausted by repeated straining much sooner than by the disease alone  can any one in his senses suppose that diseases a man has been his whole life contracting and to which he is adding every day by perseverance in unwholesome diet and bad habits are to be thus removed by a coup de main ou de baguette or that they will not return be they cured or conjured away ever so often whilst he continues the same mode of life that brought them on at first  what then is to be done how and in what manner are chronic diseases and cachexies to be cured and health restored and estableshed i have already shown that the causes of these evils are indolence intemperance and vexation and if there be any truth or weight in what i have said the remedies are obvious activity temperance and peace of mind it will be said the remedies are obvious but impracticable would you bid the feeble cripple who cannot stand take up his bed and walk the man who has lost all appetite abstain and the sleepless wretch racked with pain enjoy peace of mind no certainly i am not so absurd these must be assisted by medicine and if they have not exhausted all it is power already a little respite a favorable interval may be obtained that with other artificial aids cooperating may be greatly improved to their advantage and if rightly employed they may get on from strength to strength till they recover into perfect health but it is not my design at present to expatiate upon that particular kind of medical relief which every chronic case may require it would lead me into too wide a field and too far from my present purpose which is to show that the gout in most of it is stages and degrees may be cured a present paroxysm or fit relieved its return for ever safely prevented and the patient estableshed in perfect health  let us suppose the case of a man from forty to fifty years of age who has had at least twenty fits of gout by which most of his joints have been so clogged and obstructed as to make walking or any kind of motion very uneasy to him let him have had it sometimes in his stomach a little in his head and often all over him so as to make him universally sick and lowspirited especially before a regular fit has come to relieve him this i apprehend to be as bad a case as we need propose and that it will not be expected that every old cripple whose joints are burnt to chalk and his bones grown together and united by anchilosis who must be carried from his bed to his table and back again should be proposed as an object of medication and cure and yet even he might perhaps receive some relief and palliation in pain if he has any great degree of it which is not very common in this case let us therefore suppose the first example  if the point be to assuage the violent raging of a present paroxysm this may be safely done by giving some soft and slowlyoperating laxative neither hot nor cold but warm either in small doses repeated so as to move the patient once or twice in twentyfour hours or by a larger dose oftener in less time according to the strength and exigency this may be followed by a few lenient absorbent correctors of acrimony or even gentle anodynes proper cataplasms may also be safely applied to the raging part which often assuage pain surprizingly with as much mild and spontaneouslydissolving nourishment as may keep the spirits from sinking too low but i would wish them to sink a little and exhort the patient to bear that lowness with patience and resignation till nature assisted by soft and succulent food can have time to relieve him this easy method of treating a fit of the gout would answer in any age and if the patient was young and vigorous and the pain violent there could be no danger in taking away a little blood thus in two or three days time i have often seen a severe fit mitigated and made tolerable and this is a better way of treating it with regard to future consequences than bearing it with patience and suffering it to take it is course for the sooner the joints are relieved from distension and pain the less danger there is of obstructions fixing in them or their being calcined and utterly destroyed but instead of this the general practice is quite the reverse oh keep up your spirits they cry keep it out of your stomach at all events where whenever it rages in a distant part it is not at all inclined to come as you cannot eat you must drink the more freely so they take cordials strong wines and rich spoonmeats by urging in this manner a great fever is raised the pain enraged and prolonged and a fit that would have ended spontaneously in less than a week protracted to a month or six weeks and when it goes off at last leaves such obstruction and weakness in the parts as cripple the man ever after all this i hope will be fairly and heartily understood for there is doubtless a great variety of gouty cases but no case that will not admit of medical assistance judicioussly administered  but the most capital point of all and what is mostly desired by all is to prevent it is return or changing into any other disease and to establish health most men would be very well pleased and happy could this be done by any medical trick or nostrum with full liberty of living as they list and indulging every appetite and passion without control some poor silly creatures ignorant of all philosophy and the nature of causes and effects have been led into experiments of this kind by a few artful rogues very much to the prejudice of their future health and danger of their lives also expecting from medicine what it never did or can perform alone the cure of chronic diseases  i think it needless here to take any pains to show the inefficacy of all the common modes of practice vomiting purging bleeding blistering issues etc they have been found ineffectual not only in the gout but all other chronic cases all sensible practitioners must know their effects to be but temporary and that they are meant and used only as means of present relief let us see therefore by what practicable plan or regimen the person here described when a fit of the gout is happily ended may for ever prevent it is return and so confirm his general health that it shall not again be overset by every slight cold or trifling accident  i have already shown that a certain degree of activity or bodily motion is necessary at intervals every day to raise the circulation to that pitch that will keep the fine vessels open and the old blood pure and also make new from the fresh juices if the patient cannot be brought to this he has no chance of recovering to perfect health if therefore he can neither walk nor ride at all he must by degrees be brought to do both by the assistance of others which may be given him in the following manner let a handy active servant or two be employed to rub him all over as he lies in bed with flannels or flannel gloves fumigated with gums and spices which will contribute greatly to brace and strengthen his nerves and fibers and move his blood without any fatigue to himself this may seem but a trifling prescription to those who have never tried it sufficiently but is of the utmost consequence and it is effects are amazing especially to all those who are too weak to use any muscular motion themselves a little friction may have little or no effect but long continued and repeated often with fumigated flannels it will do more to recover health and support it afterward than most other things or methods it promotes circulation and perspiration opens the pores forces the fine vessels strains and purisies the blood and this without the assistance of any internal stimulation it is this that keeps horses in tolerable health with very little exercise  this may take up from five to ten minutes at first but must be repeated five or six times a day supposing him totally unable to help himself but if he can walk a hundred yards only it will forward him greatly to walk those hundred yards every two hours and if he can bear a carriage let him go out in it every day till he begins to be tired the first day or two all this may disturb and fatigue him a little but if he has patience to persevere to the fourth i dare promise him some amendment and increase of strength which he must employ as young merchants do a little money to get more thus he must go on rubbing walking and riding a little more and more every day slopping always upon the first sensation of weariness to rest a little till he be able to walk two or three miles at a stretch or ride ten without any weariness at all this is recommended with an intention to dislodge and throw off all remains of crude gouty concretions that may have obstructed his joints or lain concealed in any of the lacunae or recesses of his body to free the circulation in minimis and all it is secretions perspirations and discharges whatever and though this intention can never be but very defectively answered by medicines it may certainly be assisted and greatly promoted by a few wellchosen mild antimonial absorbent or saponaceous deobstruents and sweetners that like putting shot or gravel into a bottle with a good deal of agitation will greatly help to make it clean but without agitation will do nothing the asiatics understanding luxury much better than we do and knowing that it is not to be had without some degree of delicate health do just enough to keep them in this languid effeminate state free from pain those who are rich among them employ people called champers to rub chase and pat them all over at least twice a day to move their blood and keep their vessels free without any labor or exertion of their own powers this daily practice in hot countries where they live in the most slothful indolence is not only necessary to them but a great luxury the greeks and romans too when they became luxurious fell into habits of this kind and were strigilld and curried and bathed and oiled almost every day   while we are thus endeavoring to resolve all old obstructions to open the fine vessels and strain and purify the blood and by degrees to enable the man to use a certain degree of exercise or labor every day great care must be taken in the choice of his diet that no new acrimony be added to the old to thwart and frustrate this salutary operation his food must be soft mild and spentaneously digesting and in moderate quantity so as to give the least possible labor to the stomach and bowels that it may neither turn sour nor bitter nor rancid nor any way degenerate from those qualities necessary to make good blood such things are at first newlaid eggs boiled so as not to harden the white creamy part of them tripe calves feet chicken partridge rabbits most sorts of white mild fish such as whiting skate cod turbot etc and all sorts of shellfish particularly oysters raw very soon he will be strong enough to eat beef veal mutton lamb pork venison etc but these must all be kept till they are tender and eaten with their own gravies without any compounded sauces or pickles whatever instead of which boiled or stewed vegetables and sallads of lettuce and endive may be used and the luxury that is not unwholesome may be allowed light puddings custards creams blancmanger etc and ripe fruits of all kinds and seasons but because i have made what inquiries i could upon this capital article from living witnesses for i do not always pin my faith upon books knowing it to be no uncommon thing for authors instead of framing their system from observation and experience to wrest and explain both to support their opinions i have been assured by a physician who practiced above thirty years in turkey that from the danube to the euphrates he had never seen a gouty turk i have also been informed by some of our ministers who had resided many years at constantinople that the gout and other diseases of the same class were not uncommon at court but the courtiers it seems were not as good mahometans as those who lived in the country for they drank wine drams liqueurs of all sorts without restraint i have also been very creadibly informed that the gentoos or marratas a people of india living in the most temperate simplicity chiefly upon rice have no such thing as the gout or indeed any other chronic disease among them   wine undoubtedly produces nine in ten of all the gouts in the world wine must be avoided or taken very sparingly and but seldom how is this to be done can a man used to it every day who thinks he cannot live without it and that his existence depends upon it leave it off safely if he thinks he must die of the experiment doing it all at once he may do it by degrees and drink but half the quantity of yesterday till he has brought it to nothing but the danger of attempting it in this manner is that it will never be done and like a procrastinating sinner he will for ever put off his penitential resolution till tomorrow if he did it all at once i would be hanged if he died of the attempt he would be uneasy for three or four days that is all he may change his liquor and drink a little good porter or soft ale and by degrees come to small beer the wholsomest and best of all liquors except good soft water i do not mean that this rigorous abstinence from wine is to last for life but only during the conflict with the disease as soon as he has recovered health and strength to use exercise enough to subdue it he may safely indulge once a week or perhaps twice with a pint of wine for the sake of good humor and good company if they cannot be enjoyed without it for i would not be such a churl as to forbid or even damp one of the greatest joys of human life  if any man should say it is better to have a little gout than take all these pains and submit to this discipline this is not the alternative perhaps it may be more eligible to live at large and have but a little gout now and then that goes off well and leaves no trace behind but this is very seldom the case the misfortune is that a little gout most commonly comes again and again more severely till it becomes a great gout till it cripples the man and shortens his life at least twenty years embittering all the latter part of it if any one thinks this description of it which is the real state of the case nine times in ten preferable to that gradual exertion of his own powers and strictness of regimen or rather attention to himself with very moderate abstinence or selfdenial for a year or two as here recommended i have no reply to make him but must give him up to his own choice  the severity of these efforts and this abstemious care need be continued no longer than the disease or the effects of it remain when by perseverance in the practice of them together with the medical aids here recommended the patient shall have recovered his strength and locomotive powers he may preserve and perpetuate them and make good his title to longevity upon the following plan  he must never lose sight of the three great principles of health and long life activity temperance and peace of mind with these ever in view he may eat and drink of every thing the earth produces but his diet must be plain simple solid and tender or in proportion to his consumption he must eat but of one thing or two at most at a meal and this will soon bring him to be satisfied with about half his usual quantity for all men eat about twice as much as they ought to do provoked by variety he must drink but little of any liquor and never till he has done eating the drier every mans diet is the better no wine oftener than once or twice a week at most and this must be considered as a luxurious indulgence if he be sometimes led unawares into a debauch it must be expiated by abstinence and double exercise the next day and he may take a little of my magnesia and rhubarb as a good antidote or if he cannot sleep with his unusual load he may drink water and with his finger in his throat throw it up i have known some old soldiers by this trick alone never taking their dose to bed with them live to kill their acquaintance two or three times over one moderate meal a day is abundantly sufficient therefore it is better to omit supper because dinner is not so easily avoided instead of supper any good ripe fruit of the season would be very salutary preventing costiveness and keeping the bowels free and open cooling correcting and carrying off the heats and crudities of his indigestion  his activity need be no more than to persevere in the habit of rubbing all over night and morning for eight or ten minutes and walking three or four miles every day or riding ten or using any bodily labor or exercise equivalent to it in bad weather i can see no great evil in throwing a cloak round his shoulders and walking even in the rain the only difficulty is to summon resolution enough to venture out and a little use would take off all danger of catching cold by hardening and securing him against the possibility of it upon that and all other occasions if he dares not risque this some succedaneum must be used within doors more especially when bad weather continues any time i recommend it to all men to wash their feet every day the gouty in particular and not to lie abed above seven hours in summer and eight in winter  whoever thinks there cannot be luxury enough in this course of life i am persuaded will not find more in any other for good health with all it is natural appetites and sensations in perfect order is the only true foundation of luxury and whoever cultivates it upon the false principles of culinary or medical art urging to excess by stimulating provocatives of any kind instead of pleasure and enjoyment will meet with pain and disgust  some pehaps may be reasonable enough to observe and say this plan of yours is very simple there is nothing mavelous in it no wonderful discovery of any of the latent powers of medicine but will a regimen so easy to be complied with as this cure the gout stone dropsy etc will it repair broken constitutions and restore old invalids to health my answer is that if i may trust the experience of my whole life and above all the experience i have had in my own person having not only got rid of the gout of which i have had four severe fits in my younger days but also emerged from the lowest ebb of life that a man could possibly be reduced to by cholic jaundice and a complication of complaints and recovered to perfect health which i have now uninterruptedly enjoyed above ten years i say if i may rely upon all this i may with great safety pronounce and promise that the plan here recommended assisted at first with all the collateral aids of medicine peculiar to each case correcting many an untoward concomitant symptom pursued with resolution and patience will certainly procure to others the same benefits i received from it and cure every curable disease if this be thought too much to promise i beg it may be considered that a life of bad habits produces all these diseases nothing therefore so likely as good ones long continued to restore or preserve health  what can the best physician do more than discover and point out to his patients the real causes of their diseases you will say he must find a remedy this he will do for you also as long as he can but i will tell you a secret his remedies are chiefly evacuations and as long as your body can bear scouring and cleansing paracelsus was a good chemist but a miserable physician he invented that medicine which he most ridiculously called elixir proprietatis and from it is efficacy sot as he was promised himself the years of methusalem at first it did wonders scoured and carried off all his crapulary indigestions and kept him some time in health and spirits but trusting to it too long and repeating it too often it not only lost all it is power of doing good but hurt him greatly and he died i think at sixandthirty notwithstanding his elixir he will do you some temporary apparent service but when it begins to wear out his remedies will answer no longer you must try better methods you must not repeat the cause so often for he cannot for ever build up as fast as you can pull down in short you must reform your life and change all your bad habits for good ones and if you have patience to wait the slow operations of nature properly assisted you will have no reason to regret your former luxuries  we are all so much the creatures of habit which forms and fashions us to good or ill almost as much as nature itself that we ought to be very attentive and careful that our daily habits may ever tend to the confirmation not the destruction of health it is not what we do now and then that can injure us greatly but what we do every day must either do us great good or harm either establishing our health or fixing our diseases for life  if after all any man should say these restraints this care in choosing what is wholesome this constant watching over all we do would make life so grievous that health were not worth having upon these terms i wish him to slop a little and consider them well before he rejects them entirely and whether there be any better for him it can do him no great harm to try a month or two if he does i flatter myself he will find that custom will take off the greatest part of the grievance and perseverance make them not only tolerable but pleasant if he thinks health may be enjoyed upon easier terms i fear he will be miserably deceived for health like beauty may be won by our own attention efforts and assiduities but cannot be had by purchase whoever thinks to buy either will have the misfortune to find it not long his own though he has paid for it  but there may be others whom long suffering has made more patient and reasonable these may be glad to hear that a little health is to be had on any terms and it may be very comfortable to them to know that there is scarcely any state of weakness so low supposing the vitals not mortally hurt from which they may not recover into very desirable health and strength and by these means exerted with persevering patience i say this to invalids in general for thus may be cured not only the gout but very bad rheutisms ischiaticas rickets stone jaundice dropsy asthma cachexies and complications of many kinds not excepting even cancers if they are not too far gone for a cancer is nothing more than a place where nature deposits the bad humors of the blood as appears by its almost constant return to some other part after extirpation whatever chronic disease will not give way to this system of medication will be found i greatly fear too hard for any other and should there be a particular case in which some fortunate violence or chance may have apparently succeeded for a time the return of the evil or change to something worse can no way be so well guarded against and prevented as by some such rational and natural institution of life  thus have i endeavored to set forth the real causes of chronic diseases in general and the true principles of convalescence health and longevity if i have hazarded any thing new or contrary to received opinions it has been from a thorough conviction of it is truth however dangerous to fame and fortune both which i know are more easily acquired by complying with the world than attempting to reform it but it must be somebody equally indifferent to both as i am who will venture to tell such truths as are more likely to recoil and hurt the author than to convince and conciliate the bulk of mankind  the end
