of power what mighty mischief from ambition springs the fate of heroes and the fall of kings but these high themes however adorned by art have seldom gained the passes of the heart calm we behold the pompous mimick woe unmoved by sorrows we can never know ar other feelings in the soul arise when private griefs arrest our ears and eyes when the false friend and blameless suffering wife reflect the image of domestic life and still more wide the sympathy more keen when to each breast responsive is the scene and the sine cords that every heart intwine dilated vibrate with the glowing line  such is the theme that now demands your ear and claims the silent plaudit of a tear one tyrant passion all mankind must prove the balm or poison of our lives  is love loves sovereign sway extends over every

look up sir you are safe the tempests wildness seems hushed on shore where was your vessel bound   manoa ancona was her port the hurricane baffled our pilots skill and drove us headlong just as your ship made good her anchorage on the sharp rock where you beheld her split all my companions fifty luckless men sunk in my sight and i had shared their fate had not your strong arm saved me but alas we are in genoa if mine eyes deceive not  marcellus the fame   manoa too well i know it shield me heaven for what am i reserved  marcellus i hope to lose the memory of your grief and find peace here  manoa o no to lose my life if i am found here   marcellus pray let me know your story by your habit i guess you are not of our faith or nation  manoa i am by birth of syria but here sojourned twice twenty years in wealth and fair repute till christian malice or my nations curse or both combining turned me forth a wanderer look there that very mansion once was mine  marcellus i now recall some traces of that face your name is manoa  manoa ay that wretch am i thou have an aspect to benign and noble thou could not injure me  marcellus myself much sooner   manoa this state for its late levies against the turk called on all traffickers for sums of gold our tribe at my persuasion furnished them on rates so easy to the borrowers the native merchants offers were refused and public clamor and disgrace pursued them thence grew their hate of black and monstrous crimes avouchd on oath by witnesses suborned they charged me guiltless flight alone was left to save my hunted life  marcellus and i remember twas rumored you had perished by the sea attempting your escape and so believed knaves called your fate a judgment  manoa to prevent a hot pursuit the hebrews here in genoa by common concert spread abroad that rumor the death they feigned this morning but for thee my brave preserver had indeed oertaen me  marcellus i can do more to serve you name your wish   manoa at present this not far from hence resides the lord durazzo whose great wealth and power as heaven sends dews and sunshine are dispensed to gladden every humble thing beneath them let your men help me there for i am feeble and this disguise may save me from the note of those who pass  though in this slothful city few leave their down so early  marcellus sir farewell you shall hear more of me  manoa accept my prayers my hearts too full to speak the thanks i owe you  exit manoa with attendants marcellus he has been sorely wronged  but who goes there camillo passes over the stage i cannot sure mistake him it is camillo good kinsman turn and own a friend who loves you  camillo returns scene ii camillo marcellus camillo a gentle invitation ha marcellus welcome once more to genoa my dear cousin embracing we heard you had escaped with some slight hurts that bloody lingering business there at candia but such fierce storms of late have swept our coasts our fears were lest the angry elements leaguing alike against the christian cross might prove worse foes even than the infidels  marcellus we had rough weather but our sturdy bark outrode it is my mother well at leisure i shall fatigue your ear with other questions my ignorance and your kindness must excuse  camillo you have not seen her then   marcellus no i arrived within this hour and knowing how she loved loved even to dotage my poor brother claudio lost by a fate so strange and horrible i would not rush at once into her presence till some kind friend like you should first inform me how best to assuage her grief and hide my own  camillo thought like a son but o his vanished form again presented in your living likeness will with the strong extreme convulse her soul and joy so mixed with anguish doubly shake her  marcellus twas what i feared camillo i must try then to fix her fond attention on myself and shun that direful theme  camillo direful indeed how my heart shrinks even now think of it it is ever present to her tortured fancy and we who daily see her have observed our care to give the current of her thoughts a different course but swells up her impatience you know the lady fulvias ardent temper how sudden yet how strong in every feeling  marcellus our burning mountains when their fires burst forth rage not more fiercely than her breast inflamed but is it possible in all this time months after months elapsed no light no spark to guide to a discovery has been traced the turkish galleys so overspread the sea my letters rarely reached me while at candia  camillo what have you heard   marcellus but thus much and no more two days ere that for his intended marriage with good durazzos daughter lovely julia was claudio missing two days more were passed in fruitless search and sad anxiety when on the fifth some weary mariners flying for shelter from a furious storm midst the white caverns on the western shore a mile from genoa found his lifeless body in his clenchd hand was his own bloodstained sword and in his manly breast a mortal wound  camillo and there ends all our knowledge proclamation of vast rewards to find his murderer is still abroad through all the italian states the untouched jewels of his costly habit bright and conspicuous clearly manifest twas not the crime of men who kill for spoil  marcellus alas camillo well i know the place when we were boys it was our favorite haunt he could not sure have fallen by his own sword  camillo impossible a thought so black and sullen never dimmed the sunshine of his cheerful breast the joy he long had sighed for in his reach possessed of all that gilds the morn of life and each fair prospect brightning to his hopes besides the exalted tenor of his mind too firm and full for wild extremities they crush that black conclusion nay the skilful who searched the wound with closest art and care pronounced it not the execrable work of his own sword but some assassins steel  marcellus may wakeful conscience like a writhing snake if still he lives curl round the villains heart with sharpest venom to consume and gnaw him i know our base italian stabbing spirit in the close art of murder none excel us we read the very earth breathe the same air with our old latian fires but for their virtues as well might eagles rustle their large plumes where owlets roost or filthy kites engender as they find shelter in our dastard breasts  camillo let others rail but thines a nobler task to shame desenracy by fair example for twenty forward spirits like thine own might shake this state from its inglorious trance and rouse our sloth to gallant enterprise  marcellus i left it a luxurious worthless city  of its trash its wealth if such i find it i will not strike my lazy root at home to rot in rank contagious apathy but seek again a scene of vigorous action the unskilful perseverance of the turk still wakes excitement for a soldiers ardour  but who are those to earnest in discourse this way they move  camillo durazzo is the eldest   marcellus fair julias father him i know the other   camillo mentevole his name a noble youth and suitor hopelessly i think to julia though vulgar fame calls him a favored wooer but this report startling your mothers ear who brooks no slight to her sons memory has much estranged her from durazzos house and thus the bonds of their long amity the lie with many mouths has puffed asunder  marcellus my care all be to reunite their friendship but how must i esteem mentevole  camillo as one accomplished brave and liberal soon after your departure for the siege he came from travel home and was to claudio a second self  marcellus so shall he be to me i will wear him here but go thou to my mother prepare her for my coming for a moment leave me to greet this venerable lord and beg his introduction to the stranger exit camillo  scene iii to marcellus durazzo and mentevole the ruddy hue your visage owns my lord i see with pleasure is sound healths true ensign your eyes quick spirit too proclaims you fresh as when the race of careless youth began durazzo such is your wish marcellus and i thank you o welcome to thy country thy smooth cheek has changed its down for manhood since we parted but for these wellknown kindred lineaments i scarce durst swear thou were that playful boy whose frolicks used to mar our gravity and make us smile while chiding  marcellus i remember your goodness always now entreat your favor to recommend me to this lords esteem as by the title of my brothers friend he claims already mine  durazzo mentevole give him your hand  mentevole my heart too twas his brothers and by that pledge grows thus at once acquainted  durazzo marcellus you must tell me of your wars your mines your sallies ambuscades and dangers though now it is long since i was cased in steel the cresent of our swarthy foe has felt me  marcellus they are slugglish soldiers but right obstinate so numerous too it seems an caller task to kill than count them now twice fifty thousand and more have fallen in sacking one poor isle yet like light foam chafed by the curling surge each hour new turbans whiten round its shores  but yet i have not visited my mother and she by this expects me  durazzo get thee to her unhappy lady may your presence cheer her  exit marcellus scene iv durazzo mentevole is he not like to claudie  mentevole rather say is it not himself as ere the tomb received him but dear my lord by all that charmed your youth forgive me though i seem importunate o win your daughter to accept my vows for i have loved to such a mad excess so stored up every thought of happiness in that fond hope should i prove bankrupt there i dare not look to earth or heaven for comfort  durazzo mentevole i doubt not of your love my daughter too believes it a feigned passion speaks not your fervent language   mentevole a feigned passion thus hear me swear   durazzo oaths are unnecessary my tongue has not been niggard of your praise i have tried entreaties too a harsh command heard with repugnancy that she should love because her anxious father deems it meet or you would have it so might change at once the indifference you complain of to aversion thus the calm lake that slept at peace before turns a strong tide and sets against your wishes  mentevole o the degrees my lord are infinite between a harsh command and such persuasion as every day the fondest parents use in tender strife with a coy maids reluctance were i to plead as a feed advocate even for a scanty rood of barren earth i should account me faithless to my charge my rhetoric oerprizd at one poor ducat did i neglect a gloss or argument might sway the unwilling judge to my decision  durazzo instruct me to speed better i shall thank you   mentevole my words my action should have life and grace i would probe his reason try his every humor wind to his inmost soul grow to his eye watch where impression stole upon his sense there ply my strength where most i found him weak nor cease to urge till i had conquered him  durazzo passion thus blindfold sees no obstacle young man young man be calm a while and hear me  mentevole yet tell me not my suit is desperate sooth though you cannot heal and i will listen as if i lived by every sound you uttered and death and inattention were the same  durazzo you knew long since to see my daughter wedded without a variance twixt her choice and mine was my prime wish malignant destiny marred that fair prospect the assassins stab had almost pierced with one pernicious stroke two faithful breasts anguish unutterable on her soft frame laid such a deadly grasp too long i trembled for her life and reason  mentevole spare me my lord o spare me the remembrance it harrows me too deeply  durazzo can you question i wish to see her unavailing sorrow changed to gay festivals and bridal joy or think you that supinely i can view thus childless but in her my houses honors my large estates sunk in a virgins tomb or scattered amongst remote and thankless kindred when by alliance with your wellmatchd love such near and natural heirs may spring to bless me  mentevole why grant it all yet how have i prevailed my presence she endures for you desired it yet if the only theme can touch me nearly but trembles from my tongue her cheek turns pale her blood runs back as mustering to her heart to fortify the access more strong against me i pity him who thinks he has known distress and never felt the pang of hopeless love the consummation of all other ills is light and trivial to that misery  durazzo time may do much nor shall my aid be wanting urge me no more nor doubt me your kind sister olympia the companion she holds dear may unobserved watch every soft approach and steal a lovers image on her fancy but lo she comes farewell i go to serve you  exit durazzo scene v mentevole alone he goes to serve me let his feeble breath turn ice to fire wake in her frozen bosom such hot consuming flames as i feel here o i could sluice my veins mangle this form this common form that wants the power to move her scene vi to him olympia tell me olympia are not women wooed by constancy and deepprotested oaths by living on their smiles by nice attentions by yielding up our reason to their humors by adoration of their beautys power by sighs and tears by flattery kneeling fawning tell me how many ways a manly mind must be debased to win a ladys smile olympia that which by baseness only can be gained were better undesird but say good brother why do you question with such angry haste and what strange fury ruffles all your mien give me your hand it burns you are not well your mind unquiet fevers thus your blood  mentevole no no a womans coldness your fair friend  teach her to smile and my distemper dies  olympia she has no sense of joy that beauteous flower bows its sweet head over claudios bloody grave  mentevole must that eternal sound grate on me still have thou been faithful to me have thou told her how thou have seen these lids even at her name swell with unbidden tides or melting fondness whole nights how i have filled thy patient ear and she my only theme how many times when chance has given her beauties to my sight thou have beheld me trembling try to speak and gaze away my meaning  olympia nay my lord endeavors true as mine disdain suspicion and let me say if she should never consent   mentevole how is that take heed if she should never consent put not my life on chilling supposition make it the doubt olympia of a moment and though thou art my sister and a dear one by heaven i almost think that i shall hate thee for here i swear deeply and calmly swear it the hour which sees me desperate of her love sl be my last  lympia for shame be more a man   mentevole by the great power which gave me sense and being i will wrest from fate my follys chastisement and this right hand shall end me  olympia oh how shocking to hear with what devout impiety thou dare call heaven the witness of an oath outrageous to its own blessed providence  mentevole well be it as it may i have sworn it knows she that young marcellus is arrived  olympia yes and the pleasing tidings for a moment dispelled the cloud that dimmed her beauteous eyes instant she begged me and with warmth unusual to bear her greetings to his mother fulvia i now was on my way  mentevole then bear thy message go be the agent to destroy thy brother this compliment i know is but the prelude to invite a second claudio in marcellus  olympia if peace be worth a wish and love be such in every other bosom as in thine let the short story on my gravestone tell nor loving nor beloved olympia died  mentevole you never wished more wisely but forgive me pardon my infirmity it is too like madness  olympia it is worse for madmen have their intervals thines an eternal rage going  mentevole go not in anger return i will be calm return olympia thus on my knee let me entreat you hear me  offering to knee olympia pray rise we may be seen what is it go on   mentevole i have a neverfailing instinct here which prompts me what to dread this young marcellus   olympia well what of him   mentevole i know will see her shortly crowd all thy faculties into thine eye read his reception keenly mark him too and give me note of every circumstance their words their looks let not a glance escape thee promise me so and from this hour olympia thy prudence shall be my sole counselor though you enjoin me to be blind and mute i will bear it patient as the tutored child whose fond instructor smiles and teaches him  olympia keep these conditions and command my service i linger here too long  remember patience  exit olympia scene vii mentevole alone and what more likely he is claudios brother noble as he and decked too with the plume of brave adventure in the candian war younger and not less comely she may call it as women make shrewd logic for their likings truth to the memory of her former vows to embrace the living brother for the dead and so find faith in her inconstancy i know not why my genius shrinks at him the very fear craves vengeance like a wrong beware gay stripling no degenerate awe of what may be can check my fiery course she must be mine and shall be for the means or good or ill necessity must shape them the end of the first act act ii scene i a chamber in durazzos palace julia alone at a table putting up papers which she has been reading she presses them passionately to her heart kisses them and speaks dear sad remembrances my tears have stained you o foolish drops wash not away my treasure unenvied unobserved and solitary let me indulge this luxury of grief my claudios soul was poured out on these papers and every little word recalls him to me lovely beloved in beautys manly bloom protesting welcome vows and breathing passion scene ii to her olympia returned so speedily my gentle friend your cares are so preventive of my wishes i shall begin to expect beyond all bounds and grow presuming from too much indulgence olympia from fulvia and her son i bring my julia a thousand kind endearments both together with cordial acceptance heard your message and presently both mean to visit you  julia why does not pleasure kindle through my frame and mount up to my cheek at such glad tidings the time has been i should have glowed at this counting the impatient moments till her coming  but my repining heart deserves no blessings  olympia to labor to forget i know is vain the fond endeavor toils against itself and deeper graves the idea twould efface yet there are means   julia unprofitable all how have i dragged about this weary load through every change of place and circumstance i mingled with the young the gay the happy forcing a hollow smile at giddy joy while my pale heart sat mocking it within the arrow sticking here from scene to scene you led my sad insensibility the objects varying but my soul the same  olympia too much i fear we tried and you endured our wellmeant unavailing services  julia could i forbear i would not weep olympia indeed i would not for it pains my friends twas such a black unapprehended horror so sudden and so dreadfully consummate i sometimes for a moment close my eyes and strive to think i have had a hideous dream that quite awake twill vanish from my brain that still he lives and i again shall see him ah no the short illusion is the dream claudio thy death the dire reality  olympia the volume of his days too soon was closed but grace and honor had so filled the record each page outweighd a long lifes history  julia this was the hour when my dear father came trembling and pale to falter out the tidings that instant mighty ruler of our fates had thy exterminating arm reached here these floods of bitter tears this black despair had not beep numbered with the sins of julia  olympia tame languid minds whose course glides dully on yield as the stream to the sharp severing keel to close as quickly on each transient wound but woes deep traces never leave thy breast  julia was i not mad olympia i remember i felt the stab in genoa  when i waked the place nor aught around me were the fame i saw the smooth bisagnio as i lay rolling his quiet tide beneath my window it seemed elysium and the peaceful shades where guiltless lovers are no more divided  olympia but now my friend collect your fortitude nor start when you behold your claudios image recalled to life and blooming in marcellus i know he will soon be here  julia why should i dread it  disused even to the shadow of a joy my fickly apprehension plays the coward yet i will see him  olympia you turn pale my julia shall i forbid his coming  julia no this weakness will pass away a treacherous hectic wastes me i shall not suffer long  is he to like so very like his brother  olympia features stature almost the same somewhat a bolder air yet gentle still and youthful as he is a little frown of discontented thought casts over his brow a momentary shade that seems not native to his generous aspect  julia in such an aspect was my paradise but now pale lead lies on that mouldering face whose beams shot rapture once to julias bosom  olympia by nature framed for every genial bliss turn gently turn from that cold retrospect and there is one   julia i know whom you would name   olympia then smile and name him for me   julia no i cannot i cannot smile and name mentevole but yet i much respect him  olympia bare respect for passion such as his  julia olympia spare me in this alone i must seem obstinate  olympia alas poor brother aside   julia hark my father comes hold him a little moment in discourse i would not have him see i had been weeping  julia retires a little scene iii to julia and olympia durazzo durazzo i come olympia to this chamber door to learn my destiny as we inquire from those who wake us if the sun looks bright or clouds obscure him and then suit our garments to meet the changeful temper of the sky so by the color of my daughters health my mind is dressed for gladness or dejection  olympia i think she mends her sorrow that was silent finds some relief in utterance she approaches  julia your blessing sir   durazzo o may it drop upon thee refreshing as mild dews on vernal flowers to kill the canker that consumes thy fragrance  julia my heart my grateful heart owns all your goodness and could my first devotion reach the sky time and your honored days should end together  durazzo not too long life pray not for curses on me helpless uncomely loathed and burdensome i would not cling to the last hold of nature nor lag without one social cord to aid me surviving my companions of the voyage the world to me would seem a ruined vessel a worthless wreck when manned alone by strangers let my heart burst at once with some great feeling let me go all together to my grave not maimed and piecemeal with infirmity  i have lived enough could i but see thee happy  julia that will not be   durazzo i swear it must it shall be and come i have a suit which you must grant me  julia my dearest father throwing her arms round him   durazzo change these mourning weeds for outward signs though trifles in themselves when the minds weak and spirits delicate to fancy in herself too powerful lend their mute aid and make her workings stronger  julia this habit was best suited to my mood but shall no more offend you  durazzo fair olympia i now must beg your aid your constant brother nor does proud genoa boast a nobler youth with adoration such as saints pay heaven devotes his service here  julia ah sir for pity i feel myself not worthy of his passion my soul is out of tune to flattery the fondest vows that ever lover sighed might wring my eyes but never warm my heart  durazzo nay stop these tears i will urge this theme no more and see an honored visitant approaches receive her not in sorrow  scene iv to them fulvia marcellus behind julia and fulvia embrace fulvia lovely julia in this embrace i hoped to have clasped a daughter to have called thee mine by an endearing tie that yields alone to natures closest bond but though that fleet delusive dream is vanished with pride i own thy native excellence these eager throbbings while i hold thee thus are stronger protestations how i prize thee than all the lavish praise my tongue could utter  julia here let me grow for ever none divide us methinks when these protecting arms enfold me longvanishd peace seems to return once more and spread her dovelike wings again to shield me  marcellus they told me truth i never saw such beauty   aside looking at julia fulvia vile slander on my life has wronged her virtue  aside have i not seemed unkind so many months a stranger here where evernew delight sprung in our paths where each returning morn among the happy found me happiest but o i feared for thee and for myself our walks these chambers every senseless object by known relation to our common loss had conjured up to our accustomed sense sad visions of his looks his gestures words and multiplied the ideas we should banish  julia i judged it not unkindness for i know your generous nature feels for all who suffer and if to have been once supremely blessed to have reached the height of every human wish then sudden  but your swelling eyes reproach me you owned him first before his birth you loved him but o this selfish grief forgets all titles  fulvia yet join with me to bless that providence which bending gracious to a parents prayer midst all the perils of destructive war preserved one pillar of my falling house come near my son and in this fair perfection behold what next to thee the world contains most precious to thy mother  marcellus who has been behind with durazzo advances julia saints and angels starting am i awake or is this mockery o i could gaze for ever on that face nor wish to rouse me from the dear delusion still let me know him only by my eyes o do not speak lest some unusual sound an alien to my ear dissolve this vision and tell me thou but wearst my claudios outside  marcellus if it commend me madam to your favor i would not change it for the comliest form that ever charmed the eye with fair proportion but stop not at the exterior search me deeply for proof command me instant to your service though peril walk with death in the achievement swifter than falcons through the trackless air my eager thoughts shall fly to your obedience  julia take heed take heed tempt not the dangerous shore rocks shelves and quicksands lurk i fear around me and let one gallant vessels shipwreck warn thee  shun the same course and find a happier fortune  marcellus i fear no shelves no quicksands but thy frown awed and enraptured i behold such beauty and while i talk thus wish to find some language fit for a being of a sphere above me  a servant enters and whispers olympia olympia julia a word mentevole attends to julia aside and asks to be admitted  julia now not now indeed i cannot see him quick my olympia prevent his entrance my poor fluttering heart if suddenly that name is founded to me beats like a imprisoned bird against its cage when some annoying hand is stretched to seize it  durazzo madam this day which brings you back to us to fulvia we should make festival your presence here has wrought a miracle i have not seen a smile of joy enlighten that dear face heaven knows how long till you brought sunshine with you  fulvia i have upbraidings for my absence here the cause i am sure a false one in atonement let me observe her with a mothers care invention shall be racked to find new means to lure her thoughts to sweet serenity she shall not see the frequent tears that wear their woeful channel down a parents cheeks and to the brightest source of mortal comfort i will commend her when i kneel to heaven  durazzo may plumes of seraphs waft your pious prayers the tenderness of women has a charm our rougher natures can attain but rudely your voices are such dulcet instruments they steal the listening soul from its affliction to wind it gently in the soft enchantment  fulvia o may that power be mine observe my julia my lord commits you to my guardianship do you confirm the trust  julia an outcasts fortune a light pitiless fall on me could i fail to bend with reverence for your dear protection  fulvia come let us hence the air is mild abroad julia we must not sink but strive to banish that restless inbred foe to the afflicted reflection from our bosoms  julia would i could but deaths long sleep alone can banish him  exeunt all but marcelus marcellus my soul and all its faculties go with her looking after julia grace beauty sweetness all that captivates and holds us long in dear delicious bonds indissoluble bonds for time too strong for change or casualty are summed up there divinity of love absolute master from this white hour to thy allpotent sway thus i submit me hence all idle thoughts i chase you forth fullplumd ambition glory arms and the war farewell her brighter image claims all my bosom and disdains a rival exit  scene vi a place before durazzos palace mentevole with a letter and a servant convey this letter to the lady fulvia be muffled close and cloakd that none may know you speak not a word but leave it and return exit servant pride and suspicion in her violent temper from this short scroll will work rare mischief for me one spark will set her passions in a blaze a hint to her is proof demonstrative  so  i must bear this too she will not see me her health is delicate but young marcellus he fits a ladys chamber at all seasons soft as favonius  and a cherubs cheek is not so smooth and rosy precious minion they think me sure a tame enduring slave a trampled clod they shall not find me such the scanty drop which once was patience here flames as it flows and kindles all my nature to its own element of tire within me ha he appears choke me not indignation prey inwards down while i dissemble calmness mentevole retires a little scene vii marcellus enters looking back ay there is the attraction thou unconscious house thy turrets should be cased with beaten gold for thou enshrinst a goddess  can it be not three years passed regardless of her charms day after day i saw her and forgot them or does the beauty of the fullblown rose surpass the promise of the opening bud i sure loved claudio well no brothers bond was truer to a brother yet self self this sudden flower now springs up from his grave that in a brother lies a rival buried mentevole advances my lord well met you then have seen this wonder has fame exceeded think you  marcellus how exceeded   mentevole spoke julia fairer than your eyes confess her   marcellus all eyes all hearts with rapture must confess her   mentevole then i must think you do not mean to pine in silent adoration  marcellus what blessed strain can touch that gentle bosom  mentevole take my counsel devote thy soul to any thing but love steep thy drenched senses in the madning bowl heap gold and hug the mammon for itself set provinces on dice over the pale lamp of sickly science waste thy vigorous youth rush to the war or cheer the deeptongud hound be thou the proverbd slave of each or all they shall not be so noxious to thy soul as dainty womans love  marcellus if this be counsel it comes with such a harsh and boisterous breath i more discern the freedom than the friendship  mentevole falsely our poets deck the barbarous god with roseat hue with infants dimpling smiles with wanton curls and wings of downy gold  he dips his darts in poisonous aconite the fiery venom rankles in our veins infuses rage and murderous cruelty  marcellus the richest juice poured in a tainted jar turns to a nauseous and unwholesome draught but we condemn the vessel not the wine so gentle love lodged in a savage breast may change his nature to a tygers fierceness  mentevole away with vain disguise mark me my lord i long have loved this lady with a passion too quick and jealous not to find a rival too fierce to brook him she receives my vows her father favors them wealth titles honor my rank in the state and many fair additions surpassed by none keep buoyant my full hopes if yet your hearts untouched i ask entreat it and strangers grant such common courtesies forbear your visits to her  marcellus believe this were there a fasting lion in my path i would rather this good steel here by my side should grow one piece with the sheath or in my grasp shrink to a bulrush but to mock the wielder than feed you with the smallest hope or promise i mean not to fulfill  mentevole then we are oes   marcellus i am sorry for it   mentevole deadly irreconcilable two eager racers starting for one goal both cannot win but shame must find the loser you step between me and the light of heaven you strive to rob me of my lifes best hope for life without her were my curse my burden with cruel calmness you pluck out my heart therefore were the worlds bounds more wide and large they could not hold us both  marcellus i little thought to draw my sword against my brothers friend and here attest heaven and my peaceful soul you drag this quarrel on me  mentevole yonder herd who prying now would interrupt our purpose will two hours hence be housed to avoid the sun then riding at his height at home i will wait you and lead you thence to a sequestered spot fit for the mortal issue of our meeting  marcellus since you will have it so    mentevole the die is cast have i the bulk and sinewy strength of man but to sustain a heavier injury let cowards shiver with a smothered hate and fear the evil valor might avert the brave mans sword secures his destiny exeunt severally  the end of the second act act iii scene i a garden behind mentevoles house mentevole alone on a garden seat looking at a picture and must i be content with thee poor shadow yet she is less kind than this her counterfeit for this looks pleased and seems to smile upon me o what a form is here her polished

be denied and when you know why i am here you will have cause to bless not chide me for the intrusion  mentevole then be quick for other cares and of more serious import will presently demand me speak your purpose  olympia my lips would give my purpose little grace when she who sent me forward but to find you can speak it for herself i came with julia  mentevole with julia do not mock me   olympia turn your eyes to yonder cypress see who there expects you  mentevole by all my hopes of happiness it is she like a descended angel there she stands  olympia herself indeed then haste conduct her hither   mentevole rushes out scene iii olympia sees and take up the picture ay as i thought her picture on this face his eyes were fed when my approach surprised him thou fair consumer of his pining soul o thou delicious poison for a while though he may grieve let me withhold thee from him with what a blaze of wealth has he adorned it what gems are here i will leave it in her sight this silent proof should more commend his suit than hotbreathd vows whose common vehemence their common violation quickly follows scene iv to olympia mentevole leading in julia julia well may you be surprised nor can you question when you behold me here how deep the interest that urges me to seek you  mentevole to behold you whatever the cause is such excess of bliss how how shall i pour out my enraptured sense how thank this condescension  julia good my lord the anxious bosom ill at ease like mine partakes no raptures calmness and attention if i deserve your thanks will better thank me  mentevole thou soul of all my passions this fond breast is but the obedient instrument whose chords as you think meet sound high or sink to silence  julia i have heard of your late outrage to marcellus   mentevole has he complained and to a ladys ear   julia wrong not his welltried courage no the attendants saw all your furious gestures heard your challenge and for prevention to olympia ran to alarm us of the danger  olympia he is concealed and has been since your parting that confirms it  julia waste not the precious minutes in denial   mentevole fool that i was no kind concern for me the safety of marcellus made you seek me  julia and i avow the motive am i held like those grim idols barbarous nations worship by cruel rites to be propitiated if love prevail not dressed in smiles and softness arrayed in blood will the fell monster charm me no if you prize my peace it you desire i ever more should name mentevole or suffer him in thought but with abhorrence dismiss your causeless hate to claudios brother  mentevole let him dismiss his love to claudios mistress   julia your own imaginary light suggestion he boasts it glories in it causeless hate causeless to hate the envenomed thing that stings me diseases curdle up his youthful blood and mar his specious outside  julia watchful angels keep him in charge and over his gallant head spread their protecting wings to avert thy curses  mentevole ha am i then    olympia is this your promised patience   mentevole what can i do   julia what reason bids you do not to repent but to commit a wrong gives shames true crimson to the ingenuous cheek ask his indulgence and confess your frenzy  mentevole the boy may think i fear him   julia no not so what generous spirit is not slow to ascribe motives to others which itself would scorn are you alone too mighty to have erred rather suspect your pride revolts to own it acknowledge it and then have cause for pride and rise exalted by humility contrition is fair virtues meekeyd sister her drops can wash offense to fleecy white turning our sins to gracious intercessors the wisest sometimes may do wrong from passion but conscious of that wrong the ruffian only by brutal perseverance twice does wrong mean pride false principle true honor scorns them  mentevole it goes against my natures bent   julia indeed then hear me hear this solemn protestation if you persist by that benevolent power whose blessed beams avert from violence whose law forbids it   mentevole o enough forbear yes you shall be obeyed i will put on the meek demeanor of repenting rashness and to the foe i hate thus bending cry forgive me since you will it yet remember i thus degrade me in mine own esteem only to rise in yours your liberal nature will give my free compliance its best gloss it shows your full dominion over my soul that joyfully prefers your least command even to my honor which i risk to obey you  julia the act bespeaks itself i must remember my peace or misery was in your power you chose the gentler part and made me happy  mentevole transporting thought behold i fly to meet him the hour is come marcellus now expects me farewell my eyes at variance with my tongue still gaze and cannot bear to lose thy beauties  exit mentevole scene v julia olympia olympia indeed he loves you   julia would to heaven he did not it looks methinks like hard ingratitude to render aught for love but equal love esteem the best affection i can offer seems but a dull unvalued counterpoise and pays the glowing ore with worthless lead though all be little to give all is bounty exeunt  scene vi enter at an opposite side marcellus and mentevole marcellus enough my lord this fair acknowledgment has raised your justice high in my esteem a soldiers honor can require no more and sure it is better thus to join our hands than try their strength in rude hostility  mentevole i was your brothers friend and while he lived though the same passion that still fires my soul then fiercely burned for this enchanting julia yet from respect for his precedent claim and to her choice avowed within my breast i kept the painful secret he so loved me the wound he could not heal i would not show then sure full equally from you marcellus new to her charms at least i may expect a like declining  marcellus good mentevole let us find some safer subject  mentevole no this only i cannot speak or think of aught but her she is my essence feeds wakes sleeps with me is vital to me as the air i breathe but mark i am composed no violence lives in my thoughts or shall disgrace my tongue  marcellus then lest i move your temper let me leave you   mentevole no prythee no not thus unsatisfied i will not contend but her transcendent beauty even at first sight must strike the gazers eye with admiration which might grow to love but is it possible one interview for you but once have seen her should so root her image in your soul that all your bliss or future misery depends on her  marcelles regard not me but reason for yourself if all your faithful vows your length of courtship her fathers favor and the nameless aids which time and opportunity have furnished raise not your hopes above a rivals power say were it not more wise and manly too to rouse and shake off such a hard dominion  mentevole how cold you talk good heaven i might as well resolve to change my nature bid my ear see for my eye or turn my blood to milk newstamp my features and newmould my limbs make this soft flesh that yields to every print impassive as thin air waste time and thought on any wild impossibility as be the thing i am and cease to love her  marcellus then take my lord your course while i shall follow the counsel which i offer once rejected no more to persecute where most i love i shall retire and mourn repulse in silence  mentevole so then my lord my suit is persecution   marcellus i said it not but since you will search further i have heard almost as much  mentevole and who informed you   marcellus a lower tone perhaps may meet an answer   mentevole i will be answered   marcellus will  hot man farewell going   mentevole come back i will answer for you your own pride    marcellus ha have a care   mentevole your boyish vanity your fond conceit of that imposing form   marcellus i will bear no more this insolence and rudeness have roused my rage and thus i answer thee  they fight mentevole is disarmed mentevole my life is yours strike home showing his breast   marcellus take back your sword and when your peevish spleen next swells within you let this deserved rebuke subdue your choler  exit marcellus scene vii mentevole alone he triumphs every way vile baffled wretch where shall i hide my ignominious head while love remorse and rage at once overwhelm me exit

magnificent hall in durazzos palace the duke of genoa with guards and other attendants in the center fulvia etc on one side durazzo camillo and julia with their attendants on the other fulvia i have obeyed the summons of your grace yet when i see the seat of justice changed from the grave bench where once she used to frown even to the chambers of my adversaries i look for such an issue as hereafter will make this novelty no precedent but to be shunned and noted for the abuse  duke the sanctity of justice is the heart of him who judges place makes no distinction and when the veil of passion is removed when with clear eyes you see the good we mean you yourself i know will thank us for this course and own our swerving from the common form was kind to all concerned  fulvia may it prove so   julia you see me here brought for so strange a cause i can but with astonishment look round nor know i whom to oppose or what to answer it is hard to make my affliction my offense and the black deed which saddens all my days  the source the bitter source of every sorrow  the ground to load me with reproach and shame yet here am i accused  i cannot speak it  accused of what  to say i am innocent would be such mean such base indignity to the great spirit of my exalted love i would rather burst with the proud sense of scorn and leave my silence to your worst surmise than utter such a word  duke o it is too much   durazzo you are apprisd my lord with what intent my daughter secretly this morning sought a meeting with mentevole  duke i know it  and grieve to find so gentle an intent has met such hard construction from good fulvia  fulvia reserve my lord your pity till we ask it and counsel ignorance we know our purpose  duke as we our duty and behold the man first in our present search takes his seat  scene iv enter mentevole know you my lord why we assemble here mentevole yes clamours throat has roared it in our streets i passed along through files of obloquy our sapient rabble reverse the order of the magistracy and ere they hear condemn us  duke then my lord as you regard your honor and your life touched by suspicion to the quick this instant account for your possession of that picture that lady there dead claudios mother swears it was her sons and worn around his neck the day he disappeared behold do you know it do you allow you dropped it  mentevole yes but not that it was claudios yet i cannot wonder two objects so alike should seem the same  fulvia should seem the same   duke have patience gentle lady   mentevole i say should seem for it is barely seeming from that which claudio owned the artists boast myself not meanly in the science skilled painted this picture love my pencils guide and from the image in my heart engraved assisted by the model such i made it that not the most discerning nicest eye from the first beauteous draught could know that copy  fulvia and had you skill to paint those jewels too those jewels in the round their hue and luster so singular and bright by every power these were my sons  mentevole no give me hearing madam those too i purchased from the very merchant who furnished claudio all who hear me know the name of manoa his services to this ungrateful state his flight his death which i lament since living he could witness and strike you dumb that by my special order he chose these precious gems in form and color so like to claudios none could mark distinction to pay their value my estate was strained but had their estimation been twice doubled a crown imperial deemed the mighty price rather than yield him preference in aught might seem a test of my extravagant love i would have grasped at it and so remained the ruined happy lord of that sole treasure now learn from hence how wisdom should demur to found a sentence on appearances your grace is satisfied here durazzo whispers camillo who goes out  duke i own to me no proof appearing to the contrary if this be so your honor seems acquitted  fulvia but not to me o undiscerning lord is this your inquisition this your justice i am not satisfied my heart still tells me that picture was my sons so reason tells me nor should a voucher from the yawning grave shake my conviction  that good manoa did sell these jewels to my slaughtered son and he it is true conveniently is dead but he had heirs and kindred summon them a treasure such as this could not be sold without their knowledge instantly convene them and act through shame as if you sought for truth else your grave robes will be the jest of boys and my sons blood will cry till death against you  mentevole do not suppose i scoff at this grave presence when thus i smile in my security produce such witnesses what could they prove their ignorance perhaps in what you ask them but we have clear and positive laws to guard us  julia so long i have said little fearful ever to give offense where all my care has been to manifest respect esteem and honor even with a daughters duteous humbleness but thus much let me add i here disclaim as most abhorrent to my thoughts and nature all common interest union and accord with him for whom i suffer in the censure of that ungentle lady and believe firmly like her that picture was her sons and there before you stands his murderer  mentevole why stay i here my lord if you have power to give me reparation for the stain cast on my honor by this foolish process pronounce it straight if not thus i withdraw from those vexed eyes which glare with fury on me  durazzo soft you a while for lo you who comes here even to your

curses of his nation light upon him aside  julia the villains cheek turns pale his fate has found him aside   duke surprise to see you here no way abates to manoa our pleasure at your welfare blushing deeply we own the state has wronged you but soon purpose to give you full redress  manoa my humblest thanks   duke takes is seat at present we must set aside that care for one which now employs us no more thanks we yet deserve them not  come nearer still gives manoa the picture take this examine it do you remember observe them well the jewels round that picture  manoa most sure my lord they are by no means common but all indeed most rare and singular  duke they once were yours who was their purchaser   manoa a noble youth by whose untimely death genoa has lost her brightest ornament even in the depth of my own misery my heart dropped blood to hear the fate of claudio  duke did you at any time think ere you answer procure for any other purchaser jewels like these  manoa never my lord   mentevole out dotard thy miseries have crazed thy memory to me these gems were sold look on me well i was the friend of claudio think old man a noble persons life and reputation more dear than life

gems nor any like them save to noble claudio  duke hear you my lord   mentevole i hear a faithless jew a slave suborned a traitor to the state a bankrupt fugitive and outcast hebrew aver  he knows not

uninstructed of the cause for which you summoned me nor know i now why i am thus reviled for my true answer  duke to mentevole it can avail you naught to disallow the proof yourself appealed to  manoa

missed him we took together our accustomed walk when this too certain arm achievd the deed which long lay brooding in my jealousy  fulvia deliberate cursed assassin   julia o my heart   mentevole he talked with rapture of the approaching bliss till passion drowned his sight with eyes upcast then drew that picture hanging round his neck from underneath his garment glewd his lips with transport to the beauteous lifeless form my smothered fury rose at once to madness with one hand from his grasp i tore the picture and with the other smote him to the heart julia faints  durazzo my daughter ha the blood forsakes her cheeks my life my all look up  fulvia running to julia dear injured maid live but to see my penitence my tears thou lovely sufferer o wake and hear me alas she heeds me not my

heart one drop of mercy to fall upon a wretch whose savage fury outraged thy virtues pierced thy tender soul mocking thy bitterest pangs o julia julia kneeling  julia rise madam rise these supplicating hands your streaming eyes and that respected body thus bowed with grief and grovelling on the earth are sights unfit for her whose dying beams with tender reverence must still behold you alas resentment at this awful moment can find no place in my departing spirit for all will soon be peace  fulvia thou saintlike goodness unmoved i saw thy tears saw the sweet blush of thy wronged innocence for pity hate me in life in death rise not so much above me  julia give me your hand my last tears fall upon it as these dissolving drops part from my eyes so melts the memory of all past

was mine is well exchanged for blessed eternity thine shall be long and happy  marcellus never never infinite woe from this black hour awaits me yet let me print on that pale beauteous hand one sad adieu o that my soul could pass thus by every sacred power that hears i swear my lips thus hallowed by this holy kiss shall never again   julia eagerly as you regard my peace my last my earnest prayer

light dawn on my sense my pains grow less this load will soon fall off i shall be happy weep not mercy oh dies  curtain falls the end of the fifth act epilogue written by john courtenay esquire spoken by mrs siddons though tender sighs breathe in the tragic page what lover now complains  but on the stage no suitor now attempts his rivals life but lets him take that cordial balm  a wife and yet to prove his pure and constant flame still loves his mistress in the wedded dame still courts his friend and still devoutly bows at the fair shrine where first he breathed his vows for love she knows some gratitude is due searches her heart and finds there is room for two and often sees her coy reluctance over good cause to prize her caro sposo more thus modish wives with sentimental spirit may go astray to prove their husbands merit  or open the door in this commodious age without deaths aid to scape from wedlocks cage  abjuring rules that soon will seem romance loves gayer system we import from france rescind politely our old english duty and take off all restraints from wine and beauty while lighter manners cheer our native gloom as spanish wool refines the british loom had fashions law of old such influence shed the raptured claudio never had timeless bled his bliss with joy mentevole had seen and julias favorite cicishe had been the assiduous lover and the husband bland like brentfords kings had still walked hand in hand together still had shone at park and play quaffing the fragrance of the same bouquet our varlet poet with licentious speech thus far our injured sex has dared impeach the female character thus rudely slurrd it is fit at last that i should have a word  first then without rejoinder or dispute this virtuous circle might each charge refute that it is a nuptial age i sure may say with their own wives when husbands run away  but truce with jest however the wits may rail the cause of truth and virtue must prevail of former times whatever may be told we are just as good as ever they were of old connubial love here long has fixed his throne and bliss is ours to foreign climes unknown if now and then a tripping fair is sound on scandals wings the buzzing tale flies round while blameless thousands in sequestered life adorn each state of parent friend and wife from private cares never wish abroad to roam and bless each day the sunshine of their home unnoticed keep their noiseless happy course nor dream of second wedlock or divorce  i see the verdicts ours you smile applause so with your leave again i will plead our cause new triumphs nightly over this railer gain and to the last our female rights maintain  finis
