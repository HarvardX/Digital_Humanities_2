the triumph of prudence over passion vol ii  the triumph of prudence over passion or the history of miss mortimer and miss fitzgerald  by the authoress of emeline  in two volumes  vol ii  dublin printed for the author by s colbert no     caplestreet opposite abbeystreet  mdccxxxi  the history of miss mortimer and miss fitzgerald volume the second letter xxxii miss fitzgerald to miss mortimer feb    i could not get time till this day to answer my louisas very agreeable favor of the  st instant as some old friends of my mothers have been with us these ten days and i could not leave them long enough to compose an epistle for we were always engaged either in conversation or cards as i happened to please the old ladies and besides that they played whist and could not make a party without me  i had a letter from charles yesterday he had settled his affairs to his satisfaction and was returned to london where he says his stay will be but short though he has made some agreeable acquaintances and is engaged in a perpetual round of amusements but adds he has so little relish for them when i am absent that he shall quit them very soon without the least regret and hasten to dublin where he hopes to meet me though i have not the least doubt of his affection i do not think myself bound to give credit to all he says on the subject especially as the liveliness of his style contradicts what he says of not having a relish for amusement i dare say he enjoys them with a very good gout nor am i so weak as to expect he should not have any satisfaction but when i am present  poor gertrude indeed i think she must have a good deal of resolution if she can keep up her spirits tolerably on the approaching change in her condition for there is something very melancholy in the idea of leaving ones friends and country for ever i shall be extremely sorry if they go before i get to town though to be sure she will come over now and then to see us all and no doubt you will sometimes pay her a visit if i can prevail on my mother to undertake it we will make a party to spend two or three months at montpellier and i think she would be the better of it  gertrudes cousins are fine girls i hope she will provide agreeable young men for their partners harry maunsell without doubt will be a bridesman but we all know who will be the object of his attention you say there is very few to whom your example should be recommended and i will venture to assert there is very few indeed who would choose to follow it for notwithstanding the many pretenders to sentiment in both sexes there is not one in a thousand that has really such refined notions as to be capable of considering love in any other light than as a passion so you need not be the least apprehensive that any of the misses will bring themselves into danger by attempting to adopt your ideas on the subject for i must confess you have a singularity in your opinions that is perfectly adapted to your situation or i believe it will be rather more proper to say you have adapted your situation to your sentiments for it is certainly of your own choosing you are a character my dear louisa an amiable one every body acknowledges but at the same time very uncommon for so young a person i wish i was just such another for i do not know any body so happy  you are very severe on fine feelings and i cannot but say the ladies you hint at have left you great room to be so however i think it can be only an affectation of sensibility when one feels only for themselves but weak nerves are so fashionable there is no being a fine lady without them  i have got my poor woman removed to her new habitation and presented her with your generous donation part of which she will apply to the purposes you mention when she is able to attend to those matters as yet she is very weak though surprizingly recovered since she has had proper care and nourishment where she is now all her neighbors will assist her till she is well enough to do her own work and i am sure they will always be kind to her for they know it will oblige me and besides that the natural disposition of our country people is compassionate in a high degree even the poor creatures she lived near when i met with her shared their scanty provision with her i gave them all some little matter and will do more for them hereafter i need hardly tell you what prayers were put up for your happiness when i gave her your present one may easily see the woman has known better days she has such decent notions  i shall be dull on the  0th with the recollection of all the amusement i lose by being here i shall expect you will write to me next day and will long for the arrival of the post  i think it is quite right in emily to discourage any declaration from james till she has changed her mourning at least there is something very indelicate in a woman listening to a lover while in her weeds even though she had no reason to lament her husband but in a proper time i hope she will lay aside her reserve and that her father will not object though james has but a thousand a year and she has four besides all the money he can give her yet the qualities of his mind ought to be considered i shall be much concerned if he is disappointed  my mother joins me in wishing gertrude all the happiness she can expect or desire as well as in affectionate regards to you  i am dear louisa unalterably yours eliza fitzgerald  letter xxxiii miss mortimer to miss fitzgerald feb     it was a most unconscionable task you imposed on me eliza to write the day after a wedding when all the folks are crouding to pay their compliments and i as mistress of the house ought to be ready to receive them however as i feared the disappointment might be too much for you i have left the bride to do the honors to her own company with mrs rochfort to assist her and i assure you gertrude looks very matronly today and becomes her title extremely i have quite provoked her by saying her ladyship when i spoke of her or to her you may think it was to make her laugh i did it as you know i am not much dazzled by titles but i must tell you about yesterday for to hear of a wedding is the delight of all females from fifteen to fifty gertrude by my advice was dressed early and in the drawing room before the company came as i thought it would distress her less than coming in where they were all assembled she had only a white satin nightgown and petticoat trimmed with ermine gauze apron and blond cap and robbins with a very fine net tippet no jewels except three brilliant pins in her cap which there was no being without but she wore as few as possible because she did not wish to be glittering my gown was off the same piece trimmed also like hers but i had a laylock satin petticoat elegantly quilted the rest of my dress quite in her style except i had a beautiful painted gauze shawl instead of a tippet her cousins were as fine as hands could make them in white and silver and a profusion of diamonds in their hair  captain st george and mr fitzmaurice were bridesmen as were mr fitzgerald and harry maunsell  the count had a suit of pearl color tabbinet with a slight pattern of silver and he really looked very handsome but i have seen gertrude look better than she did she was rather pale and kept up her spirits very indifferently a woman cannot appear to advantage at her own wedding unless she is very thoughtless indeed  the company were all assembled at seven oclock and the instant the teatable was removed the bridegroom stepped forward and leading out the bride the ceremony was immediately performed and she went through it much better than i expected but was very near fainting when it was over she soon recovered herself and when cake and wine was handed about we all sat down to cards till supper except mr oneil and your cousin james who retired into another room and played backgammon till ten oclock when the old gentleman went home but as a very particular compliment to gertrude and me permitted his wife to stay as long as she pleased and i assure you that was a very great favor to us and a remarkable indulgence to her had i been his wife it is an indulgence i would take without his leave for i should not submit to be treated like a child  supper passed over cheerfully and about twelve mrs ponsonby being the oldest matron in company rose to withdraw and was followed by all the ladies gertrude indeed would have increased her own confusion by being the last to move only i perceived her slowness and pretending her chair was on my gown obliged her to rise and putting her forward amongst the bridemaids hurried her off before the gentlemen had time to observe her when the young ladies had got garter and pins to dream on all the women went home and the count quitting his company soon after they were all gone by one oclock today we had several morning visitors and the young folks that were at the marriage are to spend the evening with us this week will be entirely taken up in receiving compliments and the next in returning them for as gertrudes stay here will be very short it is necessary for her to get that piece of ceremony over as soon as possible i shall be heartily glad when it is over for i am fatigued with the bustle we have had this while past you know i am no friend to a continual round of dissipation i have not time now to take notice of your last nor does it require any particular answer i give you joy of hearing from charles and hope i shall soon see you both in dublin  farewell dear eliza affectionately yours louisa mortimer  letter xxxiv mr skeffington to mr maunsell london feb     dear maunsell i have been about three weeks in this center of amusements and so borne down by the torrent of dissipation with which people here are overwhelmed that i could not find time to perform my promise of writing to you till this day that a violent cold has obliged me to stay at home and nurse myself i got it by walking home late from a tavern  to confess the truth raking does not agree with me but it is scarce possible to withstand the temptations that are continually thrown in ones way in a place where vice puts on the most alluring form and covers her deformity with the spacious appearance of pleasure which one must be almost insensible to resist at least till experience has taught us wisdom  you cautioned me against sharpers and i was on my guard but you did not tell me i might be in as much danger from those whose birth entitled them to be called gentlemen but perhaps you never met with such i would hardly believe it myself if i had not purchased my knowledge at the extravagant rate of two thousand pounds i did not at first suspect but latterly i perceived the cheat and rising gave the gentleman a draft on my banker for the money informing him at the same time i did not choose to play any longer with one who understood all the game and instantly quit the room expecting he would follow to demand an explanation as there was a deal of company present who all heard what i said  it happened as i thought for i had not gone ten yards when he came up with me and asking what my words meant i answered the meaning was so very obvious it could scarely be mistaken on which he drew his sword and bid me defend myself i did it so effectually that in less than a minute i wounded him in the sword arm and the weapon dropped from his hand as he bled fast i advised him to return to the house we had just left and send for a surgeon then bidding him good night stepped into a chair i met and went home very much dissatisfied with myself  i had no apology for playing so deep because my fortune is already too large to receive any advantage from winning that sum and though the loss is no way material to me yet since i had it to spare i might have disposed of it in a way that would have made several happy the event too might have been fatal and duelling you know i greatly disapprove but when his unfair practices were so plain that i must see it i should have been looked on either as a fool or a coward if i had not taken notice of it  i took great care however not to wound him in a dangerous place for i soon perceived he had very little skill he is recovering fast but i shall always choose to avoid his company as i must dislike the man besides i am determined never to play again but for a few guineas which will not be worth any ones while to cheat for  my intercourse with the other sex has been more agreeable for affairs of gallantry have offered every day without my seeking i should be sorry my lovely eliza knew how i have been led astray though they were only venial transgressions in which the heart was no way concerned and indeed the man must be void of all passion that could withstand such temptations  the women have such a fund of vivacity that they are the most agreeable mistresses in the world but for a wife i would prefer the more reserved cheerfulness of my pretty countrywomen that perhaps may be prejudice for it is likely an englishman would think them insipid  i have paid pretty high for my amusements in this way though i assure you it was not with those who set their charms to sale but presents must be made and of value according to the rank of the fair one  in all my dealings here i find money is the idol of the place and the whole force of the peoples genius is turned toward the different methods of obtaining it  i often think if a medium could be struck between the english and the irish it would just produce a proper standard whereby to regulate our economy for one loves gold too much for their eternal welfare the other too little for their temporal peace as their total disregard of it keeps their domestic affairs in continual embarrassment i speak of the general character of the two nations for i know there are many exceptions in each  i made an acquaintance in sussex with a miss freeman who was in a visit with a family where i was intimate she lives in london and when she was coming to town a few days before me gave me an invitation to her aunts house in jermynstreet where she lives i availed myself of it and have passed several agreeable evenings there  they are genteel people and very pleasing miss freeman is a pretty lively girl about nineteen her aunts daughter something younger and handsomer but more serious than her cousin i find the former has a large fortune at her own disposal i believe the aunt gave me that hint with some view but my heart is already fixed and if elizas sentiments remain unaltered at my return i have nothing more to wish for except being at age as i cannot marry till then but i have a very short time to wait for that  i shall not expect to hear from you since i mean to set out for ireland in less than a week and hope to find you and all those i most wish to see in dublin  my best compliments to miss mortimer but do not tell her i am indisposed for i shall write to eliza this post and will not mention it lest she should be uneasy  tell fitzgerald i have just received his letter and will answer it if i have time before i quit london  adieu dear maunsell yours c skeffington  letter xxxv miss fitzgerald to miss mortimer feb     i had the pleasure of my dear louisas letter with an account of the wedding and beg you will make my mothers compliments of congratulation with mine acceptable to madame la comtesse seriously no one can wish her happier than we do and i hope to have an opportunity of telling her so in person before she leaves ireland as we are to set out for dublin in ten days which has raised my spirits more effectually than a large dose of assafaetida indeed there is no one inducement here to make me wish to stay for though the place is beautiful in summer at this season i can find nothing pleasing in the country especially when every one is gone to town except a few old ladies and gentlemen that are kept prisoners by the gout or else are past all inclination for amusement and them you may think cannot be very agreeable companions for me  mr boil who returned a few days ago is the only one that keeps us alive he left his daughters in dublin and brought me a letter from the eldest requesting if i was not to be in town very soon i would give her some excuse to make you a visit for she longs of all things to be acquainted with you and though she could be easily introduced by some who visit you yet as an intimacy is what she wishes for she says that would be sooner accomplished if she brought her credentials from me these are her own words  i have wrote to inform her i shall soon be in town when i shall perform the part of sir clement cottrel and introduce her to your presence mean time if you should meet her in company as probably you may i flatter myself you will on my recommendation make some advances toward an acquaintance and i am very sure you will like her and her sister too though not so well for the reasons i mentioned she is equally desirous of being acquainted with you  their father will be in town again shortly  i have not heard from charles since little as he says he relishes amusements i find they engage a good deal of his attention else he might have wrote to me more than once since he has been in london  i expect you will answer this as i have still ten days to stay here and my next will be just to tell you what day i set out for dublin  i am going with my mother to take an airing must therefore conclude abruptly  yours affectionately eliza fitzgerald i hope gertrude has recovered her spirits now the awful day is over    letter xxxvi miss mortimer to miss fitzgerald feb     my dear elizas letter has given me infinite pleasure by informing me i may soon hope to see her gertrude too is quite joyful for she began to fear she should be gone before you arrived  yes she begins to lay aside her melancholy except at times when she thinks of leaving us and i assure you it is well you have had a letter from your swain who he supposes has left london ere this but you will hear from him by this post for he says at the conclusion of his to harry he was going to write to you  he mentions a miss freeman he is acquainted with there and her cousin as pretty agreeable girls and says he passes some of his hours very pleasingly with them you need not however be alarmed for he in the same paragraph speaks of you as the mistress of his heart  mr maunsell read all those extracts to me but did not offer to show me the letter from which i guess he gives some account of his adventures and i believe the adventures of young men in london are not always fit for females to hear so i would not ask to see it  i hope this is the last i shall write to you for this season as i expect the return of the post will inform me that you set out in a day or two what delightful news that will be  adieu dear girl commend me to mrs fitzgerald who i hope will get well through her journey and be assured i am  my dear eliza affectionately yours louisa mortimer  letter xxxvii miss fitzgerald to miss mortimes feb     i have the pleasure to acquaint my dear louisa we shall begin our journey the   th but as my mother is still weak and cannot bear fatigue we shall be four days on the road so the   th in the evening i expect to find you waiting for me that we may lose no time in once more enjoying each others society  the same post brought me your letter and one from charles as you supposed he will not leave london till the   th and as he does not mean to travel post i shall be in dublin some days before him he does not mention miss freeman to me but i assure you i am not a bit inclined to be jealous of her or any other person i am rather apt to fear my uneasiness will arise from mr skeffingtons having too much affection for me than too little but i hope his going more into the gay world than he used to do will cure him of any little defect in his temper for people who have confined themselves much to their study are apt to fall into some particularity which they grow ashamed of when they see more of life  i wish mr maunsell had shown you his letter for his not doing it makes me think there was something about me in it that he was unwilling you should see though upon consideration i believe it is more likely to be as you imagine for as harry knows how much you interest yourself in my happiness he would hardly conceal any thing that was material to it from you  i am obliged to you for your intention of taking notice of the miss boyles if you meet them before i arrive i would not request it of you but i am sure you will find them agreeable and i expect we shall be very happy together while they stay in town which i dare say will be till the parliament is up for their aunt stays till then  i have no doubt but you will cure harriet of her affectation for i never met with any one that had the art of making one ashamed of their own foibles without giving offense equal to you your raillery is so void of satire that it both pleases and instructs  i do think it is best for mr maunsell to be absent from you for though i have no idea he can ever cease to love you since his attachment is of so long a standing yet i dare say variety of objects will amuse his mind and keep it from dwelling so incessantly on a subject that must distress him as he has not the most distant hope to support his spirits with and i agree with you that some variation of place and company is absolutely necessary to make life pleasing a love of society is natural to us and without enjoying it in a moderate degree every one must sink into gloominess and like your friends will grow peevish and dissatisfied for it is impossible that three or four people living constantly together retired from the rest of the world can always find a fund of conversation or entertainment in each other i know it by experience when i am in the country with my mother and charles who i need not tell you are two of those i love best yet when we are any time without company or going abroad i find myself grow stupid and tired of every thing about me to tell truth i am at this instant in the very state i am describing as i think my letter will convince you  i am very glad i do not belong to the comfortable family you mention what a treat your company must be to the young people for i suppose they are not much delighted with the comforts of being shut up from society though their parents may have outlived all taste for earthly enjoyments very thankful am i that my mother is not of that disposition  farewell till the   th when i shall have the happiness of telling you in person how affectionately i am  your own eliza fitzgerald  letter xxxviii miss mortimer to the countess rousillon may    the receipt of my dear gertrudes letter relieved me from great uneasiness which i suffered by not getting an account of your arrival in france but the round you took and all the visits you made to the counts relations on your journey is sufficient reason for my not hearing from you sooner i am happy to find they all received you so kindly for politeness alone would be only what you had a right to expect one wishes to meet with something more from the family they go into and it gives me much satisfaction that you have met with that tenderness and affection which i am sure you will merit from them  your departure made us all melancholy and each morning when emily and i met at breakfast we renewed each others concern by observing how lonely we were without poor gertrude and indeed if i was inclined to forget you wilson would not let me for she laments you daily when she comes to take my orders and brings her accounts for my inspection always observing how good you were to spare me that trouble and i must acknowledge i have a loss of you in that respect though she is so careful and exact that i find it less disagreeable than it would be if i had a different sort of person in her place but she is faithful and honest and i esteem such a servant to be invaluable  i have had several letters from harry since you left him in london and think he is recovering his usual cheerfulness the first to be sure was filled with lamentations and regrets and all the etceteras of soft nonsense but i have absolutely prohibited that subject on pain of returning his letters unanswered he murmured a little at my cruelty but was obliged to comply with the restriction and now he writes like a rational creature and is a very pleasing correspondent your carosposo did him no good for he encouraged him in all his romance and folly and only for this fortunate call to england i should have had him sighing and dying at my feet till both for his sake and my own i would have been under a necessity of quarrelling with him when he goes to france i beg you will not indulge him in talking of certain circumstances that had better be forgot  mr hamilton has been in town this month charles and he are on the most friendly terms without any appearance of the suspicions his presence formerly raised so you may judge how happy eliza is i suppose matters will soon be brought to a conclusion there as mr skeffington will be at age early in june and then i think there will be nothing to prevent it  miss freeman that you heard him mention has been in dublin some weeks and i have a strong idea that it is an attachment to charles has brought her over she says she was ordered seasickness for a disorder in her stomach and as she had a desire to see dublin she thought she might as well come here as any where the story is plausible and i fancy is believed by every one but me however if she was ill the remedy has been very effectual for she has not the least remains of any complaint whatever besides i think it very extraordinary that her friends would let her come to a strange country in such ill health without any companion but her waitingmaid  she has brought letters of introduction to some genteel families here who of course pay great attention to her but i observe she takes great pains to cultivate an intimacy with eliza who went to visit her on account of the civility she and her aunt had shown mr skeffington for she sent to him the day after she arrived and had first fixed herself in a lodging next street to him  eliza gave her a general invitation to come to them whenever she was disengaged and she avails herself of it in a manner that shows she means to be quite on free terms with her all these things make me very observant of her as i fear she has some scheme of supplanting eliza in charless affections i do not however think that would be easily done unless she should discover that tincture of jealousy in his temper by which he might he wrought upon  she is rather pretty and uncommonly lively in my opinion if her vivacity was a little tempered with discretion she would be much more agreeable for at present it borders upon levity  i know the english women are of a more sprightly disposition than the irish but i never met any of them that could not set some bounds to it but this young lady who quite overpowers me with her amazing volubility and you know i have a downright horror of being talked to death one happiness to her hearers is she does not talk nonsense and though i am not much delighted with her she is generally thought agreeable  i can perceive i am no great favorite with her notwithstanding she effects an esteem for me to eliza but i am sure she would not wish i was so often at that house for she has said more than once she believed i had a deal of penetration  i have said perhaps too much on surmise for i acknowledge it is nothing more except so far as relates to her liking charles which i have no doubt about but my suspicions arose from observations i have made on her behavior  i shall however be well pleased to lose my character for penetration in this particular  mr fitzgerald has declared himself in form to mrs rochfort and she has positively refused to listen to him again on that subject during the first year of her widowhood a pretty hint that for him to renew it at the expiration of that time when she told me what passed between them i said very seriously but with a significant look it was really kind of her to limit his time of probation she had not been aware of the inference i would draw and it threw her into the utmost confusion when she could speak she said no one would think of such a thing but myself if said i mr fitzgerald does not think of it he is more dull of apprehension than any lover i ever heard of but do not be uneasy for you know widows are privileged to give a modest hint of their intentions she blushed so excessively and seemed so distressed that i pitied her though i could not help laughing at her being so affected but she has an uncommon degree of bash fullness i relieved her by saying i owed her that teizing for her reserve to me on that affair for she constantly denied her partiality for james though it was very visible and i was determined to mortify her for it  i allow it is not delicate to make open declaration of our favorable opinion of a man however worthy he may be but to deny it so positively to a particular friend that one was living in the house with looks i think either like prudery or distrust  when she found i had taken it amiss she apologized by assuring me it proceeded only from a wish to conceal her sentiments from every body even herself if possible till she knew if her father would approve of mr fitzgerald as she meant to be guided by him i could not help saying i thought it would be carrying her obedience too far though i have as high a notion of the duty we owe our parents as most people but as she had once made herself unhappy to oblige him i did not think it necessary to consult his caprice in a second choice when we knew his love of money and that inequality of fortune was the only objection could be made in the present case she certainly ought to inform her father of the affair but if he objected merely on the grounds i mention i did not think she was under any obligation to comply with an unreasonable humor considering she was now her own mistress if she was still under her parents authority i should think her right extended no farther than to refuse a person she could not be happy with but not to marry any one against their consent  she seemed to join in my opinion but said she had been used to obey so implicitly and besides was of such a timid disposition she doubted if she would have resolution to follow her own inclinations  i hope she will not be put to the trial as mr oneil professes a most violent friendship for james and sets him up as a pattern for all young men that he knows  i shall continue to write to you an account of all our proceedings here without the formality of waiting for an answer since the war prevents a regular intercourse between the two countries  the miss boyles and i are become intimate you were prejudiced in their favor by the little you had seen of them before you left us and if you had known more of them you would like them still better as they improve on an acquaintance particularly harriet whose good sense is a little obscured by affectation which however she is throwing off very fast you cannot think how much i made her ashamed of it so much that it is only long habit makes her ever practice it and the least look from me corrects her  i think mr hamilton begins to attach himself to miss boil but i do not find it is observed by any one else nor am i quite sure of it but i wish it may be so since it would remove all causes of uneasiness from charles as he is the only one he ever seemed to fear would rival him  mr boil is my ce cisbeo and flirts most delightfully considering he is old enough to be my father i am a prodigious favorite of his and indeed i return the compliment for i think him the most cheerful pleasing man i ever met with of an elderly one i mean  you must suppose a million of compliments and good wishes from all your friends and acquaintances here for it would fill a sheet of paper to enumerate them  do not be jealous that i desire my love to your husband are not you shocked at such an obsolete epithet  believe me affectionately yourslouisa mortimer  letter xxxix miss freeman to miss vernon dublin may    since my arrival in this metropolis i have wrote three letters to my dear charlotte and have received but one from her but as the packets are kept out by contrary winds i take it for granted your answers to my other two are detained by that means and shall proceed to give you an account of my irish acquaintances  i have already informed you of the polite or i may rather say kind reception i met with from every family to whom i brought letters and i have now to tell you their civility rather increases every day indeed i think there is no end to the attention a stranger meets with in this land of hospitality which has in spite of all my prejudices reconciled me to a people of whom we are taught to entertain the most unjust ideas for i assure you i find them the very reverse of every thing our country folks usually imagine them to be and i begin to see it is very illiberal to suppose merit is confined to any one particular clime or kingdom  i told you miss fitzgerald skeffingtons intended had paid me a visit and given me a genteel invitation to go to their house whenever i was not otherwise engaged as they live in the next street for i took care to fix myself near them she has since showed she meant more than mere compliment for she came herself several times and took me with her after taking me airing or to such places in the town as she thought worth my seeing so we were now as free as if we had been acquainted this twelve month  she is a pretty gentle soul entirely composed of the tender passions and has too much sensibility for her own peace of mind which i am very sorry for since there is a great deal of uneasiness in store for her i wish it was otherwise but i never was used to put any persons happiness in competition with my own a stranger cannot therefore expect that compliment from me besides i really think i shall do them a service in separating them for were two such quiet mortals as skeffington and she to go together they would inevitably fall into a lethargy by the perfect sameness of each others temper now if i take him i believe i may engage to keep him from that disorder by the continual variety of my disposition not to say any thing of my spirit which i flatter myself is sufficient to keep any man awake for though i love him to distraction and will go any lengths to obtain him i do not mean to be the same turtle when married that his eliza would be it is necessary to rouse them sometimes that they may set the higher value on your good temper when you choose to treat them with it  there is a miss mortimer that stands very much in my way for she is elizas bosom friend and chief adviser she is very civil to me and asks me to her parties but she has quick discernment and i think observes me with a penetrating eye for which reason i am in awe of her and of course do not like her but that i keep to myself for i find she is a general favorite even amongst the women though very much the taste of the men  is not this odd she is not handsome but has great expression in her countenance and is by no means ugly her disposition is exceedingly lively and a vein of humor runs through her conversation that makes it vastly pleasing however her vivacity never leads her into an impropriety for her understanding is in the superior degree and she conducts herself with the same prudence you might expect from her grandmother i have been particular in my description of her because i think her rather an extraordinary character for a woman not above four and twenty but do you know i hate those pieces of infallibility their manners are a tacit reproach on us who are too volatile to be restrained by dull rules of decorum  the women here would in general suit your taste better than mine for though very cheerful they have a sedateness in them that would be just the thing for you who are a good deal in that style yourself  i have this instant got a piece of intelligence that is of the utmost importance to me skeffington has a spark of jealousy in his bosom which if i do not blow into a flame i deserve to lose him it never broke out till within these few months the person who raised it is a mr hamilton a most accomplished young man he is at present in town is very intimate at mrs fitzgeralds and seems to be on the most friendly terms with charles however since he once looked on him as a rival there can be no great difficulty in placing him in the same light again for suspicions of that nature may be revived with very little address  letty whom i ordered to make an acquaintance with miss fitzgeralds maid got this information from her but as she is not in her mistresss secrets she could not tell how he was convinced there was no cause for his fears it was from some unguarded expressions of his own she discovered his foible she said she told her lady of it at the time who bid her not mention it and she never heard more of it after though she perceived her very lowspirited at times till of late she seems quite easy be that as it may i think i cannot fail of succeeding now i know his weak side as i shall direct all my attack against that but how i shall proceed i cannot at present inform you since my operations must be determined by the circumstance of the moment  i never gave you a more convincing proof of the confidence i place in you than by letting you into my intention of going such lengths to accomplish my wishes since i know you will not approve of it but i also know your affection for me will prevent your taking any steps to frustrate my designs as your knowledge of my disposition must tell you such a measure would inevitably be attended with fatal consequences  whatever i do must be done soon for he will be at age in a few weeks and they are to be married as soon after as he can go through some necessary forms of law to enable him to make proper settlements for notwithstanding they have loved and been intended for each other from their infancy she has patiently waited till all these matters could be done regularly  so important do the ladies here esteem the security of their fortunes that a girl who would marry without that precaution would be looked on as a prodigy of imprudence while we give away thousands without asking any return but love surely the irish women must have very cold constitutions or very great command of their passions else their reason could not act so powerfully  what has reason and love to do with each other the association is unnatural and never entered into a breast truly occupied by that tender passion as i can vouch from experience  i would not venture to speak so openly but that i know your mother cannot be returned to town yet if you should find she means to come sooner than we expected let me know as i would not for the world one of my letters should fall into her hands no doubt she was greatly astonished when you informed her i was gone to ireland  you must not expect i shall write frequently now as i have done because my mind will be otherwise employed  adieu dear charlotte yours caroline freeman  letter xl miss freeman to miss vernon dublin may     i have a whole packet of my dear charlottes letters now before me and as skeffington and the fitzgeralds are gone to dine a few miles from town i take the opportunity of answering them for when they are at home i am generally with or expect them to call on me  chance has been favorable to my design and put it in a train that perhaps my own ingenuity could not have so easily brought about miss fitzgerald and mr hamilton have accidentally met at my lodgings on morning visits two or three different times when by the greatest good fortune that could happen charles luckily called in and sound them there the first time he did not seem to mind it but the second i saw made an impression on him and the last which was yesterday they all looked embarrassed hamilton soon took leave you must know i encouraged an intimacy with him in hopes it would some way answer my purpose charles and eliza sat a while and then i went home with them being engaged to pass the day there  he continued very serious and she very badly affected cheerfulness in the evening however we were set a little to rights two miss boyles who are frequently there came into tea which roused them from their thoughtfulness and when tea was over we all went to the rotunda where we were joined by mr hamilton but as he attached himself to the eldest miss boil whom i think he admires charless good humor rather increased the music too of which he is very fond seemed to compose his spirits and he went home much easier in mind than he had been all day but as this meeting by chance affects him so much i shall take the hint and improve upon it i cannot now be more explicit as my plan is not thoroughly digested  you ask how i can be so barbarous as to make an amiable girl wretched who has showed me such friendship i answer because my own happiness is dearer to me than that of any other person and as to the civility she has shown me she would do the same to any other stranger that was introduced to her it is the natural disposition of the people here therefore i do not esteem it any particular compliment to me so my conscience is easy on that head and i beg i may have no more of your preaching it comes mighty ill from a girl of eighteen  my aunt you tell me is much displeased at my expedition i guessed she would which was the reason i took the opportunity to come off while she was in the country i was determined and there was no use in having an argument upon it if she knew my purpose i suppose she would come over express to prevent it and if she was not two hundred miles from london and likely to be detained there till as i hope my business will be accomplished i would not have given you the smallest item of it but i caution you to dread the consequence of betraying me  if i can but succeed in making a quarrel between skeffington and his fair cousin i have no doubt but i shall easily obtain her place in his heart and then you shall see how good how religious and all that i will be the rest of my life  i wish i was rid of this miss mortimer for a while i think she perfectly keeps guard over eliza and there is no having her to ones self long enough to get into her confidence which i am sure i would have done long since if her friend was out of my way and that would be of great use to forward my scheme for i am sure i could draw her into things that would confirm his suspicions if she was without the advice of one who is so well acquainted with her disposition and so interested in her happiness besides that i have reason to think she suspects my attachment to skeffington and is therefore more anxious to prevent eliza from being too open in her communications to me for neither of them has ever dropped the least hint of his jealousy however i believe all her wisdom and precaution will be insufficient to obstruct the success of my plan which i look upon as certain now that the knowledge of his temper gives me such a sure foundation to work upon  you ask me of miss mortimers family and situation and seem wonderfully taken with her character she is descended from one of the oldest families in england and i think values herself on her pedigree though she is at the same time exceedingly complaisant and affable to every one her father and mother are dead but i suppose her fortune must be quite easy since she has a house elegantly furnished visits and is visited by all the fine folks here and is treated with all that respect and attention that is usually paid to those who are totally independent in short she ranks in the upper class of life but will not be a slave to particular forms and empty ceremonies which she says is the very reverse of true politeness how she manages i do not know but every thing she does pleases and she is set up as a pattern to all young ladies as soon as they are brought into company and as i told you much admired by the men to all that i have ever seen with her she behaves with such perfect equality that i cannot guess which of them she prefers yet it is scarcely probable that she has not some attachment besides i have heard hints among them that convinces me she has but i believe there is some mystery in it that i cannot fathom and the ladies here are very reserved on those subjects i am dying to find it out too for i should have great satisfaction in knowing she had an imprudent intanglement but no matter i shall triumph over her sagacity yet notwithstanding all her endeavors to watch me for i see plainly her suspicions of me increase  when you hear from me next probably something decisive will be done for the time advances fast  till then farewell  believe me ever yours caroline freeman  letter xli from the same to the same dublin june    dear charlotte i have separated them i hope for ever but it has produced a consequence i was not prepared for he went off to england in the first transports of his jealousy and i fear he may take the fancy of going abroad to amuse his mind but i am hastening after him and if i can but keep him in england his going there will be much to my advantage because it will effectually prevent their coming to any explanation and baffle all miss mortimers cleverness  i write while letty is packing my things and you may expect me in a day or two after you receive this when i will tell you how i brought the matter about  yours in a violent hurry caroline freeman  letter xlii miss mortimer to henry maunsell esquire june    what poor weak mortals you men are borne away by every gust of passion and with all your boasted wisdom incapable of conducting yourselves with propriety in the common occurrences of life  any girl just escaped from the nursery can if she sets her wits to work make you believe improbabilities  excuse me harry i have no reason to accuse you of those follies but i am angry with the whole sex and vexed to death that it should be in the power of any of you to make my poor eliza unhappy  your friend mr skeffington is flown off to england in a fit of jealousy and upon the credit of an anonymous scrawl he received has accused the sweet girl whose heart he has possessed from her infancy of inconstancy and i know not what nonsense mr hamilton is still the object of his suspicions though he is actually paying his addresses to miss boil and that any body might see that did not choose to shut their eyes against conviction he will certainly avoid you and i do not wish you to seek him out it could be of no use at present besides our pride forbids it  i am certain that miss freeman he mentioned to you is at the bottom of it all i told you she was here and that i thought she liked charles every day convinced me i was right and i have now no doubt of it for she set off for england this morning which was as soon as she could go after she heard of his departure and she had never mentioned her intentions before she lives with her aunt a mrs vernon in jermynstreet and i should be glad you would keep a watch on the house to see if he goes or sends there he has taken will lacky with him the fellow you know is his fosterbrother and i am sure has his masters happiness at heart so if your james could meet with him i dare say he would give some intelligence how he means to dispose of himself  i do not suppose he will continue in england unless that little witch contrives some stratagem to detain him and i would wish to know where he is or is likely to be because mrs fitzgerald who loves him nearly as well as she loves eliza is quite miserable about him besides one would choose to know his motions as something may yet happen to set matters right again and make him ashamed of a weakness that causes so much unhappiness to those whose felicity i know he would wish to promote  i make no apology for the employment i give you as i know your regard for the parties concerned exclusive of the pleasure you will have in obeying my commands  you see i have said that for you just to save you the trouble of repeating what you have so often told me  adieu yours louisa mortimer  letter xliii miss mortimer to the countess de rousillon june    i promised to give my dear gertrude an account of all the occurrences among us that were worth relating and i have now to inform you of one that i believe will give you much concern charles skeffington departed abruptly for england four days ago in a paroxism of jealousy which i am certain has been roused by the machinations of that miss freeman of whom i hinted my suspicions in my last they are confirmed by her setting out for england as soon as she found he was gone on a pretense of being wrote for on material business though there had not a packet arrived in the time for as i suspected her i sent to enquire  eliza bears it surprisingly she is hurt by his behavior and her pride supports her for the present but i fear that will not continue long she is too gentle and loved him too well not to regret her disappointment i do my best to keep up her resentment but i know it will not do tender recollections will obtrude themselves on her mind and interrupt if not totally destroy her happiness  her mother too is greatly to be pitied for she loved charles as if he had been her own son and you cannot imagine how much his present conduct affects her add to that she has terrible apprehensions for elizas health which indeed i think likely to suffer from the shock she has received  i shall advise them to go to montpellier changing the scene may be of use to her and as you mean to leave paris this month you will be at rousillon before they could reach it and i am sure would contribute all in your power to amuse the dear girl if i possibly can i will accompany them but that is at present uncertain  it is time for me to tell you how the affair happened at least as much as i know of it i told you in my last i was sure miss freeman liked charles as i observed her closely i was every day more convinced of it as well as that she must have some scheme in coming over for which reason i gave her as few opportunities of being alone with eliza as possible for being extremely artless herself i feared she would be too unreserved and lay herself open to the others cunning to take advantage of  i was constantly uneasy for her though i did not know precisely what to fear and was much more so when i found mr hamilton and eliza had met by accident at miss freemans lodgings several times charles had found them there and showed strong symptoms of returning jealousy when eliza told me what had happened i mentioned my suspicions of miss freeman and cautioned her to guard against her artifices and not to go to her without charles she promised she would not but seemed to think i wronged the girl very much who she said was too volatile to manage any deep laid plot she however look my advice and seldom went to her but invited her to their house as usual matters were in this way when mrs rochfort got a violent cold which confined her and you may think i would not leave her  mrs fitzgerald was also indisposed so that i had not seen eliza for three days when i was much surprised at receiving a note from her at twelve oclock monday night requesting i would go to her immediately and prepare for staying till morning as an accident had happened which greatly affected her to prevent delay she sent the carriage for me  i showed the note to emily in whose chamber i was sitting begging she would excuse me if i should not be at home at breakfast and ordering jenny to put my night clothes into the chariot went off very much alarmed as both emily and i had concluded it to be something relative to charles  when i stepped into the hall the servants all looked sad and silent kitty met me with her eyes quite red from crying as she was lighting me up stairs kitty said i what ails your mistress oh maam mr skeffington and bursting into tears was unable to say more but conducted me in silence to mrs fitzgeralds bedchamber who sat in her easy chair weeping when she saw me you are very good miss mortimer says she my poor girl wanted such a friend to comfort her looking toward eliza who sat leaning her elbow on the dressing table her hand supporting her head in the other she had two letters open which she held out to me saying read them louisa they will explain our present situation better than i am able to do and be my excuse for bringing you out at this late hour i took them and read as follows  madam when you receive this i shall for ever have quitted a house where once my chief happiness was centered i will not endeavor to raise your compassion by describing what i feel at parting for since i have lost your affection i will try to set myself above your pity and will at least convince you your felicity is infinitely dearer to me than my own by relieving you from that restraint which my presence must have laid you under and leaving you at liberty to give your hand to him whose shining qualities i am not all surprised should rob me of your heart it is not in woman to withstand such perfections and i have no right to expect a miracle should be wrought in my favor  to show you i am not actuated by mere suspicion i enclose a letter that was put into my hand this morning as i was stepping into my carriage i followed the writers directions went to the rotunda and was convinced of your inconstancy  as you wished to deceive me you should have been cautious who you trusted with your secret no doubt you will know the hand and remove that person from your family  i know and grieve for what my aunt will feel on this occasion but i hope mr hamilton will by his attention reconcile her to the event and make you as happy as i would have rejoiced in doing had the pleasing task fallen to the lot of your still  very sincere friend c skeffington   the letter alluded to was badly wrote and worse spelt it contained the following lines  sir knowing how long and tenderly you have loved miss fitzgerald and that you are now flattering yourself with the pleasing hope of being soon united to her i could not bear to see you any longer deceived and therefore from a perfect knowledge of her intentions assure you she only wishes to stand fair with you during her mothers life which from her ill health she thinks cannot be long  you soon perceived the growing attachments between her and mr hamilton but so high was your opinion of her you persuaded yourself to discredit the evidence of your own senses rather than think she could be guilty of so much baseness  if you choose to be convinced of the truth of this information go to the rotunda about nine oclock tonight where though you fancy she is confined to her mothers apartment you will find her in company with the present object of her affection she thinks herself secure as you were to stay at lucan till tomorrow but i presume this will be sufficient to bring you back  i remain sir your humble servant an unknown friend   you will observe this was calculated to make him suppose it wrote by some one in his own family accordingly his suspicions fell on kitty for she says when he was quitting the house he called for her and giving her the letter for eliza put five guineas into her hand saying he believed he was under an obligation to her though if her mistress confided in her she did wrong to betray her secrets he forgot he had once endeavored to tempt her to do the very same thing he now disapproved the girl did not know what he meant she must be innocent of it for she could not possibly tell her mistress would go to the rotunda before she knew it herself that could only be told by the person who was determined to take her there  having read the letters i asked eliza had she been at the rotunda that evening she answered yes but begged i would not condemn her till i heard her story she then proceeded to tell me that in the morning miss freeman had come to breakfast as she often did but would not stay the day though much pressed alleging she was geting a beautiful fancy trimming on a gown and must go home to show her maid how to put it on for she would not let the mantuamaker do it lest it should not be to her taste but said if it was done she would come in the evening as she knew charles would be out of town  she left us soon after and we heard no more of her till six in the afternoon letty came seemingly in a great hurry with a request from her mistress that i should go drink tea with her i answered she knew i could not leave my mother ah maam she bid me tell you she is in the utmost distress for mr harman is come to tea and she does not think it prudent to entertain gentlemen at her lodgings without having some other lady with her and she cannot make so free with any one but you as to expect they would come on such short notice  as mr harman is reputed to be an admirer of miss freemans my mother was charmed with her discretion and insisted i should go saying she was now well enough to amuse herself by reading i therefore told the girl i would follow her as soon as the horses could be put to which i did miss freeman met me on the stairs and in her own rattling way said i was the best girl in the world if i had not come she would have been ruined for there was two of them with her now but bid me not say any thing of being just sent for we had by this time reached the drawing room where i found the gentleman already mentioned and mr hamilton i would rather he had not been there but as charles was not likely to know of it i was the less concerned be it as it would i would not go away again we had tea immediately and a great deal of wit and repartee passed between miss freeman and her admirer who seemed to think it incumbent on him to follow her lead and she was remarkable lively even for her that you know is always so  all of a sudden she proposed going to the rotunda which i readily assented to thinking it more eligible than staying at home the evening was so fine we agreed to walk and i ordered the carriage there at ten it was very full and rather warm so between the acts we walked in the garden when we returned to the room miss freeman complained of fatigue and thirst the forms were all filled but the gentlemen proposed going into a recess and having coffee which she accepted saying she was choked with dust and we went into one that a set of company had just quitted coffee and several other refreshments were soon brought and we were sitting making our observations on the variety of figures that were moving in a circle before us when miss freeman cried in a tone of astonishment there is mr skeffington instantly he turned his head and when he saw it was us stepped in i said i was surprised to meet him there as i did not expect him to town he answered i am sure you did not and seemed to lay a particular emphasis on his words i hope says i nothing extraordinary has happened yes madam said he something very extraordinary  i was silent perceiving at once what he meant though i could not conceive how he got intelligence of my being there the gentlemen pressed him to take coffee but he declined saying he had some material business to transact and had only called in to look for a person he had heard was there  he cast a look full of indignation at me and bowing to the company withdrew leaving us all looking at each other as if we did not know whether we should take notice of his behavior or not till miss freeman said laughing she thought we looked as if we had got anger and were afraid to speak  to be sure mr skeffingtons temper was much ruffled at something or he would not have behaved so odd then turning to me he will make an agreeable husband my dear if he has frequent returns of those humors  i was confused at her directing the speech to me but answered the woman would deserve to be unhappy that knowingly subjected herself to such caprice  mr hamilton whom i saw guessed he was the cause of what had passed looked concerned and serious but as for me i was so full of resentment that it kept up my spirits and i was determined to speak to him when i came home and put a final end to the affair for since he has no confidence in my affection it is impossible we could be happy  it seems he was of the same sentiments for he was gone before i came in kitty gave me a letter saying mr skeffington left it for me when he was going away  away where she answered to england maam i asked no more questions but came to my mothers chamber who i found so cheerful that i knew she had not heard of it so i went to my dressing room as if to undress and there i read the letters i immediately ordered the carriage to go for you and then returned to my mother and broke the matter to her as gently as i could by telling her of the first commencement of charless jealousy which i never mentioned before wishing to save her from uneasiness and still hoping a little reflection would cure him of that weakness the hope i find was vain aded she sighing but my greatest concern at present is to see my mother so much afflicted by his ingratitude she wanted me to send after him as he could not have got down to the packet when i came home but i begged her not to insist on it as i never would condescend so far to a man who upon such slight foundation could suspect my sincerity i said i thought her right for it would probably be to no purpose since he did not now seem capable of using his reason it was therefore better to let him alone till time and circumstances might open his eyes to conviction  mrs fitzgerald agreed with me saying she had not considered the matter properly at first i asked them had they no suspicion of the author of that letter eliza said she had no doubt it was miss freeman had it wrote perhaps by her maid but the words she was sure were her own as the style did not suit the writing and spelling which were both of the vulgar kind she said she had not asked any particulars about his going but would call kitty now for she had heard the chariot return since i came in  when kitty came she was asked where john had left his master she answered he had staid to see him in the wherry and the sailors said the wind was so fair he would be at the head to breakfast i then asked her what had passed before he left the house she said the servants told her for she was not below that he came in soon after nine which surprised them as they did not expect him that night he went to his study and called for will who found him walking back and forward in great discomposure he took no notice of him for some minutes then bid him pack up all his things with what haste he could for he was setting off immediately for england and will if you choose to come you may pack up your own things too but probably i shall not return these twoor three years therefore take your choice will said to be sure he would attend his honor as long as he would give him leave and went to do as he was ordered but first stepped into the hall to tell the servants the news  mr skeffington came down in about half an hour desired one of the men to call me and when i came bid me deliver that letter to my mistress she then repeated what he had said to her adding he charged her not to mention his departure to his aunt her young lady would tell it when she returned he left directions for will to follow with the trunks as soon as possible and drove off leaving them all in great consternation and for her she said she had been crying almost ever since for though she did not know directly what the words meant she guessed some mischief was between him and her mistress and that he suspected her to be the cause of it eliza bid her not be uneasy for she was convinced of her innocence and then dismissed her  we all retired to bed soon after but i cannot say to rest for eliza and i talked over the affair the remainder of the night which was already far advanced and i took care to place his treatment of her in such a light as should raise her resentment for i found her several times inclined to melt into tears we determined if miss freeman came next day to say charles was gone to england on business of importance and watch her looks and behavior to see if they would confirm our suspicions which in my opinion did not want confirmation since it is impossible any one but her could know eliza and mr hamilton would be at the rotunda together as it was by her means the thing happened  she came as we expected in the forenoon just as sprightly and to all appearance as thoughtless as usual but she is not what she seems to be in that respect she had not sat long before she asked for charles and eliza made the answer we agreed on she looked astonished and exclaimed to england you quite surprise me why should it surprise you says i that mr skeffington who has a large estate in england should have business there she was disconcerted at first but recovered quick enough and replied because maam i thought a certain event looking toward eliza was to take place so soon that he would defer every other business till that was over eliza blushed and was silent but i made answer miss fitzgerald was in no hurry about that affair here the subject dropped and we talked of indifferent things till she left us which she did very shortly saying she had a hundred visits to pay  i went home to see emily and tell her what had happened but returned again to stay the day with them it passed over very well as several friends had called in to see mrs fitzgerald and the miss boyles came to tea they always come early so we had a good deal of time for chat and i thought it best to tell them the real truth in regard to charless sudden departure for it will be certainly talked of and reserve to them was unnecessary they immediately fixed on miss freeman as the cause and i found mr hamilton had told them what passed at the gardens we were still talking it over and had sat down to tea when miss freeman arrived she told us she was come to take leave for since she saw us in the morning she had received a letter with some news which made it necessary for her to go home directly and she meant to sail in the next packet we all cast a look at each other and i said it was a sudden call indeed that put her in such a hurry she made no reply to that but chatted away in her usual style about two hours and then took leave making a profusion of acknowlegements to mrs fitzgerald and eliza for the many civilities she had received from them which provoked me so much i could scarce forbear giving her a hint of my suspicions but i considered it best to say nothing as it could not answer any purpose since she certainly would not own it  after she was gone we agreed there could be no doubt of what was taking her back and i mentioned to the boyles what had been my opinion of her all along and my reasons for it  eliza said she would never dispute my penetration again but she had thought her too giddy to be so designing i have wrote to harry maunsell an account of mr skeffingtons behavior and begged him to have a watch on miss freeman perhaps something will come out that will be of use to us for i think if his eyes were effectually opened by a discovery of her artifice it would cure him of his foible and they might yet be happy  mr hamiltons marriage with miss boil when that takes place must go a good way toward undeceiving him  mr fitzgerald does not abate the least bit in his attention to our lovely widow and she receives them very graciously  when i freed my heart from its fond prepossession i thought i had done with love and all its attendant perplexities but i find i was mistaken for i am now as much affected with the soft distresses of my friends as i could possibly be with my own i think rather more so because if any of the follows took such airs with me i should discard them at once without a moments pain i wish i could inspire eliza with a little of my spirit for it is such tender souls as you and she are that make the men so saucy  do not call this a letter it is quite a volume by the time you have got through it perhaps you may hear from me again  the best wishes of your friends here waits on the compte and your ladyship  none more sincerely than those of my  dear gertrudes very affectionate louisa mortimer  letter xliv mr maunsell to miss mortimer london june     i defered acknowleging the receipt of my dear miss mortimers favor till i could give some satisfactory account of my unhappy friend unhappy i call him though i think him blameable but i must feel for him since i too well know what he suffers who loses all hopes of being united to the object of his fondest wishes but i forget myself and am transgressing against your cruel commands not to mention that subject which is and will ever be nearest my heart yet surely louisa you will pardon me as you must at least allow there is some merit in my endeavors to obey you when i find the task is so difficult  i was under the necessity of letting james into the whole secret as i should want his assistance and have no doubt of his fidelity i then gave him proper instructions and sent him to jermynstreet where he took a lodging nearly opposite mrs vernons so that he must see who went in and out there it was in the evening and as his landlady keeps a shop he bought some tea and begged leave to try it in her apartment and sent for cakes to treat her and the children she was much pleased with his civility which made her very communicative and in the course of conversation she gave him the history of every family in the street and told him all the genteel female servants frequented her shop and often made parties to drink tea there and be merry just to help her because she was a poor widow james requested she would introduce him to some of them as opportunity offered which she promised telling him miss vernons maid was the prettiest girl in the street and she would invite her next evening it was the very thing he wanted so giving her to understand he would provide the entertainment he took his leave telling her he should sleep there next night and came to inform me of his proceedings  i was well pleased at such a beginning not doubting but he would so manage matters with the pretty damsel as to get into the secrets of the young ladies so far as would be useful to us i sent him next day that he might watch if mr skeffington went there and told him i should not expect to see him that night again  accordingly he did not return till morning when he informed me he had the greatest hopes of succeeding to my wishes for the girl he had been introduced to was sister to miss freemans maid that she told him that young lady had met with an accident by the overturning of the carriage on her road from ireland which rendered her unable to travel and her young lady was to go to her in a day or two to stay with her till she recovered  finding he was an irishman she enquired if he knew mrs fitzgeralds family being answered in the affirmative she asked several questions about them and charles in a manner that convinces him she knows the whole affair  i have therefore laid a plan by which i think we shall come at the truth  james is a welllooking lad and the girl seemed pleased with his company by treating her with a little gallantry it is more than probable he will learn all she can tell him he is already become a favorite and is frequently with her for her mistress is gone to attend her cousin who still remains too ill to be moved and mrs vernon has been out of town some time by which means he will have great opportunities of getting into her confidence  as you guessed charles did not come near me but i made private enquiries and found he was at his house in sussex however i could get no knowledge of his intentions till yesterday james luckily met will lacky who had been sent to town on business they were rejoiced to see each other and stepped into a public house to take a glass where william told him his master had some unfortunate misunderstanding with miss fitzgerald and had left dublin in a huff was determined not to return this long time and was now preparing to go abroad he believed to germany and from thence to italy  he lamented greatly what had happened saying he was sure the young mistress was not to blame but his master would not hear reason  james expressed his sorrow on the occasion and having obtained a promise from will to keep up a constant correspondence they parted and james came to tell what he had heard and that he proposed corresponding that i might have always intelligence of mr skeffingtons movements which it seems he did not intend to make any of his friends acquainted with  i approved what he had done and commended him highly for his attention to the business  i hope my proceedings will meet the approbation of my lovely louisa and obtain her good opinion of one at least of that sex against which she is so justly incensed by the folly and ingratitude of another  i sincerely wish your fair friend had some share of that fortitude of which you exhibit such an example on all trying occasions indeed i should do well to wish for it myself too since i have even more need of it than miss fitzgerald because it is most likely resentment will keep her from repining but i have not that to support me and am i think more unhappy than if i had been ill used by the woman i adore  why will these ideas perpetually recur i shall not fail to inform you of every thing material that passes and have no doubt but matters will yet take a happy turn if mr hamilton marries miss boil sure that alone will be sufficient to convince charles of his error  i will not now give you room to laugh at me by repeating what you have already anticipated so shall only say i wish you may ever retain that charming vivacity which so exceedingly becomes you  adieu my dear miss mortimer assure yourself i shall always be unalterably yours henry maunsell  letter xlv from the same to the same london july    two days after i wrote to my dear miss mortimer i received a short letter from mr skeffington apologizing for not calling on me as his mind was in too distracted a state since he came to england to make him a pleasing companion to any one before that would reach me he said he should have set off with an intention of quitting these kingdoms till the memory of some late events which no doubt i had heard of were so far worn out as to enable him to return to his own country with some degree of satisfaction when he hoped we should renew that friendship which had ever afforded him so much pleasure  james same time received a note from william informing him they were just setting out for harwick there to embark for helvoetsluys and promising to write to him from the first place where he should find they were likely to make any stay if he keeps his word we shall not be at a loss where to find him and as i am to go to france i shall certainly make whatever place he is in my way if he is not lost to reason  i have now such a proof as must convince him the whole plan was laid by miss freeman but i think it best he should suffer awhile as the torments he feels from jealousy will when he finds how groundless it has been be the most probable means of effecting his cure and if mr hamilton is married before i leave england it will be a strong testimony in our favor  but to the most material point james continued his visits to mrs betty but quit his lodging informing her his master was returned from ireland where he had said i went on business and that he found i had heard something very particular about mr skeffington who she had been speaking of and who was his masters very particular friend  this raised the girls curiosity and she made it a point that he should find out what it was her young ladies were expected in a few days and i suppose she was desirous of having what intelligence she could against they came  james told me what had passed and we agreed he should not go to her for two or three days he then paid his visit with a face of great concern and when she questioned him in regard to what he had heard from me he evaded answering and seemed unwilling to enter on the subject which made her more anxious to know till at length he suffered himself with great difficulty to be prevailed on to tell her i had by some means discovered that there was mischief made between mr skeffington and the lady he was going to marry by a scheme of miss freemans that mr skeffington was gone abroad in consequence of it but he found i was determined to lay the whole matter before mrs vernon and insist on her using her authority with her daughter who he knew was privy to the affair to produce all her cousins letters from dublin by which means he said i hoped to effect a reconciliation between the parties concerned and concluded by saying he flattered himself she had nothing to do in it for if she had she would certainly lose her place besides being greatly exposed as they all would who had entered into such a wicked plot  the girl was terrified and said it would be the ruin of both her and her young lady if his master should acquaint mrs vernon of the affair though she declared neither of them had any farther to do with it than by knowing there was such a plan and how it was carried on of which her sister constantly informed her by letter as miss freeman she was sure did her mistress for she had often heard her wish her cousin had never gone to ireland as she feared it would have bad consequences  she then asked him could he think of any way to prevent his master telling mrs vernon for if it was done she did not see how either her mistress or she could stand the anger they would get for not discovering it at first for her part she was determined to run away though she did not know where to go since she had neither father nor mother living and must earn her own bread here she cried bitterly and james affected much uneasiness for her she pressing him all the time to think of some expedient that would save them from being exposed to the old ladys wrath  after much pretended consideration he told her he had just thought of one which if she consented to he believed would not fail of satisfying me as all i wanted was to lay open to mr skeffington and miss fitzgerald the art that had been used to separate them and if that could be done without applying to mr vernon he was sure i would at once give that up  she was earnest to know what she could to do and he said if her sisters letters to her contained sufficient information and that she would part with them he was certain he could prevent all farther enquiries and perhaps obtain a reward for her besides as he could put her behavior in the best light to his master  betty who was most hearty readily complied with his proposal making no other terms than those that he should get my promise never to make the affair known to mrs vernon for she was sure them letters contained every thing i wished to know and she believed more than miss freemans  she delivered a parcel of letters to him which he brought in triumph to me mightily elated with his success i immediately sat down to examine them and found a long account of her mistresss attachment to mr skeffington and her intention to seize the first opportunity of creating a quarrel between him and his intended bride and says in one of them she had discovered by miss fitzgeralds maid that he had been jealous of a mr hamilton and her mistress had given her a silk gown for the information she observes the girl that told her meant no harm but she was a simple innocent body and was not aware of the consequence  the last letter is however the most material as it contains the whole plan which was to be put in execution the day after it was dated and mentions her having wrote that note dictated by her mistress that was to be delivered to mr skeffington just when he was going out of town  the whole collection is wretchedly spelt and wrote so that i could scarce decypher some of them however as it was the same hand wrote the anonymous note which charles gave such credit to i think he must believe his own eyes when he compares them together for i hope that is not destroyed  i sent the girl a few guineas by james and my promise not to mention the transaction except to those it concerned for i find by her sisters letters she advised her not to have any thing to do with such a wicked scheme and had great scruples of conscience about it  the young ladies are come to town but miss freeman is confined to her chamber after the journey the hurt she got was in her head and the effect will not as the surgeons say be speedily removed  she ought to have remained where she was at least a fortnight longer but her impatience to get home in hopes of finding charles was so great she could not listen to advice and she now makes herself worse with fretting lest he should go from england before she is able to see him  at present she supposes he is in sussex as betty tells james and she on her own account does not pretend to know any thing about him  i am exceedingly happy in being able to dive so far into this contrivance as will i think bring matters to a pleasing conclusion between our friends at least my endeavors shall not be wanting for such a desirable purpose  i hope to be favored with a line on the receipt of this and am  my dear louisas most devoted servant henry maunsell  letter xliv miss mortimer to henry maunsell esquire july    i cannot express how much you have obliged me by interesting yourself so heartily in the affair i mentioned to you and eliza to whom i communicated your success is quite ashamed at the trouble you have had attended with some expense she is however a good deal pleased that the truth will be brought to light for though she has not now a thought of marrying mr skeffington she wishes to be cleared of the imputation of jilting him which she looks on and so to be sure does every one of common delicacy as a most scandalous blot in a female character indeed i who know every secret of her heart can venture to affirm she never had the smallest tendency to any kind of levity  the anonymous epistle is safe in my possession and you will shortly have the happiness of receiving it from my fair hand  now i know you are overwhelmed with joy and surprise and can scarce believe you have read it right but you may for so it is  i have promised to accompany mrs fitzgerald and eliza to montpellier the late shock they received has had a bad effect on their spirits and i advised them to this jaunt but they would not go without me so i have consented to be of the party for beside the pleasure i shall have in being with them i long to see gertrude and i know she and her agreeable count are now at roussillon i shall write by this post to inform her of our intention and get her to secure accommodations for us in the town  now i mention that will you be so good to take a lodging for us for a week against we reach london where we stop merely to rest for this is not a season for making any stay there two floors will do us  we mean to set out in two days and will go to you when we arrive to know where you have fixed us  but pray now moderate your transports when we meet for positively those raptures which were pretty enough when we were eighteen are mighty silly at fourandtwenty  mr hamilton and miss boil are certainly to be married  farewell till i see you  louisa mortimer  letter xlvii miss mortimer to the comptesse roussillon  july    i believe my dear gertrude will hear with pleasure that i shall set out in two days from this date on my way to montpellier in company with mrs fitzgerald and eliza whom i have prevailed on to take the journey which i hope will recruit both their health and spirits at present very much affected by mr skeffingtons behavior  i must trouble you to secure apartments for us in the most agreeable part of the town our family will consist of ourselves elizas waiting damsel and mine one man servant we take with us and we must certainly get a french valet de chamber for the time we stay so you will provide accommodations accordingly  mrs fitzgerald does not take her woman because she has her town housekeeper and being a trusty body can be depended on to take charge of every thing in the house and the furniture you know is very valuable therefore elizas maid is to supply her place  i know you would wish to have us at the chateau but it will be more agreeable to mrs fitzgerald to have a lodging in the town besides there is too many of us to go to you who are not in a house of your own however as we shall be so near you we can be every day together  miss freeman was as i suspected the author of all the disturbances i mentioned to you in my last harry maunsell has letters in his possession that prove it past contradiction how he came by them is in the language of auction bills too tedious to insert as i have still several little things to do preparatory to my journey but the story will serve us for conversation when we are traversing the shady walks of roussillon together which i hope we soon shall  we mean to go through holland and make as little delay on the road as possible  the first of august is fixed for the marriage of mr hamilton and miss boil they are to set off for belle park next day where they make a short stay and then go to hamilton hall for the remainder of the summer but will be in town every winter he has taken an elegant house in merrionsquare they will be an amiable couple and i am pleased on every account they are to be so soon married  mrs herbert informs me her sisterinlaw is just on the eve of matrimony with a young man of large fortune in that country patty is very happy on the occasion as she feared her brother would absent himself a good deal from her house while miss herbert remained single for as he knew her prepossession in his favor and could not return it it certainly would not be agreeable to him to be much in her company and she was frequently at her brothers  patty tells me mr herbert is determined to come to dublin in about a year their eldest girl will by that time want proper masters and he is so fond of her he cannot bear sending her to a boardingschool nor does she much like that mode of education if it can be avoided she chooses to have her daughters under her own eye but mr herbert is so fond of the country she feared he would never consent to living for any time in town but to her great joy he made the proposal himself  they have got a large addition to their fortune by the death of a distant relation  how happy shall i be to have this dear companion of my childhood settled near me once more for to be sure on the childs account they will stay in town at least six or eight months in the year  emily left me yesterday she is gone with her father and mother to the country but they will all return early in the winter mr oneil has taken a house so mrs rochfort must be there when next she comes to dublin but i fancy it will not be for any long time as matters between her and mr fitzgerald are i find most likely to be concluded to the satisfaction of all parties her father being quite content  i have told you a deal of news and reserved as much more for our meeting  till then adieu  believe me sincerely yours louisa mortimer  letter xlviii miss mortimer to mrs rochfort montpellier aug     as i am persuaded my dear emily is anxious to hear of our safe arrival i seize the first leisure moment that has offered to inform you we performed our journey surprisingly well and mrs fitzgerald bore it to a miracle scarce complaining of fatigue till the last day or two we made but three days stay in london for as she found herself quite able to proceed there was no occasion for delay nor did we stop longer than was necessary amongst the high and mighty lords so could make no material observations on the people except those obvious ones of their cleanliness and industry which are threadbare themes they have been so often expatiated on already  i think indeed they excel their english neighbors in both those qualities as for the former they are downright slaves to it since they debar themselves the use of their rooms for fear of dirtying them which is carrying the point to excess and excesses even in virtue border on vice  we have been here some days and are settled very agreeably in the midst too of acquaintances for here are several of our country people that we had some knowledge of who paid us their compliments as soon as we were known to be here and we are now quite sociable  gertrude though prepared by my letter to expect us was very near fainting when we met her joy so far overcame her she is somewhat increased in size since you saw her and is nearly as much ashamed of it as if she was not married it is surprising that she has not conquered her bashfulness in this country where i believe she is herself the only example of it but she seems not one bit altered in that respect  the counts affection is i think rather warmer than before she was his wife and she says all his family treat her with the greatest tenderness so that i have the satisfaction of seeing her happy only she now and then wishes to be in ireland amongst her own friends but as she will come over some times to see us all and will also see many of them here at times she will by degrees be reconciled to the necessity of living in france  next to my own country it is the place i would choose the disposition of the people here being very like the irish in kindness and attention to strangers and if their present monarch goes on as he has begun they bid fair to be restored to their natural rights liberty i mean for he is daily loosening the bands of oppression and slavery while our rulers are only studying how to rivet the chains with which they have been loading the people as long as i can remember  poor eliza tries to be cheerful but her heart revolts against the attempt and it does but make the settled languor that has overspread her countenance more visible her forced smiles make my heart ach and bring the tears into her mothers eyes who anxiously watches every turn of her features  i grieve that the dear girl cannot combat her tenderness for one who i fear would never make her happy but i am not surprised at it for in a temper so gentle as hers that cannot long harbor resentment one might expect ill usage would have just the effect it appears to have on her you know it was what i feared and was the the reason i wished she would change the scene as every object at home would revive some idea it was necessary she should forget  i am in hopes that time and the agreeable variety she meets with here will in some degree restore her peace  the letters mr maunsell has are exactly in the same hand as the anonymous one sent to charles therefore he must be convinced when he sees them but unless it could make an absolute change in his disposition i would never advise her to marry him for a jealous husband would be misery indeed  well and how goes on your affair do you still keep up that matronly gravity with which you used to receive mr fitzgeralds attentions for i dare say he has paid you a visit in the country before now do tell me all about it that i may amuse eliza with the recital  you shall hear soon from me again mean time believe me  affectionately yours louisa mortimer  letter xlix the same to the same montpellier august  0  dear emily i had the pleasure of yours within these few days and am much obliged to you for writing without waiting to hear from me there is however a letter of mine on its way to you which i suppose you will soon receive and which contains an account of our health and so forth i am sorry i cannot tell you that eliza is better but indeed i cannot as yet perceive the least amendment though i do not think she is any thing worse  mrs fitzgerald has received great benefit from the air and exercise she takes here if eliza was well i believe her mother would have no complaint  i hope little emily is quite recovered from the smallpox and congratulate you on her having it so favorably and while she is so young it is best early let the event be what it will for if they recover there is a deal of anxiety over but if it pleases heaven to take them the affliction cannot be so heavy for an infant as if they were taken from us at a later period of their lives  i had yesterday a letter from henry maunsell he tells me miss freemans health is in a most dangerous state she was pretty well and sent down to sussex to enquire about charles but when she received for answer that he was gone abroad disappointment and vexation threw her into violent hysteric fits which continued with short intermissions for two days and have left her so weak and low that the phisicians apprehended a galloping consumption will be the consequence as medicine seems to have little or no effect to be sure it cannot have much as the cause of her disorder lies in her mind and not likely to be removed  what a dreadful thing it is to be governed so absolutely by our passions for it brings on the worst kind of bodily complaints which one would think sufficient to deter people from giving the reigns to their headstrong inclinations supposing they have no regard to religious precepts which however ought to be the first motive with a christian to correct the wild sallies of an impetuous disposition  nature had been liberal of her endowments to miss freeman both as to person and understanding which had she made a proper use of would have enabled her to make a pleasing if not a shining figure in life but by forsaking the path of moral rectitude she has lost both her health and her peace the gentle heart of eliza is grieved for her though she is herself suffering from the unhappy girls misconduct  you cannot form an idea of any thing more beautiful than the situation and improvements of roussillon i think the very air that blows there inspires one with the softest most pleasing serenity imaginable and i am not at all surprised that gertrude should learn to love and even be prevailed on to acknowledge it in these delightful bowers for doubtless external objects operate powerfully on the disposition of the mind especially of women  place a pair of lovers on a barren rock the wind and sea roaring round them and i think the dreary prospect would extinguish every wish but that of finding shelter from the jarring elements at least i will venture to answer for the damsel that the tenderest eloquence would be lost on her in such a place but change the scene and place them in a blooming arbor a gentle rivulet murmuring by and all nature smiling round them there let him tell his soft tale and i think he need not doubt a kind reception for me i am so convinced of it that i am arming my heart with all its insensibility against harry maunsell comes for i think it will require no small degree of stoicism to remain unmoved by the soft language of his speaking eyes joined to the loveinspiring scene around me  i fear if i was not fully prepared for the danger i should forgetful of my promise and even of my own disinclination to matrimony step to the next church and present him with my fair hand  i think i hear you say this girls pen runs faster than her wit but consider child though i rattle a great deal there is many a true word  pardon me i had like to write a whole proverb in defiance of lord chesterfield  the old compte and comptese and their daughters arrived at the chatteau four days since their soninlaw is to follow soon they are most agreeable people as for madame st variolle i am quite charmed with her and delighted to see the tender friendship that subsists between her and gertrude she is exceeding sprightly but does not give into the gallantry that is usually practiced here i mean she does not encourage any particular gentleman to attend her as to the men in general the custom of the country permits a degree of familiarity with them that appears odd to us whose manners are more reserved it would throw us into the utmost confusion to have our male visitors ushered into our bedchambers before we were up or to our toilet while we were dressing yet so powerful is custom it is done here without the least idea of indelicacy by women who i am convinced are as perfectly virtuous as any woman in ireland and that i think is saying every thing for them even amongst those married ladies who fall in with the fashion of having a particular admirer which most of them do i am satisfied the greater number of them are as chaste as lucretia  i know several of them who from the justness of their sentiments and the whole tenor of their conduct i am persuaded would not deviate from the right path in so material a point be it as it may they are more refined in their gallantry than the english ladies who are gross enough to stoop so low as their footmen and grooms of which we have had several instances within these few years  gertrude cannot be brought to comply with any of the customs i have mentioned and is a good deal rallied for her bashfulness even by the compte i dare say she will in a while admit gentlemen to her toilet it is almost impossible to avoid it without being impolite and singular  we have thoughts of taking a trip to paris that is eliza and i accompanied by gertrude and her lord and madame st veriolle who has invited us to her house and was indeed the first proposer of the jaunt i had it in contemplation before as a thing that would amuse eliza but had not mentioned it she seemed pleased when it was spoke of and mrs fitzgerald consented at once saying she could never want company there were so many of our acquaintances in town  i fancy we shall set out in day or two our stay will not be very long so you need not expect to hear from me again till after we return by that time perhaps i shall have some interesting intelligence from henry who i imagine is ere now on his way to geneva where he was informed charles meant to make some stay  we are going to dine at roussillon and i am yet to dress i shall therefore bid you farewell for i must take a little more time than usual to make myself very lovely as there are to be three or four young dukes and as many marquisses nothing under to be met with here who are all candidates for my favor  do you know that i am the admiration of the french men quite eclipse eliza who is acknowledged to be infinitely handsomer they say if she had miss mortimers vivacity she would be but too charming indeed i wish i could give her a little cheerfulness i would willingly share my conquests with her if that would blot charles from her memory  but it will not be  compliments to mr and mrs oneil  believe me  affectionately yours louisa mortimer  letter l montpelier sept     dear emily a sudden illness which attacked mrs fizgerald put a stop to our intended jaunt to paris for though she was well again in two days we would not venture to leave her as from the symptoms we feared it was the gout in her stomach which might return and we could not have enjoyed ourselves under that apprehension if we were three hundred and fifty miles from her we therefore contented ourselves with making short excursions of two or three leagues and have visited several of the nobility and gentry who are relations or friends of the roussillon family and were every where received with that pleasing attention and politeness for which this nation is distinguished and which makes it such an agreeable residence for strangers  the adjacent country is very delightful but not near so populous as england or ireland it is impossible it should if we consider the thousands of both sexes that are buried in convents besides their clergy being condemned to perpetual celibacy  i will not dispute about the piety of shutting up their youth from the world though in my opinion our duty to god does not consist in secluding ourselves from society but putting religion out of the question it is certainly the most impolitic custom that was ever allowed by any government since it must depopulate and consequently impoverish the country  spain and portugal where this religious phrenzy is carried to the highest excess are melancholy proofs of it for at least half of each kingdom lies uncultivated and uninhabited while their convents and monasteries are crammed with people who were they exercising their different talents in the world might be useful members of the community  france is not so bad in this respect as there are some bounds set here to superstition and i think some limitation to the number of those houses they begin to see how destructive these institutions are to the prosperity of the kingdom in general  i have given you a dissertation upon convents as it is a subject england or ireland does not afford us and i thought you would expect something new from france  i have had a letter from harry maunsell he is yet at geneva and ledged at the same house with mr skessington  the first night he arrived he stayed at the house where he set up but you shall have it in his own words as follows  i went next day to a coffeehouse where i thought it likely i should meet him he was not there when first i went but there were several gentlemen of the town with whom i had been acquainted when on my travels who all came up to compliment me and i had been conversing with them about half an hour when charles came in his countenance showed his mind was not at ease for he appeared pale and languid and much altered for the worse since last i saw him he spoke to some gentlemen near him and then took a seat without once perceiving me and seemed so lost in thought that when i went up to him the sound of my voice made him start  he however expressed great pleasure at seeing me and asked was i going to montpellier as he knew i intended having answered him in the affirmative he said he should be glad to accompany me if i would wait till he got letters from england  you may guess this proposal was instantly complied with on my part as he could not have made a more agreeable offer  at his request i then walked to his lodgings and as we went he apologized for leaving england without seeing me saying he was at that time in a situation of mind not to be described he was now better and hoped time and proper reflection would restore his peace but added sighing it is hard to break the cord of affection that has been for years twining itself round the heart i believe harry that is a truth your own feelings will make you acknowledge he touched a tender string i too sighed assent to his observation and the ideas it raised kept us both silent till we were seated in his apartments  he then insisted i should dine with him and said if i was not already fixed i could be accommodated in that house and it would make him very happy  i soon agreed about it and sending james with my trunks took immediate possession of my chambers  in the evening we went out to pay some visits and did not return until late so that nothing farther passed that night on the material subject but i determined to introduce it the first convenient offer he gave me as i thought it necessary the affair should be thouroghly discussed before he and miss fitzgerald met  but i do not mean to tell him she is at montpellier shame would certainly prevent his going there for he has declared he never can bear to see her after the unpardonable folly he has been guilty of as he cannot expect forgiveness  i had soon an opportunity of entering on the subject by his mentioning miss freeman  you are possessed of a happy insensibility charles said i that can speak with so much indifference of a woman that is dying for you  he looked very serious and said he was not now in a disposition for joking i assured him i did not mean it as a joke then replied he excuse me mr maunsell if i disapprove of your seriously affirming such an indelicate story of a young lady i highly esteem though i am not coxcomb enough to suppose she loves me  if answered i you really did not see her partiality to you which i find other people did i am not surprised you should be displeased at my mentioning it as a womans delicacy ought to be sacred but when she herself departs from it and goes such unwarrantable lengths to gratify her passion surely she has no right to expect others will speak of her with much tenderness  he looked astonished and saying he did by no means comprehend me begged i would explain myself  i immediately went for a small box in which i kept the letters and laying it on the table told him he would find in that a full explanation of the matter and also of some disagreeable circumstances which i believed would appear to him in a quite different light after he had read those papers from what they had done  being engaged for the evening i left him to peruse them at his leisure and make his own reflections on them  i did not return until late so went directly to my chamber though james told me mr sheffington was not in bed but had been walking about his room for some time as if under an agitation but as that was not an hour to enter on the topic i retired to rest and did not see him until we met at breakfast  he looked embarrassed and continued silent seemingly at a loss how to begin the subject until i led the way by asking had he looked over the letters he replied i have and am ashamed of my own folly and ingratitude in affronting by my unjust suspicions the sweet girl who was incapable of giving me any real cause for them though i have been so industrious in seeking out imaginary ones but said he i have suffered severely for it and shall continue to suffer even more from reflecting on the happiness i have wantonly flung from me  i expressed a hope that matters might still be made up between him and miss fitzgerald but he declared he could never bring himself to appear before her or if he did to what purpose would it be for though the gentleness of her disposition might prevent her harboring any violent resentment against him yet he could not expect she would hazard her peace by uniting herself to a man who had given such proofs of a jealous temper for notwithstanding i feel myself perfectly cured of that foible how shall i convince her that it would not break out again no maunsell she never can so far forget the unkind treatment she has met with from me and i must bid adieu to all the felicity i once promised myself  he ceased speaking and was so much affected that i was moved at his affliction especially as i thought his fears were well founded and that it is very probable though miss fitzgerald may pit and forgive she will not marry him unless she can be brought to believe as i really do that he will never again yield to a passion which caused him so much uneasiness  it was not for some time that he thought of asking how i came possessed of those letters i told him james had some how got acquainted with miss vernons maid who let him into the secret and he knowing how much i was interested for your happiness persuaded her to give him these papers which would lay the whole scheme open but i must tell you charles your friends saw at first there was a plot in it and as miss freeman immediately followed you to england concluded it was concerted between you till your going abroad and the intelligence james gave me of the effect it had on the ladys health convinced us it was all her own contrivance  he said he had no right to complain of our suspicions since he must own appearances were much against him especially to eliza who was conscious of her own innocence  i took occasion from thence to preach to him on the folly of trusting to appearances and not giving our own reason fair play it was that hastiness in judging had caused all this misunderstanding and interrupted his own peace as well as that of his dearest friends  he acknowledged the justice of my observation and said he was so perfectly sensible of his error that he hoped he was quite secure from falling into it again  indeed i hope and believe so too if my louisa should be of that opinion will she not become his advocate with her fair friend i have since told him all i had heard of the accident miss freeman met with on the road and the very precarious state she is now in for when i left england there was very little hopes of her but i did not think it necessary to tell him it was i employed james to dive into the affair since he did not seem to suspect it  he made some pertinent remarks on the impropriety of the young ladys conduct as well as her ingratitude to his eliza who had shown her so much friendship  we are now only waiting for the letters he expects from england which i hope will not detain us much longer as i have the utmost impatience till i again view that enchanting face and hear the music of those accents which vibrate to my heart and cause such pleasing sensations as none but those who love as i do can feel   so far harry maunsell you see i have given you the conclusion of his epistle least you should imagine he was so stupid as not to be affected by our approaching meeting or so impolite as not to tell me so  besides i know young widows like to hear soft nonsense whether said to themselves or others not but i suppose you have sufficient entertainment of that sort from your own swain now that all impediments are removed  i charge you do not think of marrying till i return for i intend the same day shall serve for you and eliza and then i can perform the part of bridemaid to you both as i foresee my mediation will not be necessary to bring about a reconciliation in that quarter  harry knows little of the matter if he thinks his friend has need of an advocate but i do not mean to tell him so for it gives these men such consequence in their own eyes when they find their influence is so powerful over our fond hearts  instead of pleading for the offender i am endeavoring to fortify eliza with resolution to keep up some degree of dignity on their meeting and to take at least a few days before she suffers herself to be persuaded to sign his absolute pardon  but i fear all my good lessons will be forgot when the loved youth appears unless the sense of his own demerits may make him too humble to ask a complete restoration to her favor  harrys letter threw her into the prettiest agitation imaginable when she found they were coming to montpellier but the idea of charless sufferings melted her to tears in short she was quite fluttered and affected a hundred different ways but that i am not surprised at for her mother was not much better though the affection she bears him is only that of a parent while her daughters are of a much tenderer kind  her health mends apace and her countenance begins to wear its usual serenity even the country seems to have new beauties for her at least she had hitherto passed them over unnoticed so true is that line of the song   we only can taste when the heart is ease well these sensitive plants may boast of their exquisite feelings but for me i am content to be only moderately happy on condition of never being supremely miserable and for that purpose took pains to suppress those violent sensibilities that would not be controuled by reason and are therefore always dangerous and frequently fatal to the person who possesses them  a letter from harriet boil to eliza informs her of her sisters nuptials with mr hamilton i wonder how charles will look when he hears of it for harry does not say he had mentioned any thing of that to him  mrs fitzgerald begins to long for home however we shall not leave this for some time yet it would be foolish to make so short a stay after so long a journey  i shall not write to you again till i can inform you how matters are accommodated between charles and eliza  yours louisa mortimer  letter li miss mortimer to mrs rochfort montpellier sept     i am sure my dear emily will be full of impatience to know how our lovers quarrel has ended why as all love quarrels do end in an increased affection for each other  as i foretold she signed an act of oblivion as soon as he could assume resolution enough to ask it which was not for two days such a just sense had he of his high crimes and misdemeanors  i am provoked that she could think more lightly of them than he did i would have taken one little weeks beseeching at least before i would have suffered myself to be prevailed on a pardon so easily obtained may encourage him to farther transgressions but eliza has no art and as her heart forgave she could not keep her tongue from acknowledging it to tell truth i believe she will have no cause to repent for he seems so perfectly convinced of his fault that i think it impossible he can ever fall into it again  but i must tell you how matters were conducted to bring them together  harry never gave the smallest hint of our being here and contrived not to come in till night least they should by any accident meet us or our servants he then made some excuse for going out and came himself to inform me of their arrival  fortunately eliza was in her mothers chamber and it was agreed between him and me he should bring charles in the morning as if to visit a friend of his and i was to prepare the ladies for the interview  when he left me which was not till i positively insisted on his going i went to mrs fitzgeralds room to communicate the matter to them having first bid kitty withdraw but i was soon obliged to recall her for i had but just said mr maunsell was with me when eliza dropped on the floor in a fainting fit which put us all into a hurry and confusion for some minutes when she began to revive and soon after by proper applications was perfectly recovered  her spirits which were always weak have been still weaker this while past and sunk under the sudden mention of harrys arrival knowing who accompanied him  when we were once more left to ourselves i told her if she had not resolution to support the idea of seeing mr skeffington i feared she would never stand a meeting next morning so i had better write a note to forbid his coming as such another fit might have a bad effect on her health  she begged i would not teaze her but tell her was he really to come since she found some preparation would be necessary to enable her to receive him with any degree of composure  i then informed her how we had settled it and advised her to retire to rest and try to conquer the flutter she had thrown herself into else charles must have a physician for his gentleman usher as i supposed his palpitations would be as great as here is some of the faculty should certainly be at hand to apply proper restoratives  i was obliged to talk nonsense to prevent her making such a serious matter of it and when i had set her and her mother laughing at the ridiculous description of what i suppose their meeting would be i bid them good night and went to my bed where i slept very comfortably till disturbed by eliza who i dare say had not closed her eyes  i arose and was but just dressed when our french valet informed me two gentlemen enquired for me  i instantly went to them and soon as i entered the room mr skeffigton approached with a rueful countenance and with great humility kissing my hand said will miss mortimer receive a penitent and deign to intercede with her lovely friend for a man who has so high a sense of his faults that he is incapable of pleading his own cause  i told him smiling his sex were seldom so humble therefore as i loved to encourage good dispositions and had beside a proper state of the case laid before me by mr maunsell i had ventured to become his advocate and had so far succeeded that his aunt and cousin had promised to receive him as a friend that had been absent without any retrospect to former disagreeable occurrences which i believed it would be best not to mention as yet  he was full of acknowledgments for my kindness and i conducted him to his audience  his color went and came as he approached and his voice faultered so he could not articulate a word which mrs fitzgerald observing stepped forward to meet him and kindly taking his hand said my dear child i rejoice to see you indeed she loves him as if he was he own then turning to eliza will not you welcome your cousin my love the dear girl who was little less agitated than he held out her hand which he pressed to his lips and then ventured to salute her while she was utterly unable to speak as a tear stood trembling in her eye which would have overflowed its bounds on the least attempt at speech their silence however was sufficiently eloquent since it plainly discovered how their hearts stood affected to each other  i thought it high time to put an end to the pantomine which was likely to become too distressing so hurried them into the breakfast room where harry was who advancing to pay his compliments relieved them all from a very awkward situation  the conversation then became general till the gentlemen left us to pay a visit at roussillon being first invited to dinner by mrs fitzgerald  harry told me after he had informed mr skeffington when he got him near our hotel who he was to meet and it was with the greatest difficulty he could prevail on him to proceed not till he assured him i would interest myself in his favor and knowing my influence over eliza he had no doubt of my success  they continued on these terms for two days not a hint of past transactions dropping from either party when being all engaged to pass the day at the chateau every one as is usual there disposed of themselves as they found most agreeable  eliza it seems had retired to that arbor where the compte first declared his passion to gertrude and was followed by charles who had observed where she went  i also was straying in the garden and passing in sight of the place she came out and joined me not thinking i saw him there but if i had not the blush still mantling on her cheek would have betrayed her i just patted it saying well eliza that blush is not for nothing charles has pleaded his cause more effectually than the ablest advocate could do is it not so she said i was a provoking girl and she would not tell me she knew i would blame her and she could not help it now  indeed eliza you wrong me i never blame any one for consulting their own happiness and i suppose my dear you are the best judge of what will constitute yours  fie louisa said she there is no standing your looks no more than your expressions when you choose to be teizing  just then to her great relief we were joined by madame de st veriolle which prevented our pursuing the subject  i am sure she was heartily glad of the interruption for i dare say she could not have brought herself to tell me she had consented to give her hand to charles as soon after our return to ireland as matters could be settled for the purpose which i was informed of by henry the first opportunity he had of speaking to me alone  he was full of joy at his friends success and asked if eliza had told me no i replied but i knew something of the kind had been the consequence when i saw she had been with him in the arbor for arbours are of all other places the most dangerous to female resolution he laughed at the idea and clasping me to his bosom wished if that was the case he could find me in one  when we get home you will be all marrying and giving in marriage i only shall remain in the singular case  i dont however find myself a bit uneasy at the reflection the epithet of old maid is not at all formidable to me for as i at present meet as much respect as most of the matrons i know i suppose that will not be lessened when increase of years makes me wiser and better than i am now  i tell you emily i shall retain my good humor when you and eliza are fretting over your squalling infants  charles means to set off in a few days as he had a good deal of business to do preparatory to making settlements and so forth and wishes to be in dublin before november  we shall remain here till the latter end of october and mr maunsell stays to be elizas cecisbo as for me i have about a dozen lively frenchmen at command amongst whom i dispense my smiles so equally that one cannot be jealous of another and i reign sole empress of them all  elizas ideas are so totally engrossed by one object that she can find no amusement in the agreeable gallantry she would receive here without their having the least design on her heart but she would not take it on her conscience to encourage it fearing least any of them should think her serious and be hurt when he found she was engaged  i cannot persuade her that those things are mere matters of course here and meant only as politeness it is impossible to argue her out of romantic notions  harry takes up his abode at roussillon as soon as charles goes according to invitation the old compte and comptesse return soon to paris and their soninlaw accompanies them their daughter stays till gertrude and her lord goes which will be immediately after we leave this as she would shortly be unfit for traveling  you need not expect to hear from me again for i do not intend writing any more while i am here and i hope to find you and most of my friends in dublin by the time i get there  you are very idle or rather you have more agreeable amusement pour passer le tempts their writing to me i have had but one letter from you yet had i thought of that sooner i would not have said a word about charles and eliza and that would mortify you  perhaps you will say it would be no loss since i have so bad a hand at describing love scenes true but i have given you the outlines and as i dare say you are now pretty conversant in them you may supply the deficiency by the power of your own imagination  and so in the true royal style we bid you  heartily farewell louisa mortimer p s i forgot to tell you the news of mr hamiltons marriage which i took an opportunity to mention seemed to strike charles with great surprise and when i observed to him it was a thing guessed at by most of their acquaintance before he left ireland he looked in some confusion and said indeed miss mortimer i think i was under infatuation for many circumstances now come into my mind that might have convinced me it was so if i had not been blinded by that unhappy passion  but i hope it is for the best as the misery i have endured has most effectually cured me and since my gentle eliza pardons me i am once more happy    letter lii miss mortimer to the comptesse de rousillon dublin dec     here we are my dear gertrude after four months ramble enjoying ourselves under our own vines and under our own fig trees no that will never do in a city  but what is far more comfortable at this season and in our climate we are snug at our firesides talking over the pleasing hours we spent with our kind friends at roussillon  as i wrote to you on our arrival at harwick i have taken a little time to rest since i came home before i would take up the pen again for i assure you our journey from london was very fatiguing and disagreeable the weather being extremely severe at least we found it so we had been so long used to the mild air of montpellier where none but gentle breezes fan the rosy bowers  while we were in london james brought us the account of miss freemans death  she had languished in a wretched state from the time she heard that charles was gone abroad mostly delirious in which way she died a martyr to her own ungovernable passions  there is something shocking in a womans so far departing from the delicacy of her sex and all the rules of decorum as this unhappy girl did i think her friends may rejoice that she is no more for had she lived with so little regard to religion or rectitude as appeared in her conduct it is more than probable she would have brought a reproach on herself and them  i found mr and mrs herbert in town and all their little ones they have five lovely children and the best behaved babies i ever saw  their mother without any harshness has let them see they must obey her therefore it is a point they never dispute and a grave look from her is more effectual than correction from one who only indulges or chides her children rather according to her own caprice than their deserts  mr herbert is very partial to his eldest girl though patty frequently remonstrates against it as unjust and in her own behavior takes care to show equal affection to them all when they equally deserve it which prevents their little hearts from being filled with jealousy and animosity against each other  you may guess how happy it makes me to have patty once more in the fame street with me as she now is we call to remembrance a thousand pleasing circumstances that occurred in our childish days and enjoy over again our early friendship  harry who tenderly loves his sister and has as you know some small regard for your humble servant is quite delighted to get us together and joins in recollecting past pleasures but then he is too apt to dwell on those incidents that made the deepest impression on his heart however his tranquillity seems restored which adds much to my satisfaction  it is quite distressing to see our friends repining at disappointments that cannot be remedied and refusing the happiness within their reach because some one thing they wish for is withheld perhaps if it was granted the acquisition might make them miserable a thing we have frequent examples of yet we are not to be convinced that providence is wiser than we are  mrs rochfort is come to town with her father and mother her marriage is fixed for the   th elizas the day after  she insisted on emily taking the lead as she was determined to be bridemaid i would not say any thing against it because i was glad to see her in such good spirits but i have a notion she will repent placing herself in such a conspicuous light the day before her own wedding she must probably stand many jokes on the occasion but that to be sure has never occurred to her  she looks and is as well as ever i saw her the cause of her illness which was uneasiness of mind being removed the effect has ceased  mr skeffington has given james grady fifty guineas as a reward for the part he took in bringing those letters to light and i find this increase of fortune has encouraged him to offer his hand to my jenny his heart has long been here is and jenny has condescended to accept it with my approbation  you may be sure i shall make some addition to her portion and i assure you she has saved a good deal in my service  they mean to go into business linen and haberdashery they have fixed on  i shall certainly countenance them for i think it but right to promote the interest of servants who have been honest and faithful though i totally disapprove of making them confidants or allowing them any influence over us their education renders them unfit for advisers and we often see the bad effects of young ladies placing confidence in their waitingmaids who always encourage them in whatever they know to be their inclination as they are sure of being rewarded for any assistance they lend or even where they mean well ignorance often leads them into errors they do not foresee the bad consequences that may attend their repeating what they hear as was the case with elizas kitty for i am sure the girl loves her mistress yet charles incautiously betraying his temper to her was near proving fatal to the peace of the whole family  eliza has talked to her a great deal on the subject and intimated an intention of parting with her lest her indiscretion might hereafter create disturbance for as she exposed the only defect she had discovered in mr skeffingtons disposition to a stranger she was no longer to be trusted  poor kitty came in great woe to request my interest with her mistress not to discharge her promising never to commit such a fault again and she is accordingly reinstated in elizas favor  you shall hear from me when the weddings are over i am anxiously expecting an account of your being safe and well faite me baisemens a monsieur la compte and pray present my best respects to all his agreeable family particularly his amiable sister  your friends here joint in the most affectionate wishes for your health and happiness none more sincerely than  your louisa mortimer  letter liii from the same to the same  dec     at length my dear gertrude elizas novel is concluded like most other novels with the serious catastrophe matrimony  the ceremony was performed yesterday evening in what we call a private manner that is quite in the family way but in such a family as theirs you know what a crowd they make when gathered together on these occasions  eliza did not behave quite as well as your ladyship in the same circumstances for it was with the utmost difficulty she could say i will loud enough to be heard by the clergyman and as to the rest we could only perceive her lips moved to the words the good man however who saw her heart was consenting took the will for the deed else i think she would still have remained a maiden indeed he espoused the cause of his sex so far as to insist on her pronouncing the word obey pretty audibly now had i been in her place that of all words never should have passed my lips i whispered that to harry first opportunity he replied smiling he would venture to take me even on them terms if i would say i loved no said i for if you would dispense with my promising obedience i should fear you meant to enforce the doctrine by some more powerful argument he called me some fond name saying he must be a brute indeed that would desire me to comply with any thing that was disagreeable to me  how mild and gentle those men talk before marriage and how soon they change their tone after yet you can produce one that continues the same style and i have some little idea that harry would have been like him  i wish he could conquer an attachment that promises so little satisfaction for i want to make up a match between him and harriet boil whose heart seems perfectly disengaged and she has wholly laid aside her affectation  but it is in vain to think of it for he is quite determined  how i wander from my subject to return to it then  charless behavior was tender and attentive but delicately so endeavoring all he could to keep up her spirits in which harry and i assisted him for the rest of the young folks were more inclined to amuse themselves at her expense  cards however relieved her from their raillery beside some share of it was directed to emily and her bridegroom who as i told you were married the night before and a good many of the same company had been at their wedding  she too was much affected though she had gone through all the ceremony before but her heart was now concerned and she was agitated by all the hopes and fears so natural to those who love  doubtless the unhappiness she had already experienced in the state must have caused some disagreeable sensations when she reflected on the possibility of being again subject to the same though there is all the reason in the world to believe she has nothing of that kind to fear from her present choice as there does not appear to be the least defect in his temper and she you know is all sweetness  they are to accompany charles and his bride to castle skeffington as will all the bride men and maids of which number are mr maunsell and your louisa  we spend the christmas there then pay a visit by invitation to mr and mrs hamilton and return from thence to dublin  i forgot to tell you mr fitzgerald looked a little cool on charles when first they met after our return from france and not very cordial on eliza he was displeased with him for his behavior and with her for not resenting it till i laid the true state of the affair before him which reconciled him to them both else it might have had unpleasing consequences as he would have certainly told mr skeffington his mind who would probably have been too high spirited to enter into any explanation of the matter  the prevalence of that most horrid custom duelling makes one tremble at the prospect of warm words between men  eliza who observed her cousins coolness was very apprehensive till i undertook to remove it i was happpy in succeeding and they are now just as usual  we shall leave town the  0th do not expect another epistle till i come back for i know we shall live in a perpetual hurry of company while we remain in the country as all the people will crowd to pay their compliments to the two new married couple  mrs fitzgerald is i suppose the happiest creature now in the kingdom in seeing her two darlings united after the great danger there was of their being separated for ever  she has forgot all her complaints and is as young as any of us i hope she will long continue to enjoy her present satisfaction which nothing can add to except living to see half a dozen grandchildren playing about her  i expect my next will be a congratulation on the birth of a little monsieur or mademoiselle be it which it will i beseech you gertrude do not dress it in the french style till it is childish years are somewhat passed  i think the children in france so be powdered and curled have just the appearance of a race of dwarfs do let yours look like infants while they are so for you cannot make them like any thing half so pleasing  the time employed in writing this i have stolen from the hours of rest finding it impossible to obtain a moment for the purpose during the day i am so entirely engaged with the wedding folks who will not excuse my absence  they all desire me to assure you and the compte of their kindest regards  i kiss your hands and am my dear gertrudes very
