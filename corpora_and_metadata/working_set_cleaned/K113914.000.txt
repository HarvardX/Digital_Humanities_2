perfectly aware that no man ought to obtrude himself unnecessarily on the public  but when chance has thrown in the way of even the meanest individual occasion to remark on a variety of matters that lead to such information as may afford general or particular instruction and amusement i know no reason why such a labor should not aspire to popular notice  upon this principle  i address to the best judge i know of all general subjects whether natural or acquired my musical tour in which i have had opportunity at different times to laugh to deplore to pity and applaud  it has excited in some instances my astonishment in others my indifference it has called forth my warmest gratitude and moved my ineffable contempt  the provocation of these different feelings of course had its rise from my different public and individual reception i have been lost in admiration at the benignant liberality of one man in power and obliged to shelter myself under a sort of contemptuous compassion at the ignorant importance of another i have been charmed to wonder at professional candor and i have smiled unmoved at professional envy i have warmed to delight at instances of private friendship and have beheld with unhappiness and forgiven wanton attempts to do me private injuries  as for my public reception it has been flattering in the extreme as far as it relates to applause i wish i could say the same as to profit one advantage i have certainly reaped from it  my country experience has given me a more competent view of popular opinion than all i had before done i believe it may be owing to my having conversed with my audience and taken them at the moment i made them feel among the number however who have attended me i shall not easily forget the few who are firmly convinced i am a most impudent impostor  for that mr dibdin amassed so large a fortune by the padlock and the jubilee for the truth of this matter see the statement of my profits for dramatic pieces as to be perfectly independent whereas i stroll about the country that i am a stout jolly young man in my own hair whereas mr dibdin is a tall thin man and wears a wig nothing can be more curious than popular prejudices i know a clergyman who having enjoyed for several years the worlds good opinion was turned off through a ridiculous pique by a young nobleman to whom he was preceptor after his disgrace every vice and folly that could taint a mans character was attributed to him he drank wenched and was so complete a gambler that had he kept his old situation much longer he would have ruined the principles of his pupil i know him well  and am convinced he is free from all these vices and in particular as to play  i declare i once saw him in a single game at whist revoke five times  on this subject i have a large stock of anecdotes which you will get in their place  this tour also will as far as opportunity has permitted me give the public some useful hints relative to inns manufactories natural and artificial curiosities the state of the country as to cultivation and such other particulars as have cursorily struck me  and really mr paterson ought to subscribe handsomely  for i shall be able to improve his road book which in some instances is very erroneous having also had many opportunities of conversing with men of genius i shall communicate my remarks on those conversations in which in particular will be comprised my sentiments on music in all its points of view for to tell you a secret while i merely considered myself as a public man i held up disdain as a shield to ward off the shafts of envy and conceived myself under no obligation to blunt that malignity which neither gave me pain nor injured me in the opinions of the candid and liberal having however made my election to cramp myself no more in the trammels of public drudgery i mean without favor or affection honestly to point out that music neither is nor ought to be what it is represented that a knowledge of it sufficiently competent for all common purposes is to be easily attained and in short to show the world how to beware of counterfeits for such are abroad  and as i pledge myself to do this fully and fairly i have no fear of succeeding to the discomfiture of all such as have maintained that i am no musician that i do not know the nature of harmony a single method in modulation or a rule in composition another object which peculiarly demands my attention is the theater nor will a fair exposition of its arcana come by any means improperly through the medium of this publication an account of the motives which induce me to quit my native country are a part of my compact with the public and they cannot be enumerated without relating many theatrical transactions  besides a recent correspondence with mr harris actually comes within the meaning of the tour and as i consider myself under an examination  and what ought to be serious indeed a selfexamination  would it not be unpardonable to conceal any part of the truth which for my comfort will infallibly be credited because ceasing to be a public man i cannot be supposed to have any interest in what i do  these matters together with a prodigious number of observations both of my own and others on all general subjects  anecdotes and the essence of what i have delivered at different places under the title of readings and music will make up a series of letters which as they are to contain the remarks of a man long in the habit of administering to the pleasure of the public will i trust with the advantage of your sentiments on each separate letter be found to excite and satisfy public curiosity thus you see like othello i could take a hint  no sooner had you signified a wish that i should address these letters to you than i plumed myself upon that opportunity of introducing them eligibly to the world and i hope you will sustain no disgrace in this liberty taken by  dear sir yours etc c dibdin hereford august          letter ii encouragement to proceed  give me a man that is not passions slave and i will wear him in my hearts core to t s esquire dear sir i cannot have a stronger stimulative to proceed than your kindness the praise you are pleased to afford my introductory letter  which cannot from its nature be so entertaining as those of which it is the harbinger  gives me very flattering hopes that this testimony of public gratitude will hold some rank in the worlds estimation be assured it shall be written with the most rigid integrity and i think it will create some interest you are so kind to say that you really think a series of such letters would take and though much depends on popular caprice and momentary taste for which there is no accounting yet you must encourage me to proceed  for it is a musical age and an annus mirabilis of anecdote under the auspices of a generous public assisted by the advice of a warm and experienced advocate i shall fearlessly go through my task assured while i address myself to you my feelings will meet every indulgence from the kind friend and my fame every advantage from the able critic  i am etc c dibdin sheffield october          letter iii written to prove that profit is a better thing than fame  who would fardels bear  and sweat and groan under a load of life  to t s esquire dear sir a measure without a motive is a superstructure without a foundation there has been as much speculation on my becoming an itinerant as might in france have procured me the honor of a lettre de cachet vainly i say at the bottom of my bills that having received a long and liberal patronage from the public i come to thank that body for having amply requited my services say the cavillers your argument makes against you had you drawn so much money as you report the present measure would not have been worth your while and if you are such a favorite why not continue in a service that has procured you such reputation some few i have set right in these particulars  the rest are referred to this very letter which shall a round unvarnished tale unfold   first then  i certainly have received more public applause than any english composer except arne nor was it least when i could boast of that glorious competitors friendship can any other than myself count upwards of ninety songs of his own composition that have been encored and yet i never in my life wrote a single puff on my own account  but on the contrary constantly reprobated that contemptible support of imbecility and rotten prop of debilitated reputation out of nearly sixty pieces which i have written and composed and which before i have done i will enumerate no one has been actually damned  three only have been withdrawn  the shepherdess of the alps which was miserably performed  the chelsea pensioner which was actually so successful as to have four songs encored on the last night it was represented  and amphytrion which i was compelled to write on a plan i never approved many of the remainder have been performed more than thirty nights some more than sixty in the first season  not to mention those which constantly keep the stage and are favorites all over the kingdom and yet among these i have not included the padlock the jubilee nor any of those pieces which though composed by me are not of my writing a reception like this is evidently a liberal one and must have brought an immense sum of money  but to whom to the managers of the theater  who have constantly the oyster while the poet and composer divide the shells thus uniting both those characters in myself i have been encumbered with two shells instead of one  for fame after all like a theatrical banquet though very fine is not eatable these reasons which i trust bear no marks of vanity since they are plain facts and i offer them only in my vindication will show that though i have been handsomely paid yet it has been in a coin advantageous to no other being than a camelion and as i am no air eater but on the contrary love as well as any body the good things of this world my intention is certainly to go where i am informed they are to be found  thus you see i have made the matter fairly demonstrable without the smallest depreciation of the public liberality they gave the money and i the pleasure and therefore i have not the least doubt but they had rather i had received the profit  nevertheless  i should have made the best of these bad bargains and jogged on in the old way had it not been evident that my unfortunate connection with the circus barred the doors of the theater  or rather left them a little open that they might squeeze me the harder i have had no piece since amphytrion but liberty hall which after having nine songs encored the first night six of which were repeated and the other three excused out of compassion to the performers was hissed by a party on the tenth and immediately withdrawn this cannot possibly be attributable to mr linley  for though eleven years ago this circumstance deserves to be told i had certainly no expectation at drury lane after garrick retired from it poor brereton however to whom mr sheridan was under obligations wishing me to remain at the theater made his friend promise that i should return to my old situation as mr brereton is dead i should not venture to assert this as a positive fact had not mr sheridan confessed he had made such a promise not however without saying he was sorry for it as he was sure my being at drury lane would cause a heartburning between mr linley and me he had nevertheless he said done something that would answer the purpose as well  having prevailed with mr harris to engage me as composer to covent garden at his desire i called on mr harris who assured me and i sincerely believe him that he had never any conversation whatever on the subject his words were surely mr sheridans mad no engagement of course took place and i went to france  while i am on this subject i shall mention that there are moments when mean men are ashamed of their own littleness at my return from france i made a verbal engagement with mr harris to the exclusion of all others as composer to the house let it be remembered i do not say this to accuse him of inconsistency  it was certainly his intention not to have a composer till the business of poor vulcan induced him to alter his mind it was at this time the theatrical coalition had taken place and mr harris and his colleague were never asunder one morning i came to a rehearsal rather before the time and found these gentlemen talking on the stage mr harris to whom i had that morning sent the hunting song beginning give round the word dismount dismount came to me very eagerly to thank me for my expedition in getting it ready mr sheridan who could not avoid seeing me seemed not to know me we talked a good while on different subjects during which time to do his modesty justice with all his consummate eloquence he knew not what to say at length finding he must speak to me he called mr harris aside and asked him who i was  and being informed he came up to me to make an apology for as he said not knowing me i might be altered but so was he  for when i before saw him he was as remarkably spruce as at the time i mention he was remarkably slovenly said he mr dibdin i beg your pardon a thousand times  i had not the smallest recollection of you i dont know how it is  but  you are strangely altered you had no powder in your hair when i last saw you faith then said i twould have been no wonder if i had not known you for when last i saw you  you had but said i to mr harris tis not wonderful mr sheridan should not choose to know me  for the last time i saw him was when he sent me on that fools errand to you  mr sheridan excused himself from keeping a promise he had made of giving me the situation of composer to the house which i had seven years held under mr garrick by telling me that a connection with drury lane would certainly cause a heartburning  though in the affair of liberty hall mr linley protracted the benefit till it was no benefit at all  though mr linley positively accused a friend of mine as the author of the above supererogate damnation which friend has given me many strong and unequivocal proofs that he is no dealer in words only  though i had the honor of kicking my heels in mr linleys hall about thirty times in one season concerning a farce which was cursorily read liked revised and at length returned through the medium of the under prompter  which farce by way of parenthesis i afterward sent to mr harris who returned it writing me word i had better get it performed at drury lane  though notwithstanding all this i since sent two pieces to mr linley which were returned unread  and lastly though mr linley to put the matter upon a footing wrote me a letter saying they did not want my talents at drury lane  yet mr linleys character as a fair candid honest man free from littleness and above all envy  his diffidence of his own merit which he has often confessed to me did not at all qualify him for dramatic compositions  in short his amiable private virtues his wonderful public abilities which are so real that they are ten times over repeated almost every day in almost every newspaper all these abundantly prove that the aboverelated circumstances though selfevident have somehow or other like a sham flaw in a good indictment a sort of apparent defection and can by specious and ingenious arguments which are a great deal better because more fashionable than plain truth and common sense be made to quash the charge and not only show the accused immaculately innocent but grossly injured but to drop all pleasantry  are not these fardels of the mind and if so  are they not incomparably more galling and ponderous than those of the body mine however will always be relieved by the reflection that i have a friend like you and the pleasure i take in assuring you that i am unfeignedly yours  c dibdin york sept          letter iv more reasons for preferring the substance to the shadow  nothing extenuate   nor set down ought in malice  to t s esquire dear sir as tristram shandy was a long while employed on writing his history before he was born so i shall be some time getting on with my musical tour before i set out my motive which i talked of in the last letter is like a quantity of vivid quicksilver which being touched separates into a number of smaller globules these in order to go on with precision it must be my task to sweep again into the original mass  or to speak less circularly  it will be proper to touch on all that train of subordinate events which induced me to muster up the absolutely necessary resolution of roving into foreign parts to do this without a retrogade motion for i hate every thing ungraceful i shall not go regularly back but at once skip to that period when in consequence of a difference of opinion with mr harris about the mode of altering amphytrion  which being done his way was as i predicted performed without success  that gentleman and i separated at that time i applied to a friend of mine to enter into some scheme with me who prevailed on several other gentlemen to join him in building the circus the history of that place  the infamy of its present occupier  the blindness of the surry magistrates  the ill treatment of the proprietors  and my incorrigible weakness and folly in tamely suffering so many impositions would make up matter for a much larger work than this i am writing  but as i will not pay your patience so ill a compliment as to require that you should rake in a jakes and as also i mean in my public decease to die in peace with all men i shall only say that having labored four times more during three years than any other man ever did i found i had nothing for it but to regain the theaters this was certainly a forlorn hope and i struggled with it as long as i could in particular i had the pleasure of kicking down about   0l by building a castle in the air near pancras by virtue of an agreement with the famous  i had almost added another syllable  jacob leroux esquire architect brickmaker and tradingjustice in the district of clerkenwell this gentleman with a dastardly speciousness for which a hyena might envy him promised me a license in the name of several magistrates who opposed the motion and knowing i suppose the actual value of the protestations he had made erected the skeleton of a building which was blown down by the first high wind after the license was refused  foiled thus in every attempt at independancy i did my utmost to get reconnected with the theaters but to no purpose one maneuver which i practiced to accomplish this deserves notice i got a friend to present a comedy to drury lane without naming the author who had so much interest that mr sheridan himself read about half a dozen pages and praised them the rest of the piece was read by mrs sheridan who liked it very much it was then referred to mr tickel who referred it to mrs tickel who read and approved it after this mr tickel pronounced that with a few alterations it would do and something was in agitation though never completed concerning an accommodation for  00l till the piece should make its appearance my friend is since gone abroad  and seeing i had nothing else for it i wrote to mr tickel setting him right concerning the author of the comedy and desiring to have it returned though i took a great deal of pains to get an answer to the letter i have never yet received one and the piece of course remains in their hands as i shall certainly throughout the whole of this work be very tenacious of advancing what i do not positively and from my own conviction know to be fact i shall remark upon the above  that as i had no communication whatever with mr tickel concerning this same comedy i could come at what i have related through my friends account only i have a pretty strong presumptive proof however that it is literally true for during the transaction to clench the business which the readers see it did with a vengeance a near relation of mr tickel had a curacy given him of two livings not an hundred miles from bedford by the very gentleman who presented the comedy another friend in the same manner sent an afterpiece to mr harris who returned it saying though it had great theatrical merit it would not do on the stage  hear this ye wouldbewitlings and rejoice theatrical merit is no longer a dramatic requisite this piece is now in the hands of mr colman who by agreement was to have performed it during his late season  but whether he did not wish to risque the principal character with any body but mr palmer which is the reason he assigned to me adding that the piece was so well written it deserved good actors for that it was in the style of the guardian but more delicate  or whether he was shocked at the cruel and inhuman murder of harvest home see the statement of pieces  or in short whatever may be his reasons it still lies in his hands i even to leave nothing untried made an agreement with mr daly the irish manager which after being broken on his side three times yielded me in three years about   0l  whereas had it been properly kept i must have received six times that sum  finding myself therefore in the state of adam with all the world before me where to choose  for i have pretty well proved that the theatrical paradise was shut against me  it struck me that the warm and fostering climate of asia might revive a drooping plant that had been neglected in its native soil but then as mr bays says came in the quomodo  how to procure the ways and means i had never traveled much in england and i thought it would be no bad thing to pay my personal respects to my old patrons to thank them for their liberality and at the same time present them with such an entertainment as should not only insure me their good wishes and interest them for my prosperity but supply me with the means to accomplish my design  determined however to make sure of every thing in my power i wrote to mr harris telling him my intention and offering to sale such materials as i conceived might be useful to him i received a letter encouraging me to furnish him with pieces of any description and i have actually from that time to this at my leisure been hard at work for him  but i know not how it is  my mind misgives me on this subject i have since seen mr harris at bristol and heard from him at york however i shall anticipate nothing  all matters shall come in their proper order  and if you have the patience i wish you  for patience you must have if you jog on with me through my tour  indeed if i was to follow the examples of some musical travelers i should exercise no other virtue in you  you will permit me to place the banquet i have invited you to in what manner i please interest forbid having such work for my own imagination i should not leave the reader as much room as possible for the workings of his it has been affirmed that the pleasures we fancy are completer than those we enjoy and if this position be founded who knows but by constantly keeping curiosity on tiptoe i shall receive credit for having furnished a good feast even though half the merit lay in exciting the appetite there is more art say the painters in concealing than showing would any one read an epigram if the last line were taken away not to gratify would be to to make a tantalus of the reader but still let us remember that possession easily attained is but another word for satiety  thus having by a regular gradation with a few shirts and books in a trunk a welldigested plan in my head and a letter from dr arnold to dr hayes in my pocket seated myself in the oxford stagecoach my next letter will of course contain what happened to me at that confusion of tongues in the prosecution of which as well as of all the rest of my adventures though no more than othello would i have any thing extenuated or ought set down in malice yet like dick in the miller of mansfield i shall certainly speak truth and if that happens to be satire i cannot help it  yet never shall i say truer than when i assure you  i am with perfect sincerity yours c dibdin york september  0       letter v containing a journey to oxford  with a description of a musician with good sense and a clergyman without pride  yet i am honest  though i wear black to t s esquire dear sir it was not in the dull month of november when englishmen hang and drown themselves but in the sprightly month of march when they rouse from their lethargy when citizens and tomtits begin to inhale the bracing influence of the eastern breeze and ponies and countrylodgings are smartened up for customers you who are perfectly correctly critically erudite will not surely blame me for being particular as to dates some readers remember nothing but the chronological parts and it does not signify threepence by what means this queen happened to be ravished or that emperor flayed alive so that they can give a faithful account of the time such an event took place mr sheridan marks the time in the commencement of his duenna by making the clock strike four though he ridicules that very circumstance  forgetting of course that he had used it  in the critic  on the seventeenth of march      i left the regions of smoke for the regions of accomplishment nothing passed on the road worthy your notice the conversation of the passengers in the stagecoach was in the usual style almost every object brought with it some remark we admired as usual the entrance of sionhouse the convenient situation for stargazing of mr herschel  we sighed as usual to think on human depravity on contemplating the gibbets upon hounslowheath and we lamented their fate who were poisoned at salthill the very dinner was as usual  some soup which might have been mistaken for a dose of salts relished with leeks and a boiled leg of mutton scarcely warmed through at length the majestic view of lofty steeples towers and turrets demanded our admiration  and we presently arrived at oxford  the next morning i called on dr hayes if you have never seen this gentleman i must tell you that he is the very kind of man that of all others interests you strongly in his favor the moment you speak to him i believe no human creature ever possessed a better or a more blameless heart and never was a countenance more the index of a mind for whatever fancy can picture of benevolence mildness and benignity is written there in characters so legible that they cannot be mistaken if he should see this portrait of himself and from his diffidence wish i had blotted it out let him forgive me in the reflection that i am only ambitious to do him that justice which he has so much pleasure in rendering to all mankind nay  you shall yourself confess i am not a flattering painter can you tell me my dear sir a character so near perfection as he who a professor himself knows not professional envy this man then is dr hayes  and he is so very different from joseph surface that all the world speaks well of him and yet all the world speaks truth  after we had talked over my business in the course of which conversation i told him that i had a very strong wish to start my entertainment at the university to give it a proper sanction he referred me to the vice chancellor and gave me an introductory letter i asked him if dr chapman was easy of access and he told me i should find him the most cheerful amiable man i had ever conversed with this report was so true that i must try my hand at another description  the vice chancellor of oxford is a tall wellmade man with all the easy grace and native simplicity of a plain country gentleman  and yet a demeanor that might shame a courtier his eye is so piercing that it seems to penetrate your very intentions  and yet so mild that it is easy to discern his only solicitation is to know your wants and supply them his conversation is as simple  yet as elegant as swifts drapiers letters his discernment remarkably acute and his discrimination precision itself this gentleman if he should so far honor me as to read this book may wonder how i can venture to affirm so much from the little opportunity i had of conversing with him but i will be ingenuous enough to declare that i went to him predetermined to make my observations  and those observations went not more to any other part of his conduct than his invincible integrity  of which as well as the rest you shall judge  i must premise however i would not declare what passed between us could i for a moment suppose it would create the most distant chance of belief in the breast of any young gentlemen of the university that dr chapman is not as anxious to give them pleasure as they to receive it he certainly debarred them at that time of what they afterward did me the kindness to consider as a very high gratification i told him the nature of my entertainment and his words were these i am very sorry i must refuse you my consent your professional abilities deserve a different answer and i dare say you would perform nothing that could discredit either yourself or the university  but i am at this moment particularly circumstanced there have been lately many riots and though i am very desirous of pleasing the students they sometimes put it out of my power here was a mr collins and i could not with propriety let him perform he went away  and the young gentlemen took the matter so much in dudgeon that they encouraged some italians to sing here without my permission i was in consequence under the painful necessity of sending them to prison the riotous conduct of the students upon this occasion went so far that one of them struck the mayor and it was expected at the time i was there that a sentence of expulsion would pass against him at the end of the term and it is more than probable were i now to tell you  which i wish i could  mr dibdin you may perform your entertainment  they might think i set you up against their favorite italians and it might turn out a serious quarrel  for in such a case your professional reputation would be of no avail  and they would resent in their anger what in a cooler moment they might be convinced they had reason to thank me for  nothing could be handsomer than this reasoning i felt myself so influenced by it that i was more pleased at such a refusal than i should have been by an unconditional permission this gentleman took a great deal of pains to prove himself right in a matter wherein had he been so minded he had nothing to exercise but an ipse dixit the discharge of his duty as vice chancellor did not satisfy him  he chose to discharge it as a man in fine as he saw nothing that he could disapprove in the nature of my entertainment he could not bear that i should come to oxford for nothing and thinking very probably that his apparent refusal might be of public disadvantage to me he gave me his word that i should perform my amusement in the following term thus i took leave of dr chapman a character were it more imitated by the clergy religion would be more revered by the laity  to prove however that i have no further interest in what i have said above than that fair and candid justice i am determined to do every man i mention in this series of letters i declare i did not put ten guineas in my pocket by my performance at oxford on my return  and i neglected what would have been a considerably greater advantage to me i can therefore have no other reason for what i here advance than a regard for truth unbiassed by any servile motive and as that shall honestly actuate me upon all occasions you will by and by get the portrait of another vice chancellor who had his motives for refusing me too  but they were not exactly of the same complexion as dr chapmans in short plutarch compared the paralleled virtues of his heroes  mine will be all contrast and though i will not suppose but that all characters are honest who wear black yet it will be readily granted me there are shades of that color even from the dismal dingy first mourning of an heir to the light airy frenchgrey in which he takes possession of his fathers titles and estate  adieu hey for bath  where you will find me in my next letter  i am dear sir yours etc c dibdin york october         letter vi a description of bath and a tolerable instance of modest assurance  he speaks more in an hour  than he will stand to in a year  to t s esquire dear sir on sunday march  0 i arrived at that mixture of lowliness and grandeur pride and meanness politeness and impertinence  bath  the region of fashion and dullness  of elegance and vapidity  of public reputation and private intrigue  of extravagance and imposition where dress is the ne plus ultra of all virtue  where a graceful minuet is considered as the height of human perfection  where goodbreeding is carried to such a pitch of refinement that doves and rooks mix sans facon and the foxes and geese are all of one family  where the buildings like the visitors are grand heavy and smokedried  where irish gentlemen of high families and low fortunes lay in wait for opportunities to amuse those misses who pass their whole time in contriving how they shall most conveniently leave sick mamma to the care of the old nurse  and where convivial lords who have worn out the cellar the larder the waiters and themselves in london are wheeled down with about six months to live to drink the waters hobble cotillions pick their teeth qualify burgundy with spruce beer faintly revive expiring nature by the administration of stimulatives beat false time scream bravo mal apropos and hiccup out non nobis domine  here  for fortune so willed it  was i to make my coup dessai and having fixed myself in a lodging i began to prepare for my entertainment which i advertised for the following tuesday wednesday and friday on the monday morning came a loud rap at my parlour door i called come in and a genteel well looking man entered the room with  in what they call the singing or fashionable brogue  sir your most obedient humble servant i understand you are mr dibdin whom all the world knows  the composer of the padlock and the jubilee and poor vulcan and the quaker and all those charming pieces that it is a long time we have been delighted with oh by my soul i do tink that beautiful song  stay a minute  which is it ah fait its no matter  you never made a bad one in your life well sir dont let me interrupt you i take the liberty of calling  for you see i am distractedly fond of music and i find we are going to be charmed with a little entertainment of your fabricating sir i have it in my power to do you a great deal of service and to be sure i shall conceive it the duty of myself and every other friend i have to be as stirring as possible in this business i know already of a party of fourteen that i have not spoken to and den there is  oh fait there are some very capital families here  dont be uneasy  pray could you favor me with some little delicate charming beautiful touch  only just you know to make their mouths water by telling them what i have heard i was at the piano forte and complied with great readiness and indeed as much as any thing to know the drift of this long harrangue which i shrewdly suspected implied something more than mere spontaneous good nature after i had done  he cried  ah by my soul  there is no other man alive but yourself wid such taste well now i will tell you something  where do you perform i answered at the newrooms well but sure there will not be room enough for the people they will come in such crowds  but that is not what i am going to say  do you know you have it in your power to do me the greatest favor in the world i am sure then sir i have it in my inclination ah now that is what i have always said  true genius and politeness constantly go hand in hand together sir i thank you very kindly you must know there is a lady in this town of great distinction  one of the first irish families  the honorable mrs on  she is at the head of fifteen thousand a year and writes poetry like an angel  oh to be sure i have not the sweetest song of her writing  here it is  you shall read it he then produced me the first stanza of a song certainly very prettily written now do you see i entreat this may be a secret between you and in  and so very irish was this request that mathews of bath to whom i had been playing the songs of harvest home was in the room from first to last  what do you tink i have promised  you must know i have a pretty notion of music and i play tolerably well for a gentleman on the violin  i have promised to set this sweet song to music and for the life of me i dont know how  now you see  you would do it it in three minutes  i can say it is mine  and as we shall keep the secret nobody can know any tink about it what do you tink of this  you know i shall make some large parties for you  oh by my soul you may depend through my means of having a thick audience well sir if you will be so very kind as to do me this great favor i shall have a very singular and particular pleasure  and in return exclusive of the attention i mean to pay your performance which indeed is but the duty of every man who is a lover and encourager of professional merit  i shall certainly serve you any way within the scope of my interest and ability not to tire you  i set the song promising like the prince of wales about the death of hotspur that if a lie would do him grace i would dress it in the finest terms i had the captain was in raptures  promised me to bring all bath  and then came  alone i met him afterward at the catch club where he made no sort of apology for his breach of promise but carelessly said that mrs on  was charmed with the song  that he felt himself very gay in his borrowed plumes  that he was sorry i had such a bad room  that it would do my heart good to hear them sing catches and glees in ireland where he should be very happy to have the pleasure of seeing me  and in short resorted to such paltry subterfuges as induced me to pity him for a contemptible ingenuity which i dare say he thought merited praise  determined however by an honest maneuver to repay his nefarious one  i gave the song to mr incledon who sings it charmingly at vauxhall and it is now printed with my name to the music in the title page the negroes with that shrewdness for which they are remarkable call a promise windy at a place called deep bay in st kitts the young men are remarkable for taking advantage of the credulity of the negro girls one of the poor creatures who had been abused and forsaken complained to her brother honest quamino answered  sissy i always say you dam fool  for what you go deep bay  you no savey deep bay young man full a windy  which compliment however it may belong to the irish gentleman has nothing to do with me when i assure you i am  most sincerely yours etc c dibdin york october         letter vii in which the reader is rescued from the company of a yawning audience and a melancholy catch club  by a whimsical anecdote  if in these hallowed times when sober sad  when gentlemen are melancholy mad   when it is not deemed so great a crime by half  to violate a vestal  as to laugh   to t s esquire dear sir on tuesday the twentysecond at noon i made my public appearance  if performing an entertainment before eight and thirty persons can be called so  for the first time during twelve years and if i had not a perseverance beyond any other man it would have been my last heaven defend me from such a set of insipid vague unmeaning countenances one of the number i have since performed before at monmouth and another at wakefield both of whom insisted upon it that the performance was much better than at bath  when the fact was they were only in company more disposed to be happy all those passages which to your knowledge have kept the audience in a roar were received with a vacant gravity an unfeeling stare a milk and water indifference enough as i say of my poet to make a man forswear ever taking a pen in his hand  yet i found afterward that they were all pleased  it was only their manner of expressing themselves it was bath and therefore it would have been vulgar to laugh or give way to any emotion that indicates pleasure such as the heart participates this i had occasion more minutely to remark by paying a visit to the catchclub  where even the glass which never circulated more freely  nor all the toasts that accompanied it  the songs that relieved it which were pretty well fraught with that reproachful substitute for humor that men who are strangers to real wit find so much pleasure in could scarcely raise a smile  the broad bottoms of the glasses as if instinctively resounded a peal of applause at the end of every song but till the end of the next all was silent as death i note this as an instance of fashionable gravity beyond credibility  for that a meeting professedly convivial should apparently be held without mirth is a kind of existence without a soul  a mental death  but it may be reconciled by saying that it is a refinement on politeness reserved alone to grace the lukewarm court of the lukewarm king bladud  as these remarks on the affected stupidity of the bath auditors naturally lead to audiences in general i shall while i am on the subject speak a little of the different feelings of different spectators some have been in raptures about nothing  others have applauded without discrimination  some have intruded their opinions on every body and others have not dared to feel till they had asked the opinions of their neighbors but it is not bath alone  every separate place i have seen has its peculiar mode of indicating its pleasure you may remember in a letter written to me some time ago you wondered at my advertising my entertainment at birmingham when it was notorious that at one of the meetings where lallegro il ed pensoroso was performed the audience was unmoved at every part of it but the line drew iron tears down plutos cheeks  at bristol  which place to a proverb is remarkable for hoggishness  they did not consider so much the quality as when they had enough  and so of the rest  the particulars of which local taste will come in their place i cannot however refrain from noticing the delight that grog has given all the captains of ships and the race horse a gentleman of leeds assured me that song had procured an old hunter of his a sinecure for life  for so much had it roused his fears lest the faithful creature should become a hack on the road and afterward tug round a mill that even after he should be useless no sum should purchase him out of his possession  nor is this gentleman the only one by many who has made such a resolution thus by one happy portrait of strong nature have i procured the emancipation of a set of brutal slaves  let the expediency of freeing human ones be left to the decision of others all the sportsmen the classical men have chuckled at the siege of troy and the musical at pomposo  not to mention that every individual member of all the audiences ever assembled to hear me has bridled up and been charmed beyond measure at the compliment contained in the last four lines of the entertainment i shall conclude this letter with an anecdote of garrick and old cervetto  when garrick returned from italy he prepared an address to the audience which he delivered previous to the play he first appeared in when he came upon the stage he was welcomed with three loud plaudits each finishing with a huzza as soon as this unprecedented applause had a little subsided he used every art of which he was so completely master to lull the tumult into a profound silence  and just as all was hushed as death and anxious expectation sat on every face old cervetto who was better known by the name of nosey anticipated the very first line of the address by  aw  a tremendous yawn a convulsion of laughter ensued and it was some minutes before the wishedfor silence could be again restored that however obtained  garrick delivered his address in that happy irresistible manner in which he was always sure to captivate his audience and he retired with applause such as was never better given nor ever deserved but the matter did not rest here  the moment he came off the stage he flew like lightening to the music room where collaring astonished nosey he began to abuse him pretty vociferously wha  why  you old scoundrel  you must be the most infernal  at length poor cervetto  oh mr garrick vat is the matter  vat i haf do  oh god vat it is  the matter why you old damned eternal senseless idiot  with no more brains than your damned bass viol  just at the  a  very moment i had played with the audience  tickled them like a trout and brought them to the most accommodating silence  so pat to my purpose  so perfect  that it was as one may say a companion for miltons visible darkness  indeed mr garrick it vas no darkness darkness stupid fool  but how should a man of my reading make himself understood by  a  answer me was not the whole house pit box and gallery very still yes sir indeed  still as mouse well then just at that very moment did you not with your damned jaws extended wide enough to swallow a sixpenny loaf  yaw  oh i wish you had never shut your damned jaws again sare mr garrick  only if you please hear me von vord it is alvay the vay  it is indeed mr garrick  alvay the vay i go when i haf the greatest rapture mr garrick the little great mans anger instantly cooled the cunning readiness of this italian flattery operated exactly contrary to the last line of an epigram  the honey was tasted and the sting forgot  and it not only procured noseys pardon but forced a declaration from his patron that he ought to be forgiven for the wit of the offense upon this principle perhaps the yawning of the bath audience was all rapture  in which case churchill can only mean that every man has a right to express his feelings his own way  mine is to say literally what i mean which i do when i assure you that i am  with great truth yours etc c dibdin york october          letter viii treating of fashionable sincerity and the honor of an irish manager  all this wheedling of lucys is not for nothing to t s esquire dear sir i had scarcely returned home after my first performance at bath when two ladies knocked at my parlour door they were ushered in and having thanked me for my entertainment and professed themselves extremely sorry that i had been so thinly attended they proceeded to assure me that as apparently i was a stranger to the mode of conducting an amusement at bath they who were leaders of fashionable matters could not refrain from calling to set me right concerning some particulars and offer me such advice as might be condusive to my interest after a good deal of conversation it was agreed that i should suspend the performance to give them an opportunity of enquiring when a repetition of it would be most agreeable to the company then in the town these preliminaries adjusted they went away and one of these ladies actually took the trouble of advising me by letter of what she had learnt and a time was at length appointed which would according to her advice procure me a full audience the morning came and i had the honor of meeting only sixteen persons but what most astonished me was that my two patronesses did not appear among the number it immediately struck me that they had played me the second part of the same tune through which i had been so completely hummed by the irish jolmon but why  wherefore  from what motive they wanted no song set to music and yet there must be something in the wind or else why call on me and write letters not to tire you about such a stupid business i at last learnt for a certainty that they were supporters of the old rooms and had taken every possible pains to decry the entertainment  to represent me as an impostor  and appoint a time when nobody would attend  not because they had the smallest objection to me but  because i performed at the new rooms thus at bath i fell a sacrifice to a stupid caprice in which i had not the smallest concern  at length my eyes were opened by mr derham the master of the new rooms who assured me it would be the height of folly to attempt another performance i closed with him in opinion and offered the money i had agreed to pay for the rooms which he refused with these words  mr dibdin however you may have been treated by others in bath you shall meet with nothing illiberal from me i have no sort of objection to getting money but i never yet got any dirty money  and i am sure i will not begin now if you think i have done you any kindness the only return i require is to hear of your prosperity which i sincerely wish and should be happy to promote i shall make no comment on this kind conduct of mr derham his domestic and general character is too well known to need my panegyric and i am sure though my regard to justice would not permit me to do so i should have better pleased him had i been totally silent on this head  these matters passed at that notorious moment when the business of mr twycrosss e o tables engrossed all the conversation of the place  when the dovehouse exulted and the rookery shook to its foundation that building however i am afraid is erected upon too permanent a footing to be overturned so easily those are temporary convulsions and only serve to discover the damaged parts that at a proper expense they may be the more securely stopped at this time  for things fall out generally pretty apropos with me  i received a message from mr dalys agent who happened to be at bath to engage a performer  you may remember in letter iv i mention an engagement i had made with mr daly and this is a proper place to go into the particulars of it to do so i must state the substance of a handbill i was compelled to publish in the month of february last it mentioned that i had entered into an article under a penalty of  00l with mr daly for three years to furnish certain pieces and certain music for the irish theater that mr daly had broken this article in three several instances two of which i had overlooked and was willing to qualify the third if mr daly would let the whole matter go to a reference this  being then in england  he seemed to consent to a gentleman on each part was appointed but as it was evident his friend was too closely connected with his interest being afterward his agent and indeed the very gentleman who sent to me at bath as above my appointed referee seeing all this wished to have an umpire the business was however trifled with mr daly would not sign the bond of arbitration and in short nothing had been done when my friend was obliged to leave town and mr daly on the eve of his departure for ireland in this situation i was determined to bring him to reason and for that purpose commenced an action against him  but resolving to treat him with every kind of delicacy i would not suffer it to be served this he was informed of by my attorney to whom he acknowledged that i had treated him so handsomely and with so much lenity that he engaged his word and honor not to leave england till i should be fully and fairly satisfied he thought proper however to forfeit his promise and my friends urged me to publish an account of the matter as a warning to others  this business had stood over from february till the above message i met the gentleman and after a fruitless attempt to obtain my due fearing that some trick might be played me  as the article was not at that moment cancelled  i agreed to receive forty pounds for two hundred and exchange general releases so charmed was i to get rid of so scandalous a business and as it was represented to me that much inconvenience might accrue to mr daly from the above handbill which still stood out against him uncontradicted i voluntarily offered to give a declaration under my hand that i was satisfied with the conclusion of the business these matters premised the proper writings were put in hand i received thirty pounds in cash a note at two months of ten pounds and a promise in writing that the pieces of mine then in mr dalys possession should be delivered into the hands of a friend as soon as possible had these promises been fulfilled i should have conceived myself prohibited by my written declaration from publishing this transaction  but as in ten months instead of two the payment is not made nor the pieces returned i look upon the authority i gave to say i was satisfied in the light of a defeasance on the back of a warrant of attorney which is done away if the conditions annexed to it are not literally complied with  the bond therefore as far as it relates to mr dalys having behaved unhandsome and dishonorable remains yet in full force and virtue and if any persons after this choose to engage with mr daly without a proper security i think a statute of lunacy might be taken out against them without much impropriety  i should be wanting to myself and common justice if i did not say before i quit the subject of bath that with particular pleasure i saw my old friend keasbury with whom twenty years ago i have heard the chimes at midnight he was well and happy and may he long continue so nor must i omit that i witnessed a most respectable performance at his theater the farce which was mr sheridans st patricks day was acted infinitely better than ever i saw it in london indeed this is one excellent property of a regular company in the country the minuter parts  which a town actor thinks so little of and which by the bye are remarkably material witness garricks attention to them  are paid much more respect to but however this applies more immediately to bath where my old friends veteran judgment and gentlemanly deportment will always insure from the performers a proper respect and attention but lest it should be thought that i am applying the motto at the head of this letter to any interested purpose i assure you i only wish it to tell against the ladies and the irish manager for i aver with the truest sincerity that i desire no favor at mr keasburys hands and only wish i may see him alive and hearty many years to come and that so far from wheedling you i mean nothing but truth when i assure you that i am  with great truth yours etc c dibdin york october          letter ix a farewell to bath  they talk of beauty that they never saw  and fancy raptures that they never felt  to t s esquire dear sir it is indispensably incumbent on me to say something concerning the manners musical taste etc of the inhabitants of all those places in which i have been or may yet pass through this however i shall not be even tolerably qualified to do till i come to where i returned to cambridge having before that time made no resolution to publish my tour and therefore of course many matters which i have since treasured were almost forgotten as soon as passed indeed i do not conceive it at all my province to point out marketdays fairs wakes and statutes the number of inhabitants or talk of corporations charters grants and privileges unless indeed it should seem to be necessary for the illustration and establishment of any particular fact which common opinion has grossly misrepresented thus i will not call bristol the second town in england in point of the number of inhabitants when i am sure sheffield contains as many  and i believe manchester but certainly liverpool double the number i shall however give such cursory hints as i have promised in my first letter at present i have not quite done with bath  which as a city is like a frenchmans shirt  the ruffle is very fine but the body very coarse place a man in his sleep in the crescent and he might upon waking conceive himself in an amphitheatre erected by the same workmen who built the temple of solomon but instead of this place him in one of those blind alleys  for there are no other communications  which separate the old town from the new and fancying himself in fieldlane or st giless he would immediately search for his pocket handkerchief in short as i observed before all is either splendidly dull or dirtily vulgar as to their musical taste it is a bad imitation of that in town  they contented themselves with bagpipes till the famous commemoration and then they must squeak belch and snort out oratorios i asked one of their capital hands how they managed to understand handel and he answered me they fund un woundy crabbed at first but after they had altered un a little they did un auver rarely at the only inn i saw at bath they were extravagantly dear and intolerably impudent in respect to natural curiosities the baths may be reckoned of a very extraordinary kind  but every body knows what they are for artificial ones faces and fashions just at this time the ladies wore a veil made of one very large piece of gauze which entirely covering the head and monstrous head dress was drawn by a running string and tied about the waste thus exhibiting a thin but prodigious globe on their heads and no sort of addition on their petticoats  for hoops and trimming were out of fashion  every lady but especially if she was tall and thin looked like a stalk of dandelion run to seed the heads of which children under the name of mops and something else blow for pastime into the air exhibit them at every corner in short bath is the fittest place in the world for art to banquet on credulity  for extravagance and folly to go unmasked at noon day for reason and wisdom to shun  and to speak in the language of the poet for rakes and idiots to talk of beauty that they never saw and fancy raptures that they never felt  in my next letter you will find me at bristol at which place and in all places even in the luxury of an orange grove shaded by the spreading cedar and refreshed by the spiceconveying breeze i shall not be less than at this moment  yours etc c dibdin beverly oct          letter x a comparative view of diet and gormandizing and another of theatrical merit  all the worlds a stage  and all the men and women merely players  to t s esquire dear sir would one think it possible that a distance of only twelve miles should make such a difference in manners as to present you with two distinct species of human beings at bath every thing is superficial  at bristol every thing substantial at bath every thing gay  at bristol every thing grave in bath they live in fine houses and are poor  in bristol in shabby ones and are rich at careless bath nothing is thought of but the present moment  at provident bristol no step is taken but with a view to the advantage of posterity in short they are both actuated by an equal though different species of folly for one flies off from the reasonable part of human pursuits and seeks for pleasures that have no place but in the imagination like a volatile body which leaves the earth and loses itself in space while the other is buried in the muck and grossness of sensual enjoyments till the wearied appetite is sunk in gorged satiety without capacity to know distinction  on my arrival at bristol which was on monday in the passion week the first objects that presented themselves when i alighted from the coach were three living turtles lying on their backs this circumstance soon produced me an account from the waiter that on the following week the duke of portland was expected there with a large body of the minority and that ships had been dispatched to fetch good cheer on the joyful occasion their only fear it seems was that as his grace labored under an indisposition and was obliged to eat by prescription he could not be able to cut any capital figure at the noble exercise of the knife and fork mr fox mr sheridan and their facetious colleague capt morris who it was reported was hired on purpose to abuse the ministers in a new song set to an old tune were however expected to fill up the principal parts in the gormandizing concert which was to finish with a capital duetto between burgundy and disaffection but so fallacious are the hopes and precarious the expectation of turtleeaters as well as all other sublunary beings that these glorious prospects vanished like a dream for the duke of portland came almost alone  no one adherent of consequence having accompanied him but lord stormont whose passion in no way leaning from the line of a perfect gentleman and a true bred man of fashion the poor dear bristol men felt awkwardly throughout the whole business and were even some say heard to groan when they presented the duke  not with his freedom for that cost nothing  but with the gold box and five pounds a year  for though this last was not sterling yet a promise with a merchant is the same as money  the salary annexed to the high office to which they did his grace the honor to call him  passion week being observed in bristol with great exactness by way of balance in hand to answer the expected disbursements during the feasts after easter nothing like amusements could be thought of in the easter week every moment was appropriated to the duke of portland therefore of course i could not get my entertainment in edge ways on the week following when i did perform it and heaven knows to very little purpose the constant cry was  that so much more money had been expended on the above occasion than was expected that they were obliged to pull up a little  but if i would stay a fortnight longer and perform upon more reasonable terms there could be no doubt but i should find it worth my while never having been fond of any thing so rigidly methodical and fearing it would not answer my purpose  the constant maxim of a bristol man being to take care that nobody shall get any thing by him  i gave the matter up and devoted the remainder of my time to pleasure  among the rest  for the first time i had ever seen any thing written by mrs inchbald  i attended at the performance of such things are and the widows vow  the first of which i should have known belonged to a lady if it had been only for the wig which i will venture to say outdoes every thing in mrs behns rover the parts were many of them incomparably well played i never saw mr lewis in twineall but i should think nothing could surpass bernard in that character mr diamond was very correct and able in haswell  and indeed where there would otherwise have been any deficiency perfectness and good discipline gave the whole an air of respectability which i could wish to see imitated on a london theater  where frequently in a game of romps the author is kicked and buffetted about in a most unmerciful manner in these particulars my old valuable friend jefferson  who hearing i was at bristol came from bath on purpose to see me  perfectly agreed with me what can be the reason jefferson is not engaged in town this question i did not ask him but it has twenty times occurred to me surely the man whom garrick took delight to perform with cannot but be an object to the theater he was constantly as every body knows the colonel briton to his dox felix  the claudio to his benedict  the aimwell to his archer  the frederick to his don john  and i could name many other similar instances  nay when he left off walking as benedick in the jubilee he chose jefferson as the only person that could represent him jefferson is like garrick in the face and he gives you a strong idea of him altogether only larger nor let it be said that garrick used him as a soil it is well known at the theater that garrick was particularly careful to have those plays well got up in which he appeared himself upon these occasions he had recourse wherever he could to jefferson parsons weston and dodd did not then garricks judgment rank jefferson respectably it is true he shrunk a little from the very firstrate abilities he would never couple with barry in tragedy and very reluctantly indeed with king in comedy  and if the common course of the business made it indispensible  for where is there a play in which king has not successfully performed  you will always see that the two characters wear so very different a complexion that no auditor can draw a comparative view of their merits and here i cannot refrain from noticing that there was no man whom mr garrick openly caressed and secretly hated so much as mr king i will bring this fact home to mr kings recollection mr garrick prepared a prose dialogue which was spoken by himself and that gentleman at the jubilee immediately after the ode  a time when there was not the smallest possibility of receiving attention to any thing but this was not enough  what part did mr king act why truly in the place where about twelve hundred people were in enthusiastic admiration of shakespeare he was to find out a thousand faults in his writing nor was this ungrateful task fairly set about  for written by mr garrick the objections were all pretended  the better to show his defense of the poet by way of answer i know this fact or i would not assert it and i believe it may be easily reconciled when we consider that mr king added to his uncommon merit as a performer is an independent man yet with all his faults should the memory of garrick be revered i have an enthusiastic reverence for his merit as a performer  and as jefferson was at least his faithful and approved companion in his theatrical career let us no more neglect him when we think of garrick than we would pylades achates and patrocles when we think of orestes aeneas or achilles perhaps however as my interest at the theater is not very strong i had better have let alone this recommendation of my friend  but it cannot at any rate injure him with the world  and as his ideas at least like mine are independent he must content himself  for no man through the wonderful serenity of his disposition is more easily contented  with being respected instead of affluent  my opinion however of my theatrical influence was somewhat different at the time i mention  for on that morning i met mr harris who was for the benefit of his health at the hot wells this gentleman so corroborated the contents of the letter i formerly mentioned that during the play i took measure of bernard and blanchard  and they may remember i told them so  for those parts i intended to introduce for them in a new opera which has been long since finished but i fear will never be performed  in this letter you see i have stuck close to my motto  for whether men perform the farce of greatness zeal fashion or gormandizing in real life or on the stage as foot says the purpose is the same and the place immaterial as i have not in the writing of those letter a single document to consult but my memory how naturally have the greatest part of my quotations been from shakespeare voltaire meaning to abuse him pays that wonderful poet a most elegant compliment he says the english because they find in shakespeare many passages fraught so strongly with force and nature that they get them by heart in spite of themselves think him a great writer if they wanted a better proof i am sure it was not in mr voltaires power to give it them  adieu yours very sincerely c dibdin why have i not heard from you   beverly october          letter xi a grateful subject  nay do not think i flatter to t s esquire dear sir as so many procrastinations threw some time on my hands i improved it as much as possible by cultivating the friendship of a gentleman whose professional abilities and private virtues endear him to all who have the pleasure of his acquaintance a better proof i think of his private worth need not be given than that he passes from eight to twelve hours out of twentyfour in fagging at teaching that most miserable of all drudgery and the remainder cherishing his wife and improving his children nor need i hold him up better as a model of professional excellence than by remarking that he has genius judgment taste and what is better good sense to regulate them his compositions which are many of them models for harpsichord music never sink to mediocrity and often rise to perfection he has not the folly to substitute abstruseness for nature but contents himself with pleasing instead of surprising as a performer he shall take any mans style and excel him  and i will demonstrate it in a moment first there is no passage ever so difficult but he can execute  and what no other player i ever heard could attain  i mean keeping regular time  he has in the highest perfection for let the passage be ever so rapid or interwoven a child with an ear may as easily mark the accented parts as of the most familiar tune i beg however i may be understood to mean that my friend is no conjurer nor performer of impossibilities  for threefourths of harpsichord music have neither plan nor motive nor indeed any drift but difficulty  in particular those unmeaning senseless rhapsodies in music that were they executed by apollo would have no better effect than a dutch concert for the sake of simplicity that beautiful groundwork of all sublimity i hope i am understood  and yet is not that hope like many of mine fruitless i shall make myself clear however by saying there are two positions in music which common sense says must ever be kept separate and apart these are the different distinctions of time  one is to count four and the other three yet the musicmongers  against common sense  with no other remedy for their imbecility than abstruseness  no other substitute for their sterile and unprofitable imaginations than extraneousness  pretend to make one hand play four and the other three in and at the same time cannot the most common understanding without the smallest knowledge of music see in one moment that this is an impossibility if you should go to bristol call on mr boyton  the gentleman to whom i have alluded above  and he will for my sake be glad to see you  unless he should be offended  which i entreat he will not  at my endeavoring to do him a piece of justice which he will think more than he deserves though i well know my utmost praise is inadequate to his merit the subject of this letter has given me so much pleasure that i will not mix it with other matter i cannot flatter  but it is like winning ones own heart to speak the praises of the deserving it is hard you will not write to me  yet were you never more to do so i could not cease to be  most heartily yours etc c dibdin beverly oct          letter xii a digression  he has the wide world for his heritage to the public i have ever conceived it the utmost height of extravagant folly to deal with even the slightest appearance of disingenuousness in any appeal to the public the truth is so easily told  and besides it brings with it such a saving of trouble art and duplicity  all which are mighty disagreeable things  that  exclusive of the comfortable conviction that a mans argument cannot fairly be controverted  it is in every other way his interest to keep that honest manly monitor in view thus to give fairly up the most distant appearance of double dealing i shall address no more letters to t s esquire  not that i have altered my sentiments in any respect relative to that gentleman  i know his admirable talents nice discernment and correct judgment  i know these letters would have been greatly benefitted by his remarks  i know his erudition is profound his taste elegant and his style beautiful nor do i at this moment believe he has altered his opinion in relation to me and as one strong proof of if  though i confess i have yet received no answer to my second letter which introduced the five successive ones as will be seen by comparing their dates  he very lately told a particular friend of mine that my seven first letters  i use his own words  are wonderfully well written the fact is i hope to leave england by the beginning of april and chance having thrown this gentleman and i such a distance from each other were i to wait for answers respectively to my letters it would now be morally impossible for this publication to come out till i had lost the india season i therefore  as i have frequently done and i never repented it  throw myself upon the candor of the public not however in the paltry manner in which their indulgence is too frequently solicited on the stage this brings to my mind a whimsical anecdote which i cannot avoid giving a place tommy hull who is well known to have been the apologistgeneral at covent garden theater for about five and twenty years took it into his head at the time of the dispute between keppel and palliser to distinguish himself as a lad of liberty on the night when all london was illuminated on keppels acquittal he undertook not only to light up his tenement in martletcourt bowstreet but treat the populace with small beer they had drank all but one barrel which out of wantonness  because it was rather stale  they left running the door was now shut lest some of the liberty boys should take a fancy to the silver spoons at this they grew clamourous and bawled out very outrageously for more beer tommy  as was his custom  thinking it high time he should now make his appearance  popped his red nightcapped head out of the window and there was immediately a cry of hear him  hear him when he thus began  ladies and gentlemen i have the misfortune to tell you  that the spiggot is out of the fauset and the small beer is run about the cellar  and we humbly hope for  your usual indulgence  but backed with an assurance that though the front of my army cannot come up yet i am winged with particular literary friends and well flanked with casual ones add to which i have several outposts  well situated  of wellwishers and an admirable corpse de reserve of  the lovers of music nor am i yet without hope that i shall derive some assistance from the main body thus when all my forces are mustered together i flatter myself i shall not fail of a complete victory over my enemies whom i shall deliver up to the public to be admonished and forgiven  a friend of mine when he swore an oath would say  god forgive me  which he called rubbing out as he went thus  by way of clearing my ground or as the sailors call it bringing up leeway  i shall make this letter one entire digression into which i shall collect all extraneous matter and first  being figuratively at one place and literally at another  it may be asked why i did not set down those transactions i celebrate at the time they happened i have already said that at my first setting out i had not the smallest idea of writing any account of my tour at all again  circumstances at the first blush dressed in the delusive charms of novelty have a strength and false glow which upon a nearer investigation meliorate into sober truth and wear off the influence of primary prejudice thus had i spoken of my friend boyton in the moment i was witness of his wonderful performance i might have injured him by exaggeration and in this i give the strongest possible instance  because language can scarcely produce an hyperbole on the subject to give a contrary instance  had i not waited till contempt had died away and given place to indifference i could not probably have told my story of the irish jolmon with that triumphant coolness which will never cease to make a much more uncomfortable wound than the keenest shafts of hasty resentment i insist upon it cibber gave pope more uneasiness and the world a better opinion of his good sense  in his easy welltempered facetious letter  than did the other atchieve against cibber or with the public  with all his weight of abilities  in the labored bitterness of his invidious dunciad it has often occurred to me as a matter of astonishment that any one after reading the dunciad should doubt popes being an envious man nothing can be more selfevident than that he wrote more than any man for same and what could divert him from such a pursuit to lose time on a work which must die with the names it stigmatizes but  envy how one digression introduces another take the following lines on envy see envy  from her cheeks the color fled while aconite and nightshade bind her head  see how her shriveld shanks with palsy shake how her lips quiver  while a forked snake  pointing her tongue sends poison in each hiss to wound the happy in the hour of bliss see where she skulks with torn dishevelled hair pushed urged and goaded on  by lank despair  i might have rashly blamed one man for a slight or an unkindness that originated in another and i might have extolled a third for tinselled wit which  from a graceful manner and faithful memory  he had the art to pass for sterling  foot when he heard garrick repeat his ode at the jubilee declared  whether the subject had inspired him  whether the genius of shakespeare had deigned to illuminate his fancy with some rays of its wonderful effect  or from whatever cause it proceeded he knew not  but that certainly the ode was elegantly and poetically written the next morning  having read it  he swore he must have been in a dream foot had the most contemptible opinion of garricks literary abilities he once received an anonymous letter which pointed out to him a french play as an excellent subject for his theater this circumstance he mentioned to a nobleman who happened that evening to be behind the scenes adding that he should be particularly happy to know the author as it was incomparably well written  for among other traits there were several quotations that spoke a perfect and elegant knowledge of classical reading said his lordship i think i can guess at him can you my lord said foot i wish i could what do you think of garkick oh no my lord answered the wit i am sure it is not garrick why returned his lordship i shall answer says foot like scrub first i am sure it is not garrick because there is greek in it secondly i am sure it is not garrick because there is latin in it and thirdly i am sure it is not garrick because there is english in it  for that the whole was the most stupid rhapsody of incongruous nonsense that ever was listened to if he had taken a month to consider of it and had been unprejudiced he probably would have decided that it was a meritorious attempt and if not executed in a manner worthy the subject  which could not be without the pen of another shakespeare  the errors of the poet ought to have been forgotten in the inimitable merit of the speaker which was beyond all description admirable and fairly equal to the wonderful task  having cleared away all the froth of the whipped syllabub to which this letter may be compared i am now come to the drop of wine at the bottom it was written howsoever the rovings of fancy may have led me astray in a great measure  to say this   five minutes before i sat down to this table where i am now writing being at beverly in yorkshire i dispatched to the printer at hull a manuscript of the proposal for publishing my musical tour it immediately afterward occurred to me as a thing not impossible that when the list of subscribers come to be published if the names of all those i praise should appear in it some of my kind friends may be so civil as to consider what i have said as so many purchased encomiums and as a man practices firing at a mark to put himself au sait to a duel  so by anticipation do i falsify all such malice at this present writing i do not know who will subscribe and i cannot speak warmer or cooler of people than i have occasionally done already besides i must be a poor hireling indeed to sell panegyricks for twelve shillings a piece to be more serious i declare solemnly that no consideration shall warp my pen to the deformity of an invidious lie nor  which would be equally reprehensible  the prostitution of unmerited praise kindness has a most wonderful effect upon me perhaps because i have received as little of it as any man there are many living instances that i can forget injuries but never obligations and though many parts of this work will sting home  and i would have them do so  yet will they wound the keener because it will be plainly seen  i have no rancour  i have met with more real kindness during my musical tour than in all the rest of my life put together  yet think not i mean of a pecuniary nature  i detest all servile considerations rectitude is a cheerful companion and nothing is so ponderous as obligation though i hope this very book will yield me a good sum of money  yet i should receive it with reluctance if i did not feel i had earned it these sentiments will not i am sure be censured by the public who have not in the whole round of their servants one more ambitious to merit their favor than  the obliged and grateful c dibdin beverly october          letter xiii an adieu to bristol  lifes but a walking shadow a poor player  that frets and struts his hour upon the stage   and thon  is heard no more   to mr b my dear friend you who so largely contributed to make bristol agreeable to me deserve in preference to any other this letter which i take the liberty of addressing to you  especially as it comes where i am to describe those beautiful situations with which that place abounds and which would for ever have been unknown to me but for your kind solicitude you taught me to admire the extensive and picturesque views from durdham down clifden hill cooks folly there is a strange anecdote related of this place one cook dreamt that he was bit by an adder and it so preyed on his mind that he built this place which is very lofty and resided wholly in the upper apartment one cold day his servant brought in a faggot that concealed an adder which upon being disturbed flew at mr cook bit him  and he died of the wound the reader may give what portion of credit he pleases to this tale and kings weston nor had i more pleasure in the charming variety these sweet places afforded than in your conversation what a number of circumstances it called home to my recollection as you pointed out the former theater to me where powell holland what i am now going to relate i know to be fact and it conveys nearly as strong a presentiment as the above the last time holland ever performed he was in unusual spirits during the evening he related a number of anecdotes  but it was remarkable he continually alluded to powell he repeated the lines written by mr colman and which he had spoken on powells death at length i heard him repeat these extraordinary words the first time i ever saw powell was at a spoutingclub where he and i performed posthumous and jachimo the first time we ever played on the stage together was posthumous and jachimo the last time we ever played together  and added he with a sigh it was the last time he ever played  was posthumous and jachimo what makes this matter singular almost beyond belief is  that the time he made these observations he was performing jachimo and he died a few days after and so many of the old school were such favorites poor powell poor holland the one a sacrifice to youthful impetuosity powell was a well dispositioned young man but he was weak and his professional and personal vanity got the better of every tie or consideration he was handsome lively and presuming to which if we add that he was a manager it will be seen that it was an easy matter to make his terms with many of the actresses provided he acceded to theirs indeed his amors were not confined to the theater keptmistresses and demireps were continually sending him letters to the stagedoor none of which solicitations he had the courage to resist the consequence was fatal and inevitable  he died a martyr to his pleasures for what head could even a robust constitution make against the wasteful conflict of mercury and stimulatives his acting was strong nature as luxuriant as a wilderness it had a thousand beauties and a thousand faults he felt so forcibly that in any impassioned situation tears came faster than words and frequently choked his utterance if garrick had never gone to italy and we can suppose he would have honestly instructed him  there was certainly no height of perfection in tragedy to which such abilities could not have reached but garricks performance in real life was not the worst part of his acting powell as an actor visibly declined from the moment his tutor turned his back on him  so much does nature want assistance on the stage  the other a proof that the most rigid prudence is no safeguard against the grim tyrant holland was extremely different from powell as an actor and a man  he kept as respectable a public situation and his company was more courted he had not received a liberal education but his intellects were of that strong clear and decided kind they performed for him the task of a tutor so well that his decisions upon all occasions were founded in sound judgment and experience he was free goodnatured cheerful and generous  nor had he an unkind wish to any human creature he indulged himself as much as any young man reasonably ought  yet with his purse and his heart ever open  though sprung from obscurity which he had too much good sense to conceal  at the age i believe of thirtythree he lest his family six thousand pounds as to his acting what he wanted of powells natural requisites he made up in strong discrimination one was susceptible  the other critical whoever remembers their playing those favorite parts posthumous and jachimo will feel the truth of this observation powell made the strongest first impression holland pleased you most upon repetition powell though he often charmed sometimes disgusted you holland even where you could not admire him gave you no pain in short powell owed to nature  what holland owed to himself and if after all we are obliged to admit something of preeminence on the side of powell and thus regret his loss as an actor we cannot refrain from heaving a deeper sigh when we consider that in holland we lost an honest man and a valuable member of society  before i quit this subject i shall relate an anecdote relative to the funeral of poor holland he was one of footes greatest favorites perhaps in some measure because the world said he was the retailer of his wit but there was no occasion holland had wit enough of his own  besides aristophanes dealt in the retail way himself george garrick being one of hollands executors with his usual good nature  for no man possessed more  undertook to manage the funeral in a way suitable to his friends circumstances for which purpose he went to chiswick and ordered a decent vault and such other preparations as he thought necessary  hollands father was a baker foot was invited to the funeral which he certainly attended with unseigned sorrow for exclusive of his real concern for the loss of a convivial companion whenever he had a serious moment he felt with very strong susceptibility while the ceremony was performing g garrick remarked to foot how happy he was out of respect to his friend to see every thing so decently conducted  you see said he what a snug family vault we have made here   family vault said foot  with the tears trickling down his cheeks  damme if i did not think it had been  the family oven   from the theater you led me to that natural wonder the hot well and to that still superior one st vincents as well as that vast chain of rocks which form a convenient boundary to conduct the river safely to kingroad employ a number of workmen make up highways build houses and supply foppish peasants with glittering sleevebuttons  as to the musical taste of bristol the treatment at inns and other indispensible matters i shall mention them when i return for i will not give you pain by speaking truth of your neighbors adieu  yours with the truest friendship c dibdin hull nov         letter xiv from a new correspondent  even as one wedge drives out another to mr dibdin dear sir when i had the pleasure of witnessing your performance i said but the truth when i assured you it would be no trifling satisfaction to me to promote whatever you should consider as your interest as to your request of addressing your public letters to me i embrace with great satisfaction an opportunity of receiving an earlier entertainment from them than the rest of your friends nobody can be more zealous in your cause there is i confess one consideration that will make me read them with reluctance  every succeeding letter will be one approach nearer to your departure which you know i never cordially liked  though i own you have conquered every scruple but one answer me what will the people of india say of you when they see in your book that you make a visit to them your sorlorn hope you see i begin the office of a friend by treating you with freedom my remarks however will not be very troublesome to you your career is brilliant and it were pity to stop it adieu i have read thirteen letters and be assured i shall make a perusal of the rest supercede every other consideration of business or pleasure  being  your sincere friend and obedient servant  nov         letter xv answer  there is an especial providence in the fall of a sparrow to the rev mr  dear sir i thought the best way of thanking you for your letter would be to insert  and answer it it shall be printed however without your name  nor shall i publicly use it at all though out of kindness you have stipulated for no such arrangement my reason is that though i may find it necessary to go to loggerheads with witlings and crotchetmongers it would be unhandsome to bring you in as my second or even bottleholder thanking you heartily for your zeal and kindness and assuring you that i shall take every care to merit your attention to my letters and by that means insure myself the good opinion of the public i shall first answering your only remaining scruple proceed on my tour the prejudices of general opinion from which i believe no man is wholly free incline one naturally to form ideas of a long voyage a foreign climate a strange race of people and new laws and customs that after fairly and maturely consulting our reason we really find do not exist these beget a repugnance to leave our native land which were it examined would be found to originate in folly and ignorance i am sure there is not more danger in a long voyage than a long journey i have myself been overturned during this tour in a chaise and was within a very little of breaking my neck lloyds evening post contained some time ago an account of a gentleman who having been two voyages to the east indies returned and in taking a short journey in the mailcoach  was overturned and killed as to a foreign climate can it be worse than the month of november in england for strange people  they are to be met with every where new laws cannot certainly be better than the spirit of those in this country  but the letter and the execution cannot any where be worse  i shall hereafter have occasion to animadvert a little stronger on this subject it is very true i leave england because i think i have not been well treated but surely this is paying a compliment to the liberality of india they love pleasure  it is in my power to give it to them the compact is a fair one and if they find me capable to take a review of their amusements regulate them supply them with novelty put them upon an eligible and permanent footing and at length leave them in possession of such materials as will induce them to encourage me while i stay and remember me afterward  what will it be between us but a mutual obligation and yet though i argue so coolly and i hope reasonably i had till very lately every one of the above vulgar prejudices and absurd notions  for which no man alive can invent a rational excuse nay i had eight years ago gone to india could i have conquered these scruples which  though i had in great measure got the better of  returned with irresistible force upon receiving the news of my brothers death my election however is now made yet believe me i go not like an exile i go to give and receive pleasure and advantage  to earn honestly a competency and return with it to my native country if there be any difficulties to encounter i shall hope to surmount them by the means of unconquerable spirits and a strong constitution and if after all  it should so happen that i am beckoned there by the finger of fate i could not better obey the summons than in believing with our immortal poet that there is an especial providence in the fall of a sparrow i am not however foolhardy enough to court the accomplishment of this nor will i say with the philosopher ungrateful country thou shall not have my ashes sacred be destinys immutable decree i once expressed these sentiments in the following song song what of fortune would tell me  i know all the past  am content with the fate i am at present possessing  and if for the future our lots are all cast we might there find a curse where we hoped for a blessing what is hid in the stars then is not worth our care  we shall know it too soon if it is any vexation  if it is good fortune  pleasures a little too rare to rob ourselves of it by  anticipation ii then curiously seek not the mysteries of fate to explore  by a vain idle passion directed  the knowledge of ill cannot lessen its weight  and joy is most welcome when least it is expected what is hid in the stars etc    i shall be proud to see you again in old england and assure you face to face as i do now under my hand that i am  with great truth your obliged friend and humble servant c dibdin newark nov         letter xvi one suspicion repaid by another  since the world will  why let it be deceived to the rev mr  dear sir from bristol  i sat out with a view to perform a night or two at gloucester to which place  i cannot avoid noticing  i had a most beautiful journey the wonderful rich soil round that city so invigorates vegetation that the country looked as if the season had been a month older but when i arrived one would have sworn the place was entirely deserted i could not help fancying that some public occasion had invited all the inhabitants to a distance no such thing it arose from nothing more than  as the residents in other places get out and mix with each other and thus enjoy the comforts of sociality and good fellowship  those at gloucester stay at home in their own hugger mugger way  and form no acquaintance but with the cats and crickets by the fire side without exaggeration  it is so remarkable for its dullness that you may upon an average look from one end of the street to the other twenty times and not at any one time see twenty people this gave me but poor hopes of gloucester nor were my expectations more sanguine when in a conversation with mr raikes i found the town was as much in sackcloth as if there had been a general mourning four or five unexpected bankruptcies had thrown them into a consternation not to be described which added to their natural gloom made gloucester at that time the most unfit of all places for making an experiment with my entertainment i therefore got into a chaise and posted away to cheltenham but there were yet arrived only a sick lord an old maid and a monkey  so i stayed all night slept in a damp bed this is infallible if any one should sleep there in the month of april and went on to worcester of this pretty and very sprightly town  i own  i augured well nor was i deceived in my expectations i found the inhabitants however very tardy and had it not been for a reverend and honorable gentleman  who never fails to countenance public amusements whenever he can with propriety  i should never have had a second night this owed its rise to a report  which somebody had very good naturedly propagated  that i was an impostor when one considers it has been affirmed that a man took thirty pounds to be shot for admiral byng  and that foot had his leg cut off on purpose to procure a patent  or  as some have maintained  to give him a graceful hitch in his walk  is it wonderful that a stranger should have some difficulty in proving his own identity they were however reasoned with in the following manner it is true this man may possibly not be mr dibdin  in which case those who attend his performance would be subject to some kind of raillery but it is also possible he may be the very identical man  and that admitted would not his departure in dudgeon bring a stronger ridicule on the place suppose said a few  who really were possessed of something like reason  the first performance should be watched with a critical eye and a report spread as to its merit and the originality of its fabrication  if he be an impostor it will be then time enough to give way to our resentment if not surely he deserves some apology and future attention  for having paid us the compliment to come among us so said  so done i was attended by eleven critics who i am sure had made up their minds before they came  for it so happened that they had good sense enough to see there does not exist a man who could have performed what i promised and yet have been an impostor  i plainly perceived the drift of this maneuver and went through my entertainment with a spirit that surprised my audience when i had finished  an apology was made me in the name of the city of worcester  and to be brief i had afterward four very decent nights and that not satisfying them they exacted a promise from me to return in the race week  the report of my being an impostor originated from an unmarried lady who had seen me she said at birmingham and who  as she did not confess herself a member of the tribe of old maids  was not a little nettled as i afterward understood when i remarked  upon hearing this story  that her love of justice had got the better of her amor propre for that by mentioning birmingham  where i had not been for twentyfive years  she was tacitly obliged to agree to an age rather more ancient than it was her usual custom to acknowledge  i shall speak of worcester more fully on my return  and in the mean time beg the favor of your company to birmingham  whither i went in the stage coach in company with a plain agreeable man who i could very soon perceive was intimately concerned in some large manufactory as i am upon all occasions just as willing that the laugh should go against myself as another i here inform you of a matter in which i conceived myself to be wonderfully sagacious about ten months before the period i speak of  or as mr bays has it long before the beginning of this play  i went with a party to dinner at the isle of wight where a genteel man sent in his compliments and requested he might dine with the company our own being rather a promiscuous meeting he was readily admitted he turned out to be a pleasant chatty companion  seemed to be very ready on every general topic  but the whole of his conversation appeared purposely to allude to his being a man of property i took it for granted that he was so  and did not testify a little surprise when the landlord told me he was a rider or what they call in yorkshire  a bagman i was determined afterward to take care who i believed to be men of property  and this journey from worcester to birmingham was the first time afterward that my suspicions were awakened every time the gentleman was talking of bills of parcels and bails of goods i could not get rid of the idea of  bagman and before we arrived i had actually set him down for a vain empty pretender to property  a pattern carrier  a stirrup holder  in short the very shadow of what he appeared to be during the interval between our arrival and dinner he went out  and the waiter asking if i knew who that gentleman was i answered carelessly  some bagman i fancy bagman cried the waiter the gentleman is worth eighty thousand pounds  a great clothier near cheltenham this incident may serve to show how deceitful are appearances and it should teach us this lesson  to pay every object its proper degree of respect  for as there is no rank ever so high but vice may debase  so there is no station ever so low but virtue will exalt both these men behaved very properly one kept a little higher than his real rank like an able ambassador to demand respect to his master  while the other like a king condescended a little  to show he had no pride if it had not been for the officiousness of the landlord at the isle of wight i should never have known  that the first had only credentials to show nor suspected  that the latter was the less a man of property for not assuming airs of consequence how i came to be thus suspicious i cannot conceive my characteristic  and it is no feather in my cap  is credulity and my pocket and peace of mind have often smarted for believing the ipse dixit of other men in preference to the evidence of my own senses the poet says since the world will why let it be deceived do not you however believe that there is the smallest deceit in my assuring you that i am  yours most faithfully c dibdin nottingham nov  0       letter xvii various success at birmingham oxford and london  vain his attempt who strives to please you all to the rev mr  dear sir out of three times that i advertised my entertainment at birmingham  i performed it only twice these fuliginous sons of vulcan were at my arrival too busily attending to feats of horsemanship  a species of amusement ever fatal to my interest  to take any notice of me one thing completely disgusted me at worcester it was suggested to me that as my price was three shillings the tradesmen and others in middling situations could not afford to pay that sum or mix with the company who could  and therefore i made a distinction and partitioning the town hall  which is very large  admitted company at three shillings and eighteenpence the spirit of the people was roused at this circumstance  and very few indeed were to be found in the back seats while those in the front were crowded upon making the same experiment at birmingham it was exactly the reverse  for as the inhabitants of worcester of middling property made a point of paying three shillings so people of very considerable property in birmingham skulked in at eighteenpence one circumstance i own made me look upon birmingham as a very likely place for success it was the first town in which i appeared as an actor and as i signified this by a paragraph in the hand bills and made  what i there said  a sort of invitation to witness the maturity of those abilities which they had seen in their infancy i naturally supposed i should awaken their curiosity  and that they would be pouring in by hundreds not a bit the people of birmingham were too much taken up with hobnails and horsemanship to pay me the least attention upon mentioning my surprise to a frenchman he exclaimed  mon dieu que est ce que voulez vous comment agir pour fair un cheval vuider lavoine qil nai jamais mange i confessed the justice of the remark and comforted myself with a letter i had in my pocket from dr hayes enclosing one from the vice chancellor which gave me leave to come to oxford for three days in the following week  thus i left birmingham  without being able to sing the glee of smiths are good fellows of my journey to oxford i can give you no farther account  having traveled in the night  than that at the white lion at stratforduponavon  that very inn which i saw in such confusion at the jubilee  we had the most scandalous supper that ever was set upon a table but as on my return to worcester i shall have something to say further of this house you will now if you please attend me to dr hayes who received me with his accustomed cordiality and politeness we settled the mode of commencing the entertainment and i waited on the vice chancellor to thank him for his kindness and request that i might submit the copy of my amusement to his inspection he was pleased to say  he had a particular pleasure in obliging me and  as he did not suppose i would offer any entertainment to the students unworthy my reputation or their attention  he trusted the matter wholly to me and thought a perusal of the copy totally unnecessary  the first night was announced  and with every care and circumspection i prepared for it i cut out grog and introduced  for the first time it was ever sung  the siege of troy i took occasion  merely because i felt it  to introduce an oblique compliment to dr chapman which afterward as i understood was inserted with some handsome remarks in the oxford paper the compliment was this i said solon was no enemy to pleasure he only condemned those fictitious representations which concealed the deformity of vice and gave countenance to lawless enjoyments he went one night to see one of these performances which thespis conducted when it was over he asked the comedian if he was not ashamed of himself what harm have i done said thespis twas only in jest  true said solon  but approving vice in jest is the surest way to make it admired in earnest in short i performed the three nights for which i had permission  and was granted at the pressing instance of many members of the university a fourth  and i may truly say as to applause no man ever experienced hansomer encouragement the profit however was only what i have before mentioned  during my stay at oxford i became more intimate with dr hayes  and as our conversations on music were very frequent he could not help telling me what trouble he had been put to at different times  though he had never seen me  to defend my reputation against the malignity of the ignorant and the invidious these conversations finished with my making him a sort of half promise to put a stop to the tongue of envy by composing the proper exercise and taking the complicate degree of bachelor and doctor of music this promise however so given i fancy i shall not keep i despise envy too much to fear it  and therefore cannot condescend to silence it as to the exercise it is composed  and  be it known to the musical critics  though it is a task infinitely more complex than any thing i had before done  i never set myself an easier lesson in my life so much less difficult is it to work by method than fancy as however the song of hope is a part of it one half of the kingdom will witness for me that melody and harmony may be blended and as i shall previous to my departure make a present of the overture to some of the first concerts  particularly those of liverpool manchester and leeds  the most rigid theorist shall be obliged to confess  that the first sugue i ever thought it worth my while to make is one of my best compositions for it does not wrong my ownestablished maxim  of never losing sight of melody  yet it extends and expatiates through all the wide field of modulation if the cavillers take up this let them consider it merely as a whet  by and by they shall have a full meal  at oxford i received a letter from a friend informing me that my little piece of harvest home had been performed and received with very great applause to corroborate this account i sent the next day for the morning chronicle where i found it spoken of in the highest terms mr woodfall among other things having predicted it would become a popular favorite and i sincerely believe his words would have been verified had it been performed every night afterward in the same state as on the first on the fourth however i saw it myself and i declare most solemnly  though as major sturgeon says i have seen some desperate duty  i never witnessed so wanto a mutilation i scarcely knew it  and my friend who was with me and who gave me the above account assured me that all the alterations had been made since the first night i bore my disgrace like a philosopher  and was not at all surprised when instead of getting a remittance for the profit of my benefit i received a letter informing me that there was a balance against me of nine pounds but to please managers who are not attached to you is a more ridiculous attempt than the man with his son and his jackass thank heaven i have now only the public to please  of which as a valuable individual i beg you will take your share and believe me  your obliged friend c dibdin newark nov          letter xviii various acknowledgements opinions and observations  there lies honor to the rev mr  dear sir i will not leave oxford without noticing the civility which in addition to that of dr hayes and the vice chancellor i received from that fine hearty friendly character mr jackson the bookseller nor must the great attention shown me by that able artist mr roberts pass unsung  whose paintings and in particular his small whole lengths are remarkable for spirit expression good drawing and exact similitude no stronger instances of the latter quality in them can be given than the following circumstance when i was at wolverhampton a gentleman came into the room and being musical chatted with me some minutes before the performance i thought i had met with him before  but it turned out that i had seen only his portrait at mr robertss  that distance of time was at least three months and as i never saw either original or portrait more than once and that for a very short space of time the resemblance must have been not only correct but very striking indeed this gentlemans name is spence and he is a student at the university mr roberts does not want my recommendation  if he did i should strongly advise those who wish to preserve their likenesses and possess at the same time good paintings to apply to him  before i set out for london i sent a letter of thanks to the vice chancellor which i sincerely wish i could remember as it would serve admirably well by way of contrast to one that will appear in the next letter which i kept a copy of  the transaction that occasioned it having fixed in me a firm determination to publish this work  oxford is so well known that it will be necessary for me to say but little about it every child knows that it has thirteen parish churches twenty colleges and five halls which being intermixed with the houses give it an air of superb magnificence not perhaps to be equalled in the world as to its musical taste i need not say more in its praise than that dr hayes is their professor of music the inns are in term time filled constantly with riots  which render them very uncomfortable to strangers nor can this be restrained the authority of the most powerful or the examples of the best man upon earth  and it will be difficult to find out a better than dr chapman  can avail but little while fathers instead of a modest stipend sufficient to answer the purposes of a student send their sons to the university one would think to plunge them into extravagance and disqualify them for every study  but profligacy and brutality and now in my usual way must i break off to throw together some of those thoughts which have often struck me on this important subject the young gentlemen of the university have generally separate tutors i do not say the following remarks apply to every tutor but do they generally understood consider any thing but the pleasures of the pupil nay are they not often commanded to do so is not his vanity gratified are not his wishes anticipated is there an incentive to idleness a stimulative to dissipation but it is their study to procure are misdemeanors to be investigated  they wrack invention to find an excuse is pleasure the word  the tutor is the jolliest fellow in the throng in short would you teach your son to trample upon reason violate decorum destroy every social trace of virtue and to finish  in his own language  knock down order give him a tutor that will pass muster among the rest if he be of any other description he will be hunted down with undeserved calumny till he shall be obliged either to take refuge in a school or behind the readingdesk of a country curate and the mischief is  it is so difficult to make a choice sanctity is no more to be trusted than the grief of an actor which continues only till the curtain drops to make room for the farce that is to follow it thus fools come in as large shoals from the university as knaves from church your right collegian can give you vices of an hundred years standing a newcut to bring them into fashion  but as to books they are the same to him as drugs to an apothecary  both are prescribed and both taken but neither the physic by the doctor nor letters by the scholar a set of unintelligent terms serve the purpose of both and one administers to the body and the other to the mind while they trust to chance for the success of the operation  of natural curiosities  i believe there are none at oxford artificial ones manufactured there may be seen in many of the pulpits throughout the kingdom  perhaps you will say i am somewhat too hard  for this should seem to imply that our universities produce nothing but dunces i allow which is a great deal that once in ten times they may turn out a man of tolerable abilities  two thirds of the remainder are but at best pedants  fellows who go over a whole library  book by book  as faithfully as a moth but who  after they have both read and retained every thing  have not sufficient taste to distinguish a single literary beauty the rest  as i have described above  are either pretty fellows or jolly dogs  a set of beings comparatively less obnoxious in proportion as they approach to insignificance  i returned to london on monday the twentyfirst of may exactly in time  as i mentioned in my last letter  to see harvest home on the fourth night from which circumstance i as positively predicted its downfall as mr woodfall had done its popularity that very evening i formed  what i thought amounted to a resolution of drawing my pen no more for the stage but so much was i mistaken that three days afterward i caught myself finishing a seen in i think the best piece i have ever written but any one would have done the same the encouragement i had received from mr harris no man would have suspected to be trifling and two or three pieces purchased at a good price would not have been an uncomfortable circumstance upon a long voyage how fallacious however this dependence was will be shown in its proper place  little happened during my stay in town worthy notice  except many instances of friendship i received from mr preston in the strand and that dr hayes who came up to the festival did me the kindness to dine with me on the kings birthday and caught me hard at work at my exercise  for my intention was pretty strong then to go for the degree for i was pleased with my work and thought it a pity to take so much pains for nothing other pursuits however have since diverted me from it  so there lies honor  it will not stop the tide nor restrain the winds  therefore i will have none on it  you will as readily believe it as that i am  with the most perfect truth c dibdin newark nov          letter xix an agreeable companion in a stage coach  thou have seen a dog bark at a beggar to the rev mr  dear sir on the seventh of june i quitted london for cambridge in the coach happened to be a gentleman of some medical consequence in the city who not only turned out a very agreeable companion but made some of the best general remarks i ever listened to these though i may avail myself of some of them in the course of my work i shall say nothing of here i cannot refrain however from giving his opinion  which i earnestly requested as that subject came up among a number of others  concerning the execution of donnellan i could not withhold myself from reprobating in pretty strong terms the prejudgment in that business  the rigor shown from the bench  where the prisoner should never want an advocate and in particular the remarkable circumstance  that the charge to the grand jury previous to the trial  contained the very words of the sentence of condemnation all of which i believe the public have but one opinion of  this gentlemans sentiments of the matter as a physician  setting aside all the nonsensical controversies that have happened concerning the quality of laurel water  he very sensibly confined to this that poison of any kind could not effect death so instantaneously  the shortest period between the swallowing of poison and the consequent death that he had ever heard of in all his practice was nearly four hours and sir theodore boughton is said to have died in less time than one minute in short said he if that phial contained any thing of donnellans invention which actually caused that sudden death sworn to by the mother he discovered what no other ever did unless it was one of those secrets which dr mead is said to have kept from the world lest knowing human depravity he might be the instrument of providing them with a novel opportunity of perpetrating the dictates of a cowardly and diabolical revenge as to dr retrays killing rats and dogs to prove he had been mistaken when he swore sir theodore boughton was poisoned with arsenic we laughed at it as it deserved but when we came to consider that dr hunter was pinned to a single question namely whether the deceased died of poison or not  which no man could have positively answered  we agreed in a sincere wish that the learned interpreter of the law  who acted the part of judge and jury upon this occasion  was in his own mind clearly and fully convinced of the prisoners guilt and so with that laudable and upright detestation  with which his lordship is well known to accelerate the extermination of murderers  he resolved that the victim then in his power should not escape  i was unfortunate enough to lose this gentlemans company after we had traveled together about six and thirty miles on my arrival in cambridge where i cannot refrain from noticing that though the coach from grays inn lane is bound to the white heart  yet the passengers will far every disagreeably if they are obliged as i was to stay all night as soon as i could the following morning i got into a lodging and began to make my preparations in form i delivered a letter to dr randall who begged to be excused from taking an active part in the business on account of his age and the resolution he had made not to concern himself but as little as possible with public matters i afterward called on a gentleman of trinity college to whom i had a very friendly and pressing letter from a man of fortune in town  but unluckily the gentleman was not then at cambridge my next application was of course to the vice chancellor and as every other channel was  as the reader has seen  dammed up my only reliance was on the permission i had received from dr chapman and some other documents which i put in my pocket for his inspection but as this interview and the result of it make too marking a part of my tour not to have every possible advantage  i shall give so singular a transaction a letter by itself i have shown in this letter a judicial cur in office  in my next i shall give you the portrait of a clerical one  but all these are the foils that set off the brilliancy of true friendship and the value of sterling worth  for the knowledge of these kind and estimable qualities in you give me leave to assure you that i am  thankfully yours c dibdin newark nov  0       letter xx scruples of conscience  let the galled jade wince to the rev mr  dear sir i have often wondered that in the common transactions of life men meet with such continual rudeness when civility is so cheap and so becoming if hackney coachmen and waiters made a point of using a little of this good quality they would find themselves richer and lead more comfortable lives but if rudeness be unpardonable in those we rule for heavens sake what is it in those who rule us a man in a high and respectable situation can add nothing to his dignity so truly great as complacency and gentleness of manners thus the vice chancellor of oxford who is an absolute monarch for the time being  like a little emperor of germany  dispenses his decrees with such impartial evenhanded justice and tender regard to his own honor and the susceptibility of individuals that a man must be selfcondemned before he punishes him and i will venture to say that if any consideration could induce a distinction in his conduct or carriage to any different descriptions of men who on various accounts have occasion to apply to him the benevolent affability which so eminently characterises him would be conspicuously extended to the most unfortunate among them i saw once a noble instance of this triumphant philanthropy in the conduct of the late sir john fielding a man was examined before him upon a charge of a highway robbery instituted by a gentleman of distinction who swore positively to every circumstance of the robbery yet could not identify the person in the course of the business the right honorable witness seemed extremely offended that sir john fielding should pay the prisoner so much respect and him as he thought so very little  for which discontent he received the following rebuke i am heartily sorry that you are offended at my softening the rigor of justice with a little humanity the prisoner is entitled more to my attention than you are  because he is unfortunate if he should be guilty the law is severe enough without any exaggeration on my part but if innocent how could i excuse myself  by adding insult to misfortune  what then can be said of a vice chancellor of cambridge who has equal power and whose haughty and imperious deportment sullen aspect and premature determination seem  contrary to all acknowledged justice  to suppose every man guilty till he is proved innocent such a vice chancellor must surely be unfit for his situation he must be uncandid ungenerous and unjust and  what are terrible qualities in that high character  ignorant and incapable of discrimination lest it should be thought i had dr ellison in view when i drew the above portrait i will entreat the reader to attend minutely to what passed during my interview with that gentleman  and afterward in consequence of it  and it will be plainly seen whether he meant any thing more than a faithful discharge of the duties of that office committed to his care  i had waited on dr ellison who was not to be spoken with  i therefore by way of breaking the ice entreated mr wynn who keeps a music shop to call and leave some of my bills that done  after four visits to no purpose  i was at length admitted and my memory  which is pretty faithful  assures me what follows was the conversation that passed between us  sir i have the honor to introduce myself to you  my name is dibdin  i come to cambridge with a view of offering the university a little musical entertainment which has given very great satisfaction at several places  and in particular at oxford  where with the vice chancellors permission i had the honor of performing with much reputation ha  you had the vice chancellors permission there had you how do i know that i assure you sir upon my honor i had however as i am a perfect stranger you are certainly not to oblige me upon my bare assertion  therefore please to look at those letters i then produced the letter from dr hayes written to me at worcester and that from dr chapman to him which accompanied it ah  well  this letter gives you leave to be sure  but it does not say that your entertainment is such a one as ought to be delivered at a university it is true sir dr chapman never saw the entertainment in question not even to this moment but he was kind enough to suppose i would not commit such an outrage on propriety or so far offend against the etiquette of that university of which he is such an ornament as to offer them any thing unworthy the patronage under which i had the honor to appear before them and to convince me he was of this opinion mrs chapman and several ladies with her attended the performance nay sir to show you beyond contradiction that the amusement had the good opinion of the university in general here is a paragraph in the oxford paper announcing that at the particular request of many respectable members of the different colleges the vice chancellor extended his permission in consequence of the satisfaction i had given oh the paragraph in the paper is nothing at all  a man put a paragraph in the cambridge paper the other day against me  and it was all a lie sir mr jackson who prints the oxford paper is a man of probity and fortune  he idolizes the vice chancellor  and could not be induced for any consideration to use his name to grace a falsity upon my word you speak very well  one may easily see by your conversation you have merit i am obliged to you for your good opinion sir but you see the morals of the young men are all in my care and as dr chapman never saw the entertainment he may yet be imposed upon i have seen your bill and i own it seems to hold out something immoral besides if you are a man of this reputation what can induce you to come strolling about the country sir i am going to india  and as i wish before my departure to say good bye to a generous public who have afforded me a long and liberal patronage   why do you know any body at cambridge no sir  then it is plain the people here do not make up any part of that public to whom you are so much obliged consequently they have no right to be thanked thus you see as you are rich enough to come with no other motive than mere gratitude  why pay it where it is not due good god sir am i obliged to be personally acquainted with all those who wish me well as a public man well sir i dont know what to say to it it has always been my rule to give no person permission who is not recommended by somebody belonging to the university you say you know nobody i brought with me a letter for dr randall sir oh dr randall will not do what kind of person must it be sir  why for instance a fellow commoner of one of the colleges i have a letter to a gentleman so described in my pocket  it is unsealed  please to read it sir  he is unfortunately not at cambridge  but you will readily believe that upon the strength of his friends recommendation he would otherwise have waited on you with pleasure it does not signify sir  the gentleman is not here to speak for himself and i cannot credit mere appearances sir had i known there would have been so many difficulties thrown in the way of a request which it would have done you no dishonor or discredit to grant i would not have given myself a moments trouble about it oh sir if you begin to talk of difficulties i have done so would i sir did i not feel myself a little hurt at being deprived by your suspicions of an opportunity of giving cambridge an amusement that has been so followed at oxford my suspicions sir yes sir  for you must suppose me a most impudent impostor after every thing that has happened well but surely  why you are not the mr dibdin who composed the padlock and such a number of musical works i am sir  and i am sorry you could not prevail on yourself to believe it sooner why  really  this to be sure alters the case in short sir as this conversation has imperceptible stolen on thus far i am determined you shall be convinced the duke of grafton as i take it is chancellor of cambridge and you are only vice chancellor and i am sure i know a channel through which i can get you his graces recommendation of me why now upon my word this is a strange mistake  pray sit down i beg to be excused sir i am sorry a constant rule which i prescribe myself in these cases should occasion such a misunderstanding you may perform sir on monday this being the very point i wanted to bring him to i abruptly wished him a good morning and he followed me to the door with many apologies of which i took no manner of notice as soon as i got home i sent him the following letter  to the rev dr elliston sir when i did myself the honor in a letter to the vice chancellor of oxford to thank him for a similar favor to that for which i this day applied to you i could not help noticing that the manner of conferring a favor constituted  incomparably before all other considerations  its value you sir  with a vigilant zeal no doubt for the cause of morality have thought proper to disbelieve what that gentleman saw no rational cause to discredit yet let me assure you that the letters from dr hayes and dr chapman were not forgeries  the paragraph in the oxford paper was no fabrication to deceive you  the letter to mr thompson of trinity college really was written by a man of fortune  and i declare that i did not in a single instance misrepresent or exaggerate any one circumstance lest however you should think this letter as well as the rest an imposition i hasten to the purpose for which it is written and inform you that i take the liberty to decline that permission you have thought proper so very liberally to grant  i am sir etc c dibdin june  0       i must not quit this subject without observing that it is more than possible i went the wrong way to work this i know to be fact a certain mimic who had once some sort of lectures at cambridge in which his great merit was an imitation of me  procured a permission for his performance by giving the vice chancellors butler  i will not say what vice chancellor  a guinea thus as it frequently happens in life was the substance neglected for the shadow if this stings let the galled jade wince in which case you and i have free souls adieu believe me  yours very truly c dibdin doncaster nov  0       letter xxi a race and a badgering  young birds alone are caught with chaff to the rev mr  dear sir cambridge having detained me a week to no purpose i was persuaded to try huntingdon which place was said to have a very spirited neighborhood lord sandwich not being then at hinchinbrook none of the musical tribe would stir a peg without their first fiddle  and having performed one night to an audience of about twentyfive who were not in the habit of following a leader i flattered myself by the satisfaction those few received a second would be worth trial but i had not considered that on that very evening madame mara performed at cambridge or i should not have been so absurd as to expect that any lover of music within twenty miles would lose the opportunity of hearing her i was so thinly attended that i would not perform  and the next day set off with a view of going to norwich i cannot refrain from mentioning a sensible remark of the mayor to whom as commanding officer i as usual applied sir said he it is not in my power to give you permission on the contrary i am expressly ordered by the late proclamation as mayor of this town to prevent every exhibition not authorized by a regular license  now as according to the present laws there cannot be a license to tolerate any sort of amusement at huntingdon nor indeed at any other place more than twentyone miles out of london and as it is certainly unfair that we should be denied rational amusements i shall as long as my office continues take the liberty to make this distinction whenever an entertainment presents itself that like yours promises to give pleasure without being immoral although i give no leave as a magistrate  i will certainly as a man recommend it to the attention of my friends if therefore you should think proper to perform i dare say nobody will inform against you and if you wish for the town hall the man who takes care of it will no doubt let you have it for a mere trifle  i am sure you will pardon me for noticing this gentlemanlike conduct i shall in the course of this work go into a full description of the laws relative to public amusements  to which i am very competent having had as much public and private legal advice as any man  huntingdon  which gave birth to oliver cromwell  is a pretty town it lies however on a flat and the prospect near it is remarkable for nothing but a number of handsome spires the road to cambridge is very fine the hairdresser gave me a long account of the number of parishes it formerly had  but alas sir said he they are now dwindled  and we have only four church yards three spires two churches and one parson  when i came to newmarket in my way to norwich upon hearing the races were to be the following week at ipswich i changed my design and went to that place i found it in glorious confusion and trying to get a lodging i discovered a manaeuvre the mention of which may serve as a caution to those who mean to visit any place in the raceweek the landlord of one of the principal inns had advertised his beds at a guinea apiece and fearing on account of the exorbitant demand that visitors should be induced to take lodgings he procured with great cunning and industry a promise from the other inhabitants that they would ask the same price what was the consequence ipswich is very large and the strangers naturally said if we can get lodgings no cheaper at private houses than at inns we had better be where our horses can be taken care of thus few private lodgings were let  the inns were full  and the landlords laughed at the credulity of their neighbors  at ipswich i gave my entertainment twice before i went to colchester and once at my return the two first times i was as well attended as considering the number of amusements that poured in from all quarters i had a right to expect the fourth night however was to make me large amends but like my dependences in general turned out a rotten one  an unfortunate and truly ridiculous circumstance happened to give a fort of tacit umbrage to many of the company there it was this i was invited to sup with about eight of the leading gentlemen and as they had a ball that evening and it was very unlikely that these eight should sup away from the general meeting where as sort of stewards their presence seemed to be absolutely necessary i suspected some artifice in the business now it is a rule with me  as i was once under the unpleasant necessity of hinting to one of my auditors  that when i am stuck up in my temporary orchestra and playing my tricks i am unconditionally at the devotion of the audience but before or after my performance  as there was never any thing either imperious or presuming in my deportment of which i am sure i should have witnesses enough were i to ask it  i cannot consent to consider myself in an ineligible light  whether this rule struck these gentlemen and ladies as false consequence improper pride or what i will not determine but certainly the invitation to supper meant nothing more than that i should relieve the pipe and taber by doing my utmost  to entertain the company and here i cannot for the life of me avoid pausing to tell two stories of poor shuter  this child of humor was at a dinner one day in a promiscuous company  and as soon as the cloth was taken away one of them got up and entreated as a particular favor he would begin to be comical god said shuter i forgot my fools dress  but however i will go and fetch it if you will be my substitute till i return the man thought this very comical and declared he would shuter then took his hat and cane  went away  and did not return at all  another time  a set of warm citizens who had been used to the company of bennet  an actor of very mediocre abilities at covent garden theater  got shuter to a tavern in the city  no mans intellects were ever stronger nor did any utter brighter sallies of wit and pleasantry at every good thing the gaping citizens were in raptures shuter could not conceive the reason of such very lavish praises  till at length hearing one of them exclaim oh that is great  that is charming  that is so like bennet he was immediately let into the secret bennet was with them all that wit and humor could comprize and they had not the smallest idea of paying him an ill compliment by comparing him to their favorite but to return  having given a pretty shrewd guess at what was going forward i went to the coffeehouse  in boots the gentleman who invited me was evidently disappointed at my appearance  and this confirmed my suspicions  i told him  as the party was private and consisted only of gentlemen  i had taken the liberty to come with no ceremony especially as i should be under the necessity of going to colchester early in the morning he hesitated  and we were joined in the coffeeroom by other gentlemen through whose enquiries after supper the murder came out i immediately wished this gentleman a good night  saying  it was utterly impossible to mix with the company in that trim  and gave a strong hint that i could not consent to be a performer any where but in my own entertainment the justice of my remark was admitted  and i retired at my return from colchester this gentleman told me it was impossible to blame what i had done but that it threw an universal gloom over the company  every expectation was balked and they never passed so unpleasant an evening this was not the only time the same trick was attempted to be played me at worcester at ten oclock at night a gentleman  in white gloves and without a hat  catched me busily writing  with a long beard  and would fain have me  because a lady whom he afterward married took such a whim in her head  go with him to the assemblyroom to eat supper and sing catches and glees  i was obliged to tell him in a few short words that i could not think of any such thing and if i had not been convinced  as it afterward turned out  that every body disapproved of his conduct  but what will not a hot pursuit after a large fortune make a man do  i would have left worcester the next morning  but i had the pleasure to find what i had done extremely approved of and though i had no more of that gentlemans company my numbers were not lessened by my refusal to comply with his caprice thus was i expected like shuter to be comical or jump over a stick at the word of command but i was determined to convince them i had not so much docility besides  after all  there might be some bennet or other whose comic abilities i might not have been able to equal  how far the gentleman i here allude to had a share in the business i will not pretend to say i have given a faithful relation of it  and as upon several occasions he was very attentive to me  though there certainly was a blunder somewhere  it would be ungenerous in me to suppose he meant any thing more than my interest i ought not ab origin to have been deceived  and a worthy baronet with whom i conversed on the subject at bury  and who was to have been of the party  agreed i had been disingenuously dealt with however as old birds are not caught with chaff i took care  though it affected my interest a little  it should not make me ridiculous i own i was hurt at it  and in particular because it induced me to leave my kind friends near colchester so soon  yours truly c dibdin wakefield nov          letter xxii great pains for little profit  more cry than wool to the rev mr  dear sir to colchester i posted  and being recommended by the ingenious mr moore  whose clock and other curiosities all the world has seen and wondered at  to the white heart i there received a hearty welcome to  as he said  the land of oysters baize and eringo from mr reynolds who is known among his superiors by the title of honest george  by his equals as a kind friend and agreeable companion  and among his inferiors as a generous and liberal benefactor indeed both he and his son in understanding and demeanor give you an impression of something considerably above innkeepers he shook his head at the idea of a musical entertainment at colchester  but as the assemblyroom was in his house i resolved to try it my success turned out neither good nor bad and he and i settled the matter as men should do who mean fairly by each other one circumstance however rendered my jaunt to colchester very pleasurable a gentleman who has every thing within himself that can constitute the enjoyments of a countrylife in the truest and most delectable style laid himself out with the unaffected and hearty kindness of old english hospitality to charm away every moment of my time were i to mention every particular of his flattering partiality in terms it deserves i must invent new ones  as no idea but the kind attention of this gentleman and the benevolence of his family of love engrossed me  i shall only say of colchester  that the applause was excessive  the profit scarcely any thing  on my return to ipswich my night was spoiled by the intervention of that little pique which i have so fully mentioned in my last letter i therefore got away to bury st edmunds at which place as i passed through in my way to ipswich  as the players call it  i took the town that is to say made my enquiries and saw how the land lay before i sit myself down at bury i shall speak of some characters at ipswich among the foremost i anxiously seize the first opportunity in my life of noticing two members of the law of liberal and gentlemanlike manners  and that so extraordinary an event may be fully proclaimed whether these gentlemen will or not  their names are mr kilderbee and mr squires i assure the reader i shall have in the course of the work more characters of this description and they shall be placed among my catalogue of wonders   the fashionable and friendly mr trotman certainly strove to serve me as industriously as ever the busy body did to serve sir george airy and notwithstanding it has been said the last storm was of his brewing yet i really would try my hand at his panegyric if my pen was not restrained every time the idea comes across me by a recollection of the following lines in prior to john i owe great obligation  but john unhappily thought fit to publish it to all the nation  sure john and i are more than quit   nor must i forget that son of linneas dr coyte who had  when he did me the honor to conduct me to his botanic plantation  arrived to such a pitch of perfection in improving upon nature as to deprive the sun of the power of maturing a magnolia for a whole fortnight that it might bloom for the gratification of his friends in the race week the father of this gentleman is said to have been one of the first botanists in europe  i shall also speak of another gentleman who repeatedly expressed a very strong desire to be present at my entertainment but a foreigner  which too often happens  attracted him with such magnetic force that in spite of his own wishes he had not the power to turn from the charm that fascinated him  but last  though not least  i shall speak of punchard and jermyn whose kindness was fraught with such unaffected attention that it will not easily be erased from my remembrance one thing in particular marked a strong desire to please which is one of the best recommendations of a tradesman though heaven knows the trifle i paid them was scarcely worth an acknowledgment the receipt was thus worded received the contents of this bill  with thanks  i have before expressed my surprise that civility being so cheap an accommodation should be so little attended to it is indeed so winning that it insures attention to the meanest trifles a good introduction does wonders and though an insinuating prologue cannot save a bad play it may soften considerably the rigor of its sat is not a fine lady cheated by a shopkeeper with all the willingness in the world if he compliments her person while he palms on her his damaged goods appearance  like the first blow in boxing  is half the battle what a figure would a judge look if he were to try a cause in a black bob wig and a pair of jack boots i was once witness to a farmers abusing a pair of young spruce unwigged counselors for spoiling his ground in the afternoon in whose presence he had  on a trial in the morning  trembled from head to foot but to settle my account with colchester and ipswich  both of these places seem to have been formerly of consequence but are now greatly declined the manufactory of baize as well as most of our staple commerce is getting north a stronger proof of which cannot be given than that liverpool is insensibly drawing away the trade of bristol and hull all the coasting business except yarmouth from ipswich to saltfleet  and thus it will be found inland manufactories that begin about the center of the kingdom push on to the north till  having taken up their residence in yorkshire  they expand to the east and west but particularly the east in a most astonishing way thus from leeds to liverpool  through bradford halifax rochdale manchester warrington and preston  the population is wonderful the workmen are like so many ants employed about their heaps but they are so different from those in london that while the ants of the north labor for the general benefit the other pismires work hard for the general confusion  as for the inns  the white heart at colchester is one of the best in england it is large handsome and convenient and has admirable accommodations i was witness to mr reynolds sending out  with some company who had been to pay a visit to mr rigby  two and twenty pair of horses in one morning i cannot so correctly speak as to the inns of ipswich for when i was there they were all in confusion and it was first come first served provision seemed to be very good and the soles they get from aldborough are incomparable  i acknowledge the receipt of your letter and thank you for your remarks it is true i have yet said nothing of the country as to cultivation it must have been owing to a want of diversity in the subject the face of nature at the time i am recording appeared to me like a serene day fair and full of smiles the only change was from arable to meadow land and from meadow to arable and this you may distinguish with your eyes shut  for the ripe harvest of the newmown hay gave it a sweet and pleasing odor  pray do not fail to give me your sentiments fully as i assure you nothing can give me more pleasure than the attention you are pleased to pay  your very thankful friend c dibdin wakefield nov  0       letter xxiii adventure upon adventure  i never sustained the like disgrace before  by this good light  to the rev mr  dear sir having sat myself down in a lodging at bury i paid my respects as usual to the commandant  who is there called the alderman  the rest of the magistracy being twelve feoffees this gentleman made not the smallest objection except to the use of the guildhall which was a part of my request and this he could not according to constant usage grant without the consent obtained in writing of the feoffees i asked him which among them was the most musical and he answered dr norford which intelligence was so true that having waited on that gentleman i found him surrounded with friends who were listening to a morning concert he came to me into the hall  and upon hearing my name insisted on my entering the room where the ipswich gentleman and the foreigner mentioned in my last letter made a part of the company some instrumental things were performed and i was at length requested to play a lesson on the piano forte i felt all the disadvantage of having no foreign attraction and therefore knew that i stood but little chance of being ranked with my present competitors unless i could in some arch way turn the tables i therefore said i thought a song would be a kind of relief to what had gone before and played pomposo which hit exactly as i wished it should this circumstance  for you know i love illustrations  brings another to my mind which also told very strongly in this way  i was asked to dine at one of mr foxs annual meetings were there were about two hundred westminster electors before i gave my consent i stipulated with my friend that i should not be asked to sing this indulgence he said he could insure me but upon reflection i placed very little reliance on the promise i therefore was prepared with my famous jews song which will be found in the readings and it is not in the power of language to describe how wonderfully well it hit that sine veteran macklin was in raptures and i sincerely believe it was the sole cause of his burning his wig which made such a noise the next day in the newspapers but to return to bury  the consent i wanted was easily obtained  and in my life i never experienced handsomer or politer treatment one reverend gentleman however was scrupulous  but it is a becoming thing for the clergy to be conscientious  and though the rev dr woolastons readiness to forward a rational amusement which he did me the honor to attend and highly approve had certainly nothing reprehensible in it the other reverend doctor was surely under no obligation to do the same it is true if others had imitated this wonderfully sagacious prudent and wary forecast bury would have been deprived of what they were so kind as to think a pleasure what then prevention is a wise thing and upon the same principle  a little more rigidly exacted to be sure  that it is better to let twenty guilty persons escape than that one suffer innocently  so the suppression of fifty harmless amusements is meritorious rather than run the smallest risk of giving encouragement to vice and immorality  after the performance was over  which i had advertised but for one night  i was obliged to promise a repetition of it and as i wished very much to go to norwich before the players could get there i appointed a late day in the following week and packed off i have really had the luck of meeting with friendly printers mr stevenson the valuable and worthy partner of mr crouse showed me a thousand civilities among the rest his friendly recommendation to yarmouth rubbed off all difficulties in the way of my performing there  yet would it be injustice to messrs downs and march not to say that their attention for the short time i remained at yarmouth was very gentlemanlike and perfectly liberal but let me first speak of norwich on the first night  though i addressed upwards of an hundred letters to the principal people  i had only five persons i did not perform in course and indeed i was doubtful whether i should give them the trouble or myself the expense of another night having however understood that i was there also considered as an impostor i inserted a paragraph in the bill which i expected would have its effect and indeed i was stimulated to this by the very handsome conduct of a gentleman present on the first night who said every thing he could think of to palliate the matter i drove him however into a corner by saying that i was very willing to stand or fall by the merit of the entertainment and it would give me particular pleasure if they would pitch upon twelve critics who should be men of real understanding to report the matter and let it be decided upon according to their judgment he answered that it was a fair offer but that it never could be settled for there was not any such number as twelve critics in norwich at the same time he suggested that the success might be better  that the number of nights i had advertised i ought to consider as a compact with the public this last argument roused me i determined to perform every night i had engaged for at all adventures i did so and though no opportunity was neglected and those who attended were greatly pleased  according to the irishman  i gained a loss enough therefore of norwich at which place however  as at almost every other  i found something to counterbalance my disappointments the attention and civility of my friend stevenson made me large amends for the vapid unmeaning languor that pervaded the place itself not but i have many acknowledgments to pay those who attended the performance  for they one and all agreed that i could not in painting my tour throw norwich too much into the back ground  at yarmouth i had two nights which  though not numerous  were brilliant there is a gentleman at yarmouth to whom the fashionable people look up  and well they may  as the arbiter of their amusements his attention to me  could i conceive i really merited it  might make me vain of myself indeed to show however that nothing can win me on a pecuniary score be it known i rather lost than gained at yarmouth but dr coopers anxiety on that account  his solicitude for my accommodation  his handsome wellbred conduct gave me so exalted an opinion of him that i was not at all surprised when mr roupe to whom he is a sort of patron without his own knowledge  for he confers to oblige himself assured me that there is not a human mind fraught with more worth or disinterested benevolence and here mr roupe must forgive me if in order to illustrate his and my position i speak a little of his own comfortable situation  this gentleman possessed a competent fortune subject to alienation at the death of a relation  which relation being dead he is deprived of it till the decease of another upon his loss by the advice of his friends  and dr cooper at the head of them he made what had been his amusement his profession and having an admirable musical turn he is now organist and has all the principal teaching of yarmouth i never had the pleasure of hearing him play but have heard a great account of his performance i however chatted with him some hours on music and he seems to be of my own sentiments he has a strong fancy and despises every rule that is not reconcilable to reason  may he long be happy which there is little fear of for through the benignant influence of dr cooper and his own mild and amiable manners he feels himself as independent and is as much respected as when he basked in the sunshine of fortune and had no right to consider himself as a professional man  you must understand that i performed at norwich and yarmouth alternately  which circumstance occasioned the appearance of a paragraph in the bury paper saying that it was a wonderful thing  setting aside all considerations of the merit of the performance  that mr dibdin should be able at all to perform an amusement in which he sung twenty four songs and delivered an adequate quantity of speaking on monday at norwich  tuesday at yarmouth  wednesday at norwich  thursday at yarmouth  friday at norwich  and saturday at bury this circumstance however would have been attended with more pleasurable consequences to me if every one of these nights had been equal to the last which i seriously declare was more than the other five put together  norwich is a large city  but the streets are so narrow and so alike that a man would sooner learn to be his own pilot in london than in that place there are so few spires in norwich that the view of the town and cathedral from the yarmouth road across the river has a most beautiful and picturesque effect not so very striking as that birdseyeview of bristol from cliffden hill but neat and well grouped the streets of yarmouth are yet narrower than those of norwich but the spaciousness of the quay makes handsome amends the first has all the heavy stupidity of a city where the manufactory is on the decline and the other the sprightliness of increasing trade varied by an influx of commodities from every part of the world i never beheld such a wonderful scene as the prodigious fine large rich fields of corn exhibited for a stretch of eight miles together between norwich and yarmouth  and yet go where you would the farmers grumbled but it has been well observed that englishmen are never rolling in wealth so much as when they complain of the weight of taxes and the impending ruin of the nation  yours most cordially c dibdin halifax dec          letter xxiv a disappointment  but it is a plain proof the world is all alike to the rev mr  dear sir at my return from norwich to bury which was on the last day of the assize week saturday july    i found every thing prepared for my performance at which a very splendid audience attended and among them one of the learned judges the applause was prodigious and never did better humor prevail in an assembly i felt myself however rather awkward at having announced the wolf who had been a lawyer i intimated this ridiculous distress to a gentleman who sat near me and the subject so got about that no member of the law went unconsulted and it was resolved nem con that i should cut at the lawyers you will find the passage in the readings my feelings however were too prophetic for though many of the gentlemen  particularly him i consulted and the judge  enjoyed the satire yet were there many chopfallen on the occasion i mention this circumstance to support that constant opinion i have ever broached that in the practice of the law there are so many temptations to knavery that every lawyer who does not feel a severity of this kind as a positive reproach to himself must be hurt at having been bred up to a profession that stigmatizes ninetenths of his brethren  on sunday i set out for worcester and on the following tuesday arrived there i have mentioned that before i left this place i made a promise to return to it and i now put myself to the expense of traveling post one hundred and fortynine miles to keep my word having at bury purchased mr patersons traveling dictionary i shall now begin to point out a few of its errors he says from bury to worcester is     miles and his mistake originates from calling it    miles from aulcester to worcester whereas it is    from aulcester to droitwich is    and from thence to worcester   he is wrong a single mile in three other places which makes the distance in all     miles from bury to worcester  my going this long journey was the more inconvenient having received a letter at bury telling me that a gentleman at hull and beverly could accommodate me with a room and had no doubt of my doing extremely well at those towns  but of these places in their turn i was surprised to find a much colder reception at worcester than formerly except from one or two friends i never experienced more milk and water treatment in my life i advertised my entertainment however and was tolerably attended  very tolerably as tester says and i sincerely believe had it not been for the interference of a friend i must have used the word intolerably to this gentleman who is no other than t s esquire i shall beg leave to say that if he meant his friendship and attention to my interest should finish where it apparently has  god forbid i should load him with more trouble than he is willing to suffer so far from it  i here in the face of the world acquit him of any intentions in relation to me but those of serving obliging and pleasing me and should it so happen that neither upon paper nor any other way we again exchange a single word my wishes toward him are may he enjoy a long life of health happiness and prosperity and i hope he retains so much of his former good wishes for me as to return an equal portion of esteem with equal sincerity  my success at worcester was little worth the pains i took to get at it dr evans the archdeacon who was very partial to the entertainment said my reception was a reproach to the place and really as they diverted my course in a most expensive and inconvenient way it would have been but handsome to have let me known in time that they had changed their mind or have paid me some attention when i did come i will not quit this subject without speaking of that friendly and goodnatured creature mr smart who i sincerely believe was as anxious for my success as myself nor must i leave digley unsung  the heartiness of mr peach its owner  nor the beauties of that charming place watered by the severn and bounded with a view of malvernhills mr shenstone would presently have knocked you off half a dozen stanzas on this subject wherein he would have told you in verse that goes trippingly over the tongue that the hills are blue at a distance more distinct when near  that the river has the property of reflection and that you may see in it imperfect trees standing on their heads  with many more poetically selfevident images i once parodied my banks are all furnished with bees the first verse ran thus my banks are all furnished with bees quickset hedges my fences adorn my woods are all crowded with trees and my fields yellow over with corn i seldom have found any tares of such use are my harrow and plough  in my orchards grow apples and pears in my dairy there is milk from the cow   in this manner one might i should suppose run on without any great stretch of difficulty till all the wonderful variety in the whole round of rural objects were enumerated i recollect something like the following in a french author though i cannot at this moment tell who an old fellow is buying an estate and the seller puffs it off in all the flowery descriptive extravagance of an auctioneers advertisement to which this is the answer it is in verse and i have imitated it if for seven years you were to chatter it is hills and dales and woods and water all have their whims and to tell mine to ye  one country seen  one has seen ninety  yet  let me not be profane  shenstones eclogues and many other of his things have great poetic sweetness  but having an inveterate aversion to insipidity i never could feel any other sensation than drowsiness at that famous ballad which is said to contain all the beauties of pastoral poetry but this will always be the way  the generality of mankind give an author credit for what in all probability he considered in the light of an insignificant trifle  such as the ballad abovementioned  while his higherfinished and more beautiful works  such as the school mistress  is little known and less tasted but there is always this comfort  men of real taste will separate the gold from the alloy the applause of one of whom will outweigh a whole crowd of inferior critics  i must not quit worcester without mentioning a most singular and extraordinary instance of the falsity of that vulgar position  that fortune is inattentive to virtue there is a gentleman i would name if i did not fear to wound his well known modesty who made his fortune by the exercise of that one single virtue  forbearance i do not mean that he has not all the rest in as great perfection  but this happened to be put most to the trial and to show that i am determined whenever i have an opportunity to celebrate the virtues of professional men with the same willingness as any other description this gentleman was originally nothing else than a musician  a mere thrummer of wire and a scraper of catgut he taught a young lady who fell in love with him and even went so far as to propose an elopement did he think you give way to the tender impulse and while his heart beat high snatch sweet occasion and become happy no such thing oh fie miss was all he was heard to utter having finished this laconic reproach he left the disappointed lovesick fair one and sought her father  when  first stipulating that the young lady should not be ill treated  he minutely acquainted him to do which it seems he was obliged to relate a tale that might be called the history of the sabines inverted with his daughters shocking violation of her duty what was the consequence this amiable young mans unheard of prudence saved the family the daughter became prudent by despising the man she had courted was married soon after to one of equal birth and i hope equal impetuosity the father prudently rewarded the author of his domestic happiness and that author prudently put the reward in his pocket after this our musical joseph fell in love himself  but with his usual patience and forbearance he determined that time alone should prove whether the object of his affection was worthy of it the lady however being a little in the style of the other  not quite of that passive temper which contents itself with imaginary bliss  was first uneasy  afterward unhappy  then ill  and at length died  our mirror of prudence having lost a fortune by her had nothing for it but to console the mamma he considered himself as her son  she considered herself as his mother  and that nothing might be left undone to confirm this ideal consanguinity she died and left him all she was worth  which turned out to be no trifle  is there a fortunehunter who reads this but will in future change his battery  and cease to tear forward children from the arms of indulgent parents since  by imitating the excellent example before them  the fortune  which is always the object  may be gained without the loss of honor or  which is a more material consideration  the possession of a wife  so much for worcester  where you see after all i was shabbily treated but it is a plain proof the world is all alike  and indeed i know not which was most to blame  they for promising or i for believing if i had properly reflected i might have known it was the whim of the moment and would naturally subside i should be sorry if there was not more stability in my assuring you that i am  with great truth most heartily yours c dibdin wakefield dec          letter xxv a consolation  in one great blessing all her bounty send  that i may never lose so dear a friend  to the rev mr  dear sir from worcester  having been joined by an intimate and valuable friend  i steered my course on the eleventh of august for gloucester bristol and monmouth my plan  while he should remain with me  being to make the matter a mutual intercourse of business and call at those places that might be most convenient to both nothing in my way was to be done at gloucester  for though the gloom of the bankruptcies before mentioned was worn off yet the place looked as melancholy as ever we therefore proceeded to bristol spent three or four happy days with my friend boyton and passed on from thence to monmouth being the first place where i intended to display my standard  the current account of places remains unsettled ever since norwich bury which is the picture of cheerfulness consists  together with its vicinity  of people who seem determined to be happy the seats of mr symonds sir charles bunbury sir charles davers and many others most charmingly enliven every morning ride and its proximity to newmarket occasions frequent visits from many people of the first distinction the cornmarket alone gives you a very respectable idea of the place of the inns the bell is a remarkable good one  if civility good cheer and a reasonable charge are the right distinctions if you would meet with the reverse in every respect go to the angel  my journey from bury to worcester was performed in so short a time that it would be a farce to talk of making any material observations the roads are charming from cambridge to willingborough and then very indifferent till you get four miles beyond warwick in the way to stratforduponavon afterward they are good all the way to worcester i promised to speak of the white lion at stratford and common justice obliges me to say that the insolence of the people who keep it exceeds all example i should pass by the contempt with which they treat travelers in a stage coach  which is hard by the way for they must go there or nowhere  and also their wanting to put me into a return chaise and make me pay full price for it all this is in the way of business but when you are in a hurry to have the very worst horses picked out and be told that the others are for your betters and you may have them or none  though they do not know you  and if they did your betters do not pay a farthing more  is a species of contemptuous impudence that i hope will by somebody more competent than myself be taken down i have a great deal more of this sort of conduct to complain of and i shall seriously advise the respectable inhabitants of capital towns  for at stratford i know not if it would be worth while  for their own private benefit for the benefit of those who in visits of business to them pamper the pride and fatten these insufferable innkeepers and for the benefit of the public in general to imitate the spirit of the duke of norfolk and as completely curb the haughty impertinence of these servants out of livery  which in general they are  as he has  as far as its influence extends  by building the tontine at sheffield and placing in it a man whose solicitude for the convenience of his guests should be quoted as a precedent for every one in his situation the ground from worcester to bristol i have gone over already i promised on my return to give an account of the musical taste of bristol  but upon the most diligent enquiry i do not find they have any at all the road is all the way delightful and from tewksbury to gloucester remarkably so it wanted nothing but a few scattered romish chapels to have finished subjects for the pencil of claude from bristol we crossed the severn in a dung barge and proceeded to chepstow  where we were offered our choice either to stay or have four horses to take us on and all this because the landlord of the other inn was just become a bankrupt let me caution all travelers to make any shift rather than submit to be drawn by four horses they make no more expedition than two  and exclusive of the expense in themselves postillions ostlers and turnpikes you have a great deal of difficulty to shake them off again and your bill is in proportion to your oetelage these four horses brought us very slowly  for which i was obliged to them  over one of the most uncommonly beautiful hills that can be imagined  the whole country every where abundantly rich with corn  to monmouth where for the present i shall bid you adieu  assuring you that i am ever  and very truly yours c dibdin sheffield dec  0       letter xxvi a dissertation on cities  all is not gold that glitters to the rev mr  dear sir monmouth was not worth a printer to make my intentions known therefore was a matter of no small difficulty a few respectful letters however to the principal inhabitants of the town and its vicinity did the business pretty well and i was tolerably attended a first night august    and much better a second and as a general good humor and inclination to receive pleasure was the predominant sensation i felt almost as happy as if the advantage had been equal to the applause  i must not pass by some particular civilities that i received at monmouth the rev dr davis who was then the mayor paid me very great attention and  what made it more welcome to me  it was very much in the style of dr cooper of yarmouth for this kindness i then requested him privately  and do now publicly  to receive my thanks nor will i have the ingratitude to forget the anxious heartiness of my good friend owen tudor the bookseller who though not a printer was so good a publisher upon this occasion that much more intelligence was received through his kind assiduity than i am sure would have been conveyed by means of hand bills i left him  and may he long continue so  comfortable in himself beloved by his neighbors and surrounded by that best of happiness  domestic felicity in fine i gave and received great satisfaction at monmouth but as it is the lot of human beings to do nothing perfect i understand there is one gentleman for whose castigation i was supposed to have written the business of inventing quotations nay some went so far as to say he will never be able to invent another undoubted fact as long as he lives if this be the case how unfortunate am i in having deprived a good storyteller of the greatest embellishment his talents can derive advantage from should it be so i can only say  which i entreat the gentleman if he read this to believe  that it was written many months before i had the pleasure of his company at my readings and always highly approved as a devilish good thing  from monmouth  which though an ancient town is a very sprightly one  just as a reasonable old man macklin for instance in spite of his years resolves to be merry  we jogged on to stupid hereford i have made this remark in my tour that the cities in general  as i say of the dominos  are grave elegant genteel and  stupid to which if i was to add poor and proud the phrase i think would apply pretty well for if we except bristol which being a seaport is naturally a busy and industrious place  worcester which has a manufactory for gloves and porcelain  though both are on the decline  it is impossible to conceive any thing so phlegmatic and insensible as are the rest of the cities i have seen thus shall i always say stupid hereford melancholy lichfield pitiful lincoln and frothy york this last place however being the london of the north has exactly as much of it as a shadow has of a substance and upon the strength of this it presumes to be courtly and make promises which  like the nonsense of a frenchman  are pleasing and mean nothing they buoy you up like an air jacket but the smallest inlet  even a single pin hole  can evaporate the air and down you go they will take care to promise nothing but trifles and even those they take as good care not to keep this brings to my mind an anecdote of a poor player who had run up an alehouse score to the enormous extent of two shillings for which he had been so often dunned that he kept away from the house one day meeting the landlord and being closely importuned to satisfy him this strolling roscius assured him that he might depend in the course of the week on being paid in some shape or another  shape  said the landlord  well i think i will take your word this time but  harkee  pray let it be as much in the shape of  two shillings as you can i am however not yet at york therefore i may as well keep what i have to say of that place till i get there i shall nevertheless so far digress as to finish my remarks on cities  some have averred that this vapidness is owing to the cathedral which nurtures so many drones as to make all the rest of the hive lazy i hope this assertion is more invidious than true i have literally speaking had no opportunity at the four places above mentioned of taking personal cognizance of this fact at hereford i did not perform or if i had their cathedral had just tumbled down and of course  like rats which never fail to leave a sinking ship  the black gentlemen were sheltered in some safer asylum i could not refrain from remarking that though the church lay in ruins the chapter house stood smiling at the danger  all the rentrolls tithes and commutations were safe  as safe as the iron chest of a miser who has insured his house  which defies the spreading flames and keeps its sterling value in security though buried under a load of rubbish  at lichfield they were providentially repairing their cathedral lest unable to bear the ravages of time it should also tumble down  the clergy therefore were again absent upon furlough  at lincoln indeed where the cathedral seems to have the stability of a rock and yet the lightness of a temple built with cards the clerical gentlemen seemed to be on full duty and here though nothing but my compact to speak the truth should force it from me i cannot help saying that the above remark obtained a little  but this i shall speak to particularly when i arrive at lincoln  at york whose stately and majestic minster looks magnificently stupendous at a distance and when you are near it as petite as the lords prayer the creed and ten commandments stuffed into a walnut shell i know nothing more of the clergy than that their situations are generally sinecures and that whether their cathedral stand or fall  which latter there is no great probability of  they may be absent when they please i know however a prebend of york whom my heart warms to think of but of this hereafter  as to norwich disgust was my predominant passion and therefore like the father who would not disinherit his son because he was angry with him i will pass by that subject i shall also for the present have done with all other conjectures concerning the clergy and content myself with offering my own observations relative to cities which are that having in general no manufactory or other public object to engross their attention they are divided into people of tolerable fortunes small fortunes a few adventurers  by way of cicesbeos to the wives and gallants to the daughters  and the remainder are such tradesmen as furnish the necessaries of life and pick up a livelihood by the expenditure of the money circulated by those before described the attorneys and medical gentlemen are in number according to the size of the place a tolerable large city will maintain you  about thirty of the first and fifteen of the latter so much dearer in this country is property than health dearer paid for  in every trifling village there are three or four decent houses which you may be assured belong to the parson the apothecary and the lawyer  it has been a remark that when one lawyer cannot live in a place  two can for in that case if the people are peaceably disposed one can provoke and the other palliate   over all these of course are placed the clergy who can certainly give a sort of ton to the place and if they ever happen  which all the world knows is very rare  either to be ignorant overbearing or void of taste these peculiar qualities will be as surely predominant in their influence on the rest  and indeed ought even as the whistle of the shepherd brings the sheep into the fold  thus you see how i throw my ideas about at random which indeed is all that can be expected of me for manners and men can no more be developed by a cursory view than can a single glance determine the color of a cameleon  which must have shade and sunshine night and day and every other adventitious opportunity to display its different hues and after all so blind is human judgment that it will be impossible to fix on that particular shade that is proper to it all is not gold that glitters says the proverb heaven knows my professions in no way can glitter if they could they would wear nothing but the sober appearance of truth when i assure you that i am  most sincerely yours c dibdin sheffield jan         letter xxvii pleasure the result of reflection  when i consider the heavens and the works of thy

my tour i thank you for saying exactly what you feel as you read my remarks i have not been unmindful of any of these subjects but i shall have so much loose ground to run over for three or four letters to come that i would willingly shake it off my heels before i come into the company of men of science and genius in short i shall not begin my critical attack till i get farther on my journey for to give you a pun in the place of a better phrase one cannot be too far north for them  from hereford i went to leominster where i was told the inhabitants were very anxious to see me mr pene the organist  to whose civility i am greatly indebted  took much pains for me previous to my arrival and i had one very decent night the old stupid objection however took place i was an impostor  and my performance was to be watched very narrowly  my audience were so much entertained however that they encored nine songs  nevertheless mr evans a clergyman proposed to mr geary a surgeon a bet of ten guineas that i was an impostor the wager was accepted and mr kirkman a country squire was to decide between them this last mentioned gentleman very gravely determined that to be sure of all the impostors that ever lived i was the cleverest  but that certainly i was not mr dibdin whom he knew perfectly well  that not long before he had been publicly in his company and heard him sing several jolly songs  and that he was a tall thin man and wore a wig mr geary having lost his wager query whether he should not have appealed to me as a court of equity or indeed when this tour shall come out may it not be considered such strong legal evidence as may entitle mr geary to the recovery of his money  nay more to a remedy through the medium of that act which makes it felony to obtain money by false pretenses for it was certainly a false pretense in mr kirkman to say he had been publicly in my company had it so happened i must have known it  for his person could not have been mistaken being remarkably like a ninepin with the addition of sins these premises therefore duly weighed and considered i would advise mr evans to refund the money and mr kirkman to give a handsome treat  which he seems very fond of  and pledge himself over the first pint bumper never  in imitation of the longeared gentlemen  to describe the roaring of a lion lest by exerting his own voice he discover the braying of an ass  from leominster we went to that pretty cleanlooking town ludlow  whose appearance from the distance of two miles  with the church in the center towering above the houses  forms as picturesque a coup doeul as imagination can conceive  at ludlow i would not perform because the players were there i shall not so far lift mr millar their manager into consequence as to make him a party in this tour nor shall i pay the reader so ill a compliment as to relate the particulars of a low contemptible plot which  as every thing founded in falsity ought  recoiled and severely wounded the above pretty gentleman its contriver a lion preys not upon carcases  out of pity  for i found by some conversation with one of the magistrates that the story had made him as contemptible at ludlow as at worcester we dined and went on to bridgenorth which place and coalbrook dale we had a great desire to see as nothing but pleasure engrossed us for some time i shall go on with my account of places roads etc  from monmouth  which commands a beautiful view of both the wye and the munow  we passed to hereford the whole time beguiled by extensive rich and variegated prospects brown ceres every where had spread her golden store and plump pomona half sunk under the weight of her abundant horn my friend who  till he took this journey with me  had never been forty miles out of london felt as if he had been transported to elysium and as our journey from monmouth was on a sunday we took occasion to remark on the decent cleanliness of the villagers and the sober thankful appearance which nature that morning wore we did not go to church but i think we had as much the glow of religion in our hearts as those who did you know among my amusements i practice painting and i declare most sacredly that in delineating the form of a tree  sweeping with my pencil over hills and valleys  reflecting the various tints of fleecy clouds on the smooth bosom of an extensive river  but more than all this  rolling in the aetherial expanse and commanding the winds to shape a collected vapor into a graceful form  hervey never had more delicious contemplations in his flowergarden than i in those moments an adoration of the author of nature thrills through my spontaneous fancy and the expansion of my mind lifts me above the dazzling splendor of emperors all this i felt on our journey  and for four hours could talk of nothing else i lamented the evils that persecutions dogmas and schisms have introduced into the world and how often the mildest and most charitable name that ever dignified human nature has been wickedly used  by abominable priests  to enforce slaughter exaggerated by cruelty how much more consonant to the essence would be the worship of a supreme being if  without a single reflection on what others do  it were comprised in an obedient thankfulness of heart and a sincere and grateful acknowledgment of the imminent favors and distinctions we so bountifully receive from his gracious hand  hereford seems to be as insensible of these blessings as a gorged alderman of true flavor the views continued with very little variation in point of beauty through our whole route till we got to wolverhampton when the country became flat and the soil sandy about five miles before you reach leominster  which circumstance i mention as a remarkable instance of erudition in the commissioners of the highway in that part of the world of which body i hope squire kirkman is not a member  there is a board placed up with the following words  whoever drives of this road shall be informed upon for my part i would not make any impertinent remarks on any thing i meet but perhaps they hold some charter in this part of the world by using this sort of orthography it is full as sensible  and much more innocent  than baiting the bull at stamford as however  though it was incomprehensible  it must imply some caution my friend made a very admissible alteration and it read thus whoever drives on this road shall be imposed upon which it must be confessed after the four horses from chepstow and an extravagant bill at the beaufort arms at monmouth we considered as no unwholesome hint and it was pretty well confirmed when we set out from ludlow going from which place to bridgenorth  if the traveller do not take great care  he will be sent twentyfive miles instead of eighteen you are asked if you choose to make it one stage or two and told that the road is very hilly it is more likely therefore you will prefer  as we did  the two stages that the horses may be fresh and draw you with more spirit eighteen miles being really a long stage in that country thus without saying a word more they take you to clebury  for in the direct road over the moor and through aston and down there is no place to change horses clebury is twelve miles from ludlow and bridgenorth thirteen more from clebury thus according to my friend it is plain those who drive on that road  if they are not wary  will be imposed upon  passing over the clay hills in shropshire is perhaps one of the most stupendous and wonderful instances of extent and fertility that nature has in all her domain the objects are so innumerable  their forms so varied  and their colors so beautiful that the eye is  if i may be allowed the expression  agonized with enjoyment every hundred yards presents a new scene and every scene more charming than that which went before it till the rapt fancy rises to sublimity and exquisite pleasure is lost in mute wonder nor are these expressions too strong for the subject the hills were cloud capt and no air balloon could be better situated for a good prospect than was our chaise  in the whole of this journey i was lost in pleasing astonishment and could not help exclaiming in the text of this letter  which you may call a sermon if you please for even in this age i am not ashamed of moralizing  when i consider the heavens and the work of thy fingers  adieu confess with me there is not an enjoyment equal to that which pleases on reflection one of which is that i take when i tell you that  i am with truth your obliged friend c dibdin sheffield jan          letter xxviii more wonders  what a piece of work is man to the rev mr  dear sir having wound  like the worm of a corkscrew  round that natural fortification that renders bridgenorth a little gibralter  we arrived there and supped on the wonders we had seen  for as to the musty chickens and highflavoured ham there was no eating them the next morning we explored all the beauties of that uncommonly picturesque country and after dinner while curiosity was on tiptoe went on to coalbrook dale where we intended to stay the night and see every thing worthy of observation this however was not in our power  for the stench of the sulphur was so potent that we were taken ill and i protest  though i have as few squeamish sensations as most people  i never felt myself so overcome in my life indeed the day was insufferably hot which added to the monstrous piles of coal burning to coke  the furnaces  forges  and other tremendous objects of fire and smoke which spread round us to an immense distance  might probably cause that suffocating sensation of which i can give no adequate description but by saying that  as far as conception can picture  it must have a faint resemblance of being placed in an air pump  and yet though we labored under this difficulty of respiration the inhabitants  and the workmen especially  feel no inconvenience but on the contrary as we were told are remarkably healthy and live to a great age  some particulars relative to the place we were determined however to ascertain the tarspring for example was too curious an object to be passed by unnoticed we went into the mouth of a bricked archway which reaches three hundred yards and when we had got about thirty yards we began to see the tar ooze from between the crannies in the rock it must be understood that from the top of the rock a pit had been sunk which went to such an immense depth that it would have been very expensive and indeed almost impracticable to work it but finding the coals of an admirable quality it was thought worth while to form the archway above described at the foot of the mountain and very near the severn that the coal might be drawn out in carriages which mode of getting at them  instead of the usual way  it was thought would be so much more expeditious and convenient as to make a saving  in a short time  equal to the expense of having formed the archway in the prosecution of this scheme the tar made its appearance  at first oozing as we had seen it and afterward pouring like an inundation fairly flowing into the severn the discovery was made known and the course of the tar diverted by means of iron pipes which i assure the reader are nearly as large as those which convey the water from the new river in london large pits were immediately dug and caldrons of a prodigious magnitude sunk and by boiling in those it hardened into pitch there are three springs one of which emits an astonishing quantity the first when we were there was nearly dried up which induces the workmen to believe that in time the whole will cease but who can say in what time the same rock may be traced seven miles  and every body knows at that distance they are now extracting tar from coal which very probably is a drossy part of the very tar that  about half a mile from the iron bridge  runs thicker than treacle but as pellucid as burgundy  i have since conversed with a chemical gentleman who has bought a great deal of it and he assures me it has the strongest similitude of any thing he ever saw or read of to the famous black pitch used by the egyptians for embalming this tar is remarkably free from impurity is as bituminous as asphaltum and has an agreeable odor not unlike benjamin  i must not leave coalbrook dale without saying something of the famous iron bridge that stupendous pattern card  for it may well be called so  is in every respect one of the most artful and ingenious contrivances that ever was conceived or executed by man it consists of one arch  and the river is in that place an hundred yards over  for at the same time that it proves the dusky inhabitants of that gloomy region are equal to any thing in the way of iron work  though ever so ponderous and immense  it is a source of continual profit  a constant toll being kept up which cannot be for the repair of the bridge  for though it looks like network wrought in wire it will apparently last uninjured for ages i offered mr harris  as will hereafter be seen  a number of ideas wrought into complete scenes which might in future supply matter for different pantomimes this would have been one of them he rejected the offer however as useless  i am nevertheless well assured that i could have furnished him with admirable matter in that way  to accomplish which i had nothing to do but look around and express those feelings musically and poetically with which the object at that moment impressed me  if in future any of the scenes i describe in this work should be introduced into a pantomime i hope the credit of the original idea will be given to me  not for the value of the thing  only that the saddle may be placed upon the right horse   this place wants nothing but cerberus to give you an idea of the heathen hell the severn may pass for the styx  with this difference  that old charon become a turnpikeman ushers you over the iron bridge instead of rowing you in his crazy bark the men and women might easily be mistaken for devils and furies  and the entrance of any one of those blazing caverns for the approach of tartarus jesting apart if an atheist who never heard of coalbrook dale could be transported there in a dream and left to wake at the mouth of one of those furnaces surrounded on all sides with such numbers of infernal objects  though he had been all his life the most profligate unbeliever that ever added blasphemy to incredulity  he would infallibly tremble at the just punishment he was in imagination going to receive  my friends first remark when he saw these dingy gentlemen was  that he should be sorry to meet any of them in a bye lane having made the very same observation to my friend boyton upon the colliers at kingswood  and being by him satisfied as to the fallacy of it  i was able to refute his apprehensions by saying that i made no doubt but some reformer had done the state so much service as to have reconciled these people to their situation  by an assurance that if they would be honest they should only have a hell in this world this turned out to be the case one half of them are quakers and the other methodists thus was gloom familiar to them  nor do i mean to be sarcastic  for i declare i think that the civilizing the colliers of kingswood does more honor to mr wesley is a better fight and crowns him with more laurels than ever were reaped by all the heroes of the holy war  the upright perpetrators of the massacre of st bartholomew  or the pious tortures of all the unfortunate victims that ever were brought to an inquisitorial stake what a piece of work is man  and yet while there are such characters as the above man delights not me except indeed a few select friends to whom i devote myself and among whom no one more than yourself has the good wishes of   i hope i may say  the ample hearted c dibdin sheffield jan          letter xxix resuscitation  without the help of the humane society  i wonder men are not afraid to look into a newspaper lest they should meet with something to make them unhappy for the rest of their lives to the rev mr  dear sir having washed the sulphur out of out throats by a dish of tea we set out for sheffnal and afterward for wolverhampton where it was said we should find the best inn in the kingdom  namely the george arriving there however at eleven oclock and finding every body in bed did not give us an idea of the most watchful inn in the kingdom  and getting no supper till one oclock and then a very bad one did not prove it was the best provided larder in the kingdom  the next day we moved to the red lion where we were really well treated  and the assembly room being in the house i advertised my entertainment for one night which was a very indifferent one indeed as however it was an unfavourable time and the notice was short i sincerely believe i should have mended my success if i had stayed longer i have in the little time which i was there to thank mr lane a merchant and mr smart the bookseller for several civilities  and i believe this is all i have to say of wolverhampton except that we saw the process of working up that very iron which at coalbrook dale was in so crude a state into every possible kind of form  with the addition of all that belongs to the art of japanning i must not forget to remark that the wonderful discovery of the tar spring was at wolverhampton  though at so small a distance  considered as a mere fable  leaving wolverhampton we went to birmingham and from thence to lichfield here i resolved to give my entertainment and procured for that purpose the vicars hall which requiring the consent of a certain number of gentlemen it came out among my enquiries that mr peter garrick was living and in good health as the newspapers long ago  indeed just after the death of his two brothers  had been inhuman enough to kill him i never was more surprised at any thing in my life for never having seen the account of his death contradicted i own i firmly believed him at rest with his ancestors  the moment i found where mr garrick lived i hastened to pay him my respects he was very glad to see me and we chatted together i believe an hour the old times of the jubilee and the levees of hampton made great part of our conversation and we felt mutual pleasure and pain at the recollection there were so many points of superior abilities about garrick that though historical justice obliging one to be faithful impels a retrospect of little one of the most striking of these is i believe the following garrick one day  just before the christmas tale made its appearance  went into the painting room and seeing as he imagined a prodigious quantity of gold strewed about the floor began to abuse first the man who was grinding the colors and afterward to bawl out lustily for french the painter french made his appearance and was thus accosted wha  why  hey  damme  why you mr french  is not it  ey  the cursedest thing  that you will in this harum skarum manner  he  a  damme  ruin me god bless my soul cried french what is the matter sir the matter sir  why where are you  with your damned lacklustre eyes  dont you see the ground all strewed with gold i believe you think i roll in money gold sir  oh what the dutch metal that we have rubbed off in gilding the new scene  it is not worth twopence well  twopence  and pray why the devil should i lose twopence  do you consider what twopence a day comes to in a year well sir it is nothing out of your pocket yes sir but  a  yaw  you  are a damned curious sort of a  hey  how is it nothing out of my pocket why you know sir i have a salary for finding all these things oh  a  hey  a salary  why then damme if i care twopence about it as well as great actions yet in recollecting the pleasureable moments passed in his company one naturally rejoices that in the duty of a recorder we can mingle a little the task of a panegyrist i certainly had many differences with garrick and they arose from nothing but this  i would never flatter him indeed had i been capable of that creeping adulation without which no man can arrive to a responsible situation in the theatrical cabinet or at least keep it  unless perhaps he be independent  i might certainly now have been in possession of a decent appointment  roundly assessed by the bye  together with the superlative happiness of being puffed in all the newspapers  garrick notwithstanding i sincerely believe had as good an opinion of me as of any man he ever was connected with and on my part i declare that nothing ever gave me more pleasure than my reconciliation with him before he died which happened  and it is a remarkable circumstance  at the last rehearsal of my pantomime of the touchstone on the night before he went to lord spencers from whence all the world knows he returned to the aldelphi to breathe his last  mr peter garrick attended my performance  and for one testified much satisfaction the company however in general were extremely grave which i could not possibly account for especially as mr saville  who made me many professions of kindness and service  took minutes of the most striking serious songs with a view of singing them himself the truth however at last came out it seems miss seward was there  without whose permission nobody at lichfield dares to judge of any thing literary my entertainment therefore coming in some degree under this description and that lady  angry i suppose that i should burlesque the siege of troy or conjure up the spirit of an old maid or for some other notable reason no doubt  did not choose to wear a smile the whole evening what was the issue the dean looked grave  mr saville looked grave  every body but mr peter garrick looked grave i announced the second evening  every body looked grave i attended the second evening  nobody came  it has been confidently said to me that a musical man at lichfield was very industrious first to prevent and afterward  finding that impossible  to decry my entertainment if this be not a fact the man i allude to  unconscious of ill  will suffer nothing if it be let him reflect  for i will not give myself the pain of saying more  that illiberality was never yet the companion of real genius  before i quit lichfield i must not forget to mention mr greens museum  which certainly for its size is one of the completest in the kingdom the ores of various sorts are remarkably curious the coins medals and impressions large  in point of number  and valuable  in point of neatness correctness and preservation the display of the force of magnetism is singularly worth attention but indeed to enumerate every particular of this cabinet of curiosities  which is wonderfully well filled  would go far beyond my limits and yet fall infinitely short of what the subject deserves  adieu lichfield  and adieu mr garrick  may he long enjoy that solicitous attention he so amply receives from his friends nor may the dart of death or any other human ill for years have more power to hurt him than the ineffectual calumny of a newspaper  yours most sincerely c dibdin sheffield jan          letter xxx a nasty subject  treated as delicately as possible  what is bred in the bone   to the rev mr  dear sir we came to derby a day after the races which might be said to be  for me  a day after the fair  for though during two nights that i performed there i was not so thinly attended as at wolverhampton yet it turned out nothing of consequence here we saw that wonderful effect of human ingenuity the silk mill we purchased some of the productions of the peak and we were witness to the whole process of forming drying painting and burning porcelain  it has happened among the uncommon circumstances which have attended this tour that  like sir roger de coverly with his watermen and hackneycoach men  i have employed by way of billcarriers scarcely one who has not had some natural infirmity at oxford i had two men who had not an arm and a half between them at another place i had a sailor with a wooden leg i have had men with one eye out of number but here at derby my factotum had been twice screwed up in his coffin he gave the account of it himself  and described that having lain so long in the cold had given him ever since such a pain in his bones that  as hamlet says  mine ached to think on it he had had from his cradle a lethargic habit and the first time he was supposed to be dead he laid in a profound sleep for several days the second time longer but  being aware of the probable consequence of nailing him up too soon  they kept him till they were convinced he was actually dead and having screwed him up  being nearly suffocated  he knocked as before and was let out his senses were considerably impaired after this  yet as far as they went they were so acute and collected that he never made a single blunder in all the messages i gave him though human calamities are the last subject on which i should choose to be facetious yet i cannot here refrain from recording an anecdote  but little known  of the cibber this strange eccentric wag in company with three other bon vivants made an excursion to france the had a false set of teeth  a second a glasseye  a third a cork leg  but the fourth had nothing particular except a remarkable way of shaking his head they traveled in a post coach  and while they were going the first stage  after each had made merry with his neighbors infirmity  they agreed that at every baiting place they would all affect the same singularity when they came to breakfast they were all to squint  and as the countrymen stood gaping round when they first alighted od rot it cried one how that man squints why dom thee says a second here be another squinting fellow the third was thought to be a better squinter than the other two and the fourth better than all the rest in short language cannot express how admirably they squinted  for they went one degree beyond the superlative at dinner they all appeared to have cork legs and their stumping about made more diversion than they had done at breakfast at tea they were all deaf but at supper  which was at the ship at dover  each man reassumed his character the better to play his part in a farce they had concerted among them when they were ready to go to bed cibber called out to the waiter  here you fellow  take out my teeth teeth sir said the man ay teeth sir unscrew that wire and you will find they will all come out together after some hesitation the man did as he was ordered this was no sooner performed than a second called out here you  take out my eye lord sir said the waiter your eye yes my eye come here you stupid dog  pull up that eyelid and it will come out as easy as possible this done a third cried out here you rascal  take off my leg this he did with less reluctance being before apprized that it was cork and also conceived that it would be his last job he was however mistaken the fourth watched his opportunity and while the poor frightened waiter was surveying with a rueful countetenance the eye teeth and leg laying upon the table  cried out in a frightful hollow voice come here sir  take off my head turning round and seeing the mans head shaking like that of a mandarine upon a chimney piece he darted out of the room  and after tumbling headlong down stairs he ran about the house swearing that the gentlemen up stairs were certainly all devils  this is a proper place to notice that at worcester a madman took a great liking to me he is perfectly harmless and suffered to go to all their public entertainments he promised to subscribe five thousand pounds toward building me a room and said mr pit would repay him out of the overplus after saving the million a year i should not have mentioned this man but for one circumstance he calls himself sir edward mason knight of the poker  carrying a large one constantly in his button hole  and has badges of distinction sewed all over his clothes asking him how he came by a fine star upon his sleeve  sir said he the king of prussia  the king of prussia  last battle  mark of honour  he and i  fought the whole army  killed conquered and plundered  tied the commander to a tree  robbed him of forty thousand pounds  and his watch thus how naturally he consolidated the characters of warrior and thief     having been on a flat sandy soil ever since we left shropshire we began to look about us in our way to nottingham  where there are certainly many picturesque views  and for people not just come  as we were  from the borders of wales  for i affronted a welsh waiter in monmouthshire by asking him if we might not call ourselves in wales  to which he answered  cot pless hur and luff hur to be sure it is waales but it is not welsh waales look you nottingham castle is a very handsome object and the uniformity of the piazza in the marketplace gave me an idea of its being a very likely town for my purpose  but i was born to bear and laugh at disappointments  as you shall hear  we are told that nottingham was by the saxons called snottingham upon which word one might so pun as to make it truly describe the inhabitants for they are a kind of mucus which though useful in the general work of commercial circulation cannot avoid being in itself nasty  after having consulted with master burbage the printer i thought it necessary to see mr mayor who passed by the shop door as we were talking and at burbages desire walked in i do not recollect the gentlemans name  but having told him my business he exclaimed niow you actor man what would you hay i hope you dont coom with any drooms and troompets what sir said little burbage drums and trumpets mr dibdin with drums and trumpets good god mr mayor sir  why sir  drums and trumpets  do you know the price is halfacrown  you dont know mr dibdin  how could you  lord have mercy mr mayor  drums and trumpets well well well well  cried the mayor i do not know about these things but i dont want a hooboob in the tiown will you onswer that it wawnt corrupt the morals of the prentices and the work folk burbage undertook for me  but not till he had completely gone over the business of the drums and trumpets once more  after mr mayor had retired  quite satisfied no doubt with having shown his consequence and great regard to the morals of the snottinghamites  i enquired of my friend little burbage how the taste of the town stood in relation to entertainments and he very honestly told me that if i would advertise to swallow pins or eat burning tow i should stand a better chance than by furnishing any thing that appealed to the understandings and liberal feelings of mankind or suppose  said he  you was to let them come in gratis at a shilling apiece i could not possibly conceive what he would be at upon asking him to explain  oh said he the chevalier tailor practiced such a maneuver with wonderful success  he wrote a letter indiscriminately to every inhabitant of nottingham  saying  that he would give a lecture on the eye gratis his room was not only thronged but every lady made a point of dressing herself in her best in return to the chevaliers politeness they were first admitted into an outer room and attended by a kind of master of ceremonies who informed them with great good breeding and deference that as the lecture the chevalier meant to give was very abstruse and could not possibly be rendered familiar to the comprehension of such as did not anatomically understand optics  his employer the chevalier had with great condescension and good nature caused a book to be printed which would clearly explain the most difficult passages of the lecture even to the meanest understanding that indeed this book was worth half a crown  but the chevalier determined in all things to show his candor and disinterestedness  would have the very great kindness to sell it at no more than one shilling some few murmured but the major part bought the book and thus the crafty chevalier put in his pocket about five hundred shillings through an impudent stratagem when by the common mode of advertising two shillings admittance he would have been a fortnight receiving five pounds god said little burbage  for he is a talkative goodnatured fellow  ill tell you another story of the chevalier he bespoke a wig sir  a tie wig  of a poor harmless fellow  a barber here in our good town of nottingham  and went away to loughborough without it it happened to be market day  i had some business at loughborough and i sees a fellow stalking along with a devilish great bandbox under his arm i thought i knew him  and who should it be but our barber  shaves me  makes my wigs all he is angry at is  that i wear my red cap so long in a morning that i make one wig serve the time of three well sir who the devil are you looking for says i why says he the chevalier tailor  the poor dear gentleman forgot his wig good lack and you have been so civil to tramp with it sixteen miles after him very kind indeed well but master burbage twas worth while  a deal of money to make short of the story to you sir the barber carries the wig to the chevalier what do you call this says the occulist a wig sir says the barber a wig why it is no more like a wig than a cabbage the hair is frizzled and crampt and hedgehoggd and porcupind  oh take it away in short after having so abused it that he almost persuaded the barber to be out of conceit with it himself  he offered about a fourth for it of what they originally agreed for and at length the poor shaver  rather than carry back a wig that would suit nobody else  received the money and they parted thus was the chevalier collectively and individually too cunning for the fraternity of stocking weavers i could not however buckle to any thing that carried with it the face of an imposition and therefore thought but little of my chance as however i had incurred some expense i resolved to perform  but so determined were they  this time  not to be tricked that if i had not actually held out a maneuver  though a very honest one  i should have made nothing of nottingham so much had they the old proverb with them  adieu yours very faithfully c dibdin leeds february          letter xxxi on incredulity  i pray you think you reason with a jew to the rev mr  dear sir the old contemptible business of supposing me an impostor was brought up at nottingham the report had gone out and one wise gentleman assured me that he had seen mr dibdin in a black wig three years before at the circus finding matters were taking an unpleasant turn i advertised that  as i understood such a rumor had prevailed and as it was a very serious thing for me that it should be cleared up  if any at the end of the entertainment should feel the smallest difficulty to believe that i was in no respect an impostor their money should be returned this brought me a good room and ten minutes had not passed before i plainly saw all their doubts were vanished at the place i generally pause many apologies were made me to which some spirited officers present answered that the best thing they could possibly do was to be totally silent for the utmost in their power to say would rather aggravate than lessen the absurdity of their conduct i introduced upon this occasion in the readings what follows the poet related a whimsical distress he had once labored under said he i once took it in my head to deliver a little entertainment at different places which i called readings  and being possessed of good professional reputation it was sometimes suspected that a man of my standing would not think such an experiment worth his while  and in consequence i was now and then treated as an impostor for  as one may say  personating myself this induced me to relate to my next audience the following poetic tale in rome where arts spring up it is said as spawn shoots in a mushroom bed  two theaters of some renown aspired alike to please the town both  on the plan of ours in london  were sometimes rich and sometimes undone were sometimes empty  sometimes crammed  and praised and censured  puffed and damned alike their fortune and their fame till as we hear one roscius came at a high salary engaged the wondering town to see him raged actor did never such numbers draw  for was his part to kick a straw or frown his fearful monarchs dead or dance  or stand upon his head  fame spoke him the theatric king and all the world came in a string what can be done  said the other house we play  but dont receive a souse our last new thing no soul would sit it cried a performer  zounds i have hit it the rage is now to hear this prig take off the squeaking of a pig let us stick up in large black letter that we can do the pig  much better so said so done  the bills are stuck the town with consternation struck better than roscius insolent but it is a step they may repent the night arrived  and in a swarm the audience thronged  a boding storm hung hovering on each sullen brow  the house is still as death  and now while fearful preparations making the humble actor comes on quaking  thrice low he bows  then silence breaking instant the audience hear a squeaking but what is heard next  groan hiss and scoff the stunning catcal  off  off  off noise follows noise  shout echos shout and all the ladies are turned out at length by dint of right ability patience  mild gesture  and humility after an hours stout

say that aping elf squeaks better than the pig himself this said  he takes to crown the joke a pig from underneath his cloak but he had better saved the trouble the clamor instantly was double sconces were broke  benches pulled down and planetstruck throughout the town wailing ran routed kings and queens while in a bonfire blazed the scenes to men who will persist in error say who shall dare to hold a mirror from honest common sense and reason all arguments were out of season and while the frenzy rages high fair truth itself shall seem a lie from selfconviction then be wise  the tasks not hard  believe your eyes    i thought my business was now to make an honorable retreat which i did having previously agreed  with the only gentleman who paid me any thing like attention  to return in the month of november when it was imagined they would think i did them a favor and consequently make up for their former neglect whether this was a reasonable conjecture or not will appear in due time  on the following thursday we arrived at that pretty clean town newark i made some enquiries concerning the place and found little prospect of performing to advantage therefore after dining at the kingstons arms  the history of which house i shall give in its place  on the best cutlets that ever were eaten we extended our journey to lincoln where we put up at the rein deer  i could make nothing at all of this place every thing seemed so grave and inanimate that i conceived it would be a great folly to stay this resolution was accelerated by finding that the corporation was in a sort of demur about the propriety of my performance i might however have been assured that every thing was perfectly safe when they sent a message by the waiter to invite me to supper i nevertheless excused myself and though the mayor told me i might act whenever i pleased we left lincoln passed through spital brigg and barton and arrived in the afternoon  after a very good passage across the humber  at hull  here i was to be introduced to a gentleman who could give me every possible accommodation for my entertainment and on my friends account was to do this gratis according to custom however i was to be disappointed this gentleman was then in london nor did he arrive in time to do me any material service so that this part of the world  which i expected would do such great things  failed nor could i in four nights at hull and three at beverly muster more than my expenses  in my next letter i shall carry you a longer circuit to as little purpose all which loose matter i shall bring to an end as soon as possible that i may not tire either you or my readers in general with repeated ill success  upon which indeed i should be silent if i did not conceive it my duty to set down every thing as to the men of nottingham i made up my mind to their incredulity as firmly as antonio did to the arguments of shylock which had not more of cruelty than the declaration i now make you  has of kindness  that i am  most heartily yours c dibdin newcastle feb          letter xxxii a long dance without a fiddle  for this among the rest i was ordained to the rev mr  dear sir at hull my friend left me with a view  as his affairs in town pressed his return  to prosecute the remainder of his journey with more expedition than my scheme would permit from hull i went to york where i performed by way of essay without mentioning any specific time i was tolerably attended and a gentleman  in the name of the rest  advised me as the oratorios at doncaster were to be in the following week not to do any thing more at york till they should be over i took his advice and went to malton and scarborough at the first place i received many promises which as they were made by the parson and the attorney it is not wonderful that they came to nothing at scarborough nobody would stir without the duchess of rutland and as i had neither time nor interest to conciliate her patronage i returned with my jaunt for my pains at my next essay at york the company were to be sure returned from doncaster  but they were not recovered from their fatigue i therefore  to give them a little more breathing time  was coaxed into another excursion and promised great things on my return  my intention was to have a few nights alternately at leeds and wakefield having however a very thin audience indeed at the first place and being out of temper with york i went by the advice of a clergyman at wakefield  in whose company i had the pleasure of passing some happy hours  to sheffield having however very little time to spare  this being the fifteenth of october and my advertisements standing for the eighteenth at york i performed two nights  one of which was a very decent one  and received so much private and public civility that i promised when the players should be gone  which was not expected to be till after christmas  to return coming back to wakefield i had a third night which was a very good one at sheffield i met with dr miller of doncaster and mr f sharp of grantham both of whom gave me warm invitations to their respective towns which you will find in the sequel i accepted  i shall not say a word at present of these different places  having to touch at them again  not even of york to which i returned to worse purpose than ever and left it in disgust from thence i went to beverly to call a council of war with my friend southern to whom i shall introduce the reader this gentleman has the whole business of hull and beverly as a dancing master  a character not always worthy a conspicuous situation  but here and in the instance of mr southerns son at wakefield  who i could not place before his father  remarkably so  mr southern is no foreign impostor of which description  to the disgrace of our schools the injury of the scholars morals and too often the destruction of family peace  this kingdom swarms i must confess i never feel any thing like satisfaction at the distress of others except when these frontless gentlemen meet with men as crafty as themselves there are instances however when foreigners are as much imposed on in england as englishmen are in france  and the following is one of them fierville who wallowing in english riches did not  like his countrymen in general  retire and laugh at his patrons but gave into every extravagant folly he could devise had among the rest a menagerie and would give any sum for extraordinary objects to fill it this a certain dealer in wild beasts and foreign birds  not far from the top of the haymarket  hearing he demined to make something out of fierville for this purpose he called one day at his country house  accompanied by a man with a large basket  and desired to speak with him being shown in he accosted fierville  servant sir hearing as how you was a gemmen worry fond of curiosities i have brought you two of the most beautifulest birds in the whole world i am very glad to see you sare said fierville vill you please to tell me vat it is why you must know sir i have had a lord or two after them and several fine ladies and i believe one duchess  but i loves the foreign gentlemen do you see by reason all my goods come from abroad  and so sir i had rather you should have these pink geese of mine than another pig geese god bleash me i was never hear of pig geese why no please your honor sir  they bent a

cows and a calf under the window i will take they for the geese fierville who was in deep contemplation on the beauties of his new acquisition exclaimed pless my soul well tought  you shall have them here chon go kif that gentleman dat koes and de kofe in short the man drove away the cows and the calf and left the pink geese behind which were deposited in an outhouse till a proper place could be prepared for them the next morning a friend of fierville  a blunt honest fellow  came to visit him on whom he opened immediately  ah my teer friend i haf de most crate curiosity ever was see do you know i have cot two very fine pig geese  big geese cried the other so have i twenty what the devil curiosity is there in that no no you dont understand  fine color ret peautiful come along vid me he then took his friend to the outhouse which having carelessly been lest open the geese had made their escape after a close search for some time they found them feeding in an adjoining paddock but it having rained in the night the pink geese were become as gray as a badger  and nothing could have discovered they were the same but now and then a little red spot under the wings why damme cried the friend you have been imposed upon  these are nothing but a couple of common gray lincolnshire fen geese by cot said fierville he vas ferry fine ret indeet last night hole your tongue perhaps by um by he come ret again red again said the friend why you are a damned fool  the fellow has imposed upon you i tell you what did you give pray for this pretty bargain two koes and a kofe after reprobating fiervilles credulity in pretty strong terms his anger all turned on the bird merchant who he swore should smart for this impudent fraud to put his design in execution he went immediately to him and having threatened to take him before sir sampson wright procured a restitution of fourteen pounds  the sum for which it was pretended the cows and calf were sold  there is another anecdote of this same monstermonger  he sold to a lady of distinction a number of what he called java sparrows which were of course no more than common english sparrows stained a fine blue at the time of their moulting they became exactly like other sparrows when being sent for and taxed with the imposition he had the address to make it believed that it was the climate and the common food of birds in this country that made them degenerate and that if they were carried back to java they would infallibly recover their former beauty   he is an honest plain unaffected wellmeaning man  is a father himself  has brought up a large family creditably and industriously and therefore proper to have the care of youth entrusted to him he is universally beloved and his company  for he is remarkably cheerful and hearty  every where courted his advice and his influence has been of great use to me for there is scarcely a place in yorkshire since i first left beverly where his name has not done me service  my journey to beverly  as i before remarked  was more for a consultati on than from any prospect of success mr southern however had  previous to my arrival  consulted with all the principal people and i was to be invited as soon as i came to a supper in order to form the best possible plan for making me two good nights out of nineteen however who attended the supper but four came to the performance i must not neglect to say that mr acklum mr harden then the mayor and some few others merit my acknowledgments for their attention but as to the rest they had skimmed the cream of the entertainment for nothing and how could i be such an idiot as to suppose they would afterward be contented to pay for the skimmilk but  for this among the rest i was ordained  and so i was to tell you very frequently but always truly that i am  yours most fervently c dibdin newcastle february          letter xxxiii the solicitude of a friend  i should not call you scoundrel if i did not love you to mr dibdin dear

that you have smiled at let what might be the consideration the nasty snottinghamites alone would have sickened me to such a degree that when i appeared before them it would have given me all the qualmishness and have produced all the effect of an emetic and yet you promised to return it will disappoint me and  though i warmly wish you well  displease me if it produce any advantage to you  what shall i call you that you are susceptible  quickly vividly so  i am convinced and yet where sensibility might laudably honestly take fire you exhibit a stoicism beyond all example i cannot comprehend you i have traced you now since you first corresponded with me nearly fourteen hundred miles what to do it is impossible it can have been worth your while can the conversation and attention of a few individuals of taste and discernment approach any thing near to an amends for all the contumely heaped on you by the suspicions of a set of people who have placed you in every unpleasant point of view and who believe nothing but that you levy contributions among them have i not myself seen doubts and difficulties started in every corner of the room nods winks and shrugs have gone round and when at last in spite of their teeth they have been obliged to confess their suspicions were invidious and unhandsome their selfconviction has put them so out of humor with themselves and the tardy lagging justice came out in so reluctant a concession that they seemed to wish you had been proved an impostor rather than that their own ignorant and illiberal suspipicions should be falsified  if you restrain your real feelings to teach you patience give you fortitude and brace your mind to an endurance and make it up to all the consequences of your intended voyage you must have a philosophic heroism but little known and less practiced in which case  and indeed in any case  i now give you leave to go to india where a small part of this perseverance  i should think  must enable you to return in comfort and enjoy years of happiness sweetened with independence which desirable situation no man more truly wishes to see you in than  my dear sir your faithful and obliged friend  feb          letter xxxiv the duty of a public man  fames an echo to the rev mr  dear sir your last letter is so pointed that i shall stop short my narrative to answer it and that the world may be in better possession of the subject i have a printed proof of it before me  you have taken more pains to abuse me than i have to deserve it and i could silence all that warmth and vivacity in which you calumniate me under the title of a susceptible stoic by singly asserting that i am a public character good god say you  so am i have patience you can dictate to your audience you can win them by honest and fair persuasion to a discharge of that duly without the exercise of which they can neither be good men nor valuable citizens but  admirable as your doctrines are  do you think no pulpit oration of yours has been criticized did you never see a guttling alderman asleep  while some fortune hunter was making love to his daughter  in one of your very best sermons when you have strove with benevolent mildness to inculcate the principles of reasonable religion and blend public worship with private morality were you upon your honor never blamed for tameness and insipidity and censured for not frightening your hearers into a sense of their miserable sinful condition by lowering out damnation with uplifted hands  a field preacher is not fairly inducted into his calling till he has been forty times stunned with brick bats and blind puppies but this is nothing to what is every day sustained by men in much more conspicuous situations than you or i is mr foxs poisoned bag forgot the difficulty with which mr pit made his escape from the grocers company or the dingy appearance of lord john cavendish after he had been rolled in the kennel at york beside these matters fluctuate what is a mark of disgrace at one time shall at another be a badge of honor and it has been often seen that a man who has been pelted with dead cats today  by the hands of the mob  has

remain among them   show me the most fulsome puff you ever saw to prop a sinking play or recommend a faded actress and i will show you an advertisement from a parliamentary candidate to match it how completely has churchill written a lampoon on himself in the conference i think it is the paragraph which begins with that nonsensical distich may i  can greater ill mankind befall  be born a whitehead and baptized a paul   he goes on enumerating what in his idea contains the sum total of opprobrium and obloquy and finishes with saying  that the friendship of one wilkes will make  amends for all in another place  and i believe another poem  he pants for fame and fondly fancies that some one straying in the churchyard where he lies buried shall read his works over his grave by way of epitaph no bad stroke of vanity by the bye for the manly churchill but how would his dust feel if the gentleman by accident should hit upon  the above quotation  every man has his motives for his public conduct mine are  notwithstanding the conjectures of a few unbelieving individuals  neither more nor less than those i announce i will be free to acknowledge that in the prosecution of my scheme i have met with sore disappointments but these are the very spurs the very incentives to a further pursuit if i had retired upon meeting a rebuff or two what would have been the conclusion of my enemies this man fondly fancied himself a favorite of the public but they have convinced him they do not care threepence about him having persisted they will see that it has procured me such friends as will silence the tongue of envy and blunt the poisoned arrows of malignity if churchill gloried in his wilkes what must i do when i can name more than twenty who really possess those valuable mental requisites which in his favorite he doatingly fancied the firm attachment and persevering kindness of that gentleman alone who made with me a circuit of more than seven hundred miles  first left me at hull and afterward took his final leave at york  is more than enough to compensate for all the arrogance ignorance and empty consequence that have disgraced those who could not distinguish between a fair and liberal compact with the public and the dirty impudence of a depredating itinerant it is true i did not acquire this gentlemans friendship in consequence of my tour i have possessed that pleasure for some years but it confirmed and strengthened it so many mortifications has he been witness to and so much has he pitied and commended me for a temporary perseverance  as the foundation of ultimate independence  that i am sure i have secured his valuable esteem upon so firm and permanent a basis that nothing can shake it let me here assure him that the many and handsome instances of broad and generous liberality that i have repeatedly received both at the hands of his father and himself neither time nor distance shall erase from my memory and that i never employed any moment to more grateful or pleasurable advantage than that when i have endeavored to promote their interest which after all is but a mutual obligation between them and the public many other very marking traits of friendship and attention you have already seen and many more are to come among which i cannot help noticing the kindness of a small number in london where i protest i began to fear i had scarcely a friend the many struggles i have there made to enfranchise myself from the shackles of dependence  the general hurtful falacious opinion that i have often had fortune in my power but have wantonly and prodigally spurned the courteous benefit the truth of this will he seen by an estimate of my pieces which having explained to a friend he assured me he thought it an information of a most important nature to the public laid so firm a foundation for the dexterous exertions of slander that like the mutilated picture of praxitiles i conceived myself in london  where any mans fame can be murdered with impunity  to have been all one blot happily however through the filth and dirtiness of all the malice sputtered out by irritated dullness and bursting envy a chosen few have been able to discern the neglected condition of an inoffensive traveller and  like the good samaritan opened their hearts to a sense of his ill treatment not that i mean to paint my case as a deplorable one no pride and my good spirits forbid it but there is  as i have remarked before  something for me so winning so warm so exhilirating in spontaneous goodnature that i receive from it the same cheering and invigorating ray of genial comfort that a plant imbibes from the cherishing influence of the sun i shall hereafter particularize some of the instances to which i here only allude and will conclude this letter while my heart is full of the kindness of my friend and fellowtraveller above with saying that though i consider fame as an echo and  as much as shakespeare  hold it ridiculous to seek the bubble reputation in the cannons month yet i hope demeaning myself with proper humility as a public character will not render me unfit for the duties of private friendship or induce me to make an ill use of fortune should it ever be in my power those will best command who know how to obey is an established maxim and i believe the best command and obedience within the exercise of the human mind is a peremptory subduction of all feelings but those which tend to the expansion of the heart and promote the wide and benevolent circulation of universal liberality and an implicit submission to all those moral duties which soften the manners humanize the soul and impel us to beneficent acts of general fraternal kindness that can alone dignify reason and lift us into manly preeminence  adieu yours ever and truly though indeed one implies the other c dibdin newcastle february          letter xxxv a storm in a duckpond  blow winds and burst your cheeks to the rev mr  dear sir having pretty well  i hope  quieted your scruples in my last letter i shall now proceed in my narrative which  like the man with a black and white coat in the masquerade  sometimes presents you with one color and sometimes another you have seen the black side too much i confess but in future the white will be predominant i have men to introduce you to who will convince you that honesthearted liberality is not extinct  but they are stars that can shine without any borrowed luster and therefore let them come in their place  at beverly i first issued my proposals for printing this work after which  taking one night at hull  i passed on to lincoln where my friend southern was told  on his return from london  they would be glad to see me on the fourth of november  falling on a sunday and being exactly ninetynine years since the memorable revolution  the wind being almost due south very strong and squally accompanied with a severe and incessant rain i set sail from hull to barton nor is all this preparation unworthy the occasion i am sure i shall endure nothing in my voyage to india that will exceed what i then experienced for if it did we should be all past endurance anson it is said was in the same situation and was heard to exclaim that he feared after having been safely round the world it was his fate to be drowned in a fish pond but he escaped and so did i which i believe is all we can either of us say but to proceed  as we were getting out of the harbor a man fell overboard from a brig which lay very near us and disagreeable as the weather was three or four boats hastened immediately to his assistance but will it be believed that when they found he was an exciseman it was with the utmost difficulty they could be prevailed upon to afford him relief i declare to god i never felt so wretchedly in my life that private piques between admirals and generals should restrain their public exertions and so tarnish the glory of nations one does not wonder at that a judge should recommend a jury to find a man guilty rather than break through an established etiquette or lose his dinner that the ax should now and then be poised and the halter frequently stretched and the executioner glory in his dexterity that a merciless attorney for the sake of thirteen and fourpence should coolly advise his client to ruin a whole family none of these surpise one but that a set of wretches should mock the agony of an expiring fellow creature  merely because he was discharging a disagreeable office by the kings authority  is a wanton cruelty so unnecessary and so disgraceful that i sincerely hope it never was practiced before nor will ever again the poor exciseman through much earnest persuasion was lodged safely in one of the boats and i had the pleasure before we got out of the harbor to see him standing upright at first however he seemed quite gone damme the excisemans dead  cried one  so much the better  cried another  he is gone to his father the devil then no no  said another  he stirs he is only drunk ay ay  said a genteel man on board our sloop  he could not help tasting he has been gauging you see the good liquor below ha ha ha  the dogs always drink more than they measure many more things were said equally smart and equally humane for my part i thought i should stand but little chance by mixing in the conversation  not having wit enough to make calamity a subject of merriment or stupidity to curb what would have been as impracticable a task as commanding the wind to be still which was then whistling in my ear this nation pretty well knows that there are no people under the sun possess such consummate subtlety as the italians  a man whose name is grimani after he had been in england about a month happened  as he was strolling about  to find himself near billingsgate  seeing him a foreigner he was presently hustled about and in short the fishwomen and watermen determined to give him what they called a complete blackguarding  grimani  who scarcely understood a word of english  hearing the word damn frequently used  was struck as quick as lightening with an idea that he should conquer them with their own weapons  he thought he had nothing to do but think of a number of names unknown to the mob  and therefore began  damn cicero  damn plutarch  damn aristotole  damn demosthenes  damn plato  damn anaxageras  damn scipio  damn hannibal  damn damn agamemnon  damn damn achilles  and thus he went on with extreme volubility throwing his muscles  which was a pretty easy thing to do  into the most frightful contortions till at length one of the mob cried out damme come along jack we stand no chance with this fellow he blackguards ten times better than any one of us i therefore contented myself with seeing the gasping object of their pleasantry return to life and when that event was established sneaked into a corner of the cabin to ruminate  the first thing that struck my attention was a dispute between the sailors whether they should take in two or three reefs in the mainsail and foresail the majority however  being two to one for our ships company consisted of no more than three  was in favor of the two reefs and presently we were a mile from land it now blew and rained very hard and three sailors who happened to be passengers came down into the cabin they were asked by the rest many questions  for an universal terror had began to prevail  and they all agreed that we carried too much sail but refused to interfere  for they were not afraid of weather  beside it was no concern of theirs the dissentient voice upon deck was continually heard to exclaim dont you see what short seas she ships damme my lads but you will repent not taking in another reef the other two swore she could carry every thing that was set and declared there was not a cap full of wind while the first as confidently affirmed it blew like the devil for my part i always think that if those who manage the ship do not feel themselves in danger i have no right to fancy i am but here being evidently a difference of opinion and the squalls so frequent strong and sudden i own i began to think with the sailors below that there was certainly a chance of our being capsized  and this i had more opportunity to reflect upon than the rest being the only one out of more than forty passengers  two of the sailors excepted  not seasick which i have in some moments since lamented  for it has lost me a fine occasion to describe in imitation of mr baretti all the various effects of that important and very delicate embellishment to the observations of a traveller though upon second thoughts i have been consoled with the reflection that it might have tainted my style in all the rest of my narrative and made it  like his  as tasteless as warm water  after our poor little sloop had been buffetted three hours and forty minutes during which she above a hundred times as fairly dived as ever did a duck our sailors were so kind to run us aground at the mouth of barton harbor  the tide however still continuing to flow we were soon got off and at length arrived at which time the sailors who managed the vessel were not one whit drier than the poor halfdrowned exciseman  being safely moored a long side of a cold ham i left care once more to the winds congratulating myself that there were yet some desirable considerations for which one would wish to live one of which has since turned out to be the enjoyment of that kindness you are pleased to afford to  your obliged and faithful humble servant c dibdin newcastle feb  0       letter xxxvi a touch of the forecastle  that such an oystershell should hold a pearl to the rev mr  dear sir in the coach which carried me from barton to lincoln were two of those sailors who came passengers and who had been sent from london to hull and now were returning back to london in search of a little prizemoney which had been due to them ever since the last war they said they did not know how such things came about but it had always been the way to send poor fellows  who earned their little at the risk of their lives  from agent to agent till what they received was not worth having to be sure they might have saved their journey but they thought it was better to see into it themselves than trust their affairs in the hands of those landsharks the lawyers when sir elijah impey was on his passage from india he continually kept in the cabin from indisposition while her ladyship was in very good health and constantly on deck one fine day she coaxed him out to enjoy a little air and as he was walking the deck  it having blowed pretty hard the preceding day  a shark was playing by the side of the ship having never seen such an object before he called to one of the sailors to tell him what it was being asked the question  why dont you know an please your honor said honest jack no  said sir elijah  what is the name of it why  replied the tar  i dont know what name they hail em by ashore but here we call em sea lawyers that there was something wrong but they hoped one day or other every thing would be righted for they were sure when his majesty  god bless him  came to know how the poor honest fellows were served who manned his woodenwalls some of the understrappers would get a salt eel  this was one instance out of a great many in which i have had opportunity to notice the strong intellectual feelings of sailors they are honest and liberal to a proverb and it has been remarked that public depredators who have gone to church to pick pockets have been converted into good citizens on the forecastle of a man of war a friend of mine says their honesty and good sense are fully accounted for by considering that they have very little commerce with mankind owing to this they despise money and therefore have no inducement to become knaves and as their wants are few and those soon supplied they have no occasion to rack imagination to keep up a constant deception in their words and actions thus their ideas go immediately to the point they want to express and their tongues transmit those ideas faithfully and without embellishment  i must do my friend the justice to confess that he gives us here a very ingenious argument and for so very extensive a theme as pithy a one as any of those for which the sailors receive from him such warm encomiums it is certain honestly and good sense are very congenial and i should sooner suspect that an argument which threw out a strong and brilliant display of logical and rhetorical figures was calculated to disguise rather than ornament the truth i have certainly in the course of an hour heard a sailor utter as many good things  and i am sure with as little affectation  as dr johnson nor do their technical allusions rob what they say of its beauty the character of kit keel in the touchstone came with me  on my return to england  in the coach from dover to rochester his real name is sprat and he is a pilot at harwich  the words i there set down he uttered and can there be any thing more striking than  money was made for our friends and the landlords along ashore or again my moneys my friends my heart my wifes and my life my countrys  my name is sprat which he really said and that is my way of thinking i declare i never witnessed a greater fund of wit than that he possessed in my life speaking of fashions  said he  i will tell you what before i went my last voyage my pol do you see stowed every thing snug the hatches were properly battened down sail set modesty used sparingly decently reefed nothing shook in the wind and there was enough spare canvass in the old chest in case of weather when i came home  only an eighteen months voyage  damme if i did not think i had got among the wanghees or some lubberly outlandish place where they dress themselves up in feathers  there they were  sprit sails and studding sails  every thing set they could carry and more to  i say  i expected to see them every minute bottom upwards well thinks i to myself this will not he the case with my pol  would you believe it  shiver my jib if pol was not as bad as the best of em you see before i sailed i could take her little tight head tuck it under my arm and give her a hearty smack  now damme every time i went to salute her i stuck my eyes full of black pins a ship is a glorious epitome of the world and its management is the strongest instance of ingenuity that human invention has furnished us  with these sailors in the coach i held some conversation concerning our narrow escape  for they assured me it might be so called  and they said it arose from this the men who in conduct those passage boats are in general tolerable pilots but bad sailors they said this i might have noticed not only by their neglecting to take in more than two reefs but keeping the sails continually shivering in the wind  by which means we lay at the mercy of every squall and the vessel had so many different motions that she shipped twice the sea she would have done had they laid her fairly close to the water i mention this the more particularly because i think it will operate as a good caution to all those who draw the conclusion  which i did  that if the people themselves will venture the passengers are in no danger when at the same time we have every day so many instances of peoples losing their lives through foolhardiness not a fortnight after i came from hull there was an account in one of the papers of thirteen people that were lost in crossing the severn   the journey to lincoln having been in proportion as disagreeable as the passage to barton i was glad after a slight supper to get to bed  where the whole night i was tossing about in the humber nor could i believe i was really in an inn when i awakened for never were those lines in hudibras more applicable  on a sudden by a huge clamor and a loud one as if all sorts of noise had been collected into one loud din or that a member to be chosen had got the odds above a thousand and by the greatness of his noise proved fittest for his countrys choice   this noise having awakened me  and i your curiosity  i shall postpone an explanation of it to my next letter being in the interim  yours very faithfully c dibdin newcastle february          letter xxxvii english amusement  can there be any cause in nature  for these hard hearts  to the rev mr  dear sir i lay i am sure half an hour before i could form the most distant conjecture of what this noise could proceed from bells kettles horns hallowing hooping huzzaing by men women and children conveyed to my drowsy fancy a noise more horrible than did the angry billows which lashed the yawning cavern of the six mouthed scylla to the affrighted mariners of ullusses for i will not suppose but that he delighted in the danger  at length by a few oblique words which catched my ear i was let into the secret it was the fifth of november and the mob were carrying about a figure of guy faux which they informed me when i came down to breakfast was a ceremony performed on this day at lincoln with great regularity and solemnity and that there was also to be a bullbaiting at twelve oclock and another at four i enquired particularly where and was told if i wanted places to see it i must be very expeditious for they were not only dear but perhaps all bespoke my answer was that i only asked that i might avoid so disagreeable a sight i received nothing but a contemptuous look for my declaration and was extremely mortified to find that i unfortunately run into the very predicament i was so studious to avoid for though i did not see the bull baited i was by accident so hemmed in that i could not avoid witnessing the miserable lacerated condition of the poor creature afterward  and they were then leading him to where he was to be again baited in the afternoon heavenly god i have heard of savages who have tortured their prisoners and afterward eat them  but i could find something like a motive for this a bull is baited we are told to make him eat tender  let him be hunted then  let him become the fair victim of the chase  let us feel nobly like our ancestors nor degenerate from the brave earl of warwick by cruelly cowardly tying a noble animal to the stake and stimulating a number of peaceful domestic creatures to worry him that human brutes may relish their dinner i am told at stamford they let the bull loose after baiting it  if so i most sincerely hope the next time that event takes place he may toss the first man who sets a dog at him lions tear their prey hyenas betray it  but these are provoked only by the calls of hunger but a wanton unnecessary cruelty  to which there cannot be a possible incentive but savage hardness of heart  is a refinement on brutality reserved alone for the animal of reason and to make the case more lamentable this most contemptible of all unmanly pastimes is the peculiar disgrace of the bravest nation upon earth tom clough  an under strapper for many years at drury lane theater  was the man of all others who had the truest genuine taste for the english amusements a cockfight was his delight  a bullbaiting was to him as delicious a repast as a turtle feast to an alderman  but a hanging match  he called one morning on a friend to accompany him to tyburn  which place he as punctually attended as a hypocritical bigot would a place of devotion  his friend however neither choosing to be waked so early in the morning nor relishing this diversion gave him a good round volly of abuse and sent him away the other giving him a contemptuous look swore he would never speak to him again  for damme said he my maxim is never to have any thing to do but with people of taste  mr cloughs accounts of the conduct of the different cocks as he called them  that he had seen die  would fill a pretty large duodecimo which might not be unaptly called the newgate jest book  when i first came to drury lane theater i used to listen to some of his remarks in the matted room  his doctrine fairly was that thieves in this country are so little checked in their approach to the gallows that they go on methodically professionally step by step till they are what the informers call worth forty pounds and as these principles are inculcated from their infancy they talk as naturally and with as much unconcern of their deathbed at tyhurn as a sailor leaps into that hammock in which he may be sewed up or a sensualist enters between sarsinct sheets to press that mountain of down where he is born to become a prey to the gout or stone  i shall upon a future occasion endeavor to recollect some of his anecdotes  which i truly believe are not exaggerations  the only execution i ever saw in england was at winchester when i was about fourteen years old i declare to heaven i heard one of the poor hardened wretches  not ten minutes before they were turned off  ask a sheepstealer  his companion  if he should like a bit of mutton bannister repeats  or has invented  a very witty thing said by jack ketch as he was tying the halter a culprit asked him if he had any commands to the other world  why said jack not much  i will  only  added he as he adjusted the knot under his left ear   just  trouble you  with a line     i performed at lincoln three nights  the second of which was tolerably well but the first and last miserably bad dr kaye was unfortunately while i stayed but a few hours in town he attended me however and had the goodness to send me afterward a polite invitation which i am sorry i could not accept mr money to whom i am almost wholly indebted for the little company i had gave me proof of as liberal attention as i have any where met with in short i believe through that gentlemans means every body was asked though so very few chose to come in the round of invitations however it would be an unpardonable omission if i neglected to mention the excuse of one gentleman with whom i think i had the honor of riding in the stage coach to newark this gentleman was pressed very hard to go to my entertainment and would have been there he said with great pleasure if there had been no music i hope this gentleman is a bull baiter at length being very closely pressed he said you know my detestation of music and if you will only prevail on mr dibdin to introduce something to abuse it in order to give color to my appearing there i will go with all my heart i hope it will be allowed that this is one of the most curious anecdotes i have yet recorded  i here pay my acknowledgements to mr vaneil to whom my friend southern introduced me by letter for his very kind attention to me both at lincoln and at newark in which he did honor to his friends recommendation and to me particular service  i must endeavor before i leave lincoln to account a little for the capriciousness i experienced there is a high town and a low town and they are as much at variance as the montagues and the capulets thus the place having separate interests and taken aggregately standing upon a very limited circumference and containing but a scanty number of inhabitants it is madness to think of an entertainment there a playhouse at lincoln i should suppose must be in this predicament if it was situate on the hill it must be all boxes  if under the hill all gallery  and if in the midway all pit  and as a playhouse cannot live but by box pit and gallery collectively i should conceive the last place for the drama in this kingdom is lincoln  from lincoln i went to newark where i performed one night to a very thin audience who promised great things if i would return in the course of another week this being in my power i did so and met with no better success upon soliciting lady lincoln however i received a most generous and elegant answer appointing a night and giving me the liberty to make use of her name and lord lincolns this produced me as good a night as i believe the place can afford and manifested one instance  among many i have experienced  that real distinction dignifies itself by easy and amiable affability while all the pride and ostentation of affected consequence  like a deformed figure conspicuously situated  solicits contempt when by a decent conscious humiliation it might command respect but it is the nature of folly to expose itself  i have ever remarked that the crooked women are always the first to go without cloaks the ugliest to expose their faces and those with thick legs are sure to wear short petticoats i am returning to newark when i shall illustrate this and some other positions in the mean time beg your company to nottingham where your warm wishes for my ill success will be fully gratified where little burbage  after receiving a good price for the bills  could not help remarking that it was a damned shabby business but i believe there is no more cause in nature for thick heads than hard hearts  therefore let us blame not those who do not enjoy the pleasures of goodfellowship and sociality equal to ourselves but rather thank providence for giving us the charming enjoyment of that sort of sensation i feel when i tell you i am  yours very truly c dibdin durham february          letter xxxviii a jaunt from post to pillar  promise crammed  you cannot feed capons so to the rev mr  dear sir i thank you for your impromptu  i deserve it and a great deal more on hearing of mr dibdins ill success at nottingham were you mad or bewitched  thus amongst natures worst dregs the effusions of genius to shed  aspiring no higher than sitting of legs how should they know what is fit for the head   but one cannot be always infallible who for instance would have believed that genteel derby should on my return have served me as scurvy a trick as shabby nottingham i had the folly to linger on three nights each of which was to be great things and turned out nothing at all  let me however before i mention the particulars of these matters bring you up  as the sailors say  as to the time and place my first night at newark was on the tenth of november i then went to nottingham had one night proceeded to derby and returned to newark to perform on the seventeenth  then to give opportunity for the night bespoke by lady lincoln i went to grantham and returned to newark for the performance on the twentyfourth  i found derby split into factions in consequence of the establishment of a new assembly the etiquette of which could not be settled to the general satisfaction one lady was desirous of being queen or conductress and this gave offense to the rest thus the partisans of mrs a turned up their noses at the friends of mrs b while mrs c  whose adherents were also numerous  retorted the contempt upon them both and in her turn was saluted with a whole volly of gibes and sarcasms by the staunch abettors of mrs d a decent poet might have picked up something tolerable among them for satires and lampoons how it operated with me is very apparent water and oil  fire and ice  modern music and genius  could not be more inimical than were these parties to each other if i would have performed four times in the day i might have had them all separately but together no consideration upon earth could have induced them to mix one lady certainly did trifle with me in a strange kind of way  but as no longer ago than yesterday i received intelligence that she subscribes for four copies i should hope matters were misrepresented to me for as to her uneasiness lest i should introduce her into my tour  which has also been hinted  i cannot suppose she has any apprehensions on that account to be sure her conduct was a good deal like the ladies at bath she did appoint a time for me when nobody could be there and afterward made me keep a company waiting more than an hour under an idea that she was coming at the head of a large party  and at length sent word that neither they nor her could attend me  though she knew the performance of that night was an additional one in compliment to her  the most curious treatment i met with at derby was from old surly drewry the printer this grossly ignorant man of letters took it into his head  because i thought proper to pay some attention to mr pritchard who was once under him and to whom he cannot have the smallest objection except that he begins very fast to take away his custom  to be offended and the method he took of showing his resentment was to charge halfacrown a hundred for the same sort of bills which he had printed the first time i was there for eighteenpence i really thought an advance of forty per cent even in so trifling a business was worth a remonstrance this was what he wanted he boiled with rage and the truth came out i asked him how he would like to be put in the tour damme said he clap me up in your tower at your peril i told him i always did what i was dared to and here he may perceive i am as good as my word my discovery however has nothing new in it  his overbearing purseproud ignorant consequence are as much known in derby as the accommodating modest and obliging behavior of mr pritchard  the object of his envy  and it will have this operation in proportion as one grows malicious the other will be prosperous i mention this circumstance with some regret as it is the only instance of incivility i have to this day met with from printers to all i am indebted for some kindness to many for much civility and kind attention and to some few for a liberality and friendly solicitude which will ever make the warmest impression on me even little burbage  as far as it consists with a money getting man  i sincerely believe would do any thing to serve me  i returned to newark on friday the twentysixth and took up my abode with honest worthy jemmy wallis who keeps the wing tavern and makes monuments  being at once employed on feasting the living and commemorating the dead nor is he more inadequate to one than the other his cellar is as full of good wine as his head of tasty and neat ornaments but as no man is better beloved or studied to do me more friendly offices so my panegyric even were it twenty times as strong will answer no other purpose than that of doing common justice to a valuable character some indeed may blame me for telling the world of the merits of a man only particularly known at newark  and cry out  what is mr walliss wine to me who shall never drink any of it sir richard steel had his estcourt and why should not i have my wallis no estcourt upon earth ever deserved to be better spoken of the only difference is the two pens are not alike equal to the task which certainly is not an unworthy one for it has drawn from the editor of the spectator  in that nervous touching eulogium which he concludes with saying the pen drops out of his hand  one of the brightest effusions of his genius it is true this beautiful glowing tribute of warm friendship to private worth deplores the death of estcourt while wallis  though every day recording the deceased virtues of others  keeps a state of robust health that seems like a towering elm to defy the depredations of time  the history of my jaunt to grantham  during the preparation for lady lincolns night  was this i took a letter to a gentleman who told me he could do me no manner of service and in particular that he could not be present on the first night of my performance finding however that lord and lady brownlow and some other people of distinction were there he came also but advised me not to have another night till the following week to which i did not consent he however propagated that i did and in consequence nobody attended this gentlemans kind conduct was owing to his being director of the grantham concert and it is evident he feared that if i drew too much company his appearance would be but thin all this mr f sharp can testify for me who was very solicitous to oblige and do me service this nonsense and the arrival of the duke of rutlands corpse sent me back to newark to prepare for the next saturday and set jemmy wallis a cursing the granthamites  from the evening of my performance at the desire of lord and lady lincoln i date the commencement of my itinerant prosperity which  differing from the matter in this letter as widely as earth and air  will be the subject of another and i shall finish it as i do this with complete sincerity by assuring you that i am most faithfully  yours c dibdin durham feb          letter xxxix local matter  to catch the living manners as they rise  and boldly shoot at folly as it flies  to the rev mr  dear sir at grantham on the   d of november i received a letter from mr harris the contents of which i shall defer mentioning till i go over that matter regularly before i left newark for grantham in order to accommodate lord and lady lincoln i made an application respectively to the corporation for use of the assembly room and having obtained leave individually i was astonished to find on my return that collectively they objected to it in consequence of this i found myself unpleasantly situated i was relieved however from my anxiety by mr midgeley who keeps the kingston arms the history of which house in a former letter i promised to give in its place mr midceley offered to let me have his large room gratis and i accepted the offer in consequence of which i fancy he expects to be spoken very well of in this publication and handsomely recommended to the notice of people of fashion whose accommodation  to the great annoyance of stagecoach travelers and bagmen  he very anxiously studies i shall however go no step further than the truth to oblige all the mr midgeleys upon earth and the truth is this when i first passed through newark  as i mention in its place  i ate a dinner remarkably well dressed and in consequence returned to the same house i then found that the landlord had been cook to the princess dowager of wales and that the house was famous for culinary excellence i therefore indulged myself in two or three favorite dishes the merits of which i so loudly chaunted the praise of  having eaten them in perfection in france  that he i suppose fancied me un my lor finding however i was  according to the mayor of nottingham  only an actor man i suppose by what followed he was determined to be revenged of me for being innocently the cause of his paying me a little respect he therefore gave me a miserable bad pair of horses to nottingham one of which fell down and detained me half an hour on the road and though he promised that he would very faithfully take care of any letters that might be directed for me to his house yet he refused some that were brought in my absence which but for the kindness of jemmy wallis i should not  without great difficulty  have received when he found lord and lady lincoln had bespoke a night the tables were turned again and it was impossible with all his consequence to put on a more fulsome show of adulation if he thought this was the way to procure my praise he will find by reading the above how far he succeeded  newark like malton in some degree failed owing to my having imprudently placed my dependence on a parson and a lawyer but in return i became acquainted with another attorney who paid me much attention and without an interested motive i therefore record the circumstance according to my promise as one of those which in all my life  much less during my tour  i have seldom had the good fortune to meet with  on sunday the twentyfifth i arrived at doncaster and that evening paid my respects to dr miller i own i had nohopes of this place and if i had entertained any they would have been baulked  for it was like derby divided into parties each of which seemed determined to deprive itself of its own pleasure rather than not disturb the tranquillity of its neighbor  this instance in country towns of destroying that sociality which they seem so peculiarly situated for the enjoyment of is astonishing some author mentions a circumstance of four persons who were going to the lands end in a stage coach the first twenty miles they all spoke together further on they were the best friends in the world but were content with speaking one at a time presently they all yawned by and by fell asleep and before they parted cordially wished one another at the devil now all this is natural enough these people were never to meet again but the first idea of settling in the country is a sociable neighborhood and as those who are so situated must necessarily be near each other during a number of dull months common policy would induce them one should think to give and receive as much rational pleasure as possible but pride attends every situation in life mrs double tripe the cook looks with contempt on the scullion mrs handy my ladys maid addresses mrs double tripe by the title of good woman mrs cringe the toadeater sneers superciliously at mrs handy while she in her turn is huffed and dinged about by my lady and blamed for putting her out of humor spoiling her complexion and losing her lovers a corporal is as proud of relieving a centinal as a general of commanding an army and a strolling actor is as much a monarch for the time being as the emperor of germany a foolish stagestruck young man ran away from his friends and got among a most low and miserable set of strollers a relation after a time discovered him just as he was going on to the stage in king richard and on reading him a pretty severe lecture on his folly and disobedience received an answer suitable to all the ridiculous consequence and assumed pomp of a mock monarch to which he answered  these are fine lofty words but it is a great pity mr king richard that you could not afford to buy a better pair of shoes the actor looking at his toes which were staring him in the face  without loosing his vivacity  cried out shoes  oh damme shoes are things we kings dont stand upon   at doncaster the ladies of independent fortune had established an assembly and finding on a former occasion they were intruded on by others of inferior distinction they came to a resolution of admitting no tradesman nor any of his family to the assembly this of course gave umbrage to the major part of the place who in return determined to have an assembly apart here for a little time the matter rested and it must have been no unpleasant thing to see the lower house muster numerously when the upper house could get scarcely any members to attend it at length this second assembly began to divide miss latitat the attorneys daughter made mrs friz the barbers wife no return to her curtsey while mrs ptisic the physicians lady sneered at the upstart consequence of miss bumper the innkeepers daughter and wondered that she should have the impudence to precribe rules of good breeding to her a second division was the consequence and a third meeting formed which for distinction was called the checked apron assembly this caprice destroyed every expectation of enjoyment among them their meetings being ill attended  and of course unsociable  instead of answering the desired purpose produced nothing but envy bickering and discord and were a sample of rational manners to be taken from them would give an idea that human creatures were born to plague instead of accommodate each other all this would have been the consequence at newark which lady lincoln very sensibly foreseeing  with an amiable complacency truly noble  headed the assembly and dispensed her favors with so equal a hand that it caused every where an emulation  not to assume false consequence but imitate true greatness diogenes being asked how he could live in a nasty tub when he might bask in the favor of a court replied  it is true i am deprived of the smiles of kings but i dont find the sun is more ashamed of my tub than a palace   yours very truly c dibdin sheffield march         letter xl another clerical character and a thousand musical ones  while in a heap the jarring atoms lay to the rev mr  dear sir i shall trouble you with nothing concerning the entertainment at doncaster which i did but twice  each time to a loss not however to be inconsistent i stick to my assertion that my plan began to brighten up at doncaster the business of the subscription went on pretty fast and i received such good intelligence from wakefield leeds and other places that i could no longer doubt of good success besides doncaster introduced me to the intimacy of dr miller and the countenance of mr drummond who i sincerely hope will not be offended if according to my pursuit of common justice i take the liberty to speak of him it is not however necessary to say much  for when it is known that a clergyman is venerated by his neighborhood  that the poor among his parishioners look up to him as a father  that he is the benefactor of merit  the comforter of the helpless  that born largely to enjoy the promiscuous blessings of life his sole delight is the rational and enchanting pleasures centered in the amiable duties of a husband and a father  and then add that this example of human perfection is no more than twentysix  i believe it will be pretty difficult to advance any thing stronger on the subject i cannot however debar myself the pleasure of relating one circumstance  in corroboration of the above  which happened while i was there the small pox  of a confluent and fatal kind  had raged very violently and was continually sweeping off numbers of the inhabitants  mr drummond having attended several burials determined to stop as much as in his power the progress of this alarming evil preached a sermon full of good sense and strong feeling in favor of inoculation and afterward proclaimed that those who chose to have their children inoculated might do so at his expense so blind however is human folly that but nine applied while i stayed one poor woman being asked why she did not avail herself of mr drummonds goodness answered  i thank god my children are all blessed angels in heaven  i was in the whole a week at doncaster which i passed very happily in the company of dr miller i know no man of more liberal sentiments nor whose studies are applied to more worthy purposes his public letter concerning the musical fund and advice toward the establishment of such an institution in the country is full of generous spirited and sensible remarks and it will do him lasting honor that his plan has already been in some measure adopted his institutes are another proof of his wishes to make his abilities of public use they are a work calculated to reduce the study of music to something like rule in the nature of a grammar and for a first attempt in this way  for he was very conscious that any thing of such a kind would be considered as a dangerous innovation  has great perspicuity and may be made generally serviceable but here i must tell dr miller and the public a secret the masters as they are called fearing their mysteries should be revealed which like the glorious uncertainty of the law is the source of emolument decry this work of his whenever they can and make their scholars believe it is only capable of teaching them a few superficial rules whereas their whole fear is lest it draw aside the veil of imposition and discover that deception by which they contrive to lead on a scholar in the course of two or three years to the knowledge of what they might upon a plain easy simple principle accomplish in a few weeks his elements of thorough bass is another ingenious work he seems to have kept rameau strongly in mind and he could not  tempered with his own observations  have had a better model i am only sorry he did not keep to those useful positions which so dumbfound theorists as they are called  such as maintaining that there is not in the system of harmony any thing more than the common chord and the seventh  since by showing how abstruse resolutions may be made every man will not take the matter upon the ground of its being a severe satire on mere professors but suppose he countenances the introduction of such chords it is certain his book would have tended more to simplify harmony without it but then he would have had all the cavillers in full cry after him  and every man is not obliged to set himself the herculean task of a reformer he therefore gave them two roads which  like those of virtue and vice  one is flowery and the other rugged perhaps he did wisely those who would be pleased with little trouble will choose simplicity for their guide  those who would search and never come to the end of their journey will follow difficulty  i cannot introduce music so well  for i confess to you i mean now to dwell some time on that subject  as by a description of musicians nor musicians as by speaking of the musical fund this institution is too well known to need a statement of its origin rise and progress the newspapers give frequent accounts of the thousands which are continually pouring into its coffers but does any one know what becomes of them is such an institution worthy the benevolent contribution of hundreds and the august patronage of a great powerful  and what is more incomparably more  a good and beneficent monarch which suffers the neglected dust of the matchless arne to lie without a stone to tell where it perishes who can suppress his indignation when he considers that the widow of this great man  old and friendless  applied to this society  so supported so patronized  and went away with the tear of distress on her check started by the language of reproof and what think ye was the excuse for this unfeeling refusal dr arne had been it was true one of the most ancient members of the musical fund he had many years given it countenance and support his oratorios had produced it good benefits and  which one would think was a stronger argument than all the rest  his catches and glees had caused half the drunkenness and disorder that pervaded their convivial meetings when the reckoning was paid out of the stock  but there was a law which subjected any member to a sentence of expulsion if he or she should neglect to subscribe his or her quota for four several times and dr arne having been in ireland and so guilty of this neglect he and his were for ever cut off from any claim to be relieved by the fund  the widow of michael arne applied with as little success there was something in this case whispered about difference of opinion in religion if it be true it can only be said that the best names may be prostituted to the vilest purposes it is curious at any rate to talk of the religious sentiments of musicians harmony in its extensive and universal acceptance is certainly allied to a contemplation of that great and expanded symmetry and grace which so wonderfully qualify and knit together the various contrarieties on the face of nature through the influence of contending elements into one concordant whole  but for the members of the musical fund to draw an inference from the similitude of music to moral or revealed religion  listen to the calls of humanity  or indeed make any use of their stock except to relieve their tools and gratify their own luxurious pleasures  would be a species of harmony beyond their capacity for it is founded in nature it opens to benevolence and modulating through all the fine and exquisite feelings of nice honor and smiling philanthropy it closes in that best of keys  the heart  a consideration of dr millers public letter and a further investigation of this charitable institution shall be the subject of my next after which i shall open my cause in form of nature versus theory the first i take to be the state of music after the chaos and the latter so sweetly described by dryden while in a heap of jarring atoms lay  to which state in the minds of many of its professors have the want of fancy the absence of taste and the dearth of genius again reduced it  far removed from the harmony of the soul and of course from that pleasure with which i repeat so often that i am  most sincerely yours c dibdin sheffield march         letter xli crotchets and quavers  the king should know it to the rev mr  dear sir dr miller addresses himself in his first letter to the noblemen and gentlemen managers of the different festivals in commemoration of handel praying that the musicians in the country as well as those resident in london may be entitled to some relief from that fund which their labors help to accumulate he truly says that charity ought not to be confined to any particular place and urges a variety of strong arguments to support his laudable purpose his second letter is to the directors of the fund itself  whom he advises to admit regular country musicians as members he strenuously appeals to their feelings as men and professors of the same art  instances the numerous charities for whose emolument musicians perform gratis he exclaims unfortunate professors of a noble science unhappy sons of an unnatural parent who while she procures wealth and comfort to others suffers her own children to pine in misery and want  this effort to procure relief for country musicians is however as extravagantly absurd as it is nobly liberal what have the noblemen and gentlemen to do with dispensing the profit of the abbey festivals it is sifted as often as flour and  according to honest joe  it would be wonderful if some of it did not stick by the way i have had very particular opportunity to notice that if nothing else disgraces the kings patronage in the business of the festivals the paltry haggling bargains that are made with the country musicians  and all in the names of these noblemen and gentlemen who know nothing about it  are a scandal to any set of men who boast the smallest pretensions to exercise a liberal profession in short it is  like every thing of that kind  a job and how should it be otherwise instead of placing at the head of it such men as dr hayes and dr burney the power is vested in subordinate musicians who like colonel cockburn never get rid of the black hole the gin and the catoninetails this noble commander because he could not conceal it was continually boasting of his rise from a private man his constant expression was did you ever see me do so and so when i was a private soldier one day in the island of st eustatius as he was reviewing the troops he took notice of a man in the ranks who was very dirty going up to him  said he how dare you appear in that nasty condition  your shirts as black as ink did you ever see me with such a dirty shirt no your honour answered the man to be sure your honor i never did  but then your honor will please to recollect that your honors mother  was a washer woman and these by this appointment are to dictate to men under whose command common policy says they ought to march can any thing therefore be so futile and ineffectual as an attempt to turn such a tide as this  over which these men are the moon and contrive to influence it into that channel where it can ebb and flow at their pleasure  as to the letter to the directors of the fund itself how could a man of dr millers good sense expect to have it noticed will a miser spare a single guinea out of his iron chest to save a life or a drunkard a single drop out of his pint bumper poor men their fund amounts at present but to thirtythree thousand pounds and i declare  though i have had pretty nearly as much to do with the musical tribe as any man  i do not know at this moment any one object who derives a benefit from this charity  these letters however though they could make no impression on that marble to which they were addressed nevertheless roused the resolutions of a few hopeless men who  among a number of others  had been the sport of that ignorant arrogance that distinguishes the horn and kettledrum which make up the factotum of this wisely and honestly conducted institution there is a young man whom from the following circumstance alone i hope to take by the hand in india he was bred to music  but seventeen  and fearing the ill consequences of keeping company with musicians in london he resolved to go abroad  first sending a letter to his father in which were these words the men i am obliged to mix with are so ignorant so envious and so profligate that i dread should i stay among them what might happen to inexperience like mine   mr smart  who keeps a music shop in oxfordstreet and is also a performer  applied to become a member of the musical fund mr smart happens to be one of those very few who are blessed with good intellects and it is not wonderful that he should in his life have differed in opinion from these consequential musical cockburns at the head of the harmonic army there could not be any possibly legitimate reason for getting rid of his application yet dismissed it must be  because why said one if we lets that there feller come among us damme but he will be up to the rig presently as my book is to be read at many places in the country and should not of course be merely calculated for the meridian of london i may as well write to be generally understood i have always thought that there is nothing like making a man tell his own story it is the moment of all others when his heart is most to be seen his habits manners affections and foibles are then so exposed that a tolerably sagacious observer may very easily discover the spot where he is most vulnerable besides it is unfair to rob a mans expressions of any of their brilliancy for these and other reasons equally cogent i shall always endeavor as strongly as possible to place my actors within the mental perception of my readers  in the style however of the ancient drama acting myself the part of a chorus by way of giving a general explanation to all those passages that would otherwise be inexplicable owing to idiom custom profession or locality the instance above is one of the strongest i shall have the necessity to adduce there is a language or lingo in london in the opinion of rhetoricians of a very beautiful kind  for it is entirely figurative  called slang this patter  which is another of its names  is frequently in the mouths of musicians who by imitating the inhabitants of st giless  whence this elegant improvement on the vulgar tongue boasts its origin  in their manners debaucheries and even the compilation of new music adopt also their very mode of expression i will not pretend to say that i shall always make myself perfectly clear but when i find i cannot i shall have for consolation the recollection that one of these st giless birds once so confounded lord mansfield that he was obliged to let him go without being able to gather any thing from his evidence  but then this gentleman was an adept whereas musicians neither in language nor any thing else aspire to more than imitation the trial was concerning some quarrel in the street and the kiddy  the gentlemans slang name  was to give an account of all he knew why said he my lord as i was coming by the corner of the street i stagged the man pray said lord mansfield what is stagging a man  stagging my lord why you see i was down upon him  well but i dont understand down upon him any more than i do stagging him do speak to be understood why you see my lord  and please your lordship  i speaks as well as i can i was up do you see me to all he knew to all he knew i am as much in the dark as ever well then my lord i will tell you how it was aye  now why seeing as how he was a rum kid i was one upon his tibby in short he was sent out of court and was heard in the hall to say to one of his companions that he hud gloriously queered old full bottom at length an idea was suggested  for which the person who started it received the thanks of the meeting  that it being a rule for every proposed member to give in an account of his situation and the state of his family mr smart had certainly produced a paper saying he had a wife and four children but in so doing his intention must have been to impose on the charity for at the very time he delivered in that paper so worded he well knew mrs smart was pregnant of her fifth child it was moved and carried that mr smart had endeavored to get admission as a member of the musical fund by surreptitious means and therefore should never be entitled to any benefit from it  it was after this transaction that dr millers letter got into mr smarts hands he consulted a few others and by dint of a laudable perseverance a new fund is actually established which already consists of a decent sum and has the sanction of many gentlemen of both worldly  as well as professional  rank and consequence  this letter will rouse the charitable musicians more than all the rods with which i mean to tingle them hereafter but i defy them to controvert it dr howard has an hundred times declared that it was an iniquitous business dr burney said some time ago he had washed his hands of them and they will never get over the respectable meeting at the freemasons tavern where their scandalous conduct was so severely reprobated and the new fund so liberally contributed to in short while the living professors of a liberal art are totally discouraged men of real genius will naturally turn their thoughts to something else obliged however to deplore that promotions in science  like those in the army and navy  go not by merit but interest and that in future to aspire to musical preferment you must begin by being a fifer in the guards these are the schools as mrs peachum says which produced so many great men i will venture to say simpson the hautboy player has done more injury to the cause of real genius  to which he was a stranger himself and therefore hated it in all mankind  than all the festivals in commemoration of handel will ever do good i shall give a strong instance of this when i speak of love in the city an opera performed at covent garden theater i do not however pretend to say that the guards have not assisted the cause of music in this country very materially the two parkes forster poor holland and many others are convincing proofs that it is the best nursery for wind instrumental performers in this kingdom but surely these are not to be put in competition with men by means of whose expanded fancy and fine judgment are conceived those delicious sounds which at best they can but utter my whose sensitive faculties revolt when i hear of an imperious kettle drummer chaffering with such a man as dr haves  and out of the thousands received for admission to the festivals  like a huckster haggling for a few pounds  which at last perhaps may go to furnish out the revels of a guard room at the savoy the old women in this country say if any thing is amiss the king should know it if he properly knew this  so graciously benignant are his private virtues so much does he greatly pique himself on being much a man as well as a monarch  that i sincerely believe the words of the sailor would be verified and that somebody would chance to get a salt eel  arm yourself with patience i have dipped into music and you know when i begin i do not easily leave off to show however that i am consistent there are other things i as closely stick to  one of which is my continually assuring you that i am  most sincerely yours c dibdin sheffield march         letter xlii on harmony  from harmony  from heavenly harmony  the universal frame began to the rev mr  dear sir leaving doncaster i went by invitation to wakefield where having some leisure i threw a few loose thoughts on paper concerning music  which can no where come so properly as in this letter  philosophers truly say that even the minutest objects have place on the scale of universal harmony and  spite of voltaires platos demiurgos it is almost unnessary to say i allude to platos dream on general good and evil which having related to his scholars and harrangued them for a considerable time on the subject of it till he and they are tired  one of them yawning cries out and so then i suppose  you awoke  nettles and toads are not without their use but it does not follow that men are to be continually peeping into the holes and corners of nature for objects that cannot possibly satisfy a single sensation but curiosity which even in its gratification will be accompanied with disgust these positions minutely hold good in relation to music discords are said to be the soul of harmony which  if this declaration be admitted  must be according to polonius very unlike wit discords being the very reverse of brevity so much indeed are they the limbs and outward flourishes that one would think they were introduced to bewilder what they ought to elucidate yet fear not ye mere harmonists but i shall allow that discords have their use but dare not to think of them otherwise than as the spiders and hemloc of music or that they are more material to the soul of harmony than those noxious objects to the universal system of nature  speaking to men of common sense i cannot be supposed to address myself to more than one out of twenty musicians nor am i ashamed or afraid of making the declaration no man need be ashamed of telling the truth and for the fear  the whole twenty will respectively believe themselves alluded to by the above exception in which case i shall be thanked rather than blamed for where is the man  a musician especially  who will not chuckle at even an imaginary hit at his neighbor  to express myself less archly and probably more to the point what i am going to say relative to harmony shall or i have lost my aim apply to all men who have understandings be they musicians or not musicians and as it is a subject on which a great deal has been both said and done to very little purpose  as it has opened as far as it goes as many doors to imposition as law or priestcraft and as been as conducive to picking of pockets as a seminary at st giless  i conceive it my duty at least to attempt a reform  if ever term had a positive implication the etymology of the word music is  to please to charm to delight mr heron the critic if he felt what i do at this moment would say  i will spurn at common rules and change  the better to express myself  this substantive music into a verb and conjugate it through all the moods and tenses it is true music may excite horror but then it is a mimic horror which has its delectable effects the ear is the door of the heart  and i will venture to pronounce there is no perfect music but that which is pleasing the demonstration is clear nothing can be perfect that is incomplete mere harmony is incomplete for it is a body to which melody is the soul ergo  mere harmony is not perfect music  the english from their natural goodness of heart take upon hearsay a mans abilities i am no judge  i cannot say i heard any thing striking in such an air  but the man has great reputation and of course his music is good  though i must confess it does not seem to me to be very pleasing let this for ever decide upon such sort of judgment   if a man have a disposition to be pleased with music  though he be totally ignorant of it as a science  if he can point out what air has ever given him real pleasure  which he must be qualified to do if he has heard the beggars opera or comus  if such a man should listen with attention a first a second and a third time to an air and yet cannot feel a delight capable of the clearest explanation  and heaven knows that may easily be now a days  that music deserves to be burnt even though handel were the composer this rule however is liable to some correction original music will never strike at first equal to what it will upon repetition so that original composers  and indeed so do writers  run the most risque care therefore ought to be had to examine whether it is from the style of the music the hearer cannot immediately decide the infallible way however is to hear the air repeatedly  and if at length it catch hold of the heart the trouble is well recompensed by the pleasure it will ever afterward afford  by the same token let not the auditor form a hasty judgment a familiar air jigging upon the ear may be pleasing but it will most probably be stolen in which case it can be entitled only to an illegitimate reputation and  like a present imitation of garrick  though ever so perfect serve only to make us regret that the incomparable original  is no more  any man with an ear and a heart made rather of more penetrable stuff than the gentleman at lincoln may venture to pronounce his opinion on music i do not however mean those carping cavilling critics who as it were take the dimensions of sounds and go about to explain their excellence as methodically as they would to bore a cylinder or weigh air these have ears too but they are like that of dionysius expanded to discover  all the faults  let not therefore any one be deterred from freely giving his sentiments after having consulted his heart harmony is not intended to conceal the beauties of music but to round and perfect them and men may as well talk of a picture without an outline as music without air in short all the labyrinth of harmony may be mechanically explored but melody is that charm from which music receives animation which cannot be attained by the art of man but is an intuitive principle derived from nature i do not understand the text  from harmony from heavenly harmony the universal frame began it could not be harmony till it was completed from a chaos of sounds men of brilliant fancy and good taste select a certain number and model them into form and order  for it cannot be denied that a song is as perfectly understood with a single voice as accompanied by a band  harmony serves to ornament and set off the melody but cannot do more in short melody is the naked figure and harmony the dress  which now adays is as fantastical and ridiculous as the clothes of men and women  and believe i need not say any thing stronger to prove that harmony should contain nothing but what is neat convenient and graceful which every body understands ergo every body is musician enough to be a musical critic and thus the stupid nonsense of theorists ought for ever to be silenced  but there would be as much difficulty to do that as to prevent me from telling you how much i am  yours c dibdin sheffield march         letter xliii a return to places and characters  if variety be a pleasure in life to the rev mr  dear sir i shall drop a little the subject of music to tell you how i sped at wakefield and introduce to your notice such characters and incidents as are now ripe for your observation among these let me first speak of one of the most intelligent cheerful pleasant men i have met with i mean mr clementshaw who is by every body admired and respected and whose conversation  for indeed it is very desirable  is every where desired he is the organist  was a pupil of dr miller  has all the neighboring teaching  and is in a very comfortable and reputable situation his performance on the harpsichord is second only to boyton nay when we consider that this happy easy man  whose face is never without a smile nor i believe his heart without a benevolent sensation  is blind  which i would not declare did i not know his perfect good sense and strong philosophy  he may in some respects be considered as boytons equal no mans conversation is more agreeable for no man has a more perspicuous and decided judgment on all general subjects but his great forte is a rational laugh he shall make you more and better extemporary puns in an hour  with a view to laugh at punning  than mr okeefe would studiously introduce in a whole piece in expectation of same i will give a few instances dont you think said one that is a striking argument  why no answered he i dont think any blows past waiter said one  fill that glass full so said he shall he fulfill your request this table is made of good wood says one yes said he it is like the yorkshireman going with his pig to market  ma hog an i and then when we could not get the waiter near us  did you ever see said he such a set of uncome for table fellows and afterward  being asked to drink wine  said he this is perfectly coasting  how coasting why we are already at portsmouth and you are so determined to bring us to plymouth that if we dont take care we shall be at failmouth i would have him take care lest he should be sent for to make operas for as he can pun and compose he might become a dangerous competitor to messrs okeefe and shields but i fancy they need not be uneasy  he has too much good sense to quit his agreeable situation and if he was either to write or compose for the public he would neither disgrace his piece by a pun nor his music by an imitation he has read every thing has a wonderfully retentive memory and separates and discriminates sentiments and opinions in an elegant taste and with modest and convincing arguments in short i know not any man in whose company i have felt more pleasure no wonder therefore i take so much in repeating it mr southern of wakefield who is a fine young man and much beloved is also entitled to my acknowledgements and the rev mr vincent will i hope pardon me if i take this opportunity of thanking him with great sincerity for the many kind services he did me nor shall waller the printer that wellmeaning kind creature go without my hearty good wishes for i am sure i have his  i had one very good night at wakefield  saturday december  th  and after spending the sunday most agreeably with clementshaw went on the monday to leeds on tuesday i performed to a very decent number among which were some of the principal people who at the end of the entertainment begged i would give it again on the thursday one gentleman in particular took a great deal of pains procured me the assembly room was in a great measure the cause of its being well filled and gave me a handsome letter to a gentleman at manchester  i must not pass by an incident which very strongly proves a position  not a bad one by the bye  of mr astley the rider says he your shakespeare there upon the stage says that all the worlds a stage  damme i says says i all the worlds a puppet show why now do you see bent every body shewmen dont the king good bless him show his lions at the tower but to proceed there happened to be at leeds at the time i mention a full grown gentleman six and thirty inches high and about an hour before i began my performance an ambassador from the little man was dispatched to negociate with me the terms of an itinerant alliance i listened to the proposal with great coolness and asked if it was the wish of this man in miniature to be produced out of my pocket or exhibited on my finger while i should sing say little foolish fluttering thing  at leeds i became acquainted with mr warburton an independent professional man who has it amply in his power to assist the amusement of the public without the necessity of submitting to humiliation his spirited and sensible conduct in a business that happened just before i came to leeds as above gives a striking proof of this i had heard at wakefield that it would be impolitic to apply to mr warburton for he was out of favor how out of favor why he had neglected to attend one of the concerts  my answer was that i supposed he was better engaged the fact however was this  mr warburton was chosen by the managers of the concert as commander in chief for it would have been an affront to his situation in life to have considered him in any other light notwithstanding this he was continually thwarted and though out of pocket by the concert expected to be at their beck and call upon all occasions this he overlooked with the contempt it merited  determined to go on as smoothly as he could till the end of the season but being ill  they say through having drank too much the day before at a turtlefeast  he thought it could be no such great matter if they were for once to make a trial of spelling out the concertos and sonatas by themselves a resolution was immediately formed  and immediately repented of  to admit mr warburton no more who on his part very properly determined to have nothing more to do with them what is the consequence it never would have given him any pleasure to have his ears tortured with the dissonance and false time of gentlemen players who after all he must not dare to command  for they were in the situation of trinculo in the tempest  you shall be king and i will be viceroy over you he must therefore secretly rejoice at being rid of a trouble which nothing but his own good nature  of which no man possesses a larger share  ever induced him to give himself and they repine at their nonsensical folly which has deprived them of the only means by which their concert could stand the smallest chance of flourishing or being respectable as to the business of the turtlefeast it is too illiberal to talk about it but admitting it were true it only proves that mr warburton cannot stand liquor quite so well as themselves i have so particularly mentioned this circumstance that it may serve as a hint to the diletanti in the country who  and they may take my word for it  because they can scrape upon the fiddle out of tune toot a little upon the flute or growl upon the violoncello are neither qualified to command such men as mr warburton nor give the ton to the musical world  my tour has already pretty well shown that i have as much patience as any public man need but i declare were i in the affluent situation of mr warburton which  as he truly deserves  may he long comfortably enjoy i should content myself with the eligible and distinguished attention paid me by lord mexborough sir george armytage mr fawkes etc and feel very little inclination indeed to be at the devotion of a set of mechanics who think themselves of prodigious consequence by having taken it into their heads to become gentlemen fiddlers among these god forbid i should have the ingratitude to rank any of those who attended me  leeds is a town of great trade so much so that a gentleman belonging to one of the banks assured me the whole returns of the place could not be less than from five to seven millions a year this cannot be done but by men who have thrown fortunes into trade who as i have often experienced have nothing of the littleness that springs in low minds from turning the penny i desire also i may not be understood to say that there are not tradesmen who have heads and hearts that would do honor to the highest situations kings may do little actions and cobblers  great ones i aim at nothing but to distinguish between meanness and generosity those who possess  and that largely  the latter quality are now among mr warburtons friends and i fancy any man upon the same terms will not feel uneasy at being  in the way he is  out of favor such favor is as indifferent to him as yours is material to  dear sir your obliged friend c dibdin sheffield march         letter xliv more crotchets  natures above art in this respect to the rev mr  dear sir having in my last letter but one spoken generally of harmony and shown that it is the mere wood and stone of music  which might as well have lain dormant as a part of the original chaos if melody did not lend it order symmetry and proportion i shall in this investigate it something more minutely and show that what is called harmony is now refined into such a pitch of barbarism  which though it may seem a paradox is literally truth  that the ear would be better gratified by the grossest violation of the rules of composition as they are called than by such abstruse subdivisions of tones and resolutions of discords as  according to theorists  are the very essence of harmony nor am i unable or unwilling to prove what i advance  every rule of composition except avoiding consecutive fifths and octaves are  in the hands of men of genius  to be violated with considerable advantage else the great handel  the masterly correlli  the charming natural easy arne  the graceful galuppi  and almost every body of real consequence must be excluded from among the adepts to these two standing rules however the boldest sons of nature have paid some respect and it is true that two major fifths should never be consecutive upon this i ground my argument let any man play two sensecutive fifths  which would be a musical sacrilege  and it shall sound more pleasing to an indifferent ear than the introduction of the chord of the thirteenth ever so well prepared and resolved  which is a musical excellences but who shall answer when i go further and say that the very harmonists themselves have only to play on a full organ and they will infallibly add to the charms of their own ingenious modulation all these complicate violations of harmony  for the diapason principle and sesqualtra compounding the very distances which musicians are commanded to avoid the beauties and faults are blended together and how must the understanding be shocked by the admission of error into a system of perfection how then shall this be reconciled the organ is a noble instrument some poet says it is calculated to inspire holy love the musician therefore cannot lay the fault on the instrument as the devil did upon the water because he could not swim this will be found to be the fact let a simple unadorned melody be accompanied only by such modulations as arise from the general and perfect nature of the subject and  notwithstanding the violation of the rules in consequence of the complicate construction of the instrument  my life for it the right effect upon the passions will be produced without which harmony is no longer pleasing and consequently no longer music  one should think these dogmatic musicians knew their own defects and encouraged them  like callous hearted lawyers who dare not indulge the softer feelings lest they should incline them to pity and compassion i am told there is a certain great harmonist who wears the hind part of his shirt before by way of armor against cupid  fearing lest any thing tender and natural should get into any of his compositions and as to mr baumgarten who is at this moment supposed to be the best theorist in the kingdom he has so wonderfully improved upon fuguing that he never leads the band at covent garden theater but the instruments all follow mr shaw who leads the band at drury lane and who manifests more style and taste in the conducting of any one overture than mr baumgarten ever did in his whole life has it seems put himself apprentice to this great man thus in time we may have lively hopes  when the bagpipe shall have done squeaking  that theatrical music like theatrical government shall be distinguished by its discords that a knowledge of thorough bass shall be the indispensible requisite in a comic singer that clowns and chambermaids will sputter out their nonsense in fugues and dying lovers warble their distress in counterpoint indeed were i to enumerate all the tricks of these profound theorists it would take up a larger portion of time and pains than i am willing to allow so unprofitable a subject as far however as it conduces to the point i wish to carry i shall in my free way go a little further regardless how they may feel so i but serve the public cause some of these  and for a man of such admirable genius it is a pity justice obliges me to say one of them is haydn  give you an idea of a ropedancer who though you cannot too much admire how prettily he frisks and jumps about keeps you in a constant state of terror and anxiety for fear he should break his neck if this country had produced nine hooks and they had divided among them the manuscript of haydns compositions  or indeed were to work upon them now they are published which is just as fair play as times go  there would be materials enough to furnish each a musical reputation  and yet is there a fair wellwroughtup movement in his whole works do they consist of any thing more than strong effusions of genius turned into frenzy and laboring as ineffectually to be heard as a flute in a belfry or equity in a court of justice in short pursue every thing that is cold unnatural complex and dry and it is the road to the altar of apollo  if discord be the high priest but i rather think  like the usurper who as he worshipped at the shrine of folly fondly thought he knelt in the temple of fame  they will find imagination sensibility and expression are as necessary requisites to the accomplishment of a perfect musician as courage clemency and humanity are to make up the true renown of an hero in short teach a child to walk upon his hands that he may be more expert with his feet  let him play with fire to endure the smart if he chance to be burnt  instruct him in algebra to teach him multiplication  or do ought but take the plain easy natural course of setting about any thing and you shall have an idea of the shallow miserable resources of these empty men to hide the sterility of their intellects which after all is like the goose that thrust its head in the hedge to conceal itself  forgetting that its body was exposed but if they are so reprehensible while they stick to straight forward thrumming as many notes at a time as they have fingers  which they would if they had as many as briareus  what shall we say when we go with them into chromatics dr wainwright is known to have rejected every thing natural maintaining that a tone by a man of ingenuity might be softened into as many shades as a color here is glorious ground work for the theorist who knows but the full tone which is now only divided may one day or other be so subdivided as to form a new system of theory  in which case a man would find it as tedious to go from one end of the gamut to the other as it was formerly to take a journey from york to london if it should  the utmost that can be said about it is that a learned musician like a greyhound jumps over hedges and ditches at the risk of his hide  while the child of nature like a horse jogs on safely contenting himself with the turnpike road nature ever was above art and will be ages after i have the power  for so long shall i have the inclination  to subscribe myself  yours with fervent sincerity c dibdin sheffield march         letter xlv settling of accounts  populous cities please me then  and the busy hum of men  to the rev mr  dear sir my account of places manners etc is of a long standing  therefore i may as well give you time to digest my arguments concerning music and clear my ground as far as i have gone  as gardeners dig in the old cabbage stalks to make the surface of the bed the fairer on which they are preparing to plant a new crop indeed i have generally spoken of every place but i would willingly leave nothing undone to set about this completely i believe i must go back as far as birmignham the ingenuity and populousness of which place are wonderful the increase of buildings both for convenience and pleasure has extended the place to a space at least as large again as when i knew it twentyfive years ago the first however is as praise worthy as the last is ridiculous not that i would not have men enjoy the money they have earned  let it be procured through whatever medium it honestly may  but the country houses of the birminghamites are embellished to as little purpose as a chimneysweeper washes his face and as awkwardly as a guineapig imitates a squirrel as to their manners i am sure they are not good ones a tenacious man must infallibly in birmingham be affronted ten times a day  for even if you go to buy any thing it is fifty to one if you receive a civil answer  and this rudeness extends to the most opulent among them a man who is said to possess two hundred thousand pounds used me with a style of incivility that would have disgraced a porter in thames street and i called upon another man of the first consequence there whom i could not single out from the journeymen blacksmiths that surrounded him indeed master and servant is confounded among them for each leads the same life works as hard drinks as much fat ale and undergoes as much drudgery as the other nor do i see that one has more felicity in counting useless guineas than the other in carding buttons i really speak here without acrimony and it may be seen by this i had no better success at wolverhampton than at birmingham and yet there i found civility not incompatible with trade  i have been trying what to say more of lichfield but can find nothing  unless i were to go over the old ground of the massacre of dioclesian  in which a thousand christians were martyred and their bodies exposed to wild beasts for this cruel event it seems to have mourned ever since for it is so melancholy that one would wonder miss seward could write verses that have so many charms for the reviewers in a place apparently calculated to engender only the vapors but indeed those gentlemen in general seem to have a peculiar knack of speaking eloquently upon dull subjects  i shall say nothing to the antiquity of derby but only mention it as a clean prettylooking genteel town where i sincerely believe the inhabitants want neither spirit nor taste as to what happened to me it was one of those strokes  a traverse  that have attended me all my life and which like the mistake of a figure in the solution of a mathematical problem in proportion as you expect to come home to your point carries you out of your way  nottingham as i have before said has something charming in its situation the castle has a beautifully romantic effect and the trent breaks the country near it in a most delightful and picturesque manner indeed i know not at times whether the mind does not as strongly pant for objects that derive their grandeur from simplicity as for those surprising natural effects which as it were pain and giddy the senses till sober reality is lost in intoxicated imagination  newark is something in the style of derby i do not think the inhabitants are so rich but they do not want spirit newark is a very desirable place for persons of small fortune to settle at house rent is reasonable and the corporation being for the size of the place rich  paving highways public building and repairs maintaining the poor and many other necessary but heavy charges are defrayed without assessing the inhabitants and yet they are better paid than in any other town of its standing that i have seen the town hall and the poorhouse are in proportion i believe i may venture to say the best in england  if it be true that lincoln formerly contained fifty two parish churches and one thousand and seventy one houses of entertainment it is certainly very much fallen into decay the situation from the hill is wonderful and the clergy who are astonishingly numerous there seem to have got on as high a pinnacle as they can with a view i hope to evince how idle to them are all the vain pomp and glory of this world i am not honored with the knowledge of these gentlemen nor had i the least conversation with any except dr kaye who though a certain newspaper is extremely angry that he should be praised at the expense of the rest of the clergy has in the opinion of many others as well as myself set an example in the business of the tithe child that we shall stand very little chance of seeing imitated the manners of lincoln seem to be a constant internal enmity and a remarkable shyness to strangers their musical taste i have given an instance of  hull originally a small fishing village is now a very considerable sea port and lying between yarmouth and newcastle is remarkably convenient either for homeward or outward bound ships the increase of their commerce is apparent in the new dock already made and that lately applied for to parliament round the dock is formed a kind of crescent consisting of magnificent houses which form an appearance of extraordinary novelty by being the boundary of one of the dirtiest places in the kingdom on the opposite side of the dock is a row of warehouses to a prodigious extent very spacious and admirably well stored as to their taste i do not think they relished much of my entertainment except grog and for their manners  being all seamen  they are blunt honest and careless i must not forget to mention the kind attention of mr marley whom i should have been happy to have know better that i might have spoken of his professional merit with the same certainty as that of boyton and clementshaw it is universally allowed to be very brilliant and i am sure if it bear any proportion to his kind and obliging private conduct his friends  who are a very large number  cannot speak too highly of it nor will i neglect to record the kindness of poor hudson  how no more  who died like the wife of boniface  but in this life we have need of cordials  so peace to him poor hudson puts me in mind of a brotherinlaw of griffin the bookseller who was killing himself by drinking a friend of his as he was creeping along one day asked him how he did very bad indeed anwered he i am sorry for it  said the friend  what do you take  every thing said the sick man   hot brandy and cold brandy  hot gin and cold gin  but none of it does me any good   as this subject is rather dry i shall now speak alternately of music and places till i have fairly brought up my account as far as my second visit to leeds  after which i shall open a new field and expatiate largely on a variety of public subjects adieu  yours most sincerely c dibdin london march          letter xlvi a musical alarm  the adventure of the bear and fiddle  is sung  but broke off in the middle  to the rev mr  dear sir theory in music and the empty nonsense of its professors being the subject of my last letter  in which i think i have plainly shown that a single air with simplicity for its object and expression for its effect is infinitely preferable to the most labored production that can be worked up mechanically  i shall proceed to remark on the pernicious effects of following a doctrine so very false and delusive and point out that it has step by step perverted and vitiated the english taste first of all theorists content themselves  indeed they want invention to do otherwise  with very indifferent and in general trite melodies thus having acquired great reputation by the pomp annexed to their being professed musicians their music is listened to and at length liked upon the principle of a mans eating biscuit at sea because he can get no bread the human mind is so prone to the reception of pleasure that it very often takes it upon credit and is swindled into a belief of the reality of what upon examination turns out to be only counterfeit thus the manly and i will venture to say correct taste of the english which admired the works of purcell arne and boyce  and surely they have among them some of the sweetest melodies that ever spoke to the heart  is now dwindled into an admiration of the grossest insipidity it should seem as if music had expired with the singers who uttered it and that leveridge and beard i do not mean to say beard is literally no more  i am informed he possesses at this moment all his faculties in full vigor may he long do so i was very young when mr beard knew me and he must remember through the ersuasion of others he treated me very unhandsomely but i acquit him of all intention to do so and take this public opportunity of assuring him that i never had of any man a higher opinion nor for any a greater value having given way to the use of effeminacy and falcetto the style should sink in proportion otherwise how can it be accounted for that the hark forwards of the present day should be ten times more in circulation than with horns and with hounds or the early horn has not a single insipid song called the mansion of peace brought six times the profit to the composer that the whole chaplet did to boyce  though to mention the comparative merits would be like talking of a scotch bank note and the riches of the treasury nothing in nature can be more beautifully delicious than vain is every fond endeavor and what medicine can soften the bosoms keen smart pshaw what are these trifles says a theorist to a fugue to which i answer  a great deal for they can make only the fugue whereas dr boyce could make both but to enumerate other instances is it not true that at this moment were the beauties of arne collected together headed by all the melody sweetness spirit character and expression in comus the charming peculiarly natural airs to which he so enchantingly set the songs of shakespeare  which task i will venture to say no man in the world could have executed equal to arne  and made up of those innumerable charms which pervade his voluminous works would they not be all neglected for that miserable unmeaning imitation of la virginella and twenty other things  called ma cher ami and to give yet a stronger proof were all purcells duettos brought forth  who had beyond all question a more vigorous mind than handel  were let caesar and urania live  to arms  as i saw fair clora  and in short all those admirable compositions which so honorably mark the strength of english genius corelli is said to have visited england on purpose to see purcell but hearing at rochester of his death he did not even visit the capital but returned saying  there can be nothing worthy my curiosity since purcell is dead  would they not be despised for that most execrable of all apologies for music the duetto sung by mr kelly and mrs crouch  i beg i may not be understood to mean by what i have here advanced that the compilers of such contemptible stuff are the theorists of whom i have spoken above these are only the dabblers who take advantage of the bad taste of the times but to come more closely to the point and satisfy every enquirer what are the steps which have caused this gradual declension in the public taste i answer in great measure a blind predilection for the works of handel and an indiscriminate avidity for german compositions what shall any man dare to make so bold a declaration i do  but let me have fair play handel was a composer of wonderful abilities his conception was strong his imagination immense his knowledge of music as a science clear and profound  and those masterly combinations of sounds which make up many of his chorusses abundantly prove it but like hounds led on by the huntsman on a false scent he is admired in england for his very errors handel has been frequently compared to shakespeare though nothing can be upon more opposite grounds than the admiration which has been respectively paid them shakespeare has been always praised for his genius and handel for his judgment he who wished so much of the writings of shakespeare obliterated would i fancy have been at a loss where to have laid his finger whereas it were very easy to point out which half of handels works might be consigned to oblivion and yet leave all that is pleasing in his compositions behind when i say errors i do not speak as to his knowledge as a musician but to his taste as a man of genius these errors in handel relate to expression which was sometimes false like tinsel in poetry sometimes ridiculous like bombast often begun upon a principle which sunk in the end to absurdity  making exactly the bathos and very frequently indeed sound without either meaning or expression answering exactly to nonsense verses  i believe it will be allowed me that the parts of any thing which offers itself to human observation are complete only as they regard the whole in music no man ever did or will greatly succeed who takes up particular instead of general expression handel was a slave to this  but to adduce my proofs  his false expression was this if the subject happened to be joy he too frequently invetend something sprightly  without considering time place or occasion as rejoice oh daughter of sion  which surely should convey a holy joy expressive of religious soulfelt rapture instead of which this song was first a jig and afterward a hornpipe another instance occurs in judas maccabeus  in the song let honor with desert be crowned the word trumpet here happening to be introduced he has taken such an advantage of it that the whole song seems as if it was set to display the effect of the trumpet in a key which does not belong to it and where of course it has the worst effect that can be imagined and as if this was not enough the words seem to be written as a burlesque on the music for they run thus  the trumpet never in vain should sound i have heard this song praised as the best in all his works  the second instance which i call ridiculous or bombast is a worse fault than the other  and yet it occurs as frequently who can listen to such a pantomime tune as the land brought forth frogs and call it any thing but burlesque  and yet this is a popular favorite i heard a man in the gallery say while the chorus was performing which begins and he spoke the word and there came all manner of flies and lice in all their quarters  that he itched from head to foot would the gentleman have been obliged to handel for giving him this sensation if he had lived in the days of james i who is said to have prohibited scratching thais led the way and the king seized a flambeau are again of this complexion  for they both convey a kind of drunken gaiety and give you more the idea of their going up stairs to bed together than to set the persepolis on fire  as to the bathos it occurs in such instances as the chorus in the messiah beginning all we like sheep are gone astray  which profanes the words it should express and might with great propriety be put into the peep behind the curtain  where the story of orpheus is burlesqued the sheep certainly dance and frisk about very curiously and run away from each other but unfortunately conceiving himself under a musical necessity of making a close in the line we have turned every one to his own way he brings them all back and they finish by huddling lovingly together query whether so great a man as handel might not with impunity have invented some new species of inverted counterpoint that might have finished the chorus with their all baaing to one another at a distance but i am getting into length and therefore shall in imitation of hudibras break of in the middle i will resume the subject however after the next letter till when and at all times i am  most faithfully yours c dibdin london march          letter xlvii a further settlement  over steeples towers and turrets to the rev mr  dear sir beverley is said to be one of the prettiest towns in england to this i cannot wholly agree it is a snug decent town has a spacious market place and its minster  which is very ancient and was formerly a sanctuary to bankrupts and criminals  is yet a very handsome church but i think it inferior to many towns in yorkshire as to beauty consequence or situation the inhabitants however appear to be independent and by mixing socially together promote very pleasantly all that is necessary or agreeable toward forming a friendly and comfortable neighborhood this town has many advantageous privileges among which is their being exempt from toll and custom  i know not what to say of york except that it fell infinitely below my expectations in every point of view i expected to see a large oppulent populous place  second to nothing in england but london  instead of which except the church and the gaol there is no one object that conveys an idea of superiority to the other towns around it it is not near so populous as leeds nor half so much frequented talking to a gentleman at leeds i told him york put me in mind of a man in conversation who though rich in volubility finished as he began  having impressed no one with either truth or reason in his argument whereas leeds put in only a word now and then but always to the purpose york is in proportion the poorest place in the whole county of which it is the capital its situation being in the very center of all the great north roads which are now very fine and astonishingly frequented it is continually busy without having any thing to do and though constantly crammed thinly inhabited the inns alone seem to thrive there in short it has many churches and but little devotion fine clothes and spare purses a magnificent prison always full and a theater royal where they perform at a constant loss as a proof of their musical taste they think mr kelly and mrs crouchs duetto comprizes all the excellence of all the masters that ever bowed at the shrine of apollo it must be remembered i have one exception to these general rules  and i believe when i say i have but one i write as strong a satire as words are capable of conveying  malton is a shabby town apparently in every respect  i will therefore leave it and go on to scarborough which is one of the prettiest seaports i have seen every body knows it is maintained upon the principle of bath one thing however surprised me though i was cautioned against the unreasonableness of their charges i found them so much the reverse that i paid less for better things than at any place on that side the humber  wakefield i confess is one of my favorite places there is such a sprightly cleanliness about it that the inhabitants seem as if they were born for the real purposes of life the village of heath near it is one of the sweetest spots for neatness and simplicity that imagination can form the vicinity of wakefield is filled with opulent and respectable inhabitants all of whom inherit or have accumulated fortunes by trade their manners appear to be simple and unaffected their conversation is polished and in their musical pursuits they go my way to work and praise every thing that pleases them upon reflection  doncaster has all the neatness of a quaker and on a first view begets very strongly your sober admiration but when you come to consider that they have no soul no taste no characteristic but insipidity  after having admired the church the mansion house and the guildhall  you wish yourself any where but at doncaster  as to the roads to all those different places there are now no bad ones but what are necessarily so through situation and soil and near manufacturing towns where time can be more valuably employed than in mending roads  though one would think that work would contribute to their convenience since the goods must be carried after they are made thus almost every where in swampy lincolnshire the roads are generally very disagreeable especially in winter and great part of derbyshire on account of the hills render your journeys unpleasant and not always very safe i must not forget in particular to mention that the nine miles from wakefield to leeds is so scandalously neglected that even in a postchaise and in the middle of the day you expect every moment to be overturned  having now spoken of all those places to which i shall not find it necessary to return except perhaps for some general observations i shall go on from leeds to halifax where i was advised to perform a night or two previous to my touching at manchester when i came there however they had a company of players and were otherwise so full of amusements that after sitting down a few days and writing a part of this tour i went on to manchester  promising if i could make it convenient to call on my return  on my arrival at manchester i not only found that the theater was open but that mr astley was figuring away in great style with his horsemanship to which amusement i have the same aversion  and perhaps for better reasons  that some men have to a cat i therefore enclosed a letter i had brought with me to an opulent gentleman  informed him i would take another opportunity to pay him my personal respects  and posted away to liverpool  as my success at this place and the subjects on which it must necessarily induce me to speak will make a most essential and interesting part of this work i shall introduce them as conspicuously as possible in the following letter but one and in the interim supply the next with the remainder of my argument respecting handel and german music which ideas i threw loosely on paper at halifax which is said to be the most musical spot for its size in the kingdom  for there mrs bates received her musical education  there mr bates has so planted a veneration for the works of handel that children lisp for unto us a child is born and clothmakers as they sweat under their loads in the clothhall roar out for his yoke is easy and his burden is light i have been assured for a fact that more than one man in halifax can take any part in the chorusses of the messiah and go regularly through the whole oratorio by heart and indeed the facility with which the common people join together throughout the greatest part of yorkshire and lancashire in every species of choral music is truly astonishing  this kind of cursory work is like posting the daybook into the ledger by and by we shall take out the different articles and come to a general account  adieu yours most sincerely c dibdin london march          letter xlviii another touch at music  strange so much difference should be  twixt tweedledum and tweedledee  to the rev mr  dear sir the instances of handels total neglect of expression occur much more frequently than any of his other faults how many of his oratorio songs consist of a complex accompaniment  ingeniously worked up indeed but without the smallest relation to the subject of the words  while the voice drawls out an unmeaning train of sounds destitute of melody or any power of conveying a pleasing sensation sometimes in these songs that the voice may have no reason to complain of having less to do than the instruments  for in this species of music every thing is upon a footing  it floats away upon a long division and often such a one as no voice upon earth can execute this is surely the very reverse of what vocal music ought to be where every thing manifestly should be subordinate to the voice and even in a hautboy song or any other where a particular instrument may have an obligato accompaniment the voice ought to be every where assisted but no where eclipsed  vocal music is clearly the essence of whatever can render sound delectable that which is simplest and most expressive is the best vocal music and i will add that a song perfect in all its qualities is the utmost height of excellence to which music can arrive this position i shall hereafter more fully go into as i mean to leave what i advance on this subject unanswerable  in solo songs  where one point of expression should be observed where a single unembarrassed subject should be well begun followed and finished  handel very often falls below mediocrity this proves that he is a better instrumental than a vocal composer for in the major part of his chorusses where the expression need not so much depend on the voice  for there it acts only as a kind of instrument to fill the parts  he is much more happy and in his other works where the voice has no share at all he is incomparably greater than any where who can deny this when they recollect the minuet in ariadne there is not a superfluous note in it and being made up of one simple and yet grand object  regularly pursued and greatly worked up  nothing in music for what it is can exceed it to which if you call in the other minuets together with the marches and gavottes which make up the last movements of his overtures the balance will be considerably in favor of my argument and yet while we whistle all these with the greatest facility without considering to whom we owe this satisfaction we get crowded at the abbey  to the tune of two guineas  to be stunned with the abstrusest of his works which if the heart has any thing to do with music is the worst  to prove this let me ask any man in his senses not a mere theorist if he ever felt so much real pleasure in hearing the horse and his rider as in the last movement of his famous coronation anthem of god save the king where there is scarcely a discord that might not be admitted without wounding simplicity into the most familiar song after a tedious and tiresome reiteration of discords placed unnecessarily in every point of view how are we charmed in the messiah with for the lord god omnipotent reigns why because it is full of grandeur and simplicity the soul is struck with the sublime greatness and beauty of the expression and we feel the deity in our hearts  thus i think i have proved my position without injuring the reputation of handel he his certainly left behind him some wonderful music but it cannot be denied that this ore is plentifully surrounded with dross  let us therefore  which would be infinitely more to his honor  take his music upon credit of our own feelings and not blindly and implicitly from those who living in a labyrinth wonder how any one should prefer a direct road  as to the other germans  as they have no opera so they import no vocal music and thus by torturing sounds into new positions to make old ideas wear a novel shape difficulty is the only characteristic of their compositions and by this means the ear gets accustomed not to what pleases in music but to what surprises i will venture to say solos and solo concertos have done but little good to the cause of music la mottes great merit was to figure away in alt till at last approaching to the bridge he played himself as it were out of sight the dexterity was wonderful but for heavens sake where was the pleasure this is a solid fact  and to prove it let me ask how came giardini and barthelemon constantly to call in lango lee the dargle etc to help out their concertos  the human mind cannot pay proper attention but to one object at a time zoffanis admirable portrait of the gallery of florence  at which one might look a month and not discover half the beauties  though it contains more grand objects than any twenty pictures that ever were painted has the meanest tout ensemble that can be imagined it is a chaos of exquisitely charming objects which cannot be properly distinguished because one confounds the effect of the other there is a soberness in real pleasure that cannot bear the impertinence of tickling and teazing in architecture it is the same mr woodfall may remember as he and i were near each other in henry the sevenths chapel to see the ceremony of installing the knights of the bath he took notice of the wonderful labor that had been bestowed in ornamenting that place that there was such a variety and the parts were so minute that the eye was at a loss where to fix i said if this was the case he must confess it was labor in vain  and the observation holds good in every thing that appeals to the senses and as to music if a man invent a tolerable melody and prevent its effect by complex accompaniment he will have no better success than the irish painter who undertaking the portrait of a gentleman going a shooting hid the figure behind a large tree for fear he should frighten the partridges  i understand there has been already much curiosity concerning what i can possibly mean in my proposal by an exposition of musical quackery  by the time the crotchetmongers shall have read this letter they may perhaps smell out what i am diving at i have yet however spoken only of impositions on the senses i mean hereafter to mention under the article of teaching something concerning designs on the pocket i shall first however place the different merits of dead composers side by side in which task i have no doubt but i shall prove to the satisfaction of every reasonable man that had not arne all his life been discouraged and handel considered as another apollo the fame of the englishman would have exceeded that of the german this will nearly involve all that it will be necessary for me to say  and without mentioning a single name throw the merit or the want of it if you will of many living composers into that point of view in which it is but common justice to have it seen then as the business of teaching is a serious evil i shall lay it open as bare as possible and give a receipt to heal the wound after which if the public choose to be gulled with it no teaching tickets ought to pass between masters and scholars without a stamp that thus musical quacks may be at once upon the footing of physical ones strange says swift so much difference should be twixt tweedledum and tweedledee the world is more imposed on by trifles than is generally imagined it is a trifle to be sure  but however no imposition  to say i am truly yours  c dibdin london march          letter xlix a trait of english opulence  no foreign faction shall we need to rue  if england to herself do prove but true  to the rev mr  dear sir to liverpool i went without the smallest recommendation except indeed a letter to mr pie who keeps a music warehouse there and to whose attention and indefatigable pains to oblige and accommodate me i confess myself greatly indebted the difficulty i had to get at the mayor and the doubtful reception i at first met with had at one moment nearly worked me up to a resolution of returning from thence as i went on my first performance however which was attended by about thirtyfive people and greatly relished several gentlemen made strenuous application to me to repeat it and proposed a better room for the purpose the next evening i had a very handsome audience on the third a better still and on the fourth  though it was christmas eve and a concert night  i had the very best room i have experienced at any place since i first began my rambles having done very handsomely at liverpool in relation to my entertainment and mustered so many more names to my subscription than at any other place except london it may be suspected by the uncandid that i am induced on this account alone to speak well of that truly spirited place those however who think liberally and who by the way are of the only description i care threepence about obliging will see  as i have every where been just  that i give to liverpool as i do to birmingham only its due  throughout life it holds good as an infallible maxim that the mind will be influenced by its employment able financiers have seldom in any country been great ministers because their measures have been constantly clogged by the cold regularity of mere calculation retired tradesmen live still in the misery of fearing to spend a superfluous penny but merchants though expert at every qualification for the accumulation of profit are in their minds like their traffic extensive and expanded it is astonishing to witness the difference between a counting house and a counter for my part i look upon merchants to be the first of characters and an english one to be the first of merchants voltaire having drawn a paralleled view of different distinctions among men after mentioning the good sense of the english in intermarrying their nobility with commercial characters goes on and says  after all it were worth while to consider which is the more truly noble he who knows to a moment when the king rises or goes to sleep or  something else  or he who trades to every part of the globe thereby contributing to the comfort and convenience of human nature  nothing shows an object so well as a contrast therefore as i am not yet come to manchester and newcastle where at one place they measure serret by the yard and at the other coals by the bushel i cannot to my satisfaction dwell on liverpool on my return to that place i shall be more competent to display that openhearted liberality which in so short a time i might only have imagined they possess but my observation cannot but be well founded as they have less of hypocrisy than any set of people i ever met with in my life  a compact with any part of the public is with me a very serious thing therefore  though i was offered very handsomely to stay  i left liverpool and returned to halifax  where my advertisements stood for thursday the twentyseventh  on christmas day therefore i left liverpool for manchester and the following day  after being nearly lost in the snow near rochdale  arrived at halifax i think it would be doing injustice to so well known a character if i were to omit mentioning that in the diligence from liverpool to manchester i was accompanied by mr astley who at that time was returning from liverpool after having taken the town from eight oclock in the morning till five in the afternoon  for so long is that diligence crawling thirtysix miles  i am sure he did not cease i will not say talking but bawling for this gentleman being eternally on his hobbyhorse always fancies he is holding conversation with mr merryman in the course of this curious rant he was so kind as to oblige me with his idea of improving the theaters the courts the parliament and the nation he wished he had known what i was about he would have given me such hints for my entertainment in short if i would but have listened to him i should have had new rules for making music writing singing playing and speaking english but hallowed he there is no talking to any of you now there about law  lord thurlow told me in my riding house  but that is no matter there now you see there is that there palmer if i had a mind i would have showed him a trick that would have laid them all flat on their backs for you see  to be sure i knows nothing about sense but i knows law for i cast sir joseph mawby and i have had several suits and i have been twice took up but you see nobody will not be ruled by me so i goes on by myself  and what does i do why i cuts and contrives why where will you find such another monooverer  learnt it in the army  under my particular friend and acquaintance general elliot why dont you see what i am about now i thinks our licenses will carry us through  but if they should not you know  i am at a heavy charge  so you see i goes about and gets the profit of a season before the season comes and good generalship it has turned out for i am credibly informed  at birmingham manchester and liverpool  he cleared nearly two thousand pounds  while i was at liverpool the business or the slave trade began to be agitated and out of curiosity i learned some particulars concerning it these however i shall defer till i mention what i gathered afterward on that subject at manchester and add the rejoinder of the people of liverpool on my second visit to that place  whether any thing be done in this important business or not the national character of the english will derive an additional luster from the humane endeavors that have been exerted to annihilate a traffic which those who have petitioned against it think cruel and oppressive perhaps an investigation of the abuses under the line may lead to an exposition and an amendment of those at home if so manchester will have unwittingly begun a reform of more magnitude than they were aware of and become the fortuitous perfecter of a constitution which wants only to be purged of humors contracted by  too much health  which performed it cannot be rendered more pure than the sincerity with which i profess myself  yours c dibdin london march          letter l the harmony of halifax and the sincerity of sheffield  promisings one thing  performing another to the rev mr  dear sir it is my business at present to speak of my success at halifax and my return from thence to sheffield which mountain for i love to use hackneyed expressions to mediocre subjects notwithstanding lord chesterfield to his son reprobates them as vulgar that he may keep them to himself i suppose for nobody has more brought forth a mouse but first for halifax  i had two nights at this place and considering the inhabitants of the neighborhood  for this black dismal town has in it very few people of any consequence  were locked up in their houses by the frost and snow they turned out decent but that was all my audience and indeed all halifax and its environs men women and children being musical and as some think squall in tune  just as the negroes swim  as soon as they are born my performance was critically attended to but i am afraid not much liked manzoli and guarducci were competitors in italy the public were to determine which sung best  manzoli had the voice of the spectators and guarducci of the musicians  what was the consequence manzoli made a fortune and guarducci did nothing i am however not very sorry this circumstance occurred for it gives me an opportunity which will be more strongly confirmed when i get to manchester of noticing that the conoscenti ever receive the least pleasure and in fact are the least infallible i sincerely believe however having paused on the second night and considered whether it was right to be pleased or not they would have attended with more satisfaction a third  while they were deliberating however i was gone for having received a letter from mr gales who was so kind to make the necessary enquiries concerning the entertainment i got away to sheffield on monday december the thirtyfirst  of mr gales i scarcely know how to speak he is the printer of this work if therefore i should use slight language it will look like a compact between us garrick and lacy had this compact between them  whatever one praised the other abused  when i made my article for seven years immediately after the jubilee garrick was for giving me a carte blanch and lacy for beating me down in every thing  they so well carried their point by this  garrick having previously promised me that whatever i consented to through lacys whims he would through his own generosity amply make up to me  that i agreed to receive seven pounds a week for what was worth more than double that sum lacy having always had a regard for me i could not help a few days afterward telling him that he had been very hard on me in the business of the agreement  what the devil would you have said he it was davids doings  he prompted me and if i am lavish in my praises of him some may be apt to quote from shakespeare and say a little flattery sometimes does well i should therefore feel myself awkwardly situated but for one circumstance which has major minor and conclusion in its favor as clearly as any problem in euclid before i ever saw mr gales i had received numberless civilities at the hands of different printers from many of whom i have had offers to print my tour  after i knew mr gales i preferred him to all the printers i had seen thus i am enabled by a selfevident circumstance to express my sentiments as strongly as by trying my hand at a studied panegyric which had i done in the sort of style my wishes led me to i should have been obliged to have enjoined mr galess foreman to have printed it unknown to his master for so diffident is he of his own worth that i should never have prevailed on him to let that issue from the press which would have been as great a credit to the public as any thing that ever did or ever will pass through it another circumstance will by and by oblige me to speak in mr galess favor in spite of his teeth among my general subjects it will be very proper to take up newspapers in which case it would be very improper not to mention the sheffield register with that degree of praise it deserves  my first night at sheffield notwithstanding i had beat about almost expressly for ten weeks with a view of properly paying them a visit was a very bad one and feeling myself a little let down i should not have announced a second but for the persuasion of two or three gentlemen and the conditions i made were that my continuing the performance for any length of time at sheffield should depend wholly on the degree of success on the second evening which turning out but very little better than the first i gave the matter up  nor could any persuasions induce me to resume it i can scarcely account for that strange kind of caprice through which people take so much pains to manifest the instability of their minds nothing could be warmer than the apparent heartiness with which i was entreated to return to sheffield nor any thing cooler than my reception when i did return my welcome to a stranger would have seemed as if i had been sent away with contumely and they had wondered at my impudence at intruding myself among them a second time i looked down upon it as i can do  heaven be praised  when i ought with a calm and tranquil mixture of pity and indifference and though not one of all the number who testified such satisfaction at my first visit came near me on my second i contented myself with a reflection that as it is the lot of mankind to be fickle and this worthy quality is generally influenced by local prejudice it must have arisen as the french say from lair du pais and i have only to consider that the iron which was hot when i first went there had cooled in my absence  to show however that i have a pleasure in being just i here publicly thank the inhabitants of sheffield for bringing me back even with all this obloquy for through it i acquired the friendship of mr gales and the satisfaction of employing him to print this work  adieu yours most sincerely c dibdin london march          letter li another disappointment  one woe does tread upon anothers heel to the rev mr  dear sir my labourinvain expedition to sheffield having trifled away that whole week a nonsensical business started up which lost me the next from the little town of rotherham a proposal was sent me which to this moment i can scarcely make head or tail of my intention was to have performed at manchester on the tuesday i however received a message that it would be a profit to me and a pleasure to the people of rotherham if i would give them a night there and that lady effingham had expressed a wish to that effect the inhabitants of that place after putting me to some expense and making me lose my time chose however to affect a perfect indifference about the matter and no night took place  the following letter which i wrote to clear myself from any suspicion of disrespect to lady effingham who suffered me to say in the bills that the entertainment was at her particular desire will elucidate this curious business a little better  to the right hon the countess of effingham madam i scarcely know in what words to apologize to your ladyship for making so ill a return to your condescension as to disappoint you of my performance at rotherham the actual reason however which i shall briefly state will infallibly exculpate me from any intention of abusing the very generous and handsome liberality with which you did me the honor to permit the use of your name which circumstance had i not been precluded from circulating it must have procured me an ample attendance  a proposal through mr webb of sheffield came to me from your ladyship and mr walker and mr webb went so far as to ask what sum would satisfy me for my trouble of going to rotherham my answer  as it has constantly been whenever i hear of liberal names and liberal intentions  was that i was certainly safe in relying on whatever the gentlemen of rotherham influenced by your ladyship and mr walker might think proper to do and as i am very tenacious of not being considered merely as a common exhibiter  my entertainment having been fabricated solely with a view to testify my gratitude to a generous public previous to my embarkment for india  i told mr webb that if the night failed there would be abundant opportunity of making me amends without any extrapecuniary gratification by promoting the subscription of my musical tour mr webb undertook to procure me an answer by noon on sunday and i promised not to go so soon to manchester on sunday night however hearing nothing of mr webb i wrote to him and received a verbal answer that i must wait on dr wainwright determined to know something more of this business i called at doctor wainwrights in the morning i saw only mrs wainwright who corroborated all that mr webb had told me adding that the doctor had commissioned mr webb to treat with me that he would be on that day at rotherham that there would be a meeting of the gentlemen and her advice was that i should immediately go there this i fully intended had i not by accident seen your ladyship this circumstance determined me to stay at sheffield and solicit your name to my bill which request you did me the honor so handsomely to grant in the interim however i wrote to dr wainwright and sent some general bills for circulation but dr wainwright having left rotherham before the arrival of my letter it was referred to the gentlemen at the meeting and they agreed to write me word that they were all engaged on tuesday evening and could not attend me this letter not being given to the man till past nine oclock in the evening he did not return to sheffield till yesterday morning after i had set out to rotherham prepared for the performance  on my arrival there the woman at the post office informed me that mr walker had written me a letter and if i had not received it mr tucker would tell me its contents i waited on mr tucker who blamed me for not giving more notice and letting the gentlemen know my intention sooner i represented that i had but one intention about it  which was not to go to rotherham had i not been strongly solicited  but that hearing your ladyships name and mr walkers so repeatedly mentioned i had been induced to comply with what was extremely inconvenient to me mr tucker informed me that if i performed nobody could be there  but to comfort me that gentleman was so good as to say that even if he did not come himself he would send his half crown i smiled at the compliment but could not help so far feeling for myself as to say that half a crown was probably no more an object to me than to him he advised me at all adventures to see mr walker for whom i immediately sought but finding he was gone to sheffield i saw i had nothing for it but to wait on your ladyship make my apology and inform you honestly of what had happened  but on coming to the inn i found that in my absence the landlord had put the horses which drew me to rotherham to mr walkers carriage  thus prevented every way from paying your ladyship that deference and respect which are not more your due from your high and distinguished situation than from your affability and condescending benevolence i have nothing to resort to but this letter which will i doubt not sufficiently convince you that i have in no respect been to blame but on the contrary  as this transaction has put me to some expense and prevented my receiving advantage elsewhere  i have a right to consider it as as a piece of very unhandsome treatment which i feel the more severely having through it though not wilfully disappointed your ladyship and given you so much unnecessary trouble  i have the honor to be madam your ladyships most obliged and obedient servant c dibdin sheffield january         as i could have proved loss of time and money in this transaction i think it would have been no bad hit to have proposed to mr tucker  who be it known is a worthy member of the law  an action

relating the story cried out  rotherham ah now for the future will you be after changing the r into a b and calling it botherham  laughing at these disappointments i began to anticipate the advantages of a visit to manchester where as my recommendations were good and the inhabitants were said to emulate the spirit of liverpool i had no doubt but i should reap a plentiful harvest in my next you will

equal success there to that i met with at liverpool in the highest spirits therefore i advertised at a venture three nights  tuesday the fifteenth thursday the seventeenth and friday the eighteenth  and on those three nights i received almost one half of the sum which the last night yielded me at liverpool the reception of the entertainment smacked a little of halifax the judges bore a wary eye and people holding tight the captive half crown made strict enquiries into the value to be received before they could muster up resolution to liberate the coin to say the truth i was at last ashamed of them and out of pity relieved them from their uneasiness by bidding manchester adieu  to reverse what i have said of liverpool let me not be censured if  faithful to my promise of telling the truth  i should be obliged to place manchester in an unfavourable point of view my disappointment there will tell the story for me at liverpool i had no previous recommendation that could influence the leading people at manchester a gentleman of the first consequence in the town introduced me personally to all whom he could devise might be of service to me and on my account gave a supper to which he invited a large number of his particular friends on the night before the first performance nor did they want a reporter and a very able one of what they were going to hear one of the gentlemen present had been at the amusement the last night at liverpool and spoke in the kindest way not only of the thing itself but of the liberal treatment i had received instancing in particular that as the concert had been on that very night many who had indispensible engagements there just made their appearance and then devoted the remainder of the evening to me  a kind of attention he wished to see imitated at manchester nevertheless the fact was as i have related at my coming away i might have had any thing if i would give them a night or two more which i took as it was meant  a mere promise  and declined it as it deserved  it was allowed on all hands i had been very ill treated and it was said as i had failed in the entertainment it should be made up to me in subscription and they hoped if i found that to be the case i would yet in the course of some weeks pay them another visit this i promised to do but passing two months afterward through the place and finding that there was not a single additional name to my subscription i forewent my intention of calling on any person beside the booksellers  and left manchester with an opinion which i am very sorry to be convinced it merits  let me not however be so ungrateful as to neglect saying that from one gentleman  whose name all manchester will recollect without my mentioning it  i received a warm and friendly attention beyond my abilities to describe if he had entreated for a favor to be conferred on himself he could not have been more solicitous more anxious or more industrious indeed i wish i had never gone to manchester for i am sure there are many of those who call themselves his friends whom  after this business  he can never cordially think so i take leave in this place to thank that gentleman and to assure him that no length of time or change of situation shall ever efface his kindness from my memory  the business would have turned out better if it had been undertaken by any body but this gentleman and will it be believed why he knew nothing of music twas in vain that he held out with the greatest goodnature am i obliged to learn sol fa to receive pleasure when i hear an agreeable song mr dibdin ought to have been taken up by the conoscenti who i would lay my life would be the very first to pick a hole in his coat  this and the promised pleasure of the ensuing week when a new organ was to be opened at their concert room deprived me of all the gentlemen musicians mr green who was putting up the organ was a deity among them have you seen him what sort of man is he oh sir he is a wonderful creature in short they were so full of it that i expected to see a portrait of the organ and organmaker in the next manchester print and yet with all this fuss when the grand day came they had not  after such an expense and so long a notice  twothirds of the number that usually attend a common concert at liverpool  the narrowness that characterises the people of manchester is not confined to their pleasures it is evidently apparent in their trade considering them as a community they are like an army of mercenaries at their head are a few individuals of consequence under whom all the rest are doomed to serve in perpetual subordination but liverpool is a corpse of volunteers in which any may rise by industry merit and perseverance to the highest posts some few at manchester must assuredly be immensely wealthy but it is impossible that it can boast within a prodigious sum indeed the aggregate riches of liverpool as therefore the wealth falls comparatively into a few hands  the tradesmanlike plodding routine of whose business is to pay weekly wages and settle short credits  there cannot be the same extension of ideas the same necessity for a large scale of calculation for a competent knowledge of the comparative interests of nations for clear and welldigested general intelligence and all those other important mental requisites which make up the broad comprehensive pursuits of a merchant in short manchester where a small number hoard considerable wealth and the rest are merely paid for their labor cannot on the scale of commerce be put in competition with liverpool where the tide of treasure  like the sea that produces it  rolls in a wide and expansive circulation nor is it more conducive to private and partial advantage than general convenience  men however of these contracted principles generally are strictly honest and possess the lesser virtues with as much punctuality and exactness as they honor a bill of exchange and there can be no doubt but from the timidity attendant on the common moral duties of life and an anxiety to comply as far as men can with the letter of that religion they punctually attend the ceremonies of  by way of example to their children and servants  the humanity so evidently manifest in the present efforts to abolish the slave trade had its rise the motive beyond contradiction is laudable  after examining in my next letter whether the people of manchester get or lose by setting themselves up rather as judges than as lovers of music i shall proceed to investigate their arguments relative to this important subject place those of liverpool by the side of them and see whether their general policy merits that attention from the legislature they expect or whether it has proceeded from that ruling passion which pope says time itself cannot tame and he might have added had he known my friendship any more than it can the sincerity with which i profess to be  truly yours c dibdin london april         letter liii critics and criticisms  the sports of children satisfy the child to the rev mr  dear sir some years ago there was a party of critics who constantly made a point of attending the theaters they were always headed by a chief whom they distinguished by the name of mr town and this gentleman being chosen for his superior adroitness at discovering the faults of authors very gravely  in the name he had the modesty to assume  pronounced the fate of many a trembling poet and composer it happened however after a length of time that indifferent people who really went to the theaters to be pleased and to judge for themselves thought proper to take up the business and a few ineffectual struggles over mr town and his partisans were obliged to leave the field in disgrace and withdraw to pot houses their masters offices or such other obscure retreats from which they originally issued in arrogant expectation of giving the ton to an opulent metropolis in an enlightened age a most ludicrous instance of the dismission of an actor through the fiat of mr town happened in goodmans fields a gentleman was announced for the character of macbeth and went through it with so much reputation that it was agreed to give it out for the following night a miss budgel played lady macbeth and it so happened that during his acquaintance with that lady at the different rehearsals he fell passionately in love with his theatrical wife  which misfortune might not have happened to him had she been his real one during the time of the performance he was more enraptured than ever after it was over standing near her by the side of the scenes receiving her warm compliments and congratulations an actor who had personated one of the witches was sent on the stage to announce a repetition of the performance on the following night the audience the moment the man appeared burst into a loud laugh macbeth could not conceive whence this arose till looking on the stage he saw the actor who had began to arrange himself for the farce with his hair sinely dressed and some of the witches rags hanging about him god bless me cried he it is mighty ridiculous to send this stupid fellow on the stage  what shall we do my dear sir said miss budgel you have nothing for it but to give it out yourself my dear creature returned the charmed macbeth i will do it  my sweet miss budgel  dear charming miss budgel  on he rushed full of the idea of miss budgel and as soon as he could be heard he thundered out ladies and gentlemen to morrow evening  miss budgel will be done over again mr town found something indelicate in this business and poor macbeth was banished from the theater   this party has never been entirely quelled their fury however now vents itself only in bickerings at coffee houses snarling in the box lobby or now and then a squib in the newspapers but this last never happens unless interest be made with the understrappers when the editor is out of the way  for free tickets the performance of now and then a farce and other douceurs have locked up the newspapers from the admission of any strictures relative to the theaters but such as are within the description of mr sheridans list of puffs in the critic lest this last policy however should not be sufficient to insure to the managers all the success it may be convenient to command  for that it has been sometimes thought expedient to accelerate the damnation of pieces i know to be a fact  a formidable phalanx of orderly people are stationed to crush in its infancy every attempt at a riot these have their various tasks assigned them and to say the truth they have often as hard parts to play as those on the stage sometimes it is the duty of these theatrical auxiliaries to make the most disturbances themselves in order to drown one clamor with another an irishman being witness to this and asking a person near him what could induce those people to make such a noise was informed they had all come in with orders well then upon my soul said he i never saw a set of orderly people so riotous in all my life through these and other wise precautions theatrical matters are put upon so desirable a footing that it is not what the town has an opinion of but what the manager through interest  to oblige a favorite or some such equitable motive  chooses to obtrude on the public which we see continually crammed down their throats and which has so perverted the original institution of the drama that it would be as useless to search for morality wit taste genius or any intrinsic requisite of the stage in most of the modern dramatic productions as for charity in the heart of an usurer or truth in the tongue of a hypocrite  scions from this old stock of party seem pretty freely to have spread themselves over most of the towns of consequence in this kingdom playhouse critics however have in the country very little to do for by then they have seen macbeth two or three times break his truncheon  richard start at the ghosts all the men have fallen in love and all the women envied some blooming actress of sixty and a few of the first rate having gone to london for orders and seen the performers there have pronounced the country actors to be damned stuff  expended curiosity dies away and the unfortunate sons and daughters of thespis having stamped roared grinned and squalled as long as any prentice boys are to be found to make up their gallery are obliged to take to their cart and undergo the same humiliation in some other place  musical critics have a great deal more to do an attorneys clerk who can play weidemans minuet joins a mercers apprentice who from frequenting hops has learnt to scrape a little of one of the city waits the attorney decamped  perhaps after being pilloried for perjury and the mercer become a bankrupt the clerk and the apprentice are in business for themselves perhaps one becomes an alderman and the other a town clerk a subscription is now proposed a concertroom is built where the mercer leads and the attorney plays solos the plan is at length extended till in the raceweek at the assizes or some other public season whatever singer happens then to be popular is invited an oratorio performed and messieurs latitat and remnant quit the red tails and the quality binding to emulate  in noise at least  the festivals of the abbey  i really mean no more by my mercer and attorney than the latter would by a and b did he put a case what i have instanced is virtually the fact and it has this operation if it so happen that the lovers of music outnumber the judges  as they call themselves  every thing will be conducted upon a broad liberal plan and the concert do honor to the place by giving encouragement to men of abilities and refining the taste of the inhabitants if on the contrary the judges have a majority it will be carried on upon a narrow jealous contracted scale the music will be injudiciously chosen an unnecessary consequence assumed and at length what was meant as an harmonic meeting will become a scene of confusion till the gentlemen players have no opportunity to display the brilliancy of their superior talents but through the mortifying medium of private meetings at each others houses at liverpool the lovers have the majority twenty  perhaps fifty  to one at manchester i am afraid it goes as strongly in favor of the judges let them therefore take care not to follow the example of leeds where  and i have already shown why  there will not in all probability next year be a concert at all none of this would however be worth a comment if the sports of these children  like the others in the fable of the frogs  was not the death of genius and consequently the cause of stagnating that profession they pretend to encourage  yours very sincerely c dibdin london april         letter live manchester versus liverpool  you have among you many an hired slave  shall i say marry them to your children  let them be free  to the rev mr  dear sir the objections which originated at manchester and which have since extended to a large part of the kingdom against the slave trade are as follow  that it is a disgrace to humanity and a reproach to a nation which boasts the mildest government and professes the justest religion upon earth to buy and sell our fellow creatures  that the english not contented with the prisoners taken in those wars among the different powers o the coast of africa which are provoked by their own jealousies and other private motives irritate the natives to commit partial depredations on each other and thus unnecessarily are the cause of spilling human blood and laying waste the habitations of harmless and peaceable individuals for the purpose of supplying slaves for the markets in the west indies  that these poor wretches are treated with the most inhuman cruelty that on board of ship they are stived down in the hold without the smallest respect to sex or age or any regard to common decency and that if they repine chains whips and thumbscrews bring them to a sense of their miserable condition and the scene often ends with their embracing death to free them from a worse calamity that this cruelty extends throughout the whole term of their slavery which  unless they can raise a sum generally impossible  is for life that they are cartwhipt and treated with much other cruelty under which a white man would expire for the most trivial faults and that four years generally wear out  owing to this reiterated torture  the most robust constitutions among them when they fall willing victims to their dreadful fate which becomes a standing and indelible reproach to the name of englishman  that there have been some instances to the contrary since all the world is not possessed of the same want of feeling that indeed they have been rare but when they have happened the planter has found his first stock become sufficiently numerous to answer all his purposes  for by gentleness and kind treatment they have increased astonishingly and as his humane endeavors have been evidently visited by a blessing from heaven he has amassed immense riches  while the negroes have extolled him as a benefactor whom they expected to find a grievous and oppressive task master  that a planter may take away the life of a slave without being in the smallest degree accountable for his actions  that the guinea trade over and above the other evils which attend it is the destruction of many brave englishmen inasmuch as that the flower of our intrepid tars find a grave upon the coast of africa  that the abolition of this unnatural traffic would be rather a benefit than a disadvantage as to the consumption of our commodities for that we might then have returns in articles the produce of that country  that a total abolition of the slave trade and nothing less would go to a reform of the grievances arising from it for by being convinced that they could no longer recruit their stock from the old market planters would cease to be wantonly cruel and naturally turn their thoughts to the care and preservation of the slaves then upon their hands imitating the single instance of the merciful westindian before mentioned which would produce many great and salutary effects the planter contenting himself with the slaves already in his possession would as the negroes are naturally prolific increase his stock every year also having no more purchasemoney to pay he could in a short time be enabled to part with his sugar and rum cheaper than formerly and thus we could afford to undersell all the other west india islands that these desirable blessings would perpetuate the merciful reign of george the third and finally to the end of time stand forward as as an example of humanity unparalelled in the annals of the world  many other inland towns having caught fire at the long enumeration of grievances sustained and advantages that would arise from the extirpation of the cause of those grievances have to their honor taken up the subject and in a variety of petitions  among which that of sheffield is one of the best written  besought parliament to interpose their authority and put a stop to this growing evil and they hold out what appears to be a strong proof of the handsome disinterestedness of manchester namely that their goods go now to purchase the african slaves whereas they are willing to forego all advantage as dealers rather than be remiss in their duty as men  these petitions look forward to the happy consequences that they say would be derived from so noble an exercise of english philanthropy in them is introduced every argument that generosity can dictate and the most powerful language used to entreat the legislature to protect the savages and to induce the merchants who have an interest in that trade nobly to throw it up with the same greatness of mind in which they have been set so laudable an example by the benevolent inhabitants of manchester  besides the petitioners a number of societies have formed who split the different questions into every possible division but as this would take off from the solemnity of the business and seem as if i wished to supply liverpool with opportuity to introduce palliating subterfuges i shall in my next letter let them meet the question on its present ground after which the reader and i will fairly compare both arguments  which done i shall leave him as a jury to decide upon the merits of the case  mercy upon poor liverpool if the arguments of manchester be found as infallible as that i am  most truly and faithfully yours c dibdin london april         letter lv a vindication  to do a great right do a little wrong to the rev mr  dear sir in reply to these charges liverpool says  that if there can be no reason supported by sound policy legislative necessity or any of those indispensable urgencies which in all politics occasionally introduce a partial and apparent oppression for the sake of general convenience the african slave trade is as it has been represented  an infamous traffic and a disgrace to the national character of the english but if it be made appear that it is perfectly expedient and also that it is a blessing  instead of a misfortune  to the savages whose situations are so loudly and vehemently deplored they conceive the various petitions for its abolition ought to be thrown out  though certainly originating from benevolent intentions  as frivolous and vexatious  that so false is the report that the english provoke wars up the country on the coast of africa for the purpose of purchasing slaves no englishman ever yet returned who ventured five miles from the shore that were the english so inhuman as to meditate any such thing it is perfectly unnecessary the nations on the coast of africa are remarkably prolific and naturally lazy cultivation is scarcely known among them and fishing and hunting procure them the only blessings of life their savage nature is capable of entertaining a conception of there are among them many tribes and they are never without being in some place or other at war the prisoners made in these wars are doomed some to be sacrificed some eaten  for they are cannibals to a man  and some sold these last are purchased by the english the dutch the french the portuguese the spanish the danes and as all the world knows by many other nations do all those go up the country to provoke wars or do they lay in wait for the poor captives who are tricked by the insidious arts of englishmen into unnecessary quarrels bravery and all the generosity attending on it is the characteristic of englishmen why then should their fellow country men load them with such unworthy suspicions but the wars alone do not furnish the slaves sold upon the coast of guinea if a negro have thirty wives they are his slaves so are their children and it is not uncustomary to see a man sell his whole family of the poor devoted wretches taken in war those who are sold are the happiest unless it can be proved that they are treated with all that cruelty which again is rather harshly laid to the charge of englishmen in which case indeed death were desirable these poor wretches are brought forth  such a number are put apart to be eaten at the public sacrifices the rest are carried to market  the refuse of whom which always amounts to a considerable number are beheaded and then  or perhaps alive as a prey to the sharks  thrown into the sea a gentleman from whose mouth this is taken says that a captain farrer after having purchased as many as his ship would conveniently contain saw those he had refused to buy beheaded before his face to the number of sixtytwo  that on board of ship no slave was ever treated but with the greatest mildness and lenity unless he were mutinous in which case common policy will make it necessary to be a little rigorous that the accommodations are studiously laid out for their convenience this i am competent to speak to having myself examined a guineaman with the most minute attention and every effort exerted to preserve them in health and vigor indeed if englishmen had all that ferocity at present attributed to them if they could be hardened enough to gall a poor defenseless slave with chains flog him into sickness and invent new horrors to increase the calamity of his situation  their interest would forbid it they must be madmen to brave an unhealthy clime and expend immense sums to purchase a set of miserable objects merely to exercise on them so much wanton barbarity when the slaves come to the westindian by being repurchased at a higher price it still more behooves their masters to attend to their treatment they are certainly set to work but their labor is not within any degree of comparison equal to that of a farmers man who at the harvest time has not a single hours cessation from binding and carrying from three oclock in the morning till nine at night  whereas a negro can never work but from six to six in short any english labourer is worked much harder  but then the climate why it is congenial to their nature  but the cart whip is nothing they are lazy beyond any thing that can be conceived and if they were not stimulated to it would do nothing but it is a mistake that a planter can whip a negro to death  he must receive but thirtynine lashes and if every one of the thirtynine were ten they would be still nothing to a dozen at the gangway that so far from the planters treating them with any thing but general kindness  for he must not suffer them to get the upper hand of him unless he chooses to have his throat cut  every negro has his little spot of ground from which the markets are supplied with vegetables on a sunday with the produce of which they make little parties of pleasure have their balls and different pastimes and unless it be some few moody malcontents  which are to be found in all states  are as happy as any people under the sun neither is this ground taken away from them  as some assert  when they have brought it to perfection for if this were the case where would they get the money to purchase their freedom which happens every day  in short a negros idea when he is purchased is that he is to be eaten and as nothing can induce him to drive this idea from his imagination  for persuading him to the contrary confirms it the stronger as he thinks he is only told so that he may become cheerful and get fat  therefore they generally come to market very thin which probably has given rise to the report of their being cruelly treated at sea  but when he finds he is only to work and sees himself in the midst of his countrymen who have wives and families and are happy only upon condition that they labor a little he like them buckles to his situation and finds that the bread he regularly earns by industry is sweeter than the precarious subsistence he before picked up  which perhaps was not procured till his poisoned arrow had drank the blood of his countryman  i will not say how far it is expedient by doing a little wrong to do a great right  but we will go on with the reasons of liverpool after i have once more subscribed myself  yours very faithfully c dibdin london april         letter lvi the arguments of liverpool finished  if this be true  as true it seems to be  to the rev mr  dear sir the objections of liverpool to the assertions of manchester go on thus  that certainly those who treat the slaves with the most lenity stand a chance of being best assisted by their services but the instance adduced that they are likely through good treatment alone to grow sufficiently populous for the west indies to need no further supply of them is a most extraordinary assertion it is well known there are very few women brought from africa and many of these through their connections with white men get their liberty this is certainly a subject not to be defended upon rational principles but it is a worldly blessing which the negroes have a very strong relish for and that the fact exists witness all those degrees of complexion under the titles of mulatto mustee etc who at last enjoy the immunities of englishmen and become planters themselves besides it can never be credited that if there were any possible means of keeping up a sufficient stock without a fresh supply that men would lavish away large sums to purchase new slaves merely for the pleasure of treating them ill  that a planter cannot take away the life of a slave without being accountable for his actions the laws formerly were very loose on this subject and murder of this kind has been committed  and so it has in england  with impunity there was always however a heavy fine for this crime and in aggravated cases the punishment was never less than death and what is this but our distinction of manslaughter and murder these laws however before manchester said a word on the subject it was thought necessary to render more rigid and jamaica has already determined to make this crime death without benefit of clergy an act to this effect has since passed but even if these laws did not exist there is an unfeeling cruelty beyond description in a mans coolly sitting down and supposing that his fellow creatures  his countrymen  can depart from those sensations by which alone they deserve to be linked to society and deliberately commit murder to their manifest disadvantage in the moment a poor wretch needs most his pity and compassion merely because that wretch is in his power no animal in the circuit of creation ever took a life but to gratify hunger or satiate revenge to the latter ignoble propensity man most assuredly is too much addicted  but not more in the west indies than in england or any other part of the world nor indeed are englishmen more remarkable for this savage brutality than the inhabitants of any other nation why then in a moment of forward and unnecessary zeal single out the english west india planters in particular as the perpetrators of unprovoked and useless barbarity  which were they capable of they would deserve to be swept from the face of the earth  that nothing can prove so decidedly the superficial and fallacious principles upon which the inhabitants of manchester ground their arguments as their assertion that the guinea trade is the destruction of some of our bravest seaman it is well known that when kings ships are paid off unhappy sailors who have so nobly maintained during a war the glorious naval superiority of englishmen take to bad courses for want of employ and that the gallows groans with those neglected objects of bravery who perhaps a few months before were the dread of their enemies is it wonderful then that those who have the resolution to withstand the temptations which seduced their companions should leave their country  which they must do or starve  upon any terms but this object is scarcely worth contending for  the sailors who man the guineamen are very few of them of this description  they are mostly such wretches as having escaped justice in this country are obliged to fly for it may be fairly averred that the vessels bound to africa by taking such pests of society with them go more to the prevention of depredations on the public than all the watchfulness of the english police to say the truth these ought most to be terrified at the chains in which they are sure to be manacled whenever they treat the slaves with cruelty  that if the assertion be founded  that it would be rather a benefit than a disadvantage to abolish the slave trade because we might then have returns for our commodities in articles the produce of africa it contradicts that which went before for in this case would not the sailors be as likely to find a grave upon that coast in any common trading voyage as by bartering for slaves besides this holds out a sort of argument that the disinterestedness of manchester is not quite so clear as upon the first blush it appeared for if a mutual commerce of produce for produce could be brought about the manchester goods might in that case not only be sold in as large quantities but probably to much greater advantage but after all what is the value of the produce of africa what of consequence have we ever done even with senegal if we could colonize indeed  but then would not the death of the emigrants be an improvement on the cruelty which it is said has stimulated us to carry so many sailors to their graves in that unwholesome country  that a total abolition of the slave trade would shake the very existence of our west india possessions for there cannot be a falser argument than that a stock of slaves is to be kept up without a constant supply from africa and as to the visionary notion of putting them on a footing with hired servants it is too ridiculous to deserve a thought in short were the slave trade put an end to the french and others who at present participate with us upon an equal footing the advantages arising from the produce of the caribbee islands would then come at their produce upon better terms and in greater abundance and thus would one exertion of humanity perfectly laudable in private speculation in its public operation train with it the most pernicious and destructive consequences  these arguments have branched into a multitude of others to which manchester has replied and liverpool rejoined  the material points however are contained in what i have already set down but this controversy has drawn from liverpool a question of certainly much greater magnitude than the slave trade  and it is this were it not wiser and even more humane before we carry our clemency to africa to exert it a little for the relief of that oppression under which our fellow subjects groan at home  some of their observations on this subject which are very pointed shall make up a part of the next letter  this i finish without any farther comment since this important subject is a pending one and will no doubt undergo a full and satisfactory investigation then to say that at any rate the exertions of manchester are praiseworthy and if their prayer had gone no further than to a correction of abuses not one word would or could have been said against it for in that case the reasonableness of their demand would have been as evident as that i am  yours with the most perfect sincerity c dibdin london april         letter lvii a proof that there are more slaves than those upon the coast of africa  charity begins at home to the rev mr  dear sir i shall now speak to the grievances which exist at home and are said by liverpool to have thrown such a shadow over the present soi disant philanthropic exertions as almost totally to eclipse them  these are comprehended in a general abuse and wilful perversion of the spirit of our laws hence all the distresses to harmless and industrious families by kidnapping and pressing for the army and navy through which deserted wives and children are committed to the care of merciless overseers and unthinking boys in time of peace flogged to death for desertion an instance of this kind lately occurred which plainly evinces that if the laws of this country are mild the execution of them is cruelly rigourous in the course of last month at dover a lad of eighteen was sentenced to receive a thousand lashes for desertion they had given him five hundred when  in terms of the most moving supplication  he implored a respite of the remainder of his sentence crying out in accents scarcely utterable through the violence of his agony that his heart was breaking and he should die under it if they flogged him any longer  regardless however of his entreaties they continued their unmerciful work till at the end of six hundred and fifty lashes  perceiving him actually dying  they removed him to the guardhouse where he expired the next morning query whether this is not at least a march for any cruelty that has been practiced in the west indies there is certainly great opportunity for abuses to creep into martial laws and it originates from this those who are most likely to commit crimes cannot be tried by their peers thus private soldiers and foremast men are generally punished with rigor and the crimes of officers too often palliated and softened into errors my brother assured me the following is a fact a strange eccentric fellow who was a cooks mate on board a man of war among other singularities used to amuse the sailors with tricks on the cards cups and balls and other feats of legerdemain the captain  who was not blessed with a very brilliant understanding  instead of seeing this matter in the harmless light it deserved found in his idea something very reprehensible in it the sailor was ordered into his presence and told that he had heard strange things of him have you indeed your honor said jack what are they sir if i may be so bold why said the captain they say you are a conjuror lord bless your honor answered the tar why then if that is the case they says strange things of your honor of me you rascal why what you impudent dog do they say of me why they says and please your honor as how your honor is no conjuror this though there was no offense in it from the heart ought to have procured the sailor at least a reprimand if not a slight punishment  for certainly the barrier of subordination ought never to be overleaped the captain however determined upon a more complete revenge than was then in his power dismissed him with a smile  but from that moment privately set him down in his black book no effectual opportunity occurred to gratify this smothered revenge till the sailor having got drunk ashore neglected to return at the appointed time with his companions this being the moment the captain wished for poor jack was tried for desertion and sentenced to be keel hauled when he was brought forward to suffer his sentence he begged leave to speak to the captain  to whom he said i am sentenced your honor to undergo a very heavy punishment though i have done nothing to deserve it but i have been tried by a court martial of captains  had i been an officer my tricks upon the cards would have been a genteel amusement my crimes all errors and my slaying ashore a frolic god bless you sir and all the harm i wish you is that for the next crime your honor commits you may be tried by a court martial of foremast men  and now for davy joness locker saying which words he jumped overboard hence all the injuries sustained by the constitution owing to smuggling through which the fair trader fails and the nesarious one becomes opulent certainly this fact exists  through which the exciseman keeps his horse and his girl and spends five hundred a year though he receives from government but fifty i saw myself a letter from an exciseman to a captain of a ship in which were these words sir i understand you want to land some goods on friday in the afternoon therefore at that time i shall contrive to be three miles off on government business  through which are levied shop and other grievous taxes whose produce the customs and excise alone would yield were they not defrauded by those who smuggle and others who countenance smugglers  and through which a few halfankers of brandy are seized by consent to cover the running of valuable goods to an immense amount hence come all the evils arising from imprisonment for debt through which an unmerciful creditor has been known to decide upon the liberty property and even life of an oppressed debtor instead of commenting on this subject in a note i shall reserve it to make up my next letter  through which attorneys swarm in this country like locusts  through which the villain is sure to escape and the unfortunate man to be punished  through which rogues in prison banquet in luxury and innocent men envying the milder lot of felons petition to be transported to botany bay this instance happened about a twelvemonth ago  the debtors in newgate seeing the preparations for transporting the felons to botany bay petitioned to go with them and lastly  for were i to enumerate all the instances they adduce and the variety of partial evils arising from them the remainder of this publication would not contain them  hence come the inefficacy of the penal laws through which thieves thrive in the neighborhood of justice  through which informers who are the only instruments to put the laws in force are deemed infamous  through which justice is made a trade and lawless bandittis are every thing but protected by those whose duty it is to exterminate them this is a field on which mr clough  of whom i had formerly the honor to speak  would largely expatiate his doctrine was that thieves are encouraged by the runners of rotation offices till  as they express it  their time is come and to inure them to their certain fate they make a point of attending executions he tells a story of one of these who used to be so much favored as now and then to be permitted for love to help jack ketch to adjust the knot when his own hangingday arrived with all imaginable unconcern he looked up at the clock and said to one of his companions i say george i think we are rather late today his stories of the placid indifference with which these poor wretches submit to their fate were numerous and every one of them proved that it strong habit and example had not confirmed in them a belief as rivetted as that of soldiers and sailors as to their fate in battle that they were predestined to the gibbet many of them by being roused to their rational duties through the vigilance of the police might have become useful members of society  but the magistrates themselves know that as other children learn something to give the man idea of religion and morality so those in st giless are taught to lisp out the exploits of their fathers and nothing is so common as to hear a boy of five years old talk of dying game i shall select one more of mr cloughs stories to finish this note  a poor fellow whose irons had just been knocked off in the pressyard was seen to whimper upon which mr akerman  who bears the character of a thinking and considerate man  pleased probably to see an unexpected example of feeling in one who had always appeared very hardened asked him with great kindness what troubled him  saying that any thing in his power that could alleviate this distress for the few short moments he had to live he should be welcome to  as to your fate said he you seemed a few minutes ago to be very resigned to it lord love you replied the poor wretch sniveling tis not that  as to hanging it is as well now as another time  but i have not sixpence to buy a natty nightcap  and a man you know master akerman may as well go dessent out of the world  but i should not mind it so much if that ned nubbing cheat had not refused to lend me his  and that you know was damned illnatured for he cannot want it till next sessions     all these the people of liverpool are of opinion require a reform  not that they would wish any amendment that might go to the extirpation of the laws for they are evidently a benefit though their execution may be an evil and they conclude what they have offered on this subject by saying that though they would recommend a cure of home abuses as a project of amore sane and rational nature rather than a reform on the coast of africa yet should the present complainants be really able to point out any abuses in the slave trade and hit upon an expedient that may go to their redress they will be the first to offer them their public thanks not from any ostentation of greater liberality than their neighbors but because in that case they will have done a desirable and material service to the community in general and in particular to the inhabitants of liverpool  in this state i leave the subject of the slave trade it was in some degree my duty to report as much as i knew of it and it would have exceeded my duty to say whose arguments are the most worthy attention the only circumstance i can speak to from my own conviction is the accommodations on board the guineamen which are wonderfully calculated for the comfort and convenience of the slaves indeed the crew and even the officers themselves are very ill accommodated merely that the whole ship may be appropriated to the use of those objects on whose health and good treatment certainly depend the success of their voyage  yours very truly c dibdin london april          letter lviii a distinction between law and equity  a lawyers is an honest employment  so is mine like me too he acts in a double capacity  for rogues and against them to the rev mr  dear sir however expedient however wise however salutary may be the political justice of the laws respecting debtor and creditor in this country nothing can teem with more moral infamy than their execution a detension of the person has been thought by every wise man to be oppressive and even impolitic but i will not go upon that the laws warrant or at least tolerate it and i shall hardly betray so much folly as to offer a sentiment on what will never be effected till law lords cease to dictate on subjects that wholly apply to their own interest though the very same plea is at all times sufficient to render the testimony of a witness inadmissible in the courts  any man who will make oath to a debt of ten pounds may arrest another and if he cannot give bail to the action put him in jail it is not necessary that there be such debt in actual existence for if any accounts have passed between the two persons and there should be only a balance of twenty shillings an oath may be legally made of the whole let the amount be ever so large and when the debtor is once in jail it will take five terms to bring the matter to a final issue provided the creditor choose so long to procrastinate the dispute thus a man who only owes twenty shillings may in this country be imprisoned a year and a quarter lose his time and reputation pay fifty pounds for law and emancipate from his confinement a beggar  whereas common reason says that the creditor ought to have been compelled in the first instance to state the account fairly and receive his due without having it in his power to indulge an indignant and implacable revenge from which motive alone could spring a wish to harrass a fellow creature for the pleasure of contemplating his sufferings but it will be asked whether creditors in general are so unnecessarily oppressive and if they are what can induce them to it my answer is there are three times the number of attorneys that can honestly get employ in this kingdom from this it arises that when one of them is consulted instead of healing a breach  which is his duty  he makes it wider for indeed he must do so or starve vengeance is always advised instead of compassion and this must be gone about in the most expensive way possible that they may more completely hamper the poor devil who has the misfortune to come under their hands the action commenced  the next object is to serve it in as disgraceful and inconvenient a manner as possible  for lawyers as naturally study the interest of bailiffs as physicians do that of the apothecaries by this means they look out for red letter days and such other adventitious means as may put it as much as possible out of the power of the poor debtor to escape till  to use their own words  every man has had a leg or a wing to explain myself we will suppose saturday and monday red letter days  the defendant in this case is always arrested on a friday  but not before six oclock in the evening thus though he be prepared to give bail or pay the money he cannot be released till the following tuesday  because the intervention of the two holidays and the sunday preclude all possibility of searching the office though at the moment of the caption fifty to one but they know that there is nothing else against him during the four days he is in custody to a certainty every art is used  nine times out of ten by the attorney but always by the bailiffs  to induce other creditors to lay detainers against him at length after accumulated disgrace mortification and expense by signing notes cognovits and warrants of attorney he purchases a temporary liberty at an immoderate disadvantage  and after finding it impossible to fulfill these engagements so extorted he goes to prison for life at the will of the creditor if he be advised to resign himself to exonerate his bail he is told that if his creditors do not proceed in such a number of terms he can get a complete release from their power by superseding their actions this advice taken and a release obtained after a tedious imprisonment he is just where he set out and may be sued again on every debt for which he was imprisoned which is sure to happen if he have any thing to pay the costs if the creditor go on to execution the prisoner is certainly locked up for life and the instances of disease famine and suicide in consequence which are apparent in more than that of john smith and his wife who cut their childrens throats and hung themselves prove pretty strongly that in this country a creditor may have a virtual power over the life of a debtor in which case i do not see why he should not be like shylock not only obliged to relinquish his demand but forfeit a part of his own property for the service of the state then in vain might he retort nay take my life and all he would be answered how shall thou hope for mercy rendering none   at the time lord effingham  with a benevolence that will reflect on him lasting honor  ineffectually owing to the interference of the law lords attempted a reform on this subject he gathered together many well attested cases to strengthen his arguments and prefaced them by saying that every case was a deep tragedy  more were in preparation for him and one of them i know to be truth it was this a man in the year eightythree was five hundred pounds in debt an attorney a partner and a bailiff by false reports brought all his real creditors against him and added fictitious ones till having been in prison two years he obtained a release upon supersedeases from debts for which he could again be sued and having paid upwards of six hundred pounds for law he found himself between seven and eight hundred pounds in debt though in the interim he had not contracted a single new one one of these fictitious debts is worth notice this man was arrested for a debt he did not owe the account on which it was pretended to arise having long before been liquidated  he went to trial and obtained a verdict in his favor the plaintiff when an execution came to be sued out for the costs was in prison the defendant therefore was obliged to pay his own costs in this unjust action which amounted to seventeen pounds in short when a man delivers himself implicitly into the hands of an attorney there is no advantage that may not be taken of him and with safety for let the attorney undertake what he pleases the client is obliged to acquiesce and for god sake what man of common plain understanding unacquainted with all the different and equivocating constructions of the law can guard against the consequences that are sure to attend even a winning cause a plain wellintentioned farmer who appeared to be blessed with strong intellectual faculties once set this matter very clear in the court of kings bench on a trial before lord mansfield an action was brought to ascertain some privileges concerning the boundaries of two parishes upon which a great deal of money was spent to elucidate a question which was not of threepence consequence to either party in the course of the trial lord mansfield having taken notice of some strong pointed observations which had fallen from the farmer above mentioned he begged leave to ask him a few questions merely for information concerning the customs of overseers and other officers who manage the parish money the farmer with great cheerfulness appeared ready to satisfy him and his lordship said in the course of your evidence i think you noticed that the parish money was very often improperly applied  now i do not mean to insinuate that you would be likely to misuse it but as you mentioned that you were once churchwarden if you have no objection i should wish to hear what was done with the money at that time why my lord said the farmer the money was worse applied while i was churchwarden than ever i knew it in my life indeed said his lordship i should be glad to know how why my lord said the farmer i will tell you a gentleman who had lived some time among us went into yorkshire where he died in his will he bequeathed about an hundred and twenty pounds to the poor of our parish we appiied for it often and often but twould not do  the executors and the lawyers and one or another were glad enough to keep the money in their hands for you know my lord it is an old saying that might can overcome right well we did not know what to do and i came to your lordship for advice you were then counselor murray i remember my lord you advised us to file a bill in chancery we did so and after throwing a great deal of good money after bad we got i think they call it a decree and such a decree it was that when all expenses were paid i reckon we were about an hundred and seventyfive pounds out of pocket now my lord i leave you to judge whether the parish money was not likely to be worse employed while i was churchwarden than ever i knew it before what then must be a losing one look at the common expenses of the most trifling trial and see what fortune can make a stand against going often to law no no let every man be wary how he is imposed upon but when he is so let him sit down contented with the first loss he may easily cure the sting of one hornet but what a plight he must be in if he be unwise enough to rouse the whole nest but a lawyers is an honest employment says peachum i wish it was half so honest as i am sincere when i assure you that i am  very faithfully yours c dibdin london april          letter lix the tour enlarged  a poor petty larceny rascal  he goes off the next sessions to the rev mr  dear sir from manchester i returned to sheffield where on the following week this tour was put to press  the dates of the letters will show how much of it was at that time written having inspected the first sixtyfour pages which  except one or two half sheets  is all i have had opportunity to examine i went to leeds where with the advantage of lady mexboroughs name i had a very good night at the assemblyroom on monday february the eleventh my friend warburton also acquainted me it was very much the wish of mr fawkes that i might have another night at york this i confess i had no great relish for but knowing well the powerful influence of mr fawkes and how much the inhabitants of that dull region are obliged to the taste and fashionable elegance of mrs fawkes for teaching them how to distinguish what ought to amuse them and set them examples of polished manners and finished good breeding i did myself the honor to call on that gentleman who assuring me his utmost interest should be used to make a night worth my while it was fixed for thursday february the twentyeighth and in the interim i went on to durham and newcastle passing durham i arrived at newcastle on friday the fifteenth and the next day after delivering a recommendatory letter to a gentleman of some consequence who like the irishman at bath promised great things and did nothing i waited on the mayor and began my attack in form i performed four times with very nearly as bad success as at manchester the kind way however in which mr hodgson the printer testified his concern for what he was pleased to think want of taste in the people of newcastle was truly flattering and obliging he put a paragraph in his newspaper to induce a better attendance and he was indefatigable in promoting the subscription i here thank him for his handsome and gentlemanly treatment of me  i had trifled away ten days at newcastle when i was determined to repass durham and get on to york for this purpose i setout on sunday the twentyfourth but the weather being remarkably disagreeable i went no farther than durham that night and having seen mr ebdon the organist of the cathedral whose candid and untheoretical sentiments greatly pleased me i resolved  as i had to play with my time till the following thursday  that i would stay and see what monday night would produce it not only greatly exceeded my expectations but i was entreated to perform a second time which turned out to be nearly as productive as the first  during the time i was at durham i had many kindnesses shown me which i would more particularly notice but that my tour is hastening to its close those that were public i received from dr cooper  which has been a fortunate name to me  mr bird mr smith and several others whose names are in the list of subscribers the private ones from mr ebdon  for i never acknowledge any thing as kindness but what is meant as an unaffected intention to please and oblige as to familiarity unnecessary and illassumed consequence and invitations to dinner merely to sport a sideboard it never yet had any attractions for me and therefore if any person at durham should recognize this for the portrait of his conduct let it be a secret between him and me  but let him also endeavor to persuade himself that every man who accepts his acquaintance upon those terms laughs at him in his sleeve  master hoult at the red lion seemed anxious to be celebrated in this tour i am willing to tell the truth which i dare say is all he desires he appeared very anxious to please and undertook to give his sister at northallerton a caution how she treated me on my return as that lady had been so accommodating on my road to durham from york to put me into a damp bed what the caution was i will not pretend to say but certainly she gave me horses that knocked up between northallerton and easingwould as to himself he saw i had two tolerable nights and thought i suppose he had a right to his share of them  for having left the bargain concerning the room to a sort of eventual decision though there could be no such virtual construction put on it he adhered to his bond as rigidly as shylock i had a part of the tour with me which he read and i remember appeared charmed with my account of jemmy wallis at newark if he conceived he merited a similar panegyric he will now see he and i are of different opinions  on my return to york the business of thursday night was so spoken of that i really thought out of compliment to the lady who had taken so much pains  and in obliging whom the inhabitants by the way would have paid themselves a compliment  that i should have found reason to change my tone i remember it was suggested to me that i should be obliged to rewrite that letter where speaking of cities i put york in so unfavourable a point of view not a bit the night though it proved to the clearest demonstration the weight and consequence of mrs fawkess name only confirmed me the stronger in my belief of their general shabbiness for i had not a promiscuous audience but a party of ninetynine persons which is an astonishing number to be brought through one interest to an assemblyroom in the country  a very extraordinary adventure happened to me at this time a decent man came into the parlour in which i was sitting at the inn and after the most confused unconnected preface that can be imagined told me i had been innocently the cause of injuring him with the people of york i begged to know how and he informed me that his business in that place was to deliver an entertainment somewhat similar to mine but that of course he was silenced by my arrival he then entered into a description of his distresses in most pathetic language calling himself a ruined clergyman saying he was driven to the last despair and that he had frequently been on the point of shooting himself at length calling me out of the room he said the smallest trifle would be of infinite service to him and entreated i would lend him half a crown this i gave him without hesitation and at his request also a ticket for the performance and he went his way when i came to examine his bills i found them so worded that he might have been mistaken for me he had followed exactly in my track and announced nothing more than that the gentleman who had some time before at such and such a town given his readings and music meant to repeat that entertainment and i afterward learnt that at hull and beverly he entertained his audience with nothing more than the same lively picture of his distresses till they consented to go home and leave their money behind them  i should not have mentioned this here or at all  especially the business of the half crown  had not mr blanchard the printer  who is another of my favorites  come soon after into the room when upon giving directions for some bills on the morrow something induced him to notice that there was a strange kind of man who had made some application to him to print bills  but said he he made use of an odd recommendation for he said he was in the greatest distress in short listening to mr blanchards account i heard every word that had just been repeated to me by the ruined clergyman which ended with the old request of the half crown which was of course given to him this brings to my recollection an anecdote of dr johnson which has certainly escaped all his biographers though it be nevertheless truth  at least if i may believe dr goldsmith who told me so on the very day that he said it happened goldsmith and davis the bookseller called one morning on dr johnson and found him in company of a man not only very worthless in his character but one who had been forward in abusing the doctor himself they saw him as this man went away put something in his hand  upon which goldsmith expostulated with him saying no wonder such vipers got a living when they could be fostered by the very hand they wounded fie doctor said he this man is one of the most infamous rascals that ever existed i have nothing sir said the doctor to do with the mans vices  he asked me for half a crown and i gave it him but said mr blanchard i should have let the half crown business die had i not afterward had reason to believe he is an impostor of some consequence  for a very little time after i saw him bowling along in a post chaise alone and having the curiosity to ask the landlord where he baited whither he was going i found the chaise was to take him twentytwo miles  this gentleman attended at the room and what became of him ultimately i know not but he was certainly taken out by some man he had swindled and who had followed him from another town  thus after having been so frequently taken for an impostor myself i at last met with a person who was really one and this petty larceny rascal after all was probably in many places more respected here i recall to mind your kind letter now printed and the several friendly remarks you have since made  all which convince me how much credit i do myself in so often assuring you that i am  yours very truly c dibdin london april          letter lx a thankful adieu to liverpool  hail dear retirement to the rev mr  dear sir having returned to sheffield and given directions for advertising three nights at liverpool i repaired thither and arrived on tuesday the fourth of march as i necessarily passed through manchester i thought i might as well make some enquiry concerning the subscription which would of course set me to rights as to the attention that had been paid me in my absence finding as i before represented that not a single name had been added to the list i thought it would be a folly to see manchester any more  at liverpool  the only place in all my tour to which i returned to any good purpose  i had six handsome nights taking the average of them and it gave me pleasure to announce that i should finish my career in that spirited town my reception was certainly flattering to an excess  if i could have dined in ten places at once liverpool is remarkable of course for fine turtle a gentleman who is well known for distinguishing the best morsels received two cards of invitation to dinc on a turtle the same day at the same hour after balancing for some time which he should accept he determined to dine at both places to manage this he waited on the stewards of one feast and represented what an awkward hour they had chosen for their dinner  what an absurdity said he to dine at three oclock people who are on business all the morning will be starved besides all the world is getting into early hours now the stewards in short consented to have the dinner at two this point gained he posted away to the other stewards  good god said he what could possess you to appoint your dinner at three oclock  we shall not have done upon change  our appetites will not be half up  besides how unfashionable  all the world is getting into late hours in short when people meet at a feast business is over and therefore you should always have it as late as you can here also he carried his point repairing to the dinner at two oclock he stuffed unmercifully  when having previously ordered himself to be called out he went home took an emetic and appeared in high spirits at the other feast which had to oblige him been appointed at sour to keep my consistency however perfectly clear this gentleman is not a merchant  but a physician i should have been welcome and indeed kindness of this sort came so thick that i was obliged to decline all invitations lest i should be incapacitated from affording that entertainment for which purpose i went among them  on tuesday the eleventh i attended at their concert and declare that i heard two acts from the messiah performed much more respectably than i could have conceived mr meredith and miss harwood are known to have much merit in this style of singing mr wiltons precision and care in leading the band cannot be too much praised and mr wainwright conducted the chorusses in a very able and spirited style and also in a very delicate way gave us the second of handels concertos i have already noticed how expert the singers of yorkshire and lancashire are at chorusses those who performed them the night i speak of at liverpool did handel as much credit as if they had been drilled by mr joah bates which between seven and eight hundred persons who were present can testify  were i to speak fully of the attention paid me at liverpool i should have nothing else to say as therefore those who were so forward to please and serve me are the least conscious of it  the whole sum of their kindness being no more than the common exercise of that liberality which so remarkably characterises them  i must content myself with feeling that which i cannot properly describe  i quitted liverpool on friday the fourteenth of march having the night before exhibited myself as a public character for the last time passed on through birmingham in my way to bristol whither i went on private business spent three or four days with my friend boyton and finally arrived in london on saturday the twentysecond  my running account of places inns etc and a few more gleanings will now wind up my tour  previous to which however i shall go into the business of my negotiation with mr harris and endeavor to account for its failure this i shall enter upon in my next letter that done my last remarks on the subject of music will naturally introduce a statement of my pieces and the profits which arose from them thus every letter will lessen the frequency  though never the pleasure  with which i assure you i am  most cordially yours c dibdin london april          letter lxi theatrical matters   time was when my approach  had made a little holiday  to the rev mr  dear sir you already know the nature of my application to mr harris in march      and the substance of the answer i received from york in the following october i sent that gentleman a musical farce telling him that i had a firstpiece nearly ready and three other afterpieces which in a very short time i could perfect and also some good materials for pantomimes  i will confess to you that i chose to send the piece i set the least store by first  for i have unfortunately upon these occasions a sort of presentiment and my feelings at that time i am free to declare did not very much lead me to place any great faith in mr harriss sincerity it was however a farce that as times go covent garden need not have been ashamed of mr harris returned one act of it saying it was taken from the french and like sir john vanbrughs country house therefore it would not do but that whenever i would send any thing completed that would be of service to the theater he should be glad to treat with me but not for hints or detached music for that they were crowded with unappropriated music by the best composers i wrote him an answer to his letter saying i should be glad of the other act of the farce  that i was sorry he thought indifferently of it  that i certainly took partly the idea of it from a french piece but i had not literally translated a single speech nor had i ever read vanbrughs country house therefore it could not be so like either as to make his objection a substantial one for it was very easy to show from whence almost every piece that had appeared for some years was taken and one might venture to add the same of those which would appear for some years to come i went on saying that i hoped he and i should agree better on what i should next send i begged however that he would explain himself in one point if he meant by the word completed that he expected me to send music as well as words i certainly could not consent to it as i thought i ought to be considered as perfectly competent to decide on its merits myself  that i desired fairly and honorably to be understood to mean exactly what i had asserted that i was going to india and wished very much to leave something behind me to have my fame remembered  for which i should never stand candidate again i said that when i wrote to him some years ago on the same subject he thought that hints or any thing else from me would be valuable to him and that i really did not believe my rivals had since given him reason to alter his opinion i had a variety of materials which would certainly be useful and indeed he must think so otherwise why crowd his theater with unappropriated music  for i flattered myself i had no right to be considered as an inferior master in short i told him if he thought i could leave him nothing that would be of advantage to him it would be a folly for us to have a single moments further trouble on the subject  this was the substance of my letter to which at grantham five weeks afterward i received an answer and the second act of the farce  mr harris said he was sorry i had the trouble of sending again for the second act  it had been mislaid by an accident  he had only to repeat to me that any work i might send completed should be read with attention and without delay and if found likely to succeed he should readily treat with me for the purchase of it  but not for any unappropriated or detached music  this letter determined me to let nothing out of my hand till i had come at a fair explanation of the word completed and to do this i once more wrote to mr harris telling him that till he should please to explain that word matters must stand in statu quo for that i could not consent to send music for inspection  having received no answer to this letter not even when i arrived in london the first thing i did was to take my final leave of mr harris in a letter a copy of which shall be transcribed for your perusal after i have once more subscribed myself  your very faithful and obliged friend c dibdin london april          letter lxii an adieu to the theater  the post of honor is a private station to the rev mr  dear sir i shall now lay before you my letter to mr harris  to thomas harris esquire sir i have waited three months  which is something more than good manners allows  for an answer to my last letter but as that quality makes no part in the etiquette of a manager your silence excites in me no wonder it speaks however pretty emphatically and tells me  which i really did not think in this instance  that you have been near a twelvemonth laughing at me in the month of march last i wrote to you offering to sale such materials as i had by me or could finish before i should quit england you encouraged me in answer to send either pantomimes firstpieces or afterpieces completed of this indefinite expression i have since repeatedly entreated an explanation telling you that if you expected me to send music for inspection i could not agree to it  nor would i believe any man in his senses advise me the only answer i have received from you is a reiteration of the word without any elucidation of it and upon my pressing you three months ago for a final answer you think proper to drop all correspondence with me i shall therefore take the liberty in this letter  which you will be charmed to hear is the last you will receive from me  to say that it is impossible but you must have a predetermined resolution not to accept any thing of mine  had i gone upon the extensive sense of the word completed i must have sent you models for pantomimes as well as the stories and the music  and to what end to have had my pains requited by a refusal and hints taken from the materials not by you however i acquit you of any such idea  but your people barren of genius would have been happy to catch at any thing original as to music  i must have been mad to have sent any  that would have been a glorious feast indeed for your compilers  still without your knowledge for they would find no difficulty in passing it on you for theirs i once imposed on you as completely though not so nefariously myself i certainly the first season after i returned from france took a particular pleasure in implicitly complying with every request you made me and this is i suppose what you meant when at the end of that season you said something very handsomely in a letter of my zeal for the interests of the theater during the getting up of the touchstone you desired me to remove a tune and make a new one in its stead it was my full intention to have been as complaisant in this instance as the rest but having an engagement i forgot it till the next morning there being no time to get it ready when i came to the theater before the rehearsal and in fouless the copist room i made some trifling alteration in the accompaniments and marked the tune to be played a tone higher i frequently did this with garrick  for why should one be dictated to by the absurd observations of men without cars who give unnecessary trouble to show their own consequence as to the melody there was not a note altered and every body but yourself knew it to be the same tune thus their remarks that it was better  meaning the alteration  your coinciding with them  thinking it a new tune  and my acquiescence with both made as good an equivoque as ever mr okeefe introduced into any of his pieces  you must have known that i meant not to have sent you music subject to inspection but that you should take it upon my promise that it would be original and the best i could make nay i particularly marked that in what i left behind me i should look to my professional fame in the strictest manner upon this footing you certainly did not think proper to receive my productions  otherwise you would not have trifled with me  the conclusion is you either think my abilities impaired or that i have not now so much zeal for the interest of the theater as i had ten years ago  it is evident i cannot now write any thing to please you for you return every thing i send you whereas formerly  and i can show your own hand writing to prove it  you admit the merit of six pieces sent at one time  all of which it is true had success see the statement of pieces   will not the world be apt to think that the decay is rather in your judgment than in my abilities you very well know and i believe have allowed that i have as little of arrogance as to my productions as any man and yet i cannot but be alive to what i hear every day it has been my good fortune in the course of the last twelvemonth to see the public a little face to face and it happens to have been that part of the public which in great measure makes up your boxes  and they assure me to an individual that i greatly improve both as an author and a composer you will therefore excuse me if i rather credit my benefactors than you  this allowed it can be nothing more than that in your opinion my zeal for the interest of the theater slackened if vamping up old matter by giving it a new face if introducing stale hackneyed tunes and passages to the disgrace of taste and the total exclusion of genius and originality or if a servile obedience to the ipse dixit of the manager against the evidence of plain reason and common sense be zeal for the interest of the the theater  away with such zeal  i will have none on it  and for this i believe i shall again be praised by the public  i should not have written this letter but have let the whole business die away  for it otherwise had been scarcely worth a thought  had i not been accused by many opulent and respectable characters of having in some way so deported myself as to have made it impossible for managers to treat with me otherwise i could not set up as an excuse for going to india my having been driven from the theater  i am sure you will allow that i have fairly stated the matter and that there is nothing between us but a difference of opinion concerning the meaning of a very common word which like touchstones if has so operated as to prevent any thing coming of our negotiation in the course of which we have both acted in our situations i have as dependants should entreated  and you have not deigned to answer  my time therefore being so short as to make all accommodation impossible  and indeed were it longer nothing should shake my resolution of having done with the theater  i shall finish this letter  which i dare say has sufficiently tired you  with a most serious and solemn assurance that as a man i have and ever had the highest respect for you  that i have to thank you for a thousand instances of attention and politeness and the part of your conduct wherein i had only to consider you as a private gentleman was ever handsome and manly and this opinion you may remember i felt and professed at the very moment those around you falslely persuaded you i had written a libel against you a pamphlet was published in the year      called coalition or theatrical monopoly i really know not which it abused mr harris and i was said to be the author mr harris was undeceived and behaved very handsomely upon it some of his privy counselors however now are the same who were then   feeling these sentiments let me conjure you as a manager to open your eyes  banish every thing from your stage that can check the growth of genius  let not quaintness tricks and shifts usurp the place of weeping taste and desponding originality in short with the manager blend the man  so shall judgment rear its fostering standard and covent garden be no longer the fountain of caprice but the source of real merit  yet think not in this arrangement i affect to include myself  for i declare upon my veracity and let the world judge of its validity as i adhere to the declararion or recede from it that half the profits of your theater should not bribe me to return i am sure never was the post of honor more a privater station than at present  sir adieu   though i have considered it as a duty incumbent on me to write you this letter be assured i do not mean it in any respect to breathe rancour you have seen how i make the distinction and i once more assure you that as a man and a gentleman you have not in the world a truer advocate or a sincerer wellwisher than  your most obedient servant c dibdin london march          this matter has thus terminated and through you i give to the public a strong fact  which is worth a thousand arguments as a proof that every man who thinks independently must lay his account to having no concern with the theater mr sheridan has the boldness to say in the critic that very few go through the fatigue of thinking for themselves if so we have only to lament that stage maneuvers are not as honest as they are ingenious and that the first dramatic writer of the day holds out fallacy as the principal ingredient in a theatrical composition that he has as little of originality in the plots of his pieces as mr cumberland  against whom he seems to head the whole force of his satire  is certain i do not mean however to accuse him of imbecility  he has genius equal to any thing but the generality of english audiences have been so used to cayenne and high cookery that he knew plain nature would stand no chance among them he is however the only man who has ventured to impose upon them and tell them so in the same breath but the english have such a redundancy of good nature that if a man arrogates a superiority supporting his pretensions at the same time with any formidable show of ability their characteristic benevolence is at once appealed to and they implicitly give him credit for the very merit he asssures them he possesses  thus men who have the constancy and resolution to climb any given height atchieve the task they have set themselves by adding perseverance and intrepidity to strong intellectual endowments strengthened by intense wary and correct observation there is however a want of feeling in this  it is a sort of poaching for fame  while the fair hunters cheated of his prey i know you think it a sort of dramatic sacrilege to attack the works of mr sheridan and this will in my next letter put me upon a cursory view of them for if i were capable of advancing any thing i could not prove i should be unworthy your friendship and have told you a falsity every time i have asserted that  i am sincerely yours c dibdin london april          letter lxiii a bold undertaking  one man may steal a horse better than another look over the hedge to the rev mr  dear sir a few words on mr sheridans dramatic works and adieu to the theater  except such circumstances relative to it as will necessarily come out in my statement of pieces  the rivals has had the least success and yet it is the most original of all his pieces it was nearly damned on the first night and mr sheridan  profiting by the experience with which its reception furnished him  withdrew it with this remark i have now got the last and it shall be my fault if i dont make the shoe to fit next time his labor however being only coblers work it required too much of method for his volatile genius to buckle to and we may venture to pronounce without any great outrage on probability that had not mr sheridan so much influence in the theater the rivals would never have made its appearance a second season it is a neat well written piece but has that sort of cold correctness which will not go to the galleries the incident from the nutbrown maid though written with great sweetness and delicacy is no more proper for the theater than the fine strokes of a miniature painter would be in the finishing of flats and wings  all this perhaps inducing mr sheridan to think with the chairman in relation to pope he produced the duenna  where there is not a single new situation from beginning to end the whole plot of turning the daughter out of doors and passing the maid for the mistress is conjointly the scicelienne of moliere and il filosofo di campagna  where every circumstance is to be found from the serenade at the beginning to the marriage at the end the other plot is the wonder  which the moment it is told must be obvious to every body  because every body knows both pieces not even any single subordinate circumstance is original father paul is marmontels philosophe soi disant  who as he eats delicacies talks of the roots of the earth  and as he drinks burgundy praises the wholesome crystal stream the dialogue is by no means brilliant but mr sheridan was determined it should penetrate every where and in particular the aside speeches of isaac  showing beforehand how clearly he shall himself be taken in by his different attempts to deceive others is the most artful species of anticipation that ever was practiced and shows a judgment of theatrical effect powerful new and extraordinary  the school for scandal is no more original than the duenna the school itself is congreves cabal and the play may fairly be called a sequel to the way of the world the scandal has all been detailed in different pieces but principally in the plain dealer when in novel lord plausible olivia and eliza will be found sir benjamin crab lady sneerwell and mrs candor the brothers have been in a variety of things from the adelphi to mr cumberlands fashionable folly  but the squire of alsatia on the stage and blifil and tom jones in the closet are the closest resemblances the uncle lately returned from abroad and introduced to the drunken company is extremely like the the intriguing chambermaid the circumstance of the uncles picture is in a french piece called lecole de la jeunesse and joseph and lady teazle  are constant and lady brute  mr sheridan has said that there is not a new character or incident  and all that can be done is to take old matter and give it a novel appearance had he said that it is safer to do so i would join with him for certainly when any thing comes in contact with the imagination that has been before familiar or rather congenial to it without consideration we give credit for its merit on the spot whatever we may do upon reflection  and having once praised a thing a false pride prevents us from discovering that we were deceived the dialogue of this piece is as accommodating as the rest of it mr heron points out the tinsel scattered up and down by way of sentiments which by the theatrical people are known by the name of clap traps and mr sheridan cannot take it amiss if in justice to his abilities and our own discernment one is obliged to say that he can  whenever he pleases write ten times better  the monody which seems written expressly to desire all the world to forget garrick has again very little of originality in it lloyds actor furnished the outline in addition to which mr sheridan certainly has touched in some beautiful strokes but after all it is but a sketch and much more likely to be forgotten than him whose memory it laboriously professes to prove ought to be buried with his ashes my great quarrel with mr sheridan in this business is that he has with great skill and ability spoken of all the arts except music he has shown that the same of the statuary is most perfect when the statues themselves are broken to pieces  that raphael and sir joshua reynolds are cotemporaries i once saw at blenheimhouse what would make this line pass for satire it was a portrait of the duchess of malborough and her child in which the colors were all flown by the side of the virgin and our savior by raphael in which the tints were in as high preservation as if it had not been painted six months and that these arts are subordinate to poetry but he has not once even hinted that there is any such study as music  to which i insist upon it none of the arts are superior i beg to ask mr sheridan a question does he believe if  added to his own consummate knowledge of stage effect  he could borrow the pen of shakespeare and by blending such talents form a play beyond all conception the most perfect that ever graced a theater that the audience would not  spite of their anxious suspense  spite of their bruised hides in crowding to the house  hiss down the curtain if they were deprived of the first music but indeed whatever may be the conscious haughtiness with which this gentleman may think proper to look down on an art to which i hope he owes no grudge he had good sense enough to court its alliance before he thought proper to put his dramatic fame to a second trial  the critic is surely nothing equal as a satire to tom thumb  and when we talk of the rehearsal it sinks to nothing fielding and buckingham have taken in the whole round of tragedy and properly conceived that dryden lee and the old standards were fair game what has mr sheridan done why truly except indeed where he chooses to ridicule shakespeare  which by the bye i do not think an english audience would have suffered in any body else  he has exposed the puerile modern stuff which if it be deficient in merit he  as a manager  must bear his share of reprehension for obtruding it on the public the business of sir plagiary is severe enough but unfortunately the very words he intends should give the deepest wound recoils on himself  for they are a plagiary puff is full of pointed observation but that part of the piece is the first instance  as i before observed  where an audience have quietly sat down and consented to be laughed at by an author as to the drift of the piece it appears to be written with a view alone to discourage writers of tragedy for there is no possible situation that can excite pity terror or any of those passions which it is the business of tragedy peculiarly to call forth but this work which professes to be critical attempts to laugh at  and really not always with success for if figure and imagery may at all be introduced in this species of writing the criticism itself is more an object of ridicule than the thing it professes to criticize in short i defy mr sheridan himself to write a tragedy so as to steer clear of his own lash and how absurd must a man appear who provides a castigation for himself the matter relative to the clock at the beginning of the duenna shows evidently that he is vulnerable as well as his neighbors and as the circumstance goes to a reprobation of the unities it were as modest to propose some better criterion before he invited us to explode the admitted standard but one man may steal a horse better than another look over the hedge says the old proverb mr sheridan can write in any style and to any degree of perfection he pleases but his public writing like his public speaking is more catching than captivating it dazzles but does not impress  it charms but does not convince in short as that gentlemans aim is popularity he does every thing for the moment and it is a question after he has sunk into ease and independance from his natural indolence of mind whether he will ever again be known but by a few eminent trifles written to grace the private cabinet and make up the delices of the elegant and euridite  mr sheridan having most probably done with the stage as an author it is but fair to examine how far in that capacity he has been an acquisition to the public and when we consider that he has deprived the world of the best singer beyond all comparison that we have ever heard it is very doubtful whether what he has given be adequate to what he has taken away  and admitting this the public would rather have gained than lost had mr sheridan originally kept to politics and have had nothing to do with the theater  this gentleman from his earliest youth resolved to be at the top of his profession be it what it might may his integrity equal his abilities and there is no situation but he will adorn  adieu yours most perfectly c dibdin london april          letter lxiv musical justice  so ceased the rival crew when purcel came  they sung no more or only sung his fame  to the rev mr  dear sir finding in london the musical world up in arms at what they had heard concerning this book i cannot resume the subject better than by taking them while they are warm i am only sorry the small remaining portion of room which i can dedicate to this subject will prevent me from going into it so fully as i could wish  for it is prolific and cannot for the sake of the public be too closely inspected  i have advanced that purcel had a stronger mind than handel and that had arne been encouraged he would have been a greater man at the time purcel lived music was in its infancy in this kingdom and all the perfection composers had an idea of was to shackle themselves with rules and thus they dared not give way to the brilliancy of their genius  for there was as much good sense in this practice as there would be in tying a mans legs to make him run the faster  but where in spite of dull custom the imagination of purcel beamed forth it had a majesty and a resulgence like the sun breaking from a cloud how beautiful is that heavenly bit i call you all to wodens hall what a bar or two will be found in let not a moonborn elf can any thing for exquisite simplicity and sweetness exceed lovely isle nor will i go out of this very piece to prove my position relative to handel come if you dare the trumpet sounds gives me a fine opportunity to throw down my gauntlet and i challenge all the world to show me any thing in music that can go beyond it handel had a glorious opportunity had it been possible but in his attempt to excel it he has fallen to an immense distance indeed the words for both are written by dryden and those which handel set for grandeur has the preeminence one runs come  if you dare  the trumpet sounds come  if you dare  the foe rebounds we come we come we come says the double double beat of the thundering drum   i cannot correctly remember the remainder  but this will be enough for my purpose the other words are the trumpets loud clangour excites us to arms with shrill notes of anger and mortal alarms the double double double beat of the thundering drum cries hark the foes come charge charge it is too late to retreat   purcels expression is one great soulfelt effusion of simple sublimity and as it ever will be the case with great minds at the same time that these few bold notes carry us to the rough manners of the court of king arthur there is a natural ease and irresistible grace in them that will vainly be imitated by all the studied polish of the italian school and indeed so strongly from genius did purcel possess that symmetry in fancy which  like the native dignity of some forms  cannot in any position be ungraceful that the very error dr burney reprobates in handel  which he qualifies by the bye saying that it was not reformed till lately  is here in purcel who lived in ruder times better than corrected  it is avoided for his great conception  while others labor to improve nature into ease  derived ease from nature what i allude to is the accommodating the melody of the capacity of the trumpets  which handel scarcely ever does  and surely there is something like barrenness of invention in this but to examine what handel has done with the other words  and here i am afraid integrity obliges us to say he has servilely imitated purcel i say servilely because the time and the construction is the same but  like a clumsy translation  the literal intention is barely preserved and all the beauty and correctness left out indeed the curious mode of accenting the beginning of every bar  for it runs thus the trumpets loud clangour excites us to arms the lovely introduction of the fourth for the trumpet and the lameness of the double beat of the thundering drum  though thundering happens to be of three syllables and thus there can be no excuse for it  shows that though handel came after purcel  which is admitted to be an advantage  it was in such a hobbling kind of way and he was at such a distance that he never was able to come up to him the words charge it is too late to retreat though they are materially hurt by the continuation of that bastard kind of minuet which accompanies them throughout have much of handels natural grandeur which certainly characterized him wherever he is helped out by instruments but which seems perpetually to forsake him when the voice should convey the mind  purcel  though probably very unconscious that he had successfully challenged all the world to excel him  follows up come  if you dare with to arms which harmony handel has twenty times played upon and britons strike home  and if any man will show me a superior selection from any one piece composed by handel  as no man is more open to conviction  i will confess that purcel and i are conquered  alexander is said to have emulated achilles and charles xii alexander it has also been remarked that spencer had only the ancients to consult  dryden the ancients and spencer  and pope all these  and that we may by deduction pronounce that spencer was the greatest poet dryden the next and pope the most inferior it is certain whatever dryden and pope have come in contact  witness for example the ode on st cecilias day and alexanders feast  pope has constantly been worsted and probably all the fancy in drydens works together bear no proportion to the wonderful imagery in the teeming imagination of spencer let me therefore be allowed when i speak of purcel the time in which he lived the little information he could have gathered from what went before him and the many discouragements he labored under and i am not afraid but every man who has the candor to take up my arguments upon this liberal ground will allow me that this wonderful composer had a stronger mind than handel  my next task will be to prove my position in relation to arne and this i shall endeavor to do in my next letter in the mean time i cannot either introduce that or finish this better than by remarking that when arne came to alter the music of king arthur for drury lane with that good sense and philanthropy of which no man possessed a larger share  though he introduced some charming things  so far from mutilating purcel as a modern compiler would have done with proper reverence for such great abilities his whole study was to place his idolized predecessor in that conspicuous situation the brilliancy of his reputation demanded for arne  and i well know it  had as much of the harmony of humanity as of sounds his latter excellence i am now going to examine give me however an agreeable relaxation by suffering me once more to repeat that i am  yours most heartily c dibdin london april          letter lxv more matter of the same complexion  till the rapt soul earth forsaking  heavenward its flight is taking  on the wings of harmony  to the rev mr  dear sir if any of the lovers of handel were to open this book exactly at this page they would think it was written in bedlam and immediately pitying the poor maniac of an author shrug up their shoulders and lay it down as to their opinions whose minds are shut against conviction i am perfectly indifferent  but i will not let them pass without remarking that those who admire one man of genius to the exclusion of all others must naturally possess such narrow contracted sentiments that their very blandishments are tainted with poison and destroy that reputation they profess to cherish  i start arne against handel by saying that handel has not produced a piece so complete from first to last as comus as a man of genius by infinite degrees acis and galatea is handels best work and i will venture to say but for that piece he could not have borne that great rank notwithstanding all that has been vaunted of the messiah among men who know really how to distinguish acis and galatea contains a number of beautiful melodies and what lists it into great consequence is that the subject is every where pastoral and yet handel has contrived without injuring it to make it every where different even polypheme and the octave flute are consistently coupled together the famous trio the flocks shall leave the mountains is a composition replete with sweetness and expression and wretched lovers is an astonishing chorus hush ye pretty warbling quire and love in her eyes are delicately pretty though if there were not so great a maze of modulation in the latter it would be more pleasing in short there is prodigious merit in acis and galatea and yet i am not afraid but arne can stand fairly up to his competitor i would not wish to match my hero with a pigmy  comus has one character as well as acis and galatea and the bacchanalian revels of arne is every where equal to the pastoral simplicity of handel and in many places superior arne has diversified his subjects and in a very peculiar way given them a masculine and a feminine coloring among the first are when phoebus sinketh in the west by the gaily circling glass fly swiftly ye minutes and several others and amongst the latter by dimpled brook would you taste the noontide air come bid adieu to fear and many more nay he has contrived to blend this coloring in live and love enjoy the fair which is a most happy composition indeed and fairly equal in its kind to the flocks shall leave the mountains all these songs are full of rich and pleasing melody and in them there is not a superfluous note there arne takes the lead of handel  because music does not want alone fancy to conceive but judgment to complete it and in many of the songs of acis and galatea shepherd what art thou pursuing consider fond shepherd cease to beauty and some others the subject is worked on till the ear can bear it no longer and the composer seeming to be aware of this lassitude takes his advantage of it and comes any how to a close while the stupor prevails that so the hearer may not with precision judge of his desects  so far comus is at least upon a par with acis and galatea and when we call in nor on beds that heavenly melody so greatly conceived so delicately pursued and so exquisitely finished  on every hill which is a species of pastoral music peculiar to arne and being in a minor key and consequently of a more primitive nature especially as its simplicity appeals wonderfully to the heart may be said to be superior to any other sweet echo which takes the rapt soul and laps it in elysium and many of inferior kind such as that pretty song by the rushy fringed bank there can be no doubt but comus is a greater effort of genius than acis and galatea  but there are more complete pieces to assist this argument artaxerxes is a most powerful performance  there the hearer may be gratified with every style of serious music and yet the whole is managed with such judgment  which outgoes mr sheridan  that though perfectly in nature the stage boxes are not more satisfied than the upper galleries  if we search further we shall find judith an oratorio that does honor to english genius  where we may see sacred ideas without burlesque accompaniments  sweet air and forcible expression  capital songs perfectly vocal  and astonishingly brilliant chorusses without a fugue  if we have still to show  for i would willingly satisfy every body  whether arne knew music scientifically i will beg leave to instance the chorusses in abel which it must be admitted explore the regions of harmony with a latitude as bold and as masterly as any thing in music and now i think if arne had been equally patronized with handel if he had not been obliged to humor managers to consult the caprice of actors and actresses to witness the arrogance of italians whose base metal became a fashion while his sterling coin was disregarded to do jobs for now and then twenty guineas and dance attendance at catch clubs to make up an annual benefit he would have had better reason to think himself properly encouraged and perhaps been stimulated to the accomplishment of various other works for which his exalted genius so eminently qualified him this alone has made him apparently inferior to handel and this induced him to keep within the limits of his mediocre situation contenting himself by the exercise of his own cheerful and even temper with that precarious pittance which is too often allotted to real merit in this country  certainly arnes faults were few  handels innumerable and when we consider that handel composed when he was in the humor and to please himself  arne when he could get a job and to please his employer that handel was rich and arne was poor  our wonder ought rather to be that he left so many and such admirable compositions behind him but dryden is said to have been prevented from writing an epic poem by his engagement with the theaters which obliged him to write four plays in a year and thus are we constantly deprived of the best efforts of english genius by lavishing that on foreigners  who laugh at us  which is so honorably due to our own countrymen  my next letter will speak of teaching  which will be all i shall have occasion to say generally of music i am charmed that i have opened your eyes relative to mr sheridan arne is a favorite of yours and therefore this last task has not been so hard i hope you believe me just to every body is i were not so i should not deserve the pleasure with which i subscribe myself  yours most faithfully c dibdin london april          letter lxvi more quackery  reform it altogether to the rev mr  dear sir a shall now speak of that mystery by which so many young ladies at a great expense in the course of seven years attain the supreme felicity of exposing themselves by playing malbrook out of tune and hammering out unmeaning progressive lessons by which the taste of whole families is vitiated through the ignorance of mere strummers and octave players through which the foundation of genius is sapped and destroyed and through which pretenders to a liberal profession  mere quacks  are lifted into consequence and permitted to vilify and traduce those productions they have not the taste and judgment to understand  a teacher nurses a scholar as an apothecary does a patient and a slow sever and a dunce are much about upon a par it is not the intention that one should recover or the other improve  the business is to keep them in hand as long as possible and if a robust constitution in one and strong intellects in the other manifest signs of health or merit it is wonderful to what shifts the poor devils are put  to curb nature in order to swell out the bill  good teachers  like good lawyers  are very scarce those who are really good ones will first of all inculcate the principles of music to a certain degree prove those principles in every possible manner and strongly root their efficacy in the scholars mind  and nothing in nature to men of real ingenuity is easier than this  bad teachers swarm all over the kingdom and their practice is to their scholars immediately to the instrument to explain nothing but as it occurs to make a mystery of every thing and at length  some wilfully and others out of ignorance  to confirm in their scholars so many bad habits and perplexities that they are further from the real mark when they leave off than when they began  a third sort of teachers  who are certainly bad ones too but not so mischievous  are those who go about every thing scientifically and teach thorough bass fugue and counterpoint instead of foots minuet one of these had taken a young lady in hand and taught her in the course of three quarters of a year every possible situation of the sixth and fourth and common chord dr miller and i had a laugh about this for we calculated that taking in all the concords and discords with their proper and inverted relations this young lady might entertain lively hopes in the course of two and thirty years and a half of accompanying a concerto  both sorts of bad teachers do equal mischief  for those who wilfully impose on parents decry the works of genius out of envy as much as the other description out of ignorance and the consequent evils are the loss of time and expense and the introduction of bad taste from this last abuse springs half the musical folly for which this country is so celebrated which like vesuvius is frequently breaking out bearing down taste genius and every cultivated object in its way for whether a human voice an octave above a blackbird  a frenchhorn that plays every thing but what is natural to it  a fugue or an irish jig  a double drum or a bagpipe  be the object this monster this devourer rages like the minotaur and taste is the bleeding sacrifice devoted to appease his ravages alas that some musical theseus would but destroy this pest and rid our country of its barbarism but a clue to the labyrinth where it is concealed will hardly be found while there are so many to participate the golden fleece  there is no coming to the end of this subject especially circumscribed as i am i can therefore only say in addition to the above remarks that a practical knowledge of music as far as it can be necessary for common purposes is very easily attained for it consists of nothing more than learning the gamut  the names lengths divisions and measure of the notes  distinctions of all the major and minor keys  the situations of the semitones and the doctrine of using the sharp seventh to modulate into the fifth of the key and the flat seventh to return to the original key these with all colateral matters are nothing like so difficult as the first four rules of arithmetic with the fractions relative to them and yet upon the same principle that addition subtraction multiplication and division comprehend the whole study of figures so do these rules in music comprehend the whole system of harmony and all there is more to be done is to blend separate diversify and in short use them in every possible point of view let not a scholar then learn more than this let it be learnt perfect and then put in practice  which done it is a thousand to one  if there is any genius to assist study  but the whole science will lay clearly open to view  if it should not by the union of what has been learnt it may be easily attained and it would be as absurd to teach music upon any other plan as to set a sum in the rule of three for a scholar who had not learnt his numeration table  with all this great care must be used in the choice of a master and as to teachers decrying good music and introducing false taste i see no cure for this but my former rule which is  let no man subscribe to the goodness of any music that is not pleasing it would be good indeed if it were as pleasing as the sensation i feel when i repeat to you that i am  very heartily yours c dibdin london april          letter lxvii a final account of places  such marches and countermarches to the rev mr  dear sir as a dramatic writer collects all his matter together at the beginning of the last act in order to introduce his coup de theater which as it may suit him either leads to or finishes the catastrophe so shall i immediately carry into one general account all the remains of places inns and other subordinate matter in order to introduce such a coup de theater as shall command applause at the fall of the curtain  i have mentioned already the opulence and populousness of leeds and shall take my final leave of the inhabitants as a spirited manly and enlightened people who have the industry to get money and the liberality to spend it it has two very large clothhalls and the assemblyroom is by far the handsomest i saw in my tour for a single room  halifax is an astonishing trading town for its size i saw the clothhall on a market day and it gave me an idea of a beehive the prodigious number of cells and the porters coming in and out with their bundles of cloth were exactly the loaded bees the parish contains twelve chapels of ease and is said to be worth about twelve hundred a year  manchester is a charming town and i have seen nothing superior to moselystreet but portlandsquare the number of people on a market day is astonishing and the entrance into the town from stockport  which is to manchester what wolverhampton is to birmingham  is very magnificent the choir in the collegiate church is beautiful and the progress of the manufactories and in particular the cutting fustians and passing even the finest muslins over a red hot iron are matters astonishingly curious and which if time permitted i should have great pleasure in dwelling on  liverpool is beyond all question the first town in the kingdom after london its capacious docks its roomy storehouses its entensive and wellfilled harbor the prodigious plenty in its markets particularly of corn  its spacious squares its magnificent public buildings of which the change is a most capital one  its churches and indeed all that great variety of edifices for duty business and pleasure to which by act of parliament they are now making considerable additions abundantly prove the truth of this assertion i did not see the theater at manchester but that at liverpool which is altering upon an admirable plan under the direction of mr tailor is spacious convenient and handsome i counted in the directory nearly an hundred streets and this circumstance obliges me again to speak disadvantageously of manchester which place has unlike liverpool neither directory nor hackney coaches  durham in summer must be one of the most beautiful situations in england the river the castle the cathedral the bishops palace and the straggling suburbs present you with a new and picturesque view wherever you turn it is remarkable for a good choir of singers indeed the salaries are higher here than any where and in consequence  for encouragement wonderfully nurtures genius  our concerts have been well stocked from thence the more genteel part of the inhabitants are more a community than a neighborhood a family than a society  newcastle is ancient and romantic and the inhabitants seem to relish of both they give you an idea of a man who piques himself on his birth and extraction though his mansion is mouldering and his estate falling to decay i do not mean to say that newcastle is not rich  it is remarkably so and i am informed hospitable however there must be a manner with me  it is not the size of the dish but the style in which it is dressed not the number of eatables but the mode of their being put on the table and after all it is not the wine but the conversation that accompanies it newcastle seems to have very little taste there is a new and remarkably handsome theater which is a hobbyhorse at present and will in all probability be thrown away next year for some other bawble in short  for i am always obliged to have recourse to liverpool when i would make an advantageous comparison  newcastle is proud liverpool industrious  newcastle is near liverpool liberal  and one may pretty well conclude that if they did not dig their riches out of the bowels of the earth and unload them in the river thames they would not count on their riches for they would never have the spirit and courage to adventure for them with any degree of intrepidity to the farthest corner of the world the road from york to darlington is beautiful it is a heavy stage from darlington to durham and on account of the hills still heavier from durham to newcastle  for the inns i must go back again to birmingham where there are several good ones but all immoderately dear at lichfield which is in the public road from london to liverpool they are pretty good and tolerably reasonable at derby much better for accommodations but much the same as to their charge at nottingham the blackamoors head is an inn where travelers will be shown every civility get good entertainment and accommodation and upon moderate terms i have spoken of newark  at lincoln i would recommend the spread eagle which is a decent civil house and reasonable at barton where it may sometimes happen that you are obliged to stay several hours and where you generally arrive wet from hull there is but one miserable inn the smallest accommodation or any thing decent by way of eating and drinking bakers at hull is a very good inn  and so is the tiger at beverly at york and every where in the north road there are good inns but in general very dear  the angel at doncaster in particular at leeds there is not a real good inn in the town at halifax they are not remarkable for appearance but they are for decent neatness and good eatables and drinkables and the lowest charges any where in yorkshire at wakefield the stratford arms is a very good inn and they pay you attention and charge pretty reasonable at manchester there is not a single good inn and the treatment is insolent beyond description  at least where i have been only see the gradation  at halifax i paid four shillings for the same tea supper and breakfast which at doncaster cost me nine and at manchester thirteen  but this last was at the hotel which exactly gives you the idea of a bagnio in london  this hotel belongs to the man who keeps the bulls head at which house i had a room and an indifferent one for the performance yet were my friends under a necessity of asking it as a sort of favor though the man was handsomely paid and the accommodations were very contemptible indeed as to dixon at the swan the last time i was at manchester i was from seven oclock in the morning till eleven getting away in a postchaise and during that time having a letter to seal and a parcel to tie up after  in the course of an hour and a half  entreating the favor of a wafer and a bit of pack thread i was at length obliged to go to a shop to buy it and the man told me he did not wonder at it for it was a remark that the innkeepers of manchester spit in peoples faces in return for their favors as far as my experience goes this usage extends also to lodginghouses every body knows where i lodged at manchester and i paid there for board and lodging full four times as much as i was charged at liverpool for better living i did not think when i was most shamefully imposed upon in france i should have an opportunity of celebrating a more scandalous piece of knavery in england at nancy in lorraine i lodged in the house of a mr villemette and having experienced a few of their tricks i had previously determined to be on my guard i paid him at the end of every week and took his receipt when i came to a final settlement he gave me the weeks receipt as usual but begged i would settle the remainder i asked what he meant for that i had paid him every thing he said it was true that i had paid him every thing supposing our agreement to have been in money of lorraine but that it had been in money of france and reckoning the difference of the currency i was then in his debt just thireen guineas i answered that fortunately i knew so much of their laws as to be well convinced that all bargains were good only for money of lorraine unless made before two witnesses this he said he had taken care of and immediately produced the witnesses whom i had never seen before i saw i was to be tricked and asked them if they would go before the general of the police and swear it voluntier monsieur was the answer i put them to the test and they swallowed the oath with all the calmness imaginable i asked the general of the police what he thought of the business he said he knew them all to be infamous scoundrels that it was a pity i could not stay to do myself justice but if i would leave ten guineas in his hand he had no doubt but he should give me a good account of the siness i however contented myself with my first loss and went away without even thanking the general of the police for his politeness  the imposition at manchester was proportionably more shameful than this the inns at liverpool are pretty rich and therefore of course pretty consequential master forshar in particular whose room i had has a good deal of consequence but he has an idea of respect and would be the first to reprove his waiters for the smallest incivility to strangers as to their charges the diligence took me to the cross keys where i was very comfortable for a day or two upon very reasonable terms the roads in lancashire are in general very sandy and bad but this is sometimes remedied by paving them and in great part of yorkshire there is a stone causeway which is a very agreeable recommendation to foot passengers  leaving all these and ceasing at once to be a public character i arrived in town as i told you where the first news that i heard was that grimaldi that incendiary by whom was bred so much of my public uneasiness that viper who bit me because i fostered him was no more perhaps it is a good omen  and having completed my resolution of quitting all theatrical pursuits in which it is plain i could not hope for prosperity the malignant fiend has ceased his detestable influence he has not living left his equal  for if fifty aburnots were to lend their assistance they could not write an epitaph expressive of him whose corrupt heart harbored more vice than could reside in the soul of fifty charterises i could not refrain from writing a few lines on the death of this monster and i was induced to do it by being informed that just before he died he said the devil was waiting for him and that he knew he was going to hell and yet had the wretch an idea of being spoken of after his death he said oh i go the devil and if any body write bout me let them finitch  alas poor grim epitaph grimaldis gone  were we to say at rest twere to make truth what he was wont  a jest internally convulsed aetna will roar and stormswelld seas lash the affrighted shore so conscience struck  spent his pestiferous breath yet shall he fear that something after death he is gone  nor more on holy rites can trample  to guilty minds a terrible example  fiends as they catch him tear him limb from limb till even the devil cries  alas poor grim  see how my plot winds up the monster is dead that obstructed my former fortune  in my next i shall introduce the guardian spirit whose benign goodness has sent me smiling hope to protect my fortune in future  adieu yours most faithfully c dibdin london april          letter lxviii the coup de theater  a combination and a form indeed  where every god did seem to set his seal  to give the world assurance of a man  to the rev mr  dear sir it had long been my ambition to bring out this work under the protection of the prince of wales for this purpose i solicited the kindest and most generous friend i have who frequently has the honor of being where his royal highness visits to do what he could with propriety to procure me this high and flattering advantage indefatigable to oblige and serve me he did not let the matter rest a single moment but watching the first opportunity to mention it with proper decorum the prince with all that amiable affability which ever distinguishes the truly noble condescendingly signified a wish to see me  by his royal highnesss gracious appointment i had the great honor at the house of a gentleman where my kind friend is very intimate of playing and singing in his presence those songs with which  not less as a correct and perfect judge of music than of nature expression and discrimination  i thought he was most likely to be entertained and though i did not perform fewer than twenty i had the singular satisfaction to find i did nothing but what received perfect approbation nor for nearly two hours did the time seem to wear  even though marchesi had during the interval made his first appearance the prince did not get to the opera till twenty minutes before ten oclock at the opera and vainly looked round for this illustrious auditor who at that moment was perhaps paying the tribute of a sigh to the memory of poor jack ratlin or regretting the unhappy fate of the worn out race horse i must take the liberty to mention that his royal highness upon my singing the race horse informed the company that he had fortunately about a fortnight before rescued a poor old half blind race horse from the galling shafts of a hakney postchaise  why twas a princely act   my friend took an opportunity before the prince retired to request the honor of his name to my subscription to which his royal highness thought proper to answer i might use his name in any way that i thought would be of service to me no terms can convey a panegyric adequate to this noble condescension what could induce it but that true greatness of mind which as portia says of mercy becomes the throned monarch better than his crown but the genial sun cherishes not more the spreading rose than the humble violet  having this honorable and flattering carte blanch my first wish i own was a dedication but upon considering how many of these sort of addresses teem with such ridiculous hyperbole and fulsome adulation as would make one think they attempted to satyrize that patronage they professed to solicit  though never did opportunity occur where flattery was so impossible  i thought an inscription  for what with such a name is not an advantage  would be most advisable and i could then give a latitude to those feelings in a letter to you which addressed to the royal personage from whose bounty i have the happiness to derive them could not without wounding respect have been dressed in terms forcible enough for the purpose nor indeed with this scope do i flatter myself with perfect success  for the real language of a susceptible heart never yet found its way to the pen  yet i cannot finish without a word or two more on this generous subject in this tour will be found many noble and illustrious persons with whom i have had the honor to converse i have in that warmth which truth alone inspired spoken of these in terms of praise and i do not upon recollection repent of any syllable to this effect i have seen courtly breeding in france  i have ever made it my particular felicity to notice the talents of ingenious men  but i confidently declare that all i have witnessed sinks into nothing before the object of my present panegyric in deportment never was there such an union of ease grace and dignity as in the prince of wales his manners are gentle mild and affable or as shakespeare has it sweet as summer  and yet always princely  his observations are keen and penetrating his intellectual intelligence strong diffusive and refined his information select and judicious in short that beautiful picture in which hamlet paints the mental as well as the personal perfections of his father never called for application so strongly as in the present instance for if ever countenance form manner and understanding are to be relied on those of this illustrious youth clearly point him out as the protector benefactor and friend of mankind  but i must force myself from this indulgent employment lest that should become disrespect which ought to be humility  for who can trust the effusions of a head full of praise and a heart full of gratitude  with these auspicious feelings i finish my tour and beg you to believe that i am now as ever  very truly yours c dibdin london april          letter lxix statement of pieces  and then nab has no head to the rev mr  dear sir i shall now as faithfully as my memory will permit me proceed to state the success both in profit and reputation of every piece i have produced to the public i am afraid however i shall not be very accurate in my account of the more subordinate kind for were i to be put to the torture i could not enumerate some of the interludes and pantomimes which have been done at sadlers wells and some other places nor can i place those i do recollect in accurate order as to their dates i shall however be as correct as possible and where my intelligence is uncertain i will myself sustain the loss rather than fill up the blank by exaggeration    the shepherds artifice performed in may      and      this piece which i wrote and composed at seventeen was only got up for my own benefit it has a thousand faults and in particular as at that time i did not know how to put my musical thoughts upon paper but by mere strength of imagination it is impossible to describe the number of its inaccuracies these however the same force of fancy enabled me to correct and without any assistance i produced the same piece in a perfect state by only listening to the faults as i heard them in the band it was performed at two of my benefits and each time brought a tolerable house  but it never came forward in the common business of the theater the music was very much applauded it will not here be improper to remark that i never learnt more of music than the gamut and the table which points out the division of the time mr fussel the organist of winchester cathedral i am told says i owe my musical education to him  which assertion contains so much truth that five or six very common tunes which i now have in his hand writing are all i ever was taught mr kent had afterward the credit of having taught me  but except some anthems which he composed for me and which i learnt by ear i never received the smallest instruction from him the music i have was strongly in my mind from my earliest remembrance and i do not think any master would have been of the smallest service to me it lay quietly a hidden spark  which in the country found nothing to vivify it  but coming in contact with that proper fuel for it the different musical performances in town it at once expanded and nothing could keep it within bounds i scarcely knew this myself till being present at a rehearsal of thomas and sally all that past so tenaciously adhered to my memory that i went home drew out a score and after attending another rehearsal filled up the accompanyments it was certainly incorrect  but for such an effort in a very trifling degree for i was not then sixteen i found however i was in the secret and immediately took the concertos of correlli in single parts and put them into score here i went upon good authority through every turning and twining in the labyrinth of harmony i next got hold of rameau and having proved theoretically by one and practically by the other the difference between passing and emphatic notes  the nature of supposed basses  and found by a fair trial of these matters in every point of view that two chords comprehend the whole system of harmony i determined fearlessly to give a loose to my fancy  to what purpose is pretty well known   love in the city performed in the year       a piece written by mr bickerstaff and performed but six nights in this i composed the overture the first horus the finales of the first and second acts and three songs love in the city has since been altered into the farce of the romp in which the chorus the quintetto the boxing trio and dear me how i long to be married are mine i cannot here omit an anecdote which tells greatly to the honor of dr arne simpson the hautboy player and some others persuaded mr beard t at my music would do his theater discredit and that in particular the overture and a song beginning ah why my dear were written entirely against the rules of harmony this mr beard  who had more goodnature than any other quality in the world  was easily brought to believe hearing what was going forward i took the copy of the overture and song and prevailed on honest tommy baker  whom all the world knows  to accompany me waited on dr arne the doctor after looking carefully over the scores said there was nothing against the rules of harmony that it was a pity mr simpson would not stick to his hautboy without pretending to judge of what he was not at all acquainted with and that if i would privately inform him when there was to be another rehearsal he would himself attend this i sailed not to do  and finding those pieces altered by some other person the doctor begged to hear the original copies these were produced and played over when he pronounced the whole business a scandalous attempt to injure the reputation of a young man whom if they had had any liberality it would have been their duty to encourage in consequence of the doctors decision my music was restored and performed with success this music i made mr bickerstaff a present of   lionel and clarissa  written by mr bickerstaff and performed in the season of      and      by looking at the index it will be seen that from first to last i composed for this piece about twentyfive things for which trouble i received at different times fortyeight pounds  giving up the copyright the sale of this music did not yield much till it came out under the title of the school for fathers otherwise i think i should not have been so completely overreached in the following agreement   the padlock  written by mr bickerstaff and performed at drury lane in october      the success of this piece is pretty well known all over the kingdom it may not however be amiss to mention that no conception can be formed of the sale of the music comus is known to have sold very extensively but after upwards of thirty years three fourths of the original plates are still in use what then will be said when i assure the public the padlock had seven years ago nearly worn out three entire sets but how will their wonder be augmented when i declare upon the faith of a man that i never received in the whole for composing that music but fortyfive pounds though i dare say the sale of the music alone yielded mr bickerstaff nearly five hundred pounds in addition to this his benefit yielded two hundred pounds mr garrick made him a present of one hundred pounds it has been some times a private compact from managers to authors to give an extra benefit on the twentieth night of a piece mr rich introduced this custom in a very handsome way on the twentieth performance of miss in her teens garrick when he received the bills in the morning found the farce advertised without any previous notice for the benefit of its author which was himself in the instance of the padlock he gave mr bickerstaff his choice of an extra benefit or an hundred pounds and the words must have also been greatly productive for he kept the copyright  and twelve years ago there had been upwards of twenty three thousand copies sold my agreement however was made before the piece came out and i conceived his recommendation of me to mr garrick in the light of a great obligation whereas had i not been the stupidest of all idiots i might have seen that my being pinned to drury lane upon such easy terms was a matter concerted between them i hate to think of it  therefore let me pause and bring myself into temper by assuring you that i am ever yours c dibdin london april          letter lxx the statement pursued  but to whom am i to make out my bill  doubtless to the vestry  to the rev mr  dear sir please to go on with me    the maid the mistress  performed in the summer of      at ranelagh and written by mr bickerstaff having made an agreement that season to compose for ranelagh and occasionally sing for which trouble i was to have an hundred guineas this piece comes within that article and the music has never yet been published   the recruiting sergeant  performed the same season on the same terms i published the music on my own account and found it unsuccessful   the jubilee  written by mr garrick and performed in october      it would be an endless task to go through the variety of circumstances which distinguish this memorable business but nothing deserves notice more truly than that shakespeare might have laid very quietly in stratford church  nobody would have disturbed his ashes  had not such a popular measure been the probable means of insuring a plentiful harvest to drury lane on the following season and yet it was managed with so much caution so much wariness that according to the representation of the matter to every body who was concerned in it there did not appear any such thing in agitation this cautiousness answered two purposes  it not only drew many to stratford who would otherwise have suspended their curiosity till they should see it in london but it served as a feasible excuse for requesting every bodys trouble and attendance for nothing thus among the rest i took unwearied pains  not seeing that i should materially assist in filling the coffers of drury lane treasury  without any emolument to myself all this however i could have forgiven if i had not been obliged to sustain fifty humiliations i will venture to say that had it not been for my music the audience would have shown much more dissatisfaction they were not in very good humor as it was they heard certainly dr arnes beautiful oratorio of judith and his charming music of the ode  and what was the most exquisite and inexpressible treat that ever transcendent abilities could convey or longing ears experience they heard garrick repeat that ode yet being disappointed of the pageant  being wet through at the masquerade the booth being built on a swamp close to the river and nobody having considered that sometimes in the month of september it rains the company had scarcely assembled when the wet began to ooze through the crevices in five minutes after they were paddling in the wet five minutes after that it was over their shoes and presently they were obliged to take to the benches then to the orchestra and then to the windows  thus there was not a creature out of about four hundred people that escaped being wet through  they were certainly very much discontented which dissatisfaction would more than silently have manifested itself had not the warwickshire lads etc brought them into good humor  yet was that very song privately set by mr aylward and the mulberry tree by dr boyce and had not my kind friend mr garrick been told at a rehearsal where i was not present that mine were set the best for effect he would have waved all delicacy to me and have had theirs performed george garrick who where davids immediate interest did not clash could be just to all the world informed me of this fact george garrick who i have said before was warmly attached to his brother was remarkably attentive to all his little whims and caprices upon this great occasion indeed he had so many admirable traits of real goodness that it is no wonder partly from gratitude partly from the amiable worthiness of his heart he should consider david as a being who had a right to exact an extraordinary degree of attention from every body but particularly from him the other who never failed to encourage adulation wherever he found it improved the influence he had over george till he brought it to something so very like meanness that it could not be palliated but by the real motives to which i have ascribed it in consequence of this slavish attention george was always in anxiety lest in his absence his brother should have wanted him and the first question he constantly asked on his return was did david want me george garrick died about three months after his brother which circumstance being mentioned in the greenroom and marked as something extraordinary  extraordinary aid bannister not at all  david wanted him in short garrick in relation to the jubilee maneuvered every where and with every body he procured abuse to be inserted in the papers which he got all his friends to answer he enlisted a prodigious number of volunteers whose exertions he pretty liberally extracted at their expense and at length performed the same entertainment ninetyfive times in one season at drury lane which he sent people an hundred miles not to see the music of the jubilee having sold it previous to the performance at stratford  except some trifling part of it  yielded altogether about fortythree pounds   damon and phillida  the same season this piece i was desired by mr garrick to alter and new set i was told that there was no settled price for such a job but i might make out a bill i conceived this a good opportunity to make me amends for the trouble i had with the jubilee and did it cheerfully the piece was not often performed but before the time arrived to talk of settling for it mr garrick proposed to enter into an article for seven years at six pounds a week for the three first years and seven pounds for the other four and in making the agreement he contrived  or lacy instructed by him as i mentioned before  to include every thing that was yet unaccounted for so damon and phillida went for nothing except fifteen pounds for which i sold the copyright of the music   the ephesian matron  written by mr bickerstaff the same article went over to a second season at ranelagh where this piece was performed and under this article i composed it the publication of this music was sold on some eventual agreement and i think yielded me only a few pounds  but i cannot at this moment say what this piece was performed about thirty times  0 the brickdustman a little musical piece performed at sadlers wells written by mr bickerstaff this trifle had great success and introduced an engagement which i entered into with mr king which though no great matter as to emolument was as good as sadlers wells could afford and one of the pleasantest i ever made indeed i am happy to have this opportunity of acknowledging my great regard and respect for this gentleman which i hold from principle and the result of many years experience of his manly liberal and uniform conduct and he must forgive me if feeling thus i here make a public acknowledgment of the letter i received from him at manchester wherein he subscribed to this book and gave as a reason that he should be sorry to be left out of the list of my wellwishers this friendship dear sir is of the complexion of yours  for which give me leave to say i remain your kind friend and obliged humble servant c dibdin london april          letter lxxi further statement  why he deals them by the score to the rev mr  dear sir we now return to drury lane     the pigmy revels  a pantomime which was performed in the season of    0 and      with considerable success i know not who wrote the words i only set the music and it produced me no emolument as it came under my article    the wedding ring  the season of      and      this piece i wrote and composed  but foreseeing the difficulties i was likely to encounter had no intention of making myself known as the author the world recollects the ignominy with which mr bickerstaff left this kingdom and an invidious public print had the audacity to attribute this piece to him finding the attack a very serious one i immediately made an affidavit that mr bickerstaff was not the author and published it this oath was called a prevaricating one because it did not say who was the author and a whole string of paragraphs of a most abusive kind were immediately levelled at me in the same paper i did not wait for the tedious forms of law but endeavored to take that sort of revenge which men perhaps imprudently endeavor to do when the offense is beyond legal reparation the printer however had as little courage to meet my anger as he had principle in seeking to wound my character he left town to avoid me and for some time was not to be seen i therefore moved the court of kings bench for him to show cause why an information should not lodge against him for printing a libel the rule was granted and afterward made absolute and there is no doubt but the gentleman would have been publicly exhibited had not my attorney taken it into his head to decamp to france with the money which to the great credit of the drury lane performers  who insisted upon taking up this attrocious matter as a public cause  was raised by a subscription among themselves to defend the action on the first night of this piece i was called on the stage and required to declare the author which i did without hesitation and the matter taking this turn i resolved instead of concealing my name always in future to announce it and rely on the public for the event i had a benefit for this piece over and above my article which yielded me upwards of an hundred pounds the publication of the music i undertook myself and got nothing by it indeed i have always made this remark that the music i have sold has yielded but very little except to the publishers and that i have published on my own account has constantly brought me in debt    the installation  the same season  written by mr garrick and composed under my article this i sold with a set of harpsichord lessons for a conditional sixtyfive pounds the conditions were fulfilled and i received the money    the ladle  a little piece for sadlers wells in the season of      written and composed by me    the mischance  the same place and also written and composed by me for the publication of this piece the ladle and the brickdustman i received thirty guineas    and    two pantomimes  the names i cannot recollect the publication of one of these i sold for ten guineas    the grenadier  written for sadlers wells the same season by mr garrick    the widow of abingdon  written also for sadlers wells the same season by mr hull all these were composed under my article they made up the entertainment of the whole season  0 trip to portsmouth  written by g a stevens and performed at the haymarket with good success i received for the composition and the publication of the music nearly fifty pounds    the deserter  altered from the french and performed at drury lane in the years      and       the music partly retained partly supplied from philidor and partly mine for this piece i had a benefit which yielded me about ninety pounds  the music turned out a very trifle  i got by the publication of the words about thirty pounds    the christmas tale  written by mr garrick and performed the same season the intrinsic value of this composition being equal to my whole salary i expostulated with mr garrick  who said he considered it in the same light and i should have no reason to complain my trouble on this occasion was inconceivable and i expected my extra reward would be proportionable but when the end of the season arrived in the office were found two promissory notes of ten pounds each which i had given by way of memorandums at two different settlements and these were sent me by george garrick as a valuable consideration for my additional trouble the publication of the music i sold for twentyfive pounds down twentyfive pounds on the twelfth night twentyfive pounds on the eighteenth night and twentyfive pounds on the twenty fifth the piece was performed twenty four times                and    two pantomimes and four little pieces for sadlers wells under my article  0 a short masque in amphytrion in the season      and      under my article of course i sold this music for some trifling sum                   two pantomimes and four little pieces for sadlers wells two of these i wrote but though i recollect the subjects i really do not the titles  it is however no great matter these six performances made up the entertainment of the season i had nothing of consequence bid for the music and i did not choose to venture the publication of it on my own account    the waterman  performed the same summer      at the haymarket the success of this piece is well known the benefit yielded me but thirtyfive pounds the publication of the words about fortyeight and the music i believe about thirty pounds    the cobbler  performed in the season      and      mr garrick would insist upon having this piece i had taken to him the seraglio which was afterward performed at covent garden  and which if i had been on the spot i am convinced would have had better success  but he had conceived great displeasure at my bringing out the waterman at the haymarket though under different pretenses he refused to perform it himself and therefore i must write he said a direct farce and nothing else which the more i altered the less i liked though the alterations were to please him at length i understood he did not intend to perform any thing but having urged him pretty strenuously he said it should be done if i would get it up in a week this i did to his astonishment and the next news was that the lord chamberlain would not license it upon my talking of waiting on lord hertford about it as there was nothing immoral in it all of a sudden a license arrived and the picce came out it was not greatly received but after the fourth night it went on very well till the tenth when  like liberty hall  it was damned by a party i got from first to last by it about an hundred and twenty pounds i am afraid this matter of fact business tires you i will please you however with another matter of fact which is that i am  yours very sincerely c dibdin london april          letter lxxii management  a man who can write can draw petitions  therefore i say discharge him to the rev mr  dear sir for breretons benefit in      i brought out    the quaker this piece meeting with success he bought it of me for seventy pounds and sold it afterward to garrick for an hundred had i not parted with it in this way however i might have kept it by me for garrick had for some time determined not to produce any thing of my writing if he could possibly avoid it he had no idea that i intended to dabble in this way when he signed the article and therefore conceived my whole employ would be to set words of his writing and a blessed time i should have had on it if i had never done any thing else for this purpose he was scheming to get rid of mr bickerstaff as fast as he could and the very particular civilities he just then showed that pretty gentleman to cover his intention probably procured him that scandalous and undeserved poem from dr kenrick  his wishes however were anticipated as the world knows when i produced him the wedding ring and afterward the deserter he found i could make some stand in this way and his discontent from that moment was evident to every body he was like captain plume he would not have a man who could write in his company indeed the most tremendous weapon in the world to garrick  was a pen the waterman following up the deserter and becoming also very popular my business was done i have shown how he behaved in the affair of the cobbler and as to the quaker he would not have suffered it to be got up at breretons benefit had not the latter insisted upon it as his right even then the copy was submitted to his inspection and he returned it with a sneer saying he wished him success but he was rather afraid the spirit would move the audience to damn it brereton took fire at this and showed it to his friend mr sheridan who spoke of it in terms of commendation all difficulties were now at an end mr sheridans pen was more to be feared than mine the next season mr garrick purchased it as i mentioned before but not with a view of performing it for this piece did not make its second appearance till the management of drurylane fell into other hands added to the seventy pounds i received forty pounds for the publication of the words and about the same sum for the music it will be seen that i did nothing of consequence under my article since the christmas tale which was entirely owing to this jealousy of garricks  in consequence of which he gave the maid of the oaks to mr barthelemon and alfred to theodore smith  in both of which pieces by the bye i received orders to make alterations and set additional songs alterations i peremptorily refused to make thinking it scandalously indelicate to those gentlemen nor would i compose an additional song for alfred  which mr blanchard of covent garden then a child may remember was intended for him  but menaced with an action for the penalty of my article rather than incur the forfeiture of five hundred pounds i reluctantly set the song beginning what cannot beauty lovely beauty do in the maid of the oaks  0                my usual quantity of business for sadlers wells ia the season         the metamorphoses  an afterpiece brought out at the haymarket in the summer of      when this piece had been performed four nights i left the care of it to mr foot who promised to do every thing handsome in it and went to france the moment my back was turned however he forgot his promise  for he only performed it once more and i reaped no manner of emolument from it whatever indeed every thing about this time went at sixes and sevens with him for he never joyed himself after the business of the coachman at the end of this season as every body knows foot was advised to go to france to dissipate his chagrin the morning he left north end going into his parlour he fixed his eyes for some time on the print taken from that picture so admirably painted by zoffani of foot and weston in the devil and dr last at last heaving a deep sigh he exclaimed alas poor weston  very soon it will be alas poor foot he died about three weeks after on the words i had a loss and the music was never published           0 business for sadlers wells mr king did not call on me for more work this year    the seraglio this piece was accepted by mr harris previous to my departure for france and performed in the season      and      i should mention also that i then left my affairs in the hands of dr arnold who superintended them till my return and common justice bids me say that he discharged his trust with great honor and fidelity for which kindness i now give him my public thanks i have yet every letter he wrote me and really there are many of the kindest and most disinterested sentiments of friendship i ever read to say the truth he had trouble enough on my account for the first stipulation mr harris made was to alter the pieces in whatever way he pleased in consequence of this when i came to read in the paper the plot of the seraglio at calais i found it totally different from that which i had sent and i remember the doctors letter that accompanied the account of its reception says that if i were to see it i should scarcely know my own piece mr harris also obliged him to new set some of the songs which he assures me was a most irksome task but he rather undertook it than that the piece should not be performed the benefit for this yielded me fortyeight pounds the words fifty and i sold the music for an eventual sixty pounds  fortyfive of which became due             the razor grinder  yo yea or the friendly tars  old woman of eighty  and the mad doctor  four pieces which i sent mr king from france these pieces were sold out and out at a very reasonable price but i again repeat that all my engagements with mr king were pleasurable ones and had i made him a present of half i have done for him i should still be under obligations to him    poor vulcan  a burletta performed in the season      and      at covent garden and which i boldly pronounce had it been given to the public in the state i sent it would have had much greater success it is uniformly said that the first act of this piece is remarkably complete and it must be confessed that from the beginning of the second act to vulcans soliloquy is as dull as any thing possibly can be and the reason is the burlesque is totally dropped and adonis  by the assistance of mr hulls somniferous muse  converted into a sighing dying sleeping swain whereas i had made him a burlesque character as well as the rest   i am glad of this opportunity of showing how authors are treated by managers and their privy counselors and am ready to stand or fall by the decision of the public on the merits of what has been taken away and what substituted this shall be considered in the next letter in the mean time rejoice with me that at the end of two more we shall have waded together through this rubbish  yours c dibdin london april          letter lxxiii the theatrical pruning knife  the kings a good poet  with a little of my help to the rev mr  dear sir my idea of making adonis a burlesque shepherd i thought perfectly a new one his first song was a parody on when forced from dear hebe to go the first verse ran thus when forced from dear maudlin to go of a large humming glass she drank part and i thought  but it might not be so that the poor creature took it to heart we guzzled till tipsy we grew for my path i could scarcely discern and for her stead of saying adieu she hiccupd out  prithee return   his second song was a parody on dear chloe come give me sweet kisses i shall not have room for it at length but i will give you the last verse count the coin at the mint they are weighing count the cash at the bank that is concealed count the rouleaus at brookess they are paying and what pharaoh and quince nightly yield count the exchequer tallies so even go number the treasurys store and when so many guineas you have given i still shall be asking for more   but my great favorite is the following imitation of horace and lydia joe when sergeant bellswagger that masculine brute one day had been drinking to swear a recruit he kissed you i saw him or else may i die and you cruel maudlin never once cried o fie again when the squire had come home from the chase you received him o gods with a smile on your face henceforth then my sheep harum skarum may run for maudlin is faithless and i am undone maudlin ah joe youre a good one  one day in my place  my husband at home i was forced to send grace i know for a truth which ye cannot gainsay you touzled her well on a cock of new hay nay swore you would be hers  and what is worse yet that you only loved me just for what you could get as for charms then i never will believe i have one for joey is faithless and i am undone joe will you know then the truth on it  i touzd her i own though i rather by half would have let it alone but i did it to see if you jealous would prove for that people say is a sure sign of love maudlin and for me if the squire said soft things in my ear i suffered it thinking he would call for strong beer and as to the sergeant it is always a rule one had better be kissed than be teased  by a fool      i could not resist the insertion of these songs that it may be seen whether either justice or judgment is generally exercised in mutilations of this sort  the benefit for poor vulcan yielded about ninetyfive pounds the music was sold for fifty pounds and the words for sixty pounds at this time the expense of the benefits was raised by the famous coalition of mr sheridan and mr harris to an hundred guineas i however would not pay it nor was it after my positive refusal insisted on     the gypsies  an afterpiece written by me and composed by dr arnold it was performed at the haymarket in the summer of      but was rather a losing game the profits  had there been any  were to have been divided    the touchstone  performed in the season      and      a pantomime written and composed by me under a verbal agreement with mr harris at the rate of three hundred pounds for the quantity of three afterpieces and every thing over and above to be paid for in proportion this piece has been attributed to mr pilon and to mrs cowley the fact is that in spite of all i could do mr harris would be trying to foist in alterations which had very nearly parted us before this entertainment came out i consented however to none but a few that were made by mr garrick after the piece was out however and fairly mr harriss property it was not in my power to prevent his doing what he pleased with it and by this means that contemptible scene got into it of the rout which i with particular pleasure acknowledge is not mine the emoluments however were and they consisted of an hundred pounds for the piece as a performance an hundred pounds by mr harris for the copyright of the words and twenty pounds for the music    rose and colin  a piece of one act performed very frequently and with great applause  0 annette and lubin  of the same description and performed as successfully    the wives revenged  rather longer but of the same description these pieces  together with the saloon the graces and the statue afterward performed with great success at the circus  are what i allude to in my letter to mr harris i received fifty pounds for each of them and sixty pounds for the music of the three from mr harris  the words i kept which according to custom were unproductive    a pantomime  the name of which i do not recollect in it was introduced that song give round the word dismount dismount it was only a revived thing and together with the song sung so well by mrs kennedy in the comedy of errors and some other matters estimated at fifty pounds    the chelsea pensioner  same season this piece came out with miss mores percy  which tragedy though it is by no means devoid of merit was not well received and my opera had like to have suffered by being in company with it the success of the chelsea pensioner however afterward was very flattering yet it was done but three nights in all  owing to the lateness of the season why mr harris has not repeated it since he knows best as there were four songs encored on the last night it was performed this piece was an overplus charge of an hundred pounds the words i published according to custom at a loss and the music  except a few songs which were introduced into a periodical work  never was made public yours most faithfully c dibdin london april          letter lxxiv the statement finished  othellos occupation is no more to the rev mr  dear sir i shall not have room particularly to mention how much my pieces have suffered from mutilation however what i neglect in detail i must make up in point     mirror  a pantomime burletta performed with considerable success at covent garden in the season of      and    0 this piece was strong satire and therefore  cavier to the multitude who however were charmed with the scenery one circumstance marks this performance very strongly the character of punch whose bibbery bino begot all the fall de rals and te de rees which have so largely contributed to make up the reputation of mr edwin and which was a satire upon nonsense is now forgotten for nonsense itself for this piece i received a sixth of the six first nights amounting to about an hundred and thirty pounds the words yielded me about twenty pounds and the music ten pounds    the shepherdess of the alps  an opera in three acts this piece fell for want of support i remember vernons saying when he was asked why he did not get perfect and play his best that he saw it was the general wish the piece should be damned and as in duty bound he lent it a hand my agreement for this piece was to have a third of the nine first nights it was performed but three i received about seventeen pounds    plymouth in an uproar  a piece brought to me by a seafaring gentleman i made some alterations in it at his desire and it succeeded pretty well being performed about twelve nights my share of the profits came to about sixtyfive pounds    the islanders  an opera of three acts performed in the season of    0 and      this piece had very good success and is remembered to have contained some of mrs kennedys most favorite songs and many other very popular things i was to have had for it a third of the nine first nights but the king coming to the performance on the sixth i was obliged to submit to take in the tenth which made a difference to me of more than fifty pounds i however from first to last got by this piece about three hundred and fifty pounds instead of coming out in the course of the business in the second season  which it might have done with considerable reputation  mr harris made me cut it down into a farce and call it the marriage act the alterations this piece underwent previous to its coming out were innumerable some few of them were suggested by mr harris but i will venture to say it gained nothing by that mr woodfall saw a sketch of the first act in a rough state and in a letter which i have by me declared it bid the fairest for popularity of any thing he had seen it was certainly a very great favorite with mr harris who advised me not to confess myself the author urging me with words more than belonged to such a trifle for he said junius was not yet known  and therefore he would not advise me to declare myself to be sure there were some flying reports that mr harris wrote it himself  but it will hardly be thought he wished those to be credited    harlequin free mason  same season this piece had a prodigious run i wrote the words and composed the music my emoluments were seventy pounds from the theater i sold about   00 books which yielded me  for so well are these things managed  about thirtyfive pounds and the music was distributed in a work called the lyrist which publication yielded me nearly fifty pounds    amphytrion  performed in the season of      and      this piece was the only instance in which i made a point of securing myself mr harris and i parted as i have before mentioned i had nothing to do with conducting it and it was performed but two nights i received for it two hundred and eightyfive pounds  0                             0             the barrier of parnassus the graces the saloon the milkmaid the refusal of harlequin the land of simplicity the passions the statue clump and cudden the benevolent tar the regions of accomplishment lancashire witches the cestus pandora the long odds these two or three other pantomimes four or five intermezzos of a more trifling kind and at least fifteen ballads each taking twelve or fourteen airs and an overture with a variety of other matter make up what i did for the circus where in the first season i cleared upwards of nine hundred pounds  but from that moment my connection with this place has been a series of trouble loss and vexation which to enumerate would make up as long a work as this i shall say a few words on this head however in a future letter    liberty hall  performed with the success i have already stated at drury lane in the season of      and      the benefit yielded fortyeight pounds the words nothing and the music  by which if it had been performed oftener i should have received a considerable sum  brought though handsomely bargained for no great matter    harvest home  performed at the haymarket      i was nine pounds in debt on the benefit the words i sold for forty pounds and the music did about as much as liberty hall these pieces were i to go over every ground would come up to very near an hundred but richmond marybone exeter change and some other places where i have produced performances shall be given in to heap up the measure what i have done will astonish the reader sufficiently  for he will see that in twentythree years i have received only about five thousand five hundred pounds even when i add my different salaries and annual benefits  think of this and all my drudgery and tell me if you do not wish safe in calcutta  your very obliged friend c dibdin london april          letter lxxv readings and music  what have we here players  that is to say strollers to the rev mr  dear sir it now remains to add to my tour and the statement of pieces already given  the entertainment which i have so often delivered and frequently to very little purpose under the title of readings and music this i shall follow up with some finishing observations a very brief recapitulation of all i have advanced  placed by way of critique on myself in every possible point of view  and at length a farewell to that country which i hope i have shown that i quit not upon slavish and narrow but liberal and laudable principles  you have seen but others will please to suppose me upon my platform with a piano forte before me mustering up either a patient contented or delighted smile  but never a contemptuous one  according to the number either scattered about or crowded in the room  and beginning by way of  exordium ladies and gentlemen  the introduction to my entertainment ought to explain its nature and tendency the first would be no very easy matter to accomplish for it is of so eccentric a kind that it will not in any respect tally with whatever may be measured by the standard of regularity but as to its drift i believe it may have as legitimate pretensions to public favor as any other amusement  matters of this kind in general aim at satisfying the auditors with an eye to the advantage of their fabricators like the physician who as he held out his hand for a see and was professing how disinterested he gave his advice  saying i take all this pains for you  was answered by the sick irishman as he put the guinea into his hand  true true all for me and a little for yourself doctor  were i kept to the letter of my promise it would be my indispensible duty to improve and amuse this text however i shall divide leaving it to others to instruct while i try the utmost of my poor endeavor to entertain the best regulated understandings may pant for relaxation at which time trifles light as air are the welcomest pleasures the mind unbent from its severer duty shall find a very nothing full of charms an anecdote a bon mot a jeux desprit shall be delicious these will be my moments of triumph besides i have a resource to which many have resorted with wonderful success sound has often proved a fortunate succedaneum for sense  for music like charity covers a multitude of faults how often has the rickety deformity of a hobbling line been wrought into symmetry by the elegance of a beautiful passage  an uncouth rhyme rendered as smooth as the honey of hybla by the force of modulation  and a whole mouthful of expletives gracefully swallowed by the operation only of a few chromatics  various friends however have suggested various improvements on my own ideas one of these you would have taken for a cook for he said he would undertake to supply my mental banquet with a curious and plentiful collection of dishes suitable to all palates he told me he had roasted nabobs and stewed patriots  surprised generals and devilled lawyers for needy gentlemen become gamblers in their own defense he had a choice quantity of pigeons he had ducks and drakes for speculators in the alley then for fish he had a plaise for sycophants who chose to apply for it he had good soles for the promoters of conviviality  and he had gudgeons for political and physical quacks that to be sure he could not brag much upon the article of maids but then to make amends he had a liquorish old wife in high season for a ruined spendthrift then for a desert  he had sugar plums for the conscientious trifles for fops whip syllabubs for orators ice for young widows and hard crusts and bitter almonds for  critics but what he most of all recommended was his flummery which he said was made of such delicious materials that it would be greedily swallowed by all distinctions from a bishop to a beggar  a frenchman advised me to fill my entertainment with dances which he assured me was not only the very essence of all public amusement but contained every requisite accomplishment for the completion of a fine gentleman but i will endeavor to give you his own words  monsieur  sare  look all over de varld every ting depend pon larn to danse sans cela vidout larn to danse you

opera house telling him if he should chance to get paid he might perhaps dance away with english bank note too  an italian let me into the secret of all that has been done in the way of taking people by the ears since this country could boast an opera house he told me it was as easy to make music by receipt as macaroni but as an italian never explains himself so well at when he sings i will endeavor to give you his idea of a recipe for a bravura song to music  and to music in the next page follows the very song i introduced upon this occasion i therefore finish this letter with

soar  twill set the audience in a roar  in a roar  in a roar  in a roar    letter lxxvi the exordium finished and the entertainment begun  so proceed you to the rev mr  dear sir the song over i thus went on  i could not help confessing there was certainly some ingenuity in this mode of spinning music but i thought it too much like the labors of the spider which  though curious  have neither beauty nor durability i consequently determined to rely on my own judgment you will therefore  proceeded i  suppose me a painter with my canvass upon an eifel and my whole apparatus lying before me preparing to present you with a faint sketch of human nature not as i have sometimes seen it described with the virtues rising on each other like the alps and apenines altogether as stupendous and altogether as cold nor again as a thing so fraught with depravity so pitiably contemptible that a man would rather be an oyster than an emperor  but as we see it every day without making it either a flattering likeness or a caricature for though i shall throw the human mind  if i may be allowed the figure  into every possible situation yet i shall not place it where i have not actually seen it it may sometimes be ludicrous but it shall be always like  imagine then that i have now filled my canvass with a number of lines curves parallels perpendiculars and dots faintly to represent a large groupe of characters  one projecting a leg another an arm and another a head and then suppose me  like the man who shows the tombs in westminster abbey  about to explain their good bad and indifferent qualities  just as it may suit to illustrate my position and to this man i may be aptly compared  for like him i have all the talk to myself and like him am paid before i show any thing  very poor however would be my reward if it was only derived from pecuniary gratification a warmer and more thankful sentiment fires my breast no less than that as i am impelled alone by gratitude to appear before you i may hope for your kind and gentle wishes for my safety health and prosperity when i did not finish the exordium in this manner it ran as follows  from the words my own judgment i shall therefore present you with a melange which i trust will be found to be neither regularly dull nor ridiculously eccentric but a sort of medium between these extremes tending sometimes to provoke an involuntary sigh but much oftener a spontaneous smile and though i profess it to be out of all rule class or distinction yet i am sanguine enough to hope it will have as regular a beginning middle and end as an epic poem that it will commence with curiosity be followed up with attention and conclude with  approbation   the cape of good hope  when impelld by my fortune new worlds to explore  i shall cheerfully leave the deminishing shore  each hour bearing gratefully proudly in mind  how nobly a generous public was kind  how nobly a generous public was kind  how freely they will give to their kind wishes scope  as gayly i double the cape of good hope  as gayly i double the cape of good hope  how freely they will give to their kind wishes scope  as galy i double the cape of good hope   when from perils of dangerous neptune set free trade winds and monsoons left behind me at sea i make rajahs and nabobs in harmony chime and gay palanquins march in regular time through the wishes to which you shall then give a scope i shall double with ease for fortunes cape of good hope   when by dint of my crotchets my catches and glees i have changed current notes into sterling rupees sighing still for that power of attraction sweet home i am no longer impelled by a motive to roam i shall still to my strong grateful feelings give scope that through you i first doubled the cape of good hope this song finished the exordium  i then began as follows  part i  cassander cut to the soul at being torn  through the avarice of her father  from the arms of his sophronia retired to a remote part of the kingdom to contemplate on her virtues  hortensia the beautiful and envied wife of the gallant ferdinand had been married but a little month when provoked by the insolence of a saucy calumniator her husband fell defending her honor grief induced her to retire and chance directed her to where cassander sighed in secret for the loss of his sophronia accident brought them together  when urged by the congeniality of their sentiments they vowed on the spot an eternal friendship and agreed to meet every morning in the same place to recite such stories of private misery as had fallen within their notice occasioned either by false honor or the insatiable cruelty of avaricious parents  cassander on his return ransacked his library to find food for new friendship which at its birth demanded to be nourished hortensia came home  sat down to her harpsichord  sighed and sung air who to my wounds a balm advises but little knows what i endure  the patients pain to torture rises when medcines tried  and fails to cure what can the wisest counsel teach me but sad remembrance of my grief alas his counsel cannot reach me it gives but words  i ask relief   after this the subject changes  i shall therefore stop short for the present with a fresh assurance  and as true as the rest  that i am  most sincerely yours c dibdin liverpool march         letter lxxvii a jovial meeting  mirth admit me of thy crew to the rev mr  dear sir to chequer the entertainment and render it a little more lively i thus went on  i shall now introduce you to a set of gentlemen whose evenings were jovially employed in the same degree as the mornings of cassander and hortensia were devoted to despondency  this company consisted of a projector who had tired the royal society and impaired his fortune by schemes that had every thing to perfect them but practicability a speculator who had invented an instrument which was to foretell the coming change of the stocks upon the principle of a barometer but who  unfortunately trusting too far to the infallibility of his project  was obliged to waddle out a commodore who had risen by his merit from the forecastle and had retired in disgust a poet who had never been able to get a play heard to the end of the first act a wild irishman who had blundered through a large patrimony fill he had nothing left  to use his own words  but the purse of a beggar and the heart of a prince and a levee hunter who in the course of thirteen years was once within five minutes of seeing the great man himself  these six grown wise from their disappointments had gathered together the scattered remains of their broken fortunes and determined to laugh away the rest of their lives health followed them to the chase pleasure filled the teeming bowl and the only contention at their meetings  where anacreon might have been proud to sit president  was  who should be forwarderst to promote harmless mirth and inoffensive hilarity  the board being met and a few toasts drank the poet was called upon for a song he said he would give them a little satirical touch which he had that morning written against a lady who had been cruel to him he confessed it was malicious  or so  but he sincerely believed exactly in point for all that  air that all the world is up in arms and talks of naught but celias charms that crowds of lovers near and far come all to see this blazing star is true  who has not heard on it but that she all at distance keeps and that her virtue never sleeps  i dont believe a word on it ii that for one lover had she ten in short did she from all the men her homage due each day receive she has good sense and i believe would never grow absurd on it but for soft dalliance she would refuse some favorite from the crowd to choose  i dont believe a word on it iii that in the face of standersby she is modesty itselfs no lie that then were men rude things to say twould anger her  oh i would lay a bottle and a bird on it  but to her bedchamber do you see that betty has no private key  i dont believe a word on it the conversation next turned on the law  and one of the company had mentioned the frequency of executions in this country from this the pbojector who was a bit of a wag took occasion to relate the following anecdote  a carpenter who could not get his money for two gibbets that had been bespoke refused to make a third and an execution having been in consequence delayed  the jailor being called to account  blamed the carpenter who was at length summoned before the judge the judge told him he had ordered the gibbet and demanded in a very preremptory way the reason it had not been made the carpenter with the greatest simplicity in nature excused himself by telling the truth  saying  i refused the hangman and the jailor to make a third gibbet because i had not been paid for the two first but if i had known the gallows had been for your lordship  why lord love you it should have been done out of hand  the poet was noticing how sometimes the most trivial and unforeseen accident overturns an authors hopes a thing said he once happened to me which was enough to make a man forswear ever taking a pen in hand i had a tragedy  garrick performed in it  i must confess the principal incident was a little similar to lears abdication of the throne in favor of his daughters mine were two daughters and the king  after giving them a lesson fraught with legislative advantages that might have done honor to solon or lycurgus  finished his harangue with saying and now i divide this crown between you  sir a malicious scoundrel peeping over the spikes of the orchestra and staring garrick full the face cried out  ah that is just half acrown apiece sir an incessant laugh immediately prevailed and if it had been to save your soul another syllable was not to be heard and thus the world lost for ever four acts and a half of the finest writing   i am glad on it said the commodore if you had not been disabled in giving chase to the public you would never have come to safe moorings in grog harbor here said he  taking the bowl  is the only sheet anchor a seaman can trust to blow high blow low let the storm tear the cable from the cathead or the shrouds from the catharpin grog will bring us through all weathers and show a smiling face in the bowl when clouds and billows are in the maddest contention  the commodores song of grog shall begin my next letter in the interim i finish this as usual with assuring you that i am  ever yours c dibdin liverpool march         letter lxxviii a sea song and an irish one  drink drink and defy  the mad spirits that fly  to the rev mr  dear sir now for the commodores song  air a plague of those musty old lubbers who tell us to fast and to think and patient fall in with lifes rubbers with nothing but water to drink a can of good stuff  had they twiggd it  twould have set them for pleasure agog and spite of the rules of the schools the old fools would have all of em swiggd it and swore there was nothing like grog ii my father when last i from guinea returned with abundance of wealth cried jack never be such a ninny to drink  said i  father your health so i showed him the stuff and he twiggd it and it set the old codger agog and he swiggd and mother and sister and brother and i swiggd and all of us swiggd it and swore there was nothing like grog iii tother day as the chaplain was preaching behind him i curiously slunk and while he our duty was teaching as how we should never get drunk i showed him the stuff and he twiggd it and it soon set his reverence agog and he swiggd and nick swiggd and ben swiggd and dick swiggd and i swiggd and all of us swiggd it and swore there was nothing like grog iv then trust me there is nothing like drinking so pleasant on this side the grave it keeps the unhappy from thinking and makes even more valiant the brave as for me from the moment i twiggd it the good stuff has so set me agog sick or well late or early wind foully or fairly helm alee or aweather for hours together i have constantly swiggd it and  damme  there is nothing like grog the commodore then gave may our sea of delight never ebb the poet said it was impossible  for they drew their mirth from the follies of mankind which source was inexhaustible this gave rise to a mixed conversation in which scarcely any subject escaped them impostors of all denominations were severely handled and particularly pretenders to courage this naturally brought up duelling and one of them said in a country like this where there are such admirable laws he wondered it was not put a stop to laws exclaimed the irishman   air fait honey in ireland i would find out a flaw in each capias each battry and action for dear  oh my soul  satisfaction is law and what is better  fait laws satisfaction when to cut your friends trote dat affronts yous the word from dat argument none will be shrinking for we clear knotty points by the point of the sword and make

a friend of mine has made a book where he has set down all manner of insults and reparations possible and impossible ah twenty fine fellows that he stretched but for dat book would have been alive and merry but then their honor will never die you know what the devil would they have  i shall reserve his further remarks and other matters and having here written about my usual quantum say adieu for the present professing myself what i truly am  yours most sincerely c dibdin liverpool march         letter lxxix bragging reproved  thou art as errant a jack in the wood as any in italy   if there were two such we should be none presently  to the rev mr  dear sir the commodore in answer to the irishmans remarks said well but surely you dont mean to countenance those pretenders to courage  those petulent wasps who  all now do stop a minute retorted the irishman  i countenance  be my soul i will tell you how i served one of these spalpeons the gentleman do you see was telling a long roundabout rhodomontade story about fighting which he finished the conclusion of by saying he had killed three men i told him that his three men was nothing at all at all a jolman in my country would kill thirteen and eat them afterward i myself said i have had eleven duels and kilt my man every time and in a twelft  but said i to the company you shall hear gentlemen i was a sad wicked rakehelly young dog  played deep  dranked hard well sir i had a quarrel wid a boxlobby beau  called him out  kilt him i did not fly you see  i knew i had pinked a puppy and should be thanked for it this affair however being wid a fly a gnat a muskito my courage was only tought a flash in the pan and i was presently insulted by five of the most resolute among them dat wanted to quarrel with me oh to be sure i was not a scoundrel paltroon and a puppy oh it would have done your heart good to see me rouse from my lethargy of passive endurance i appointed them all at different times and places on the same morning  kilt em and retired to the continent about a month afterward i was in a coffeehouse in france where a great big swiss officer who was poring over the papers seemed extremely offended at the vacant silliness of a young frenchman who  as shakespeare says of gratiano  was talking a great deal about nothing at all at all ah  said old crusty  le diable soit le petit jean foutre the youngster in a hop step and minuet jump skipt up to him and demanded in the civilest manner who he had thought proper to honor with so elegant an appellation he was answered vous  moi  vous  vous etes un petit jean foutre they went out and in ten minutes the swiss returned in all the easy tranquillity imaginable having killed the frenchman the affair became presently the talk of the coffeeroom  cetois bien dommage mais comment fair  monsieur avois le humeur noir i could not help saying that monsieurs humeur noir was but a poor excuse for having kilt the young man i was asked to explain myself to be sure i did not civilly comply with his request by knocking his ramilee wig about out we went and by as pretty a little genteel cunning lunge as ever made an eyelet hole  i cured monsieur of his humeur noir and fait every other care this was my seventh man my eighth was a dutchman whom i was obliged to fight with knives over a table for nothing in life only because i happened to say by accident that their women their ships and their pugs dogs were all cast in the same mould my affair in england being now pretty well blown over i ventured to return but that i might be sure every thing was sung i got a friend to look out for me while i lay quiet at a lodging in deal  in the family you see dear was an old gentleman who out of four children had three sons and a daughter i had not been there a week before the daughter fell in love with me dat you know was natural enough it is a dillycate affair  but a pregnancy was the consequence what was to be done the brothers  oh they watched me with the eyes of a cat or a rattle snake they were determined it seems to massacre me i had an intimation of their design from the dear girl herself  a charming lovely dear tender delicious creature i appeared before them and desired i might be permitted to defend myself my request was generously granted oh it cut me to the soul but i performed my part as nobly as horatius with curiatii  i kilt em all three the father was now determined to have a touch with me  a fine stately vinnerable parson  about sixtyseven  aquiline nose  silver hair oh if i was to explain myself ever so it would be impossible to tell you what i felt well sir we met after a genteel salute  which you know good breeding always allows  he made a lunge in tierce  i in flanconade to make short of my story after an ineffectual attempt to disarm him  taking advantage of my confusion and whipping in a well imagined lunge in carte over arm  arrah sait  he kilt me  the jolmon would not believe a single word of all i had uttered at which i told him that as i had not discredited his story i should insist on his not doubting mine at this the laugh became general and the poor devil of a duellist was glad enough to sneak out of the room  and serve him right too  said the commodore there are three occasions and only three that justify a mans risking his life  his country his wife and his friend for life do you see is a ship that providence has given us to command and he who runs her on the rocks of folly goes beyond his instructions and may be sure to be called to a severe court martial for it  give me a fellow like jack ratlin  air jack ratlin was the ablest seaman none like him could hand reef and steer no dangerous toil but he would encounter with skill and in contempt of fear in fight a lion  the battle ended meek as the bleating lamb he would prove thus jack had manners courage merit yet would he sigh  and all for love ii the song the jest the flowing liquor  for none of these had jack regard he  while his messmates were carousing high sitting on the pendant yard  would think upon his fair ones beauties swear never from such charms to rove that truly he would adore them living and dying  sigh to end his love iii the same express the crew commanded once more to view their native land among the rest brought jack some tidings  would it had been his loves fair hand oh fate  her death defaced the letter instant his pulse forgot to move with quivering lips and eyes uplifted he heaved a sigh  and died for love as i never sung this song but i was obliged to pause a little till the buz of the company ceased i will now make a pause to tell you that i am as much and as warmly yours as ever  c dibdin liverpool march         letter lxxx more of the wonderful and other matters  twenty more  kill them too to the rev mr  dear sir you may remember after the song  i said  neither the commodores remarks nor his song could do away the vein of conversation that had before taken place every notorious lie that could be thought of was related one said he had heard a lawyer aver his business was of so vast and extensive a nature that he cleared two hundred a year by only melting the wax of the chancery and other seals in the course of his practice this gentleman however was outdone by another who said he had such a counting house full of clerks that he saved double that sum in ink and expedition by only leaving out tittles and dashes but the thing that seemed to be best relished was an account of a man who undertook to jump off the monument the fact said the speculator who told the story was as follows one peter wilkins a biscuit maker by trade undertook to jump off the monument he was to mount on the rails when st pauls clock should strike twelve and he was to jump off at the last stroke every precaution was of course taken to keep the poor devil from breaking his neck feather beds loads of straw and woolpacks were piled upon each other to an immense height the day came  the streets seemed to be paved with faces and the houses roofed with people the usual accidents happened broken limbs dislocations fractures and contusions were plenty women with children in their arms were thrown down and trod upon while old chimney stacks tiles and brickbats flew about like hail well sir the moment arrived  the clock struck  and honest peter true to his trust mounted upon the balustrades at the last stroke  off he went icod sir  when he was half way down  his heart failed him  and  he jumped back again  the company getting a little into disorder silence was commanded and a hunting song called for which was given them by the poet  air at the sound of the horn we rise in the morn and waken the woods as we thunder along  yoix yoix tallyho after reynard we go while echo on echo redoubles the song ii not the steeds of the sun our brave coursers outrun over the mound horse and hound see us bound in full cry like phoebus we rise to the heights of the skies and careless of danger five bars we defy iii at eve sir we rush and are close to his brush already he dies see him panting for breath each feat and defeat we renew and repeat regardless of life so we are in at the death iv with a bottle at night we prolong the delight much trimbrush we praise and the deeds that were done and yoix tallyho the next morning we go with phoebus to end as we mount with the sun i then returned to my desponding lovers but  lest the matter should grow too grave  i gave it the following turn  cassander met his friend hortensia as usual and while they were moralizing on the uncertainty of sublunary felicity a conversation on the other side of the hedge attracted their attention i should have told you that robin cassanders confidential servant retired from a disappointment in love as well as his master nor was jenny the handmaid of hortensia behind hand with her mistress in heroic sentiments these two it seems  profitting by the lessons of their superiors  had sought also for consolation in each others friendships and so mr robin said jenny you really say you have a pleasure in my company so much mrs jenny said robin that i almost begin to forget peg already but if this is the case what sort of things we lovers must be i certainly did love that jade else what need had i to run two hundred miles to shut myself up among woods and grottos dripping fountains and murmuring brooks i will tell you how the thing is   no no said jenny let me tell you how it is you men are a set of easy credulous foolish creatures and the simplest of us women can wind the cunningest of you about her finger  air oh men what silly things you are to women thus to humble who  fowler like  but spreads her snare or at the timid game takes aim pop pop and down you tumble she marks you down  fly where you will to hedge or meed or stubble can wing you feather you or kill  just as she takes the trouble oh men etc then fly not from us it is in vain we know the art of setting as well as shooting  and can chain the slyest man our net in oh men etc before i return to the company i will just take leave to say that i am  yours most sincerely c dibdin liverpool march         letter lxxxi supererogate virtue and rules to write mechanically  why every fool can play upon the word to the rev mr  dear sir we are going to visit the club again who being still very loud on the subject of braggadocias are stopped short by one of the company who sings the following song  air curtis was old hodges wife  for vartue none was ever such she led so pure so chaste a life hodge said twas vartue over much for says sly old hodge says he great talkers do the least do you see ii curtis said if men were rude she would scratch their eyes out tear their hair  cried hodge  i believe thourt wondrous good however let us nothing swear for says etc iii one night she dreamt a drunken fool be rude with her in spite would fain she makes no more but with joint stool falls on her husband might and main still says etc iv by that time she had broke his nose hodge made a shift to wake his wife dear hodge said she judge by these blows i prize my vartue as my life still says etc v i dreamt a rude man on me fell however i his project marred  dear wife cried hodge it is mighty well but next time dont hit quite so hard for says etc vi at break of day hodge crossed a style near to a field of newmown hay and saw  and cursed his stars the while  curtis and numps in amorous play was not i right says hodge says he great talkers do the least do you see they then talked of authors the projector who once had an idea of inventing a windmill to grind poetry maintained  throughout the whole time he was bit with this scheme  fourteen authors the company being very desirous of hearing something of the project and these scribbling dependants he gratified them by saying that his plan was in idea so constructed as to grind poetry according to the degree of violence or serenity with which the wind blew zephyrs were to make pastorals  an unequal squally wind was to write pindaric odes  may breezes were to fabricate love songs  and thunder storms were to give a faithful description of warlike exploits then proceeding to speak of his poets  what was the most extraordinary said he no two of them seemed to know each others profession any more than if they were of different professions upon inquiring how this came about i found that poetry no more than physic is ever done in the lump for that one is employed to write tragedies and another dying speeches just as you have one doctor for the teeth and another for the corns thus of one i learnt punning by rule by rule said the poet yes  thus a man says mr lock was a great metaphysician oh lord says you that is nothing at all  i met a physician myself yesterday the next rule is to lay a trap for a pun by a previous question says you do you think the dinner is ready i really dont know says one of the company i am going to see oh to sea are you says you i wish you a good voyage  or thus  says you what do you think of this business of the emperor and the tukrs think says one why that the emperor will play the very devil with them why sir in another twelvemonth there will be no turkey in europe upon my word says you i am very sorry for that  it is a very charming dish especially with a pudding in its belly thus when you have learned to pun with facility you may do what you please one says  come pun away  away says you  i had better pun here had not i icod says another he is in for it stop him who can nay says you what the devil should they stop me for i have stolen nothing well upon my word says the first that is beyond every thing oh says you if that is the case you know i can go no farther so much for punning another sets up for superficial learning  that is to say  teaching you to lard your conversation with quotations which if you cannot do off hand you must invent arrah is it invent you mean said the irishman to be sure that is not as natural a bull as if i had made it myself i am perfectly right for all that said the projector a man asks your opinion of a work which though you know nothing at all about you must pretend to be critically acquainted with why says you tully says   it does not signify a halfpenny whether he ever said it or not but if your man seems to know any thing about tully you must add   somewhere says you tully says  somewhere  so then you may say any think out of your own head well upon my word said the poet that is all mighty well but suppose it should not be a very bright thing oh why then you know that is tullys fault  not yours oh but upon my soul this is treating poor tully very ill oh sir said the projector these poets care not threepence who they treat ill so they are but clever themselves but i am too sore when i think of my follies  therefore let us talk of something else  with all my heart said the commodore  come poet give us a song ill give you said the poet the musicians lamentation for the loss of his mistress  this song with the music immediately follows i shall therefore finish my letter assuring you with no less truth than pleasure that i am  yours very faithfully c dibdin liverpool march        the musicians lamentation for the loss of his mistress andantino  i thought we were fiddle and bow  so well we in concert kept

dance jig in his breast twill a bar to his happiness prove and shall surely deprive him of rest    letter lxxxii homer in a nut shell  oh what a charming things a battle to the rev mr  dear sir i sometimes instead of this song introduced a ballad  the hint of which i took from the origin of the patten in gays trivia i suppose a blacksmith sings it to a milkmaid  air sweet ditties would my patty sing old chevy chase  god save the king  fair rosemy  and sawny scot  lilebularo  the irish trot  all these would sing my blueeyd patty as with her pail she would trudge along while still the

formed from out the fire to bear her feet above the mire an engine for my blueeyd patty again was heard each tuneful close my fair one on the patten rose which takes its name from blueeyd  patty now you have been after giving us a song said the irishman to be sure i have not a pretty little bit of a chaunt for you myself do you know i have been all this week translating homer translating homer said the poet why yes sure  out of pope and my head has been ever since so full of flaming chariots and speaking horses that i have turned poet for the first time in my life and set the whole siege of troy to an irish tune oh pray let us have it said the poet oh to be sure you shall not answered the irishman but pray now dont be laughing at my brogue  the siege of troy allegretto  i sing of a war set on foot for a toy  and of paris and helen and hector and troy  where on women kings genrals and cobblers you stumble  and of mortals and gods meet a very strange jumble  sing didderoo bubberoo  oh

bubberoo oh my joy how sweetly they did one another destroy come fill up your bumpers they whisky enjoy may we never see the like of the siege of troy after the siege of troy i again adverted to the lovers  the better to relish the societys mirth when i should return to them i said   to follow cassander and hortensia through all their meetings would considerably exceed my plan they continued something more than a fortnight during which time so remarkable a parity of sentiment manifested itself that they seemed animated with one soul every look  every sigh  every wish was the same and they neither of them believed  though nothing could be more certain  that friendship had long since softened into love  about this time  as cassander was preparing to entertain hortensia with a story calculated to awaken the whole force of her sensibility  a shower of rain obliged them to take shelter in the house where the first object that presented itself was a portrait of sophronia it is wonderful to what advantage the little subtel god turned this accident cassander could not find a feature that was not imcomparably outdone in the face of hortensia  one was pretty the other beautiful  one easy the other graceful in short i am afraid one was absent and the other present his heart outwent his reason and he finished a rhapsody  which not to conceal his weakness was a plain declaration of love  with a song which he intended should show hortensia the superiority of her charms to those of sophronia  air bright gems that twinkle from afar planets and every lesser star which darting each a cheering ray console us for the loss of day begone  even venus who so bright reflects her visions pure and white quick disappear and quit the skies  for lo the moon begins to rise ii ye

will now visit the club for the last time their topic was that noble animal the horse and the vicissitudes of fortune that mark that creatures different stages of life naturally introduced a song which it seems was a favorite of the company  air see the course thronged with gazers the sports are begun the confusion but hear  i bet you sir  done done  ten thousand strange murmurs resound far and near lords hawkers and jockies assail the tired ear while  with neck like a rainbow erecting his crest pampered prancing and pleased  his head touching his breast  scarcely snuffing the air he is so proud and elate  the highmettled racer first starts for the plate ii now reynards turned out  and over hedge and ditch rush dogs horses and huntsmen all hard at his brush through marsh fen and brier led by their sly prey they by scent and by view cheat a long tedious way while  alike born for sports of the field and the course  always sure to come thorough  a staunch and fleet horse  when fairly run down the fox yields up his breath the highmettled racer is in at the death iii grown aged used up and turned out of the stud lame spavind and windgalld  but yet with some blood  while knowing postillions his pedigree trace tell his dam won this sweepstakes his sire gained that race and what matches he won to the ostlers count over as they loiter their time at some hedge alehouse door while the harness sore galls and the spurs his sides goad the highmettled racers a hack on the road iv till at last having labored drudgd early and late bowed down by degrees he bends on to his fate blind old lean and feeble he tugs round a mill or draws sand till the sand of his hourglass stands still and now cold and lifeless exposed to the view in the very same cart which he yesterday drew while a pitying crowd his sad relics surrounds the highmettled racer is sold for the hounds a whimsical extract from an entertainment was next produced  where a magician had confined two unfortunate lovers who were tormented with the severest and most ingenious rigor this duty sometimes fell on a journeyman conjurer who not being exactly au sait to this diabolical business did not always execute it so as to operate to his masters wishes in the extract i mentioned he is left with an injunction to conjure up every spirit of distress he can think of to terrify these lovers poor tycho is horribly put to it to conceive how he can possibly find out these spirits of distress having however determined to make the best of it he thus begins his incantation  air spirits of distress of every occupation persuasion mode complexion temper climate inclination come here come here spirit of a friar obliged to go to mass spirit of a sailor who leaves his pretty lass spirit of a drunkard deprived of his glass appear appear ii spirit of a virgin old and antiquated who forty long winters has sighed out unmated come here come here spirit of a quaker deceived in pretty ruth spirit of an old man who apes the tricks of youth spirit of an hypocrite obliged to speak the truth appear appear iii spirit of a briton just arrived gay france in who stead of beef and fighting meets with naught but frogs and dancing come here come here spirit of an alderman the dinner thrown down spirit of a lover who has just received a frown spirit of a beauty disappointed of her gown appear appear our tycho did not conceive there could be greater spirits of distress than these the poet however could not get his piece on the stage the history of its refusal brought up the subject of the theater and this introduced several theatrical anecdotes among which the following one relative to the cibber gave the company some pleasure  the  who all the world knows to have been a great voluptuary  and who would give his last guinea for an ortolan and confiscate something to get it dressed  had dined in the city at a public entertainment and rendered himself very agreeable by relating a number of anecdotes and sporting other sallies of wit a few nights afterward being in the boxes of the theater he saw there one of the citizens he had dined with he spoke to him with great familiarity but was astonished to find his salute scarcely returned a second and a third attempt were as unsuccessful he therefore went into another box where sat one of his boon companions who had noticed the transaction the bon vivant began upon the immediately what said he the old gentleman would not speak to you no answered the and i cannot for the life of me divine the reason it was but three days ago we were as intimate as gormandizing and hilarity could make us why sir i made him chuckle and shake his fat sides and rosy gills as often as there was a pause between a glass of burgundy and a mammoc of green sat now he affects not to recollect me and you pretend you dont know why said the other i have not the smallest conception said the ill set you right then said his companion your intimate friend over a bottle chooses to disclaim you in the face of the world that is all he is a merchant of the city of london  a man of credit and reputation  pays twenty shillings in the pound   oh that is it is it said the  why then damme if i speak to him for i pay fifty i shall let the company enjoy their laugh and take that opportunity to give myself pleasure by assuring you once more that i am with great truth yours  c dibdin liverpool march          letter lxxxiv more vivacity at the expense of actors  for they are the abstract  and brief chronicle of the times  to the rev mr  dear sir as one anecdote naturally produces another i at different times took the opportunity while the club were on the subject of the theater to introduce those which follow  an actor who had been used to perform tragedy and comedy indiscriminately was sent on for buckingham in richard the third but not being very perfect he floundered through the part with great hesitation and in much confusion when he came to that soliloquy where richard leaves him with these words  i am busy  thou troublest me  i am not in the vein he was quite at a loss  and so intimidated that he could not catch the word from the prompter the audience began to hiss and poor buckingham  after the loss of the earldom of hereford  had very nearly been pelted with rotten apples at length he recollected that he had played hodge in love in a village the night before and feeling the situation to be exactly the same as that of buckingham he hollowed out  i thought it would come to this i will be shot if i did not  another related an anecdote of mrs charke the daughter of colley cibber she was playing iago in a barn and they were in great confusion about the difficulty of managing the business of the quarrel between cassio and roderigo  for which they wanted three swords whereas they had among them but two it was agreed however that one of them should stagger into the corner and so let his sword fall as if by accident between the scenes that thus she might find it and come on to wound cassio  this however was neglected  and seeing it was impossible to get a sword  what the devil shall i do said she i must knock the fellow down saying these words she ran into the dressing room  which was also a bedchamber  and catched up an old bedpost with which she ran furiously at cassio and not to be worse than her promise laid on him pretty severely he speaking mechanically when he heard his cue  which was accompanied by a blow on the head  cried out in the words of his part  oh my leg is cut in two  the company being all lovers of theatrical merit these anecdotes induced them separately to hold forth in praise of those actors or actresses who had been their greatest favorites and having arrived to that pitch of tenacity when no one of them would cede his opinion the poet set them to rights by saying  gentlemen we have all our prejudicies i once illustrated this position pretty strongly in a fable  a large company went to see a collection of various animals a soldier admired the lion a sailor the nautilus a fine lady the ostrich a courtier the jackall and an hypocrite the hyena a humpbacked man declared they were all fools each he said might have its particular merits but he would venture to prove beyond contradiction that for beauty and symmetry no animal upon the face of creation could equal the  camel  this reproach set them all into good humor and produced the following song from the commodore  air a sailors love is void of art plain sailing to his port the heart he knows no jealous folly twere hard enough at sea to war with boisterous elements that jar  all is peace with lovely polly ii enough that far from sight of shore clouds frown and angry billows roar still is he brisk and jolly and while carousing with his mates her health he drinks  anticipates the smiles of  lovely polly iii should thunder on the horizon press mocking our signals of distress even then dull melancholy dares not intrude  he braves the din in hopes to find a calm within the snowy arms of polly the commodore now cried out poet i shall call upon you  what will you give us why said the poet you may remember mr oshocknesy the other night favored us with the whole siege of troy to an irish tune  for my part i felt my consequence as a poet a little touched at it  and so not to be outdone i have brought ulysses back to ithaca safely through all his perils to the tune of  yankee doodle you must suppose him unknown to penelope in the character of an old beggar giving her an account of his adventures it is preceded by a few lines of recitation  in which you will see how poetically penelope interrupts him  he says madam i have seen the ganges nile and eissel i have seen st georges channel and the weisel i have seen indeed i have and it is not long since i have seen    now for her thou stupid fellow hold thy nonsense  had thou over all creation taken a look and voyagd with anson and with captain cook and been strange places  more by half than both  in if thou saw not ulysses  thou saw nothing   to which he replies with great complaisance i have  and when and where but have the kindness to curb your anger i will inform your highness   here will follow the song and its music as therefore it is a favorite of yours i will leave you to hum it first telling you that

come to our town well make you drunk with bumbo    letter lxxxv the first part concluded  fore heaven that is a more exquisite song than the other to the rev mr  dear sir the speculator before the company broke up entreated the poet to favor them with a song for which he had a great partiality it was a description of the confusion that about two years ago happened at westminster hall when an officious maid servant was washing the leads of the house of commons upon which a general panic ensued and in two minutes the court of kings bench exhibited the most ludicrous scene of whimsical consternation that ever was beheld  air i will tell you a story  a story that is true  a story that is tragic and comical too  it is of a mischance that was ready to fall on this realm through the skylight of westminster hall sing bags and briefs bands gowns and other like rigs queues bags ties and fullbottom wigs wigs wigs ii the court was just opened and each learned brother preparing which readiest could puzzle the other when on top of the house a poor ignorant wench puzzled judge jury counsel and all the whole bench sing bags and briefs etc iii some say they a knotty dispute were upon of some trifle like perjury bail or crim con when this maid with goodnature alone for her object washed the windows to let in some light on the subject sing bags and briefs etc iv others say and that boldly this sly little queen was determined to wash all their consciences clean  but that would have taken so wrong was her notion instead of some drops more than all the whole ocean sing bags and briefs etc v but the lawyers with consciences ever awake did the poor girls civility strangely mistake and augmenting this mouse to a mountain of evil took her mop for a pitchsork and her for the devil sing bags and briefs etc vi one appearing however less scared than the rest their absurd apprehensions soon turned to a jest crying courage old nick will not take you this bout  he will be punctual never fear  but your time is not out sing bags and briefs etc vii and now lest the roof on their noddles should fall in two minutes deserted was westminster hall prisoner judge and jewbail against each other did squeeze and the counsel bags wigs and all lost  but their fees sing bags and briefs etc viii no longer let france then her joan of arc boast of her countrys stout foes who subdued a whole host on the maid of the skylight more honor shall fall for she routed the lawyers from  westminster hall sing bags and briefs etc after this i have sometimes introduced the following glee  glee we on the present hour relying think not of future nor of past but seize each moment as it is flying  perhaps the next may be our last perhaps old charon at his ferry this moment waits to waft us over then charge your glasses and be merry for fear we never should charge them more with brow austere and head reclining let envy age and haggard care grow sour and at our joy repining blame pleasures which they cannot share put round the glasses and be jolly in spite of all such idle stuff  whether it is wisdom or it is folly it is pleasure boys  and that is enough here i begged leave to pause and i particularly well remember  the first time i had the pleasure of seeing you  you said it was high time i should do so i shall therefore take the same liberty now assuring you in the old tone or key  which i am sure is a natural one because it is truth  that i am  most heartily yours c dibdin newcastleunderline march          letter lxxxvi extraneous matter  about it goddess and about it to the rev mr  dear sir at this place you may remember i paused  during which interval i never failed to receive much kind attention from some part or other of my auditory to go into which would be in a degree to recapitulate briefly all those public remarks that i have already given at large i shall however though the harvest is over look through the field and pick up the gleanings for  as i set out with remarking that by means of taking my hearers at the moment i made them feel i became possessed of their fair unadulterated sentiments in a purer and more ingenuous manner than i should otherwise have been competent to do  so you and my readers in general may not be displeased to get the essence of these cursory conversations  they consisted of kind enquiries whether i was not fatigued congratulations on a full room condolence on a thin one  which last was nine times out of ten the case the solicitations that never failed to be made on a first night for a repetition of the performance all the insinuating cunning of asking whether i really meant to go to india solicitude to know how i came to leave the theaters questions concerning the present state of them wishes to know why mallet murphy and other ingenious men do not write for the stage how the town formerly so fond of trite sentiment is now become altogether as mad after puns and jests if mr sheridan has really given up the management of drury lane theater what can be the possible reason why ladies who write for the stage always introduce more balderdash than men a gentleman who i am sure would not care if i mentioned his name assured me he took some pains to get acquainted with one of these soi disant female shakespeares and very gravely recommended the following anecdote  which i shall tell as decently as i can  to be introduced as a monstrous good thing in one of her comedies he said it was in the style of foot only a little fatter a juryman who was troubled with the strangury entreated one of the gentlemen of the bar sitting near him to represent his situation and beg that he might be permitted for a short time to go out of court the judge having heard the request interrupted the trial by saying he had a new question for their observation and on which indeed he should be remiss in taking any step till he had submitted his reasons for so doing to the court said he  one of the jury has craved leave to retire for a few minutes only  for an urgent purpose procured and caused by a grievous malady with which the poor man had the misfortune to be greatly afflicted the malady i allude to is the strangury  and it is a disorder which has some similitude to the stone or gravel or indeed both inasmuch as some learned physicians are of opinion  indeed my lord said the juryman making a wry face it is very painful i wish your lordship would permit me to go out of court patience my good friend patience replied his lordship i greatly wish to oblige you but every thing here must be done according to form there are if i mistake not some cases on record and i believe on a cause folio b yes i am right it was on an action brought for the recovery  indeed my lord if you will let me go out of court cried the tortured juryman it will be the kindest action your lordship ever did in your life pray said his lordship dont interrupt me when i am expounding the law yes yes it was so and then in another case hoges versus watkins  oh dear cried the juryman  where continued the judge a juryman as in the present case had with modest and becoming demeanor  oh cried the juryman screwing up his muscles  preferred to the bench upon the same emergent occasion a similar request  what shall i do bellowed out the juryman  and if my memory fails me not there are two or three other cases which i could cite at length after reiterated pain which he was no longer able to endure the juryman cried out  my lord you need not cite any more cases for i have p  d my breeches if this elegant anecdote should grace the ladys next play i hope she will have gratitude enough to acknowledge to what patron she is indebted for it why i always cut harder at the law than any other profession how much i am more than thirty years of age and whether the padlock was not performed five and twenty year ago  thus endeavoring to make it appear that i was on the stage before i was born and composed music before i could speak how i should have acted if ever i had been hissed i had made up my mind upon this had it ever happened i was determined to relate the following circumstance which really occured at edinburgh lee and love were mutually concerned in that theater and they disputed as to the mode of conducting their different departments till at length the controversy arose to such a pitch that the town took part in it thus whenever love appeared lees friends hissed him and vice versa that part of the town that came merely to be amused and had too much good sense to interfere in so ridiculous a business by this means deserted the theater and left it wholly occupied by the hissers  who also getting tired mustered thinner and thinner till the house exhibited very little more than empty benches love finding his interest materially injured came to his senses first and determined if possible to put a finish to the matter for this purpose the first time he was hissed he came forward and having obtained a hearing said  ladies and gentlemen  the next time you come to hiss i should be much obliged to you if you would bring a few more with you the consequence was inevitable  not only the audience but lee him self felt the propriety of the reproof and the quarrel was made up from that moment whether every thing i had given them was my own and in particular whether i wrote the words of the race horse which was the proper way to learn music whether it were better to begin with thorough bass the gamut or by ear and if a scholar should touch the instrument at first or a year and a half afterward these together with many tenders of civility particularly letters to india  which i always took the freedom to accept  made up the interval between the first and second parts of my entertainment and these having loosely set down in this letter as it were by way of acttune i shall in my next call your attention to the performance first pausing to tell you how very sincerely i am  yours c dibdin birmingham march          letter lxxxvii a legal argument  thou almost make me waver in my faith  to hold opinion with pythagoras  that souls of animals infuse themselves  into the trunks of men   to the rev mr  dear sir you may remember i began my performance  part ii  with saying  i shall now diversify my entertainment by running still further into eccentricity adhering to no settled plan but merely taking up detached subjects ushered in only by a few explanatory words  the following is an extract from a piece which conveys a strong general satire tired with each others society ulysses and circe agreed to part he entreats her however as the last proof of her kindness to disenchant his companions and suffer them to accompany him to ithaca to this she has not the smallest objection provided they themselves will consent ulysses thinks he shall not find the smallest difficulty to persuade asses bulls and bears to resume their original forms of men he is however mistaken and cannot prevail on even one of his companions to exchange instinct for reason his conversations with a wolf who had been a lawyer a hog who had been an alderman and a bull who had been an irish fortune hunter will elucidate this matter better  the wolf comes on in recitative  recitative uly what beast art thou my good friend hardphiz wolf i am a wolf sir at your service uly poor devil  wolf pray friend how art sure i am a poorer devil than thou art uly i am a man wolf which thou art vain of uly why is it a matter to complain of wolf this same conceit is

conscience or remorse a stranger here will i pillage out of danger air by roguery it is true i opulent grew just like any other professional sinner an orphan do you see would just wash down my tea and a poor friendless widow would serve me for dinner i was to be sure of the helpless and poor a guardian appointed to manage the pelf and i managed it well  but how  says you  tell why i let them all starve to take care of myself ii with these tricks i went on till faith sir anon a parcel of stupid meanspirited souls as they narrowly watched me soon at my tricks caught me and  in their own words  hauld me over the coals in the pillory  that fate for rogues soon or late  i stood for the sport of a dissolute mob till my neck master ketch was so eager to stretch that i gave the thing up as a dangerous job iii now a wolf from their dams i steal plenty of lambs pampered high and well fed  an insatiable glutton  in much the same sphere when a man i move here make and break laws at pleasure and kill my own mutton then since for their sport no one here moves the court nor am i amenable to an employer  i shall ever prefer with your leave my good sir the life of a wolf  to the life of a lawyer the lawyers argument being so clear and decided ulysses begins to tremble for his success  he takes comfort however in hopes of better success in his next experiment he is interrupted in the midst of his cogitations by a hog who you shall have in the next letter in the mean time like ulysses ponder upon the lawyers ingenious reasoning and believe me to be  yours most heartily c dibdin

drinking besides i have no books i arrange nor at two need i ever go to change have no business with note bond or tally nor need i from any ill luck either bull or a bear or lame duck ever fear waddling out of the alley ulysses does not wonder that so sensual a creature as a hog should pant so little to repossess his former reason  his hopes are however revived at the sight of a bull and he

march          letter lxxxix a sketch of crude virtue and vice  natures nature every where to the rev mr  dear sir while ulysses is lamenting his bad success he is surrounded by an ape who had been a coxcomb  a sparrow who had been a coquette  a bear who had been a plain dealer  a hen who had been a widow  and several others who wondering at his impudence in attempting to set up the blind and uncertain dictates of reason against the sure and unerring impulse of instinct fairly hoot him off the island  this extract was then succeeded by the following sketch  which i thus introduced  i shall now proceed to show that the passions of envy and resentment are as implacable and as full of subtle refinement in the hearts of the most uninformed as the most polished cudgo was a negro and quaco a mulatto see how quaco ridicules cudgo for being further degenerated only in one degree from the european complexion than himself ah damn you says quaco you a black dog  you a jenny neger  you dont tan

  can there be more pointed satire than this does it not convey all the conscious force of pride preeminence place and precedence as strongly as words can express he then goes on upbraiding him with his ignorance ah you black dog dont you know bout the rum when you savee put letter under a tone cudgo it seems was carrying a jug of rum and a letter to a friend of his master but meeting with another negro on the road he accosted  ah how you do buddy ah replied the other what buddy cudgo wat a divle you carry one someting dear oh dis  he da buckra rum master savee send um to anudder buckra

charmed with this idea they agreed to hide the letter under a stone ah buddy dis be good stuff savee make a heart jump having drank pretty heartily they begin to think of the consequence ah dam  jug no full now buddy buddy says the other come to the ribbor put lilly we drop water this executed cudgo takes the letter and jogs on with the jug to his masters friend who not finding the rum above proof exclaims  why what is all this you scoundrel you have been drinking the rum and filled the jug with water ah massa says cudgo dont you vex  indeed i no do nothing  nothing  what do you think i cannot read ah massa if i no tell buddy tom so  dat dam paper savee talk very wicked for poor neger man  these and other taunts and reproaches which have in them all the ridiculous pride and contemptible folly of selfconsequence at length rouses the negro  who falls foul of the mulatto with equal success and in such terms that had juvenal been a negro he would have written in the language of cudgo why now says cudgo you tink you dam creber fella too i appose  you no neger  no buckra  no any ting you dam yellow copper kin  you no nation  you a mule  i make a sing upon you song quaco

know him fader some say the soldier man some say the sailor man some say the fisherman but he no know him daddy   the mulatto who bore with great patience the satire on himself is roused to the highest pitch of indignation at the lampoon on his sister  at which moment the gentle orra  a real indian who had imbibed nothing beyond the uncontaminated simplicity of her native wilds and consequently approached nearer to primitive virtue  orra who had for the first time left her home in search of her yanko whose absence though compelled by duty she could no longer bear  this orra surprised the uplifted arm of the mulatto just when his insidious revenge impelled him to aim a death blow at the heart of cudgo orra though a woman seized quaco like a lioness  crying out ah shame kill your buddy this enraged quaco the more he cried out buddy  what dam neger rascal from jenny quaco buddy yes replied orra  every man your buddy every woman my sissy  poor dear yanko tell so  and he honest man for true  air poor orra tink of yanko dear do he be gone for ever for he no dead he still live here and he from here go never like on a sand me mark him face de wave come roll him over

tink me die my heart so sick he grieve me but in a lilly time me keiy good deal  and dat relieve me with orras song i shall finish this letter assuring you with my customary warmth and truth that i am yours very truly  c dibdin bristol march          letter xc an english sailor and a welsh curate  thou nature art my goddess to the rev mr  dear sir sometimes instead of the foregoing song in the

energy the comfort the convenience and even the strong political necessity of universal philanthropy and benevolence till at length won by her exemplary virtue both negro and mulatto forget their animosity and agree in their own language to take missa orra to de house and give her nin yam at this moment comes by an english sailor who highly applauding the sentiments of orra bursts into the following forecastle song  air what argufies pride and ambition soon or late death will take us in tow each bullet has got its commission and when our times come me must go then drink and sing  hang pain and sorrow  the halter is made for the neck he that is now live and lusty  tomorrow perhaps may be stretched on the deck ii there was little tom linstock of dover got killed and left polly in

apeak then drink etc to this sketch sometimes succeeded the following cantata  recitative curate ap hugh driving a triple trade who preached drew ale and on the crowdy played  while as the gaping rustics thronged around to hear their mountain orpheus wondrous sound would sing the cruelty of that fair maid who won his early love  bright winifred while all to make his poignant grief the sharper

actors and actresses  the plays the thing to the rev mr  dear sir having dispatched curate ap hugh  i introduced a set of theatrical characters saying   in a greenroom conversation  a short sketch of which i shall next give you  little can be expected but dramatic anecdotes and quotations we will suppose the members of the sock and buskin assembled  one says peace to this meeting wherefore we are met another  many i see are waiting round about you and i am come to beg a blessing too oh ho says one are you there mr prompter  what a part you have sent me  there is no making head or tail of it  i cannot find my last speech oh says the prompter dryly never mind it  it will be found one day or other in the sessions paper well said faith cried one you play upon the word very well this morning master catch cue come here cried another look at this part  a man has written a new tom thumb and made grizzle an irish general here is a song where  to speak in the spirit of the original  the bagpipe plays first fiddle all the way general ogrizzle sings it to huncamunca who has just said she is determined to marry tom thumb  air is it little tom thumb dat you mean and his battles arrah send him for playthings some whistles and rattles at the sight of a sword all his nerves would be quaking  he fight he kill giants  is it game you are making as well may you tell us that eagles fear larks that mice eat up lions and sprats swallow sharks then talk not of any such nonsense to me  with your confounded boderum bumboodle liddle lee ii tom thumb such a shrimp sure no eyes ever saw  he handles his arms as a fly hugs a straw to be sure in the wars dangers certain to quit him for the taefs such a flea dares no bullet can hit him and then as to courage my jewel  hut hut  arrah did not i find him chin deep in my boot then talk not of any such nonsense to me with your confounded boderum bumboodle liddle lee iii tom tuhmb marry you musha honey be easy were it not for your sinse i should think you gone crazy shall a fine stately ostrich thus wed a cock sparrow twere a halbard stuck up by the side of an arrow  or a fly on a church or a mountain and mouse or a pismire that crawls by the side of a house  then talk not of any such nonsense to me with your confounded boderum bumboodle liddle lee what are we called here for said one for the new piece says a second  i have five and twenty lengths in it and not a single good thing from beginning to end oh cries another you have a good right to complain  you fag a great deal to be sure  but what is that in comparison with my walk of characters why during the last fortnight i played hamlet richard oroonoko the earl of warwick petruchio chamont and the drunken colonel  and make nothing of them here enters the carpenter with gentlemen if you please you that act in tragedy i wish you would be so good to listen to the new thunder  it is spick and span stop a minute says one before you go any further let me tell you a story about thunder lee when he was manager at edinburgh was determined to improve upon thunder and so having procured a parcel of nine pound shot they were put into a wheelbarrow to which he affixed an octagon wheel this done there were ridges placed at the back of the stage and one of the carpenters was ordered to trundle this wheelbarrow so filled and accoutred backwards and forwards over these ridges  and i hope says the carpenter he would not get any of them to do it for him not one said the actor they had too much partiality for their old friend the thunder trunk and they were right too said the carpenter the best feather in your wing master tragedy you may rant gemmen  but if the thunder did not come for the corpse de resarve and introduce the handy climax as a body may say your lungs i believe would cut but a poorish figure well said the actor what was to be done lee was resolved to have his thunder and employed an elve of his an actor of all work to turn carpenter on the occasion the play was lear and really in the two first efforts the thunder had a good effect at length the poor baldpated king was braving the pitiless pelting of the storm when the thunderers foot slipped and down he came wheelbarrow and all the stage being of course on a declivity the balls made their way toward the orchestra and meeting with but a feeble resistance from the scene presently laid it slat on its face lear was now to be encountered by a storm much more difficult to stem than that which he had before complained of the balls taking every kind of direction he was under the necessity of skipping about to avoid them exactly like the man who dances the egg hornpipe nor was this all  the fiddlers fearing a demolition of their catgut catched up their instruments and skuttled out of the orchestra as hard as they could drive while to crown this glorious scene of confusion the sprawling actor in the sight of the audience lay prostrate like another salmoneus  the actors being gone to hear the new thunder a female singer took that opportunity of trying a song with which i shall begin my next letter and conclude this the old way by telling you that i am  very truly yours c dibdin bristol march          letter xcii the greekroom continued  the best players in the world to the rev mr  dear sir please to listen to the ladys song  air when fairies are lighted by nights silver queen and feast in the meadow or dance on the green my clump leaves his harrow his plow and his flail by yon oak to sit near me and tell his soft tail and though i am assured the same vows were believed by patty and ruth he forsook and deceived  yet his words are so sweet and like truth so appear i pardon the treason  the traitors so dear ii i saw the straw bonnet he bought at the fair the rosecoloured ribbon to deck jennys hair the shoeties of bridget and still worse than this the gloves he gave peggy for stealing a kiss all these did i see and with heartrending pain swore to part  yet i know when i see him again his words and his looks will like truth so appear i shall pardon the treason  the traitors so dear the song over and the actors returned from making an experiment of the new thunder the conversation became general again and the story of lee and his thunder insensibly produced another anecdote of lee when this strange man  who would have been a good manager but for his pride and second to but very few as an actor but for his particularity  had the management of the theater at bath one of the actresses wanted to get up tamerlane for her benefit lee was determined not to oblige her  indeed he had done nothing but thwart her the whole season  but he found it difficult to find a reasonable excuse she got the better of every obstacle  and at length being driven fairly into a corner he cried out why zounds madam what would you have  i tell you i cannot nor i will not get up the play  i have no turkish habits oh said the lady if that be all i am sure of having the play performed for i dont believe any man in the kingdom has so many  thrum was now desired to try over another irish song  air as dermot toiled one summers day young shelah as she sat beside him fairly stole his pipe away  oh den to hear how she would deride him where poor dermot is it gone your lilly lilly loodle theve left you nothing but the drone  and dats yourself you noodle beum bum boodle loodle loo poor dermots pipe is lost and gone and what will the poor devil do ii fait now i am undone and more cried dermot  ah will you be easy did not you stale my heart before is it you

dermot never moan but take your lilly loodle and for the heart of you that is gone you shall have mine ye noodle beum bum boodle loodle loo shelahs to church with dermot gone and for the rest what is dat to you talking of lee they went over the old matter of his being a strong object of garricks envy this brought up george garrick and his attachment to his brother have not you observed said one how anxiously he always attended to the minutest matters that he conceived would give pleasure to david  in particular the nights he performed all must be as still as death  not a mouse must stir  while through affection to the brother and gratitude to the friend the worthy george was every where entreating persuading and threatening to induce all those who were behind the scenes to be silent hush  hush  was he every minute heard to say why if this be the case said another it is not wonderful david should allow him so handsome a salary for it is plain he received it for hush money  his attachment to david said another was exemplary what trouble he had in the business of kenrick do you know the story of the challenge not exactly said the first i will tell it you then said the other kenrick wrote an infamous poem for which the world very justly held him in detestation garricks first feelings in this business were pretty vif and he sent by his brother a message which he called a challenge george perhaps out of tenderness delivered it rather delicately and kenrick taking advantage of this ambiguity made an equivocal reply to it garrick after this said he had challenged kenrick and he would not meet him this being the general talk came to kenricks ears who sent garrick the following letter sir  as i find you report that you sent me a challenge and that i have not spirit enough to meet you  i now inform you that i received no sort of message from you but through your brother which was worded so doubtfully that added to his being an improper person for the transaction of such a business i did not feel myself obliged to understand it in the light you now say it was meant to show you however you have mistaken me i will finish the matter in two words you have a large fortune and no family  i have a large family and no fortune  if therefore you will settle only three hundred a year on those i leave behind  provided you kill me  i will not only fight you but your brother george into the bargain  i did not always as you well know introduce so much into this part of the entertainment but i dare say as the theater is so popular a subject every thing i can recollect will be welcome to the public  yours c dibdin bristol march          letter xciii the curtain dropped  men are but children of a larger growth to the rev mr  dear sir these anecdotes having received their due share of applause one of the actors run through a song which had just been put into his hand by the copist it was in the character of pantomine and ran thus  air i have made to marches mars descend justice in jigs her scales suspend magicians in gavots portend and furies black wigs bristle to prestos pallas aegis blaze snakes twist to fugues a thousand ways and jove whole towns with lightning raze at sound of the prompters whistle ii i have made a sun of polished tin dragons of wood with ghastly grin a canvas sea the which within did leather dolphins caper i have strung with packthread orpheus lyre made sheep and oxen dance with wire and have destroyed with painted fire grand temples of cartridge paper iii i have made a swain his love asleep chide warbling birds and bleating sheep while he himself did bawling keep like boatman at a ferry i have racks made that no blood could spill foul poison that could do no ill and daggers queens and princes kill who are alive and merry in the same pantomime was a scene of a whimsical nature pierrot is left at a tavern to watch out for harlequin who is expected there and told he may call for what he chooses if he wants any thing to eat he has but to say what and they will bring it to him if he would amuse himself he has only to say how and he may take his choice of entertainments and if he would choose any sorts of wine he has nothing to do but say which and they will be instantly brought to him having conned his lesson and beginning to get sleepy he wishes for a little dancing and singing to keep him awake and hollows out   how after he had repeated this word several times the waiter comes in asks him if he called and says he shall be very glad to wait upon him pierrot repeats  how the waiter answers in any way he pleases thus the word how is played upon till pierrot finding it procures him no amusement changes it to what  which bawling out pretty powerfully the waiter thinks he is affronted and begins to apologize saying he plainly sees he has mistaken him being a foreigner but that he meant no offense there are good and bad of all countries pierrot by this time tired of calling out what has recourse to his third expedient and cries louder than ever   which why all countries replies the waiter  which vociferates pierrot at length the waiter  getting nothing from him but how  what  which  says why surely this fellow is either mad or drunk  which says pierrot oh damme if i know which returns the waiter but i will swear you are either one or the other  a repetition of this scene brought on an account of the plan of the pantomime itself it was constructed  in the opinion of the actor who mentioned it and who had the confidence of the poet  upon a very new and entertaining idea harlequin runs away with columbine the doctors wife and leaves his own wife harlequinette in the doctors house these last two with their familiar spirits are through the whole business the pursuers  but their power being rather inferior to that of harlequin they obtain their wishes figuratively but not literally thus harlequinette dooms them in one place to death and destruction and the scene immediately changes to an apothecarys shop in another place she entreats her spirits to convey them to where they will be surrounded with voracious animals and instantly they find themselves at a lord mayors feast this pantomime i put into the hands of the drury lane managers a considerable while before harlequin junior came out at that theater that piece has certainly some smack of mine and as mr sheridan spoke very handsomely of it to me in great queen street without mentioning its having the smallest similarity to any thing else it is not unfair to conclude that it furnished them with a hint since they did not perform my pantomime however i will not say it was their intention to reject it for before i knew their positive determination  which indeed might possibly have remained untold to this moment  i withdrew it myself in conformity to my agreement at the circus which precluded me from getting any piece performed elsewhere  i shall take this opportunity of mentioning that i sent a piece to mr colman through the medium of mr woodfall called the wits which was returned from this piece a whole scene was taken into the managers in distress almost literally mr colman may say  for no man as may be seen by his works has read more french authors  that the scene in question was borrowed from the french and therefore  fair game but it may be retorted that it was imitated not translated and though the original will furnish a hint which any body has a right to take it is a very curious thing that two men should imitate a french author in almost the same words besides the ingenuous way would have been at the time the piece was rejected to have given for a reason that there was already in his hands something on the same subject     they finished the subject of the pantomime by reading two of harlequinettes songs which they found to be a tolerable burlesque of operatical poetry the first ran thus  air do but thy recollection jog and

furled the sheets belayd the crimson petticoats displayed deserted are the useless shrouds and wenches come aboard in crowds pantomimes in general were now talked about and one of the actors gave an account of a dutch one upon the subject of abraham and isaac abraham is on the point of offering up his son and having tied him to a stake he very leisurely takes out an old rusty horse pistol and measuring six paces with great deliberation presents his piece when all of a sudden he finds some wet descend into the pan and damp the powder when looking up he sees an angel in a certain attitude who had caused what he had mistaken for rain in the midst of abrahams consternation he cries out  der traple abram wilt ta te youncker slauken in another scene there are a number of windmills which harlequin in the most delicate way that can be imagined sets a going getting further into the subject of dutch pieces they talked of their tragedies the famous cid of corneille it seems is curiously translated for the edification of the mynheers there is a wellknown passage in the play where the father of rodorigo stimulates his son to revenge and not satisfied with the assurance he had before given him stopping him bonny kitty moderato  when last from the straits we had fairly cast anchor  i went bonny kitty to hail  with quintables stord for our voyage was a spanker  and bran new was

money  and when the sly gypsies have fingered the money  the bag they give poor jack to hold   so i chased her do you see my lads under false colors swore my wishes were all at end that i would sported away all my good looking dollars and borrowed my togs of a friend oh then had you seen her no longer my honey it was varlet audacious and bold begone from my fight now you have spent all your money for kitty the bag you may hold   with that i took out double handfulls of shiners and scornfully bid her good bye twould have done your heart good had you then seen her fine airs how she would leer and she would sob and she would sigh but i stood well the broadside while jewel and honey she called me i put up the gold and bearing away as i sacked all the money left the bag for maam kitty to

sailor  though upon second thoughts it is a little out of character too for the author makes him too cunning to be duped by his lass  i will frankly own to you that i have introduced more into this greenroom scene than i ever gave in the readings but i thought it good matter for that situation  besides it has given me another opportunity of noticing an instance or two of theatrical conduct which i had before omitted indeed if managers are to be considered as caterers for the public and will buy refuse the better to snack a good handsome market penny it is but common justice to show those who sit down to this mental ordinary how they are crammed and if afterward they choose to swallow it they have nobody to blame but themselves  i shall now drop the curtain on the actors and actresses from whose theatrical world in little we are furnished with a specimen of the childish pursuits of mankind at large men are but children of a larger growth says dryden  and so true is the remark that whether the toy be a crown a scepter a ribbon or a rattle the motive is the same and the pleasure proportionably perfect one of my greatest pleasures which i will not call a toy because it has reason

clowns say no more than is set down for them to the rev mr  dear sir having purposely reserved about forty pages for general observations i shall methodize them by recapitulating very briefly those parts of the work which may yet remain for explanation and others which at present have probably a contradictory complexion also as i have taken leave to speak with some freedom and must of course expect to be treated as freely in return i shall suppose what will be said of me and as those snarlers who doubtless mean not to spare their critical flings cannot fortunately for them bark till i am out of hearing i mean to muzzle them before i go  and first as in duty bound for the musicians  i forbid all gentlemen of the bow reed or finger to accuse me of ignorance or innovation  to assert that i am no musician  to laugh at my feeble efforts to overthrow their long established impositions  to advance ipse dixits and flatter themselves that they will be creditted facts  to persuade the world they have silenced my objections when they have only confused themselves  to hold out terms of art in place of candid argument i forbid them also to publish any thing they do not write themselves  to have recourse to any but their own orthography  to attempt at wit  to believe they write calmly and in good humor at the moment they are bursting with envy and i require all persons whatever to pay no attention nor give credit to any matter or thing that may be set down in such criticisms of the said gentlemen of the bow reed or finger provided they come under the aforesaid prohibition but to show my candor and openness of conviction i hereby subscribe beforehand to all fair dispassionate argument which without subterfuge and in plain language clearly understood by readers of all descriptions shall be so written as to overturn mine  i desire all gentlemen of the law  whether licensed or unlicensed  whether they pursue unjust equity or inequitable justice  whether their line be swindling or bankruptcy  whether they are affidavitmakers or information hunters  whether their favorite instrument of ruin be a bond a cognovit a warrant of attorney a mortgage a post obit or an annuity  whether their nice distinctions between perjury and falseswearing go most to hang the innocent or save the guilty  or indeed whatever legal infamy they may be most expert in  i desire all such will abuse revile and calumniate me wherever they go being well convinced that this conduct on their part will operate much more to my advantage than any thing they can say in my favor the praise of ill men being the most wounding of all satire and i particularly request all manner of persons whatsoever if they hear of any encomiums panegyrics or any sort of commendations paid me by men of the above description that they will have the liberality to consider such encomiums panegyrics or commendations as so many studied attempts to abuse and injure me and that they will in their charitable goodness treat them accordingly  at the same time i beg leave to recommend myself and this work to the kind attention and good wishes of the worthy very few who make the laws a benefit and a blessing to their fellow creatures  whose study is to spare to mediate and to console  who poise the balance of justice so even that it may not incline in the estimation of a single hair while the reclined sword sleeps peaceably in its scabbard  to all such men do i commend myself as the only description of characters competent to guard the lives and property of individuals and to such i entreat all manner of persons to attend as the only court where justice and equity go hand in hand and therefore whose competency to determine they and i ought to acknowledge  i desire all managers and their adherents not to have the smallest uneasiness concerning me but to sleep perfectly at ease depending upon their alliances with the newspapers to blacken and confound those assertions of mine which they cannot controvert i advise them also not to put themselves to any inconvenience concerning the style and manner of their entertainments but since genius and judgment are not to be commanded jog on in the old way relying upon the goodnature of the english and the fecundity of their own imaginations in the art of puffing in their report of me i court their reprobation upon the same principle and for the same reason i do that of the lawyers i desire they will indulge themselves to the full extent of their wishes and in particular let them not fail to cut a great many jokes and let a great many puns as to my future intentions i would wish them to believe that i am not going to india but on the contrary that i shall by and by solicit to be received among them and i recommend them to enjoy in contemplation the slavery subjection and humiliation which they shall hereafter see me in and to meditate the most expedient modes of varying and continuing such treatment against the time  which i would have them flatter themselves will arrive upon holding up a finger  when they shall have me again in their clutches and i entreat all and every person or persons to whose knowledge this subject may come if it so happen that nothing shall be advanced by way of answer to whatever i may have asserted to believe  in spite of the affected indifference such conduct may seem to convey  that it will be put on for no other reason than because my arguments are unanswerable and because an attempt to refute them would only show the weakness of their cause but betray that secret envy which would operate equal to a confession of the truth  my next jubject will be the reviewers a few twigs of whose critical rod at least i shall be able to break and if every writer had the same constancy that tremendous object that terrific hobgoblin which men of weak minds and slender intellects worship  as indians do the devil  out of fear would very soon appear a poor inoffensive thing engendered only by splenitive ideas and a contemplation of cobwebs in libraries adieu  yours c dibdin london april          letter c critical anticipation  yes and you shall hear what i will say to the justice of peace to the rev mr  dear sir i thank you for your fears because they arise from friendship but be assured they arise from a false view of the matter tell me what you think when you have read the following letter  to the reviewers gentlemen i should be glad to know by what authority you take upon you to pronounce away the good name of those authors who come under the lash of your criticism or bid others rise into fame whose works have the transcendant advantage of your decree in their favor  if you are a chartered body  though i never heard of any power competent to confirm such establishment  and have an exclusive right to exercise laws not cognizable by other courts of criticism i have only to lament that in a country like this there should be a literary inquisition for as no persuasion is so likely to breed schisms as the study of letters so every mans opinion may by the exercise of very slender abilities be construed into critical heterodox for which impiety  should it really appear that he is amenable to your jurisdiction  what racks and slow fires may not be dreaded on the first day of every month when you regularly celebrate your aute de se  being an englishman therefore i call upon all others to protest  as i do myself upon this present occasion  against the competency of your power having no scruple to declare that as wounding the mind is a torture of a much more exquisite nature than lacerating the body so the cruelties you practice are as reprehensible a violence on erudition as those of spain or portugal were on religion i know your advocates have thrown out to palliate the matter that you wound with blunt arrows which in my opinion is an aggravation of your inhumanity  for every body knows the keenest weapon inflicts the least pain  i have often laughed at the susceptibility of literary men concerning your criticisms some have gnashed their teeth and imputed all you have said to envy which as far as my humble judgment serves me does not appear  for by the little i have seen your temperaments are too frigid to admit of any such tingling passion others have been ready to burst while they swore they endured their torture with all the intrepidity and resolution of primitive americans in short the sensibility of all is in some degree wounded and every one threatens you with a cutting answer  which he dares not write  on these occasions my constant advice is not to read you at all and then you might as well have not written at all for if the writer himself be not hurt the rest of the world find in you only what they expected and after your reviews have wrapped up stuff black pins or pectoral lozenges or been appropriated to other uses  which if they were written to mortify unfortunate authors are at least as worthy as those for which they were designed  you are as little regarded as any other temporary casualty which excites our wonder today and tomorrow is forgotten  some however look into you upon the principle of the man who wants to be taken up  in hopes of being abused colley cibber used to tell his son that so he contrived to let the world speak of him it did not matter what it said and as far as it relates to you i look upon this maxim of his to be much about the fact but lest you should imagine i affect all this carelessness in the moment i am under the keenest apprehensions as to what you may choose to say relative to this tour i will put the certainty of my enjoying the very tranquillity i describe so far  even beyond your power to doubt or reason away  that you shall in this instance at least confess  those who review the imperfections of others do not always appear the most perfect upon a review themselves  when a prejudice has taken root in an early mind it is pretty difficult to remove it  especially when planted by reason and strengthened by experience eighteen years ago i wrote a piece called the wedding ring and so much did i dread the reviewers that in the most irresolute state i walked up and down georges coffee house with a review in each hand for a considerable time without the courage to open either of them at length plucking up spirits i sneaked into the most obscure corner i could find and was presently lifted into ecstacy by reading as nearly as i can remember the following words  this piece is an imitation of il filosofo di campagna it is done into english by mr dibdin who has improved on the original and rendered it a very pleasing entertainment  having swallowed with avidity these honey words i began to think if i were to fortunate in my first search that probably on a second i should still have greater reason to rejoice and like a man who instead of quietly pocketing the money for a twenty pound prize in the lottery leaves it behind for a ticket which comes up a blank i was determined to stand another literary chance regardless of what might be the consequence  upon opening the other review i found these words or at least perfectly the sense of them  this piece which is taken from il filosofo di campagna has very little to recommend it to the notice of the public  it is much inferior to the original and mr dibdin has no pretensions upon this occasion to think himself capable of furnishing an agreeable entertainment to the public  i have already said that this happened eighteen years ago therefore i will not swear to the letter of these articles to the spirit however i do most peremptorily it had as strong an effect upon me as being introduced behind the curtain of a jugler or a puppetshewman and so completely was i in the secret that i made a resolution which i have ever since religiously kept not to read a single review of any thing i should write from that moment as therefore i pique myself upon acknowledging obligations i desire you will accept my sincerest thanks for grubbing up by the root as it were all those mortifications which on reading that abuse sure to be levelled  deservedly or undeservedly  at public characters i might have felt in common with other men for to the detection of the inconsistency recorded above i owe my never having answered in my whole life a single printed calumny unless it has been of so injurious a nature that it could not be passed over and then i have constantly signed my name whatever you say therefore of this tour will be unread by me  i advise you however to look to your own consistency and properly to do so it will not hurt you if you peruse the following letter to my reverend friend which will treat wholly of general criticism  i am gentlemen your obedient servant c dibdin   and my dear friend i am  yours most faithfully c dibdin london april          letter ci a critical examination  ashamed she marks the passage with a blot  and hates the line where candor was forgot  to the rev mr  dear sir it has often been allowed that the talents for a writer and a critic are distinct and separate if by this it be meant that the knack of finding fault is easier than the capacity to invent and improve the position is a fair one but this would prove mere cavilling to be true criticism which i will not admit the truth is no man can with the proper degree of perspicuity feeling and tenderness analyze the work of a writer but a writer and all those who poach for errors and take away imperfections without the ability to leave beauties in their place are not real judges of what they arrogate a right to decide on and consequently ought not to be entitled critics  in this light perhaps the matter has not always been seen and yet it is the only one which will give it its true color modern criticism is like looking at the sun to discover only the spots while the servour and brilliancy of his luster are disregarded but ought an ingenious and enlightened age to pay the effusions of such folly a moments attention no let the decisions upon works of genius come from men who possess congenial sentiments these only are qualified for the task and will be most likely to treat with candor and delicacy that which they know the pain and labor of producing and look with care and circumspection before they venture to wound those parts in others which upon fair inspection they may find vulnerable in themselves  i will not say should personal enmity or rooted difference of opinion interfere that severity in place of lenity will not sometimes be adopted men are fallible and a bold and flowing pen is a tempting instrument to accelerate the dictates of revenge but even then they will always remember that their antagonists can weild the same weapon and for the worlds improvement it is well such conflicts are the loss of victory is some triumph in a noble contest i know not whether king john of france waited on by the black prince is not almost at that moment as much an object of envy as his illustrious conqueror  i am clearly of opinion that if literary works were to appear only before such a tribunal the press would be more employed and the amendment have this operation dawning merit would be fostered mature abilities stimulated to a repetition of their exertions and what would be equally a public benefit pretenders would be at once silenced  whereas thanks to reviews newspapers and pamphlets men of real talents are deterred from ornamenting the world with their productions and the dull vapid offspring of insipidity and ignorance puffed into fame let me beseech therefore all those who read weigh and approve these reasons to prescribe for themselves the following simple and efficient rule  when any man decries a work of genius let him be asked if he can do as well or if his opinions be public let enquiry be made as to his own productions and do not let him be credited unless something be found equal in consequence as to every literary requisite to the work he undertakes to criticize  as to pointing out mere inaccuracies it is not more invidious and contemptible than it is an affront to the reader by whom these critical gentlemen choose to act in the quality of schoolmaster besides there cannot be a higher compliment to him they would affect to condemn  for it both implies that his faults are trifles and his merit beyond the reach of their capacity  the observations here made have this drift i do not know that from any body a volume of this size would be more considered as a piece of consummate arrogance than from myself and when it is understood that i have presumed to speak plainly of popular subjects and advanced decided sentiments which were they to obtain would go to the correction at least of several favorite follies i know not where the clamor may stop should it be very loud however i shall beg leave of the candid and ingenuous to enquire who are clamourous and if it turn out to be the very men whose impositions on the public are the objects of my reprehension every one whose opinion i have a legitimate right to value will rank on my side and then let us see whether an army of critical malcontents will stand any chance with such a phalanx  nothing in nature is so easy as to find fault bright geniuses as naturally breed critics as the sun engenders flies who has fed more grubs than dr johnson one of these was congratulating another on some recent success when he was answered oh this is nothing at all  stay till i do the dictionary why surely said the other you would not have the impudence to attack that  no no he is safe there aye how so why he has given the real etymology of all words from every authority he could gather god said the critic i did not know that for i never read it but if that is the case it will not do sure enough  for what every body says must be true  therefore let the witlings take care for they may be assured in proportion as they are abusive so they will lift me into consequence  yet will i by way of caution to the judicious say a few words if when i am gone it should be advanced that any of my assertions are false let the manner of my making them be considered the proofs i adduce examined and the ground of their probability looked into  if it be said that while i reprobate criticisms i arrogate the title of critic myself thereby insinuating that i have a right to rank with the only description which according to my idea are competent to decide on works of literature i beg to say that mine are not criticisms but mere observations and that they do not go to the correction of errors but abuses for instance what does all i say of mr sheridan amount to but that he could have written and invented much better and probably would have done so had he not conceived that if he had outgone wycherly and congreve he would have been gazed at as a comet and then lost whereas his business was to move like a planet in the regular course of periodical revolution  if it be remarked that i irregularly bred  according to my own confession  in the school of music have presumed to hold forth a rod for the correction of public taste  which has been formed by the combined excellence of men whose abilities have received universal admiration  let it be remembered that i only wish to prune the luxuriant and superfluous branches off this tree of taste and throw away the rotten and withered fruit that so it may produce vigorously that quantity it is capable of bearing giving it beauty maturity and flavor  my next will contain a discussion of these matters in a lighter way by the end of which i shall have pretty well anticipated all objections in a literary point of view  except my general errata which i reserve for the last letter but one adieu i shall soon have done subscribing myself but never being  yours most faithfully c dibdin london april          letter cii more anticipation  do not be too servile neither to the rev mr  dear sir it has been frequently considered by authors as a sufficient apology for the incongruity of their works that they were written in a hurry  which by the way is the last excuse that ought to be made is it done to give an idea that the public will swallow any thing be it ever so crude or immature or would they seem to say see what an excellent composition i have given you in so short a time  what would it have been if i had taken pains about it  how unfortunate am i then who am obliged to offer this hacknied excuse for the crudities that are to be found in this book which has been written in a greater hurry than ever book was a friend of mine was firmly of opinion that i should be at least a twelvemonth in getting it out from the first day i began to print and i really may venture to affirm that so much ground of argument and english ground have never been gone over together in so short a time but i will not be so unfair however as to avail myself of this opportunity of getting off but honestly confess that though i have chosen a pretty extensive field i do not think i could have explored it to better purpose had i taken ever so much time  for i have put up plenty of game and to have gone over all the shiftings and doublings would perhaps have rendered the chase tedious instead of amusing  to speak literally i might have expressed myself with more variety and closer accuracy than i have done but correctness is with me a cold word and if a revision of any thing take away of spirit more than it add of elegance let me go into the world with whatever faults the critics can point out so that men of strong feeling and candid discrimination will but acknowledge in me lively fancy decent language poignant remark apt epithet and argument something like axiom  as times go the art of keeping people awake has its merit and if i can but accomplish this i shall have triumphed over many writers and those  not to speak it profanely  that i have heard praised too who believing that a man takes up a book to shun his thoughts the more effectually to obliviate them  if they literati will admit my expression  seem as if they invented a sort of literary laudanum which should set him asleep without an obligation to the apothecary  the temperatures of all authors are not alike some only muddy and confound their ideas by frequent thinking  like the actor who reproved by rich for being imperfect on the fiftythird night of the beggars opera cried out good god sir would you have a man remember a thing for ever others catch hold of superficial ideas which leave no perceptible trace in the mind any more than a meteor in the air these though beautiful in the conception come to nothing upon proof they are as absurd as would be a specimen of a fine hand writing in vitriol which would be lost upon being committed to paper and destroy that which it solicited to embellish  i shall be blamed by some for introducing so much figure  but i own i love imagery and where description is necessary  particularly in the latitude of epistolary writing which it will be pretty difficult i believe to square by any rule as to its mode of language  i see no reason why this powerful literary auxiliary should not be called in to the assistance of prose as well as poetry  addison writes on the pleasures of the imagination as critically exact and in language as correctly chaste as he introduces will whimble or sir roger de coverlys rookery  all which is perfectly laudable as far as it relates to establishing a reputation for a just and accurate style but surely if he had been a little more volatile and stretched a point to have given us a glowing description or two on a subject so full of inspiration it would not have hurt but rather lent assistance to that sober solemnity which throughout his whole writings partakes a little too much of his spectatorial taciturnity  but it was his way  like the gravity of the bath audience or cervettos yawn  and this granted it is not impossible but that praise which pope thought was meant to damn  it was so faint  conveyed or was intended to do so as warm an encomium as the frigid  or rather elegant  conception of the writer was capable of admitting  for this reason i think drydens prose is the best in our language  for though yet prose it has all the fire strength and imagination of poetry  yet cannot i quit this subject without noticing how much i admire the wonderful ease of swift i would indeed go through a list of all those who have delighted me but that i hasten very fast to a finish of my journey and cannot stay to bait on the road however agreeable may be the fare provided for me and because by the side of their superior productions mine would show like a simple field flower compared to the beauty and richness of a variegated parterre  you however prize it and for that and a thousand other reasons i remain  most sincerely yours c dibdin london april          letter ciii a cursory recapitulation  there i gave it her home brother bruin to the rev mr  dear sir i have this moment finished reading for the first time in a collected state all the letters that are at present printed and instead of a general recapitulation of the whole matter which i thought would be positively necessary so well is the proper connection preserved  notwithstanding the manifest disadvantages i have labored under  that i shall only have occasion to rub off hardnesses and throw in some finishing touches to make this picture have a proper roundness and harmony in its general effects  i have said early in the work that i expected to leave england in the beginning of april  which it was certainly my firm determination to accomplish had it been eligibly practicable but i will heartily declare that when i found should i do so i must have gone abroad in a more unpleasant way than  i thank my able and willing friends  i am now likely to do i thought i might take the liberty of altering my intention  especially as i can now make so desirable an apology to those who wish me well which number i am sure is in a multiplied state and by no mean figure since i have had it in my power to tell my own story  it was my intention to have gone into the laws respecting the regulations of public entertainments but as that business has not only been argued on in every possible way but at length taken the very form i long ago predicted it would a further investigation of what is passed were totally unnecessary i shall take the liberty however to offer a few words as to what may come of it and mention how in my sense the matter ought to be and first it would be but common policy to introduce into the new bill how the amusements are to be regulated beyond the circle of twenty miles out of london for i can assure mr mainwaring that the proprietors of theaters royal in the country begin to grow very jealous of their privileges and if they should form a mistaken zeal or  what is full as likely  with an eye to their own advantage put down all the unlicensed theaters or indeed should any indifferent person  now the laws are explained  do so for the reward there is not an actor out of london who would not starve for it is not by the theaters royal where they have a large rent a number of servants and heavy nightly expenses to pay but by the snug comfortable returns and reasonable disbursements that a scheme of this kind maintains itself york is sure to lose money but leeds and wakefield never fail to bring the company up again in short let the matter be equalized  let men without respect of persons who pay a sum of money and give security have licenses which may be of various prices according to the nature of the entertainment meant to be given this would exclude all possibility of monopoly stimulate men of talents to exert themselves and make the name of actor  and why it should not be so no man upon earth can give a sensible reason  respectable it might also ultimately contribute toward the exigencies of the state and by a general regulation be made like the amusements in france of national consequence mr sheridan has i know held out that it would not be productive but the matter was not at that time pressed otherwise there can be no doubt but he would have seen to the contrary for it can be proved without difficulty that public amusements would yield as a tax forty thousand pounds a year he has also talked lately that it would be a hardship were the privileges of the two theaters  as if they were guaranteed by patents to the exclusion of all others  should be trenched upon for they are a property worth little less than two hundred thousand pounds this is speculatively true but substantially false  but if it were literally the fact there is not the smallest equity in this mode of argument the royalty theater or the circus cost as large a sum originally as either drury lane or covent garden theater and if the wardrobe scenes and other articles have swelled the property to such an immense sum  which by the bye is a little extraordinary for the last time they were put up to sale one yielded but sixty and the other seventy thousand pounds  is it money or success that has produced it  but to ask what this boasted property is worth stripped of the patent is the only way to know its intrinsic value in which case i believe we should find that the trappings would be about equal to the mock honors of the actor who wears them that ninetenths of the scenes have been considered only as so much spare wood and canvas ever since the tragedy opera or pantomime they embellished was damned or finished its run and the gilt chariots plumed caps spears shields and all that waste of spangles and gilt leather that make processions stared at  thrown by to crowd up the flies or encumber the propertyroom in short to render mr sheridans meaning so as to make it consonant to common sense is to suppose he says this we had a large ideal property which you realized by giving us a power to exercise our trade of which that property is the working tools  if you give these people an equal power their property will be as large as ours  and this is not fair why  shall one merchant entreat government to prohibit the commerce of another lest he also should grow rich no  let each do his utmost it is for the general good thus will a laudable emulation stimulate them to industry and a watchfulness over each other prevent mutual abuses  the sensible part of the world set down public amusements as ruined when mr sheridan and mr harris coalesced and the short time that monopoly went on confirmed this truth so strongly that it was clearly demonstrable a petition for the emancipation of theatrical slaves would soon have been full as necessary as those at present preferred in favor of the africans  i profess to be a little au fait to this matter and therefore it must not to me be objected that more than two public places cannot subsist in london at the same time have not houses at an immense price been purchased to be pulled down  has not invention been racked to prop the crazy walls and roofs of the two theaters till they have been stretched into the size of four and has not this expense been repaid first by laying an additional charge on the benefits of authors and actors  which were first sixty guineas afterward eighty and now an hundred  and then ten fold by the receipts of first nights which as the theater is sure to fill must of course pay all the expense of a first performance whether it succeed or not which clearly proves the manager is safe whatever may be the fate of the poor author in fact ten places of public entertainment might in the metropolis thrive supported by real merit and proper variety for that wonderful place has grown more rich and populous every day since the establishment of the present theaters but were this to obtain there would be an actual necessity for calling in the assistance of men of real abilities who will not after the treatment they have received lend their help without being properly rewarded  and this would overthrow the whole of the present system for it is evident the theater can as it is yield money enough without the smallest aid of genius or ability at all  there are but two things  either let the management of theaters be considered as a traffic that every body has a right to derive a benefit from who chooses to adventure in it or let it be understood as a grant to the proprietors of two houses in london and if you will one in every other city or opulent town in the kingdom who are to be considered as the purveyors of the public and obliged under that idea to provide the best entertainment that can be had how will it operate no single theater in the kingdom except those in london produces the smallest novelty  if therefore performances void of merit are permitted at the two theaters they go through the whole nation and are sure the source being contaminated to poison the general taste thus genius  for whose support and encouragement theaters were surely originally intended  may retire unknown and neglected to deplore the ingratitude of the most benevolent country upon earth  had i time to go over the ground of establishing theaters by purchaseable licenses i should not despair of proving that it would answer every desirable end to the managers the public and the legislature but since at present however the subject does not seem likely to take this turn i shall content myself with saying  as more cannot be meant by vesting partial powers in the hands of individuals than that such men should act in conformity with the wish and properly provide for the pleasure of the public  this law like any other should be watched and managers laid under a restriction not to reject works of acknowledged merit for this purpose a sort of board of control might be instituted who should have power to take cognizance of every omission of this kind and let the authority of that body determine in what way pieces should be produced so as to conduce to the mutual advantage of author and manager if it be objected that the cure is worse than the evil it selfevidently proves that the measure is in itself wrong and that the legislature by giving an unlimitted power to managers will check that genius it is their duty to encourage and cherish that very licentiousness they are so solicitous to curb  in a word as the laws now are a manager  either from want of principle or ability  being absolute may exercise what tyranny he shall think proper i therefore hope for the sake of consistency this power will be in some way restrained if it were only for the propriety of not countenancing despotism in a land of freedom adieu  yours with great truth c dibdin london april          letter civ more account of matter brought up  is it in the newspaper i dont like that  now i do  for then it is likely it may not be truth  to the rev mr  dear sir having done with the theaters  to which subject i wish i could have allotted more room i proceed to my task of looking further over those parts of the work which may need elucidation and others that may with propriety be revived in order to be heightened  i have said that i should be able to point out many errors in mr patersons traveling dictionary  which is certainly in many places incorrect i have shown how i calculated falsely all the way from bury to worcester owing to the faith i gave to that book from halifax to sheffield which according to mr paterson is forty miles is really no more than thirtysix from sheffield to manchester said to be forty miles is fortytwo from manchester to liverpool set down forty miles is but thirtysix from leeds to halifax said to be sixteen miles is eighteen from halifax to manchester set down thirty is but twentyeight  and indeed there are many other errors of the like kind  i shall next take an opportunity of mentioning which i look upon as common justice that long after the letter was printed containing an explanation of the business between mr daly the irish manager and myself the note of ten pounds was paid this however i had no notice of till i received a letter at liverpool mentioning it on the eighth of march last  making very nearly a twelvemonth from the time of the original transaction but i do not yet repent of noticing it in the way i have for the pieces which are far more valuable are not to this moment returned  at the latter end of the twentyfirst letter i have mentioned leaving my kind friends at colchester before i have actually been there  this arose from writing the twentysecond letter first or the reader may if he please believe that i purposely left myself this opportunity of recurring to a circumstance which will certainly ever furnish me with grateful reflections the fact is however as i have set it down  i have to speak of newspapers and the first thing i shall say is that it is astonishing to see how they multiply i remember when the daily advertiser the public advertiser the gazetteer the ledger and two evening papers made up  except the craftsman on a saturday  the whole stock of public prints in london and one or at most two papers in a county contented the people in the country and really at that time there was something like independent principles in the conduct of the public prints the morning chronicle even outwent this and for a few years was conducted  particularly as to theatrical strictures  upon the most disinterested and impartial plan that ever was characterized by candor and fearless truth but alas what force of abilities and integrity can hold out against free tickets countenance attention compliments and in fact an anticipation of every little pleasurable wish and convenience but troy fell and so did the morning chronicle  which having first implicitly bowed to the mandate of managers to finish the business took a decided part in politics and is now decidedly  nowhere the morning post blazed on us at once  it attacked every thing and seared nothing  consequently its popularity was very soon confirmed this paper is memorable for teaching advertisers how to write and what puff says in the critic has certainly its origin from the superior style in which auctions were advertised in the morning post which set every body mad for highflown paragraphical descriptions of trifles for as foot has it they had as much to say upon a ribband as a raphael the dauntless attacks however were its staple commodity its stamina through which it presently grew vigorous and rich at this time thinking i suppose that abuse alone was necessary to lift a public print into popularity a set of levelling gentlemen brought out the general advertiser which to be sure did deal about sheer mud and filth in a most liberal  or rather illiberal  way without regard to sex age or condition having however forgot that the satire in the morning post was written in the style of a gentleman and though very severe gave evident marks of genius and conveyed good strength of argument they presently found themselves decried among all those who had ability to judge or taste to distinguish yet as in this country are to be found plenty of those who love to feast now and then on a neighbors reputation this worthy paper though full of nothing but the grossest and most ignorant scurrility  which accomplished quality it retains to this very day  became a great favorite among the lower sort of people  i shall go through a remainder of this subject in my next letter  being the last but two on which i shall trouble the public or telling you except privately how much i am  your very obliged friend c dibdin london april          letter cv more news  how are we ruined to the rev mr  dear sir thus did the newspapers with all the calmness and goodnature imaginable revile abuse and vilify each other by mutual agreement for a considerable time without receiving the smallest interruption to their laudable endeavors  at length some of the underlings belonging to the morning post  headed by that renowned veteran doctor kenrick  resolving to have a morning post of their own without any previous intimation came out all of a sudden with a new paper under that title this scheme was as expeditiously stopped as it was ridiculously put into practice the malcontents however were continually fomenting disputes till thinking themselves equal to the conduct of the paper without assistance from their principal they proposed terms of separation which were handsomely and honorably acceded to and the establishment of the morning herald was the consequence which is now without doubt  except in that virulent and disgraceful party heat which some have not spared to think is a convention with the morning post to make both popular  is the most brilliant paper extant indeed how should it be otherwise when in addition to the keen and penetrating judgment and solid good sense of its fabricator it is notorious that the flower of the opposition have at times made it the conveyance of their public sentiments  after they had gone on in this manner for a time gathering strength  like anteus by being abased  the universal register now called the times was produced without a single recommendation but being printed logographically treading however in the steps or rather edging itself into the situation of the ledger  which paper began now to be on the decline  it circulated pretty well  last of all came out the world  of which paper i shall not say an unkind word if it be only for its sensible and steady attachment to that most noble and manly of all subjects  the virtues of the prince of wales certainly it was stimulated to this theme by an act of public justice unparalelled in the annals of any country for is there an instance upon recordworthy equal attention to this  where the heir of such a glorious crown with a ripened wisdom and spartan greatness of soul at twenty preferred to see his palace in ruins rather than his tradesmen should go unpaid there are no words adequate to the praise of such an action admiration must tell it it must be felt  nay it is in that uniform heartfelt transport with which men gaze on their idol who gave them so early a proof that he is not more a munificent prince  than an honest man  it would not be credited were it not as evident as light that these nine papers are so pampered with success that though advertisements  which are charged equally at the stampoffice  are now rated from five and sixpence to fourteen or fifteen shillings they garble what they think proper disappoint when they think proper and advertise for whom they think proper in short the very end proposed in advertising is defeated by their shameful neglect or scandalous perversion of what is committed to their care  this it seems has roused a number of opulent and respectable men who having themselves sustained great inconvenience from such kind of conduct are now at an immense expense and with a spirit hitherto unequalled bringing out a paper to be called the star  this paper will be out before what i am now writing can be read and this tour will finally go to press before this novel hesperus will have made its appearance therefore i cannot at any rate give more than a blind judgment on the business it will however be fair to conclude that the immense property the gentlemen engaged in this undertaking are able to muster  which is an ingredient by the bye never yet possessed by the establishers of a new public print  will certainly if they go the right way to work render their undertaking a very popular one it has one novelty to recommend it it will be published every evening and if their source of intelligence be genuine and within themselves and they can in consequence anticipate the articles of the following day it will really become a very valuable acquisition to the public some amendment most assuredly has long been wanted and by the easiest assent in the world they may rise to the summit of their wishes  for it consists of nothing more than to avoid the errors of the other daily prints which are so glaring that it is not only those who run may read but those who run may correct  i shall not speak of evening papers for they are a sort of moons to the others and it would be only to reflect a reflection in the whole there are in london  taking in the three sunday papers  about twenty under different titles  all which yield prodigious profit indeed more individually than when there were but four which i think is a pretty conclusive proof that an increase of theaters would be proportionally productive  in the country where several fortunes have been made by newspapers alone there are i should suppose ten for every one that was to be seen twentyfive years ago and the short history of them in general is this they are indefatigable to procure entertaining and useful intelligence till they fill with advertisements and then a pair of scissars become the editor which are indiscriminately brandished by compositors and devils to the great annoyance of lloyds evening post and the unmerciful mutilation of the st jamess chronicle  some exceptions however there are to this rule and the strongest i know by infinite degrees is the sheffield register i do not know how soon my friend gales may make a fortune which ultimately must inevitably happen if unwearied industry fair dealing the worlds regard and a well stocked head as well as shop are the materials to procure it but let it happen when it will i shall change my good opinion of him  which is at present pretty strongly rooted  if he so far forget his patrons the public as to neglect them in return for their favors i think however he will not and so much do i approve his paper that i have made choice of it to announce what will publicly be known of me in future and i here conformably to such resolution give notice that nothing relative to me is to be considered as authentic but what shall appear in or through the medium of the sheffield register  there may be other matters which are yet untouched if so in that state they must remain leaving it to the goodnature of my readers to overlook what in my haste i may have omitted  while i make use of the little time i have to draw up a general correction of errors in minuter matters  adieu my next letter though necessary will be tedious i shall endeavor therefore  in the way of a story or a song on a tiresome journey  to enliven it with a few remarks not forgetting however first to remark that i am as usual  yours very truly c dibdin london april          letter cvi a general errata  all offenses my lord come from the heart  never came any from mine  to the rev mr  dear sir i had a great mind not to write this letter but there is something so easy in me that i may be persuaded into any thing what i am about to set down is a candid exposition of all the errors this book contains  which being given in a new way i may perhaps from some be credited for having committed these faults on purpose to introduce novelty even in my very errata  one reason for my wish to say nothing about it was that the ingenuous part of my readers when they meet with a typographical mistake will have the goodness and  what is better in the reading of a book  the good sense to believe that the best substitute for the improper word their invention could supply was the very individual expression meant by the author  a second reason was that it would really be a pity to deprive the critical fry of a little nibbling  who live upon the errors of the press as young trouts do upon may flies till by and by the insects are all gone when searching for their prey with the usual avidity they get hooked for their pains  i had many others but the most substantial was that my modesty would become the sacrifice in such a trial  for if i say any thing about it at all common justice will oblige me to pronounce that this book though abounding with errors is the most perfect that ever was published  having so far dipped into this subject as to have been guilty of an apparent solecism my reputation demands that i should set the matter to rights relying therefore on the candor of the public i blush and go on  nothing can controvert that assertion which affirms that comparison is the only criterion by which any thing ought to be judged let it then be considered that when this book was first begun i had not the smallest idea what form it would take that i have been three thousand miles to search for the matter with which it is furnished that it was utterly impracticable i should myself superintend more than the first sixtyfour pages that i have not had recourse to a document of any kind  not even my own letters of which it was impossible to write or keep a copy that during the whole time till my last arrival in town i had on my mind the weight of performing a most laborious entertainment  perhaps four times a week that i have been under the necessity of accepting a great number of invitations that in the course of the time i have not written so few as five hundred private letters let all this i say be put against the advantages which attend the productions of writers in general in their way to the world and then try by what degree of comparison this work is more or less perfect than any other it is clear  and every reader has given it in my favor confessing that instead of so small a number of errors it is wonderful there are not twenty times as many every reader yes my friends have proclaimed it and my enemies cursed me bit their lips and owned it  in secret  i shall begin with those errors which are of the greatest magnitude  but these are not typographical the language in many places is not sufficiently perspicuous and frequently aiming at strength  for i hate any thing lukewarm  i am afraid i have been now and then a little uncouth in my style  the errors of the press are at least twothirds of them chargeable to me in the first place i write  especially when imagination is hard at work  a most villainous hand and as more than threefourths of the copy has gone letter after letter by the post there was nothing for it but to print away  in doing which mr gales has proved himself possessed of no mean abilities at decyphering but i will go over the errors in the order they happened  the first p    is a very curious one for it describes liverpool to be east of leeds nine out of ten however upon reading it would have said this is an error of the press it should be west p  0  l    it will easily be credited that i meant to say the dean and chapter of lichfield were providently repairing their cathedral  and not providentially p     l   dele in before conduct  for it should read the men who conduct those passage boats p     l   read on the stage  and not on to the stage p     l    read pollard  and not holland same page last line but two dele much  and read on being a man as well as a monarch this ought to be set right for it is that trait of his character on which our most gracious sovereign prides himself p     l  0 here is a mistake occasioned without a doubt by some omission of mine how i intended to express myself at that moment it is totally out of my power at this distance of time to say but the passage will read tolerably well if the reader will entirely omit the words then to say that after all there is some whim in this kind of errata for it looks  wholly without intention however  like a satire on the amendments of motions in the house of commons p     l   read of a more sane nature  and not sape in the letter to mr harris to say i did not mean to say more privater  though it might have been in the style of some of his people is unnecessary therefore the reader will please to dele more and let privater stand alone p     l   place a comma after arguments and put a period to theater l   read level instead of head l  0 same page p   0 l  0 for when  read where p     l   read accommodating the melody to the capacity of the trumpets  jack in the wood  read jack in thy mood every body knows it it is a speech of mercutio p     l   for sconce read nonce p   0 l    read der tiple instead of der traple p     in the motto of a few of the copies the vizor speaks the art instead of heart p     last line but one  expose not explore false charms p     l    after the word dangers add scars p   0 l   instead of recommendation to passengers read accommodation to passengers in the note p     instead of prevailed read having prevailed p     in the account of garricks maneuvers relative to the jubilee it should be he raised a prodigious number of volunteers whose exertions he pretty liberally exacted  not extracted in the song from poor vulcan read quinze  not quince p    last line but one instead of wish safe read wish me safe p  0  last line but one instead of only read not only p     read auto de fe not aute de fe p   0 l   instead of if they literati read if the literati  there are other errors of less note such as sensecutive instead of consecutive  invetend instead of invented  diving instead of driving  a the to be taken out before theater  subtel instead of subtle  whetever instead of wherever  seviture instead of serviteur  pbojector for projector  aburnot instead arbuthnot and perhaps a few others  the pointing also has in some places altered the sense and perhaps a turned letter or two will now and then be met with in return however for all these imperfections the work is beautifully printed the letter is new and clean the lines are leaded that they may be read without confusion and the presswork  which is no trifle in a large publication  carefully and nearly executed indeed so much solicitude has mr gales shown in the getting out this work and real judgment and understanding in being able to conduct it under such circumstances that he has as usual anticipated my praise by letting his labor speak his panegyric i do not know what degree of influence my recommendation of him may have but if his mode of treating others be equally obliging  and there is no reason to doubt it for i am sure my pretensions to a preference are slight indeed  he will recommend himself which it must be confessed is a very enviable style of patronage  before i quit this comedy or farce of errors if you please i must not omit to set one very material matter to rights in doing which however it will appear that we were obliged to maneuver now and then and pretty ingeniously to get out this tour through the medium of the general post  when i went last from sheffield to liverpool the matter then written went no farther than letter     which the reader will see is dated sheffield march   as i well knew the hospitality i should find at liverpool on my return and the variety of pleasures that would be kindly chalked out for me i felt myself conscious that to keep pace with mr gales would be no easy matter we therefore agreed that as soon as letter    should be finished to go on upon letter    which begins the readings as instead of inventing i should in that case have nothing to do but copy thus we calculated that there would be a vacancy of thirty letters  a number sufficient to contain all that it would be necessary to say on the tour itself and the statement of pieces we outreckoned ourselves however two ways in the first place in bringing up the matter to page  0  instead of  0  or  0  we found ourselves entangled with an odd quarter of a sheet and were thus obliged to have duplicates of the pages  0  and  0  though the matter will be found different this will all be clearly understood by noticing that letter    is dated as above sheffield march   letter     which begins the readings  is dated liverpool march   letter     which finishes the readings  s dated london march    and letter     which returns again to the main subject is dated london march     the advantage of this maneuver superadded to that which i have already mentioned was supposed to be that i should be able to superintend all that remainder of the work the proposed end however was defeated  for i have not seen sheffield  except for about eighteen hours  since the fourth of march  another error necessary to be mentioned is this letting the pages remain on the form after the matter was distributed those two half sheets which are distinguished by the colating letters   q and   r will be found to be the same pages viz             and     though different matter these particulars are mentioned merely for the information of the public you may remember i privately apprized you of them as we went on  these are the hardnesses i thought it necessary to rub off to which perhaps it will not be unnecessary to add that as there can be no doubt but that my absence will be immediately taken advantage of and as it is not impossible not only that much spurious trash may be given out for mine but also that my real compositions may surreptitiously get into the world i entreat the public not to credit any declaration either in print or otherwise to this effect not properly authenticated and i also give notice that i shall have left authority behind me to prosecute all those who shall either perform or publish any composition of mine without my written permission  this last declaration has put it in my power to finish this letter very pleasurably by mentioning mr preston in the strand i desire he will accept my public thanks for the innumerable kindnesses i have received at his hands and i sincerely hope that the music of liberty hall harvest home the songs in the readings and the variety of other things he has liberally purchased of me may by being productive to him in some degree acquit me of so large a load of obligations to advise all persons who may have dealings in his way to apply to him is only asking them to consider their own interest it is upon that principle i am happy to find that it has been in my power to contribute some little toward the extension of his immense country correspondence for i have never returned to any place where i have not been thanked for my recommendation in short if a large capital a strong back a well conducted home manufactory the best materials a reasonable price strict fidelity the most minute care and attention and a remarkable dispatch and punctuality are the true requisites of an opulent and respectable man of business mr preston certainly answers the description to which he adds  and my own feelings strongly evince it  all the warmth sincerity and generosity of a faithful and valuable friend  the heightening touches will come in the next letter and finish this picture after which it may be hung up  like of that of praxitiles  on the second day when i will venture to say if there be any beauties in truth some of them will be here allowed  if it were only a repetition of those truths which have marked me as  your very thankful friend c dibdin london april  0       letter cvii conclusion  and now i am come to the end of my song to the rev mr  dear sir i come now to that moment to which i have so long looked with panting anxiety to garrick it was an awful one for he had every enjoyment his little heart could wish he was courted encouraged flattered and caressed his productions were shown to all possible advantage his very foibles were objects of imitation and all this  he left to me it is a welcome moment for i have had but little enjoyment  except that cheerfulness of heart which has so often galled my oppressors i have been envied discouraged vilified and traduced obliged to sustain every possible humiliation  while my poor attempts have been ushered into the world under the most mortifying disadvantages and from all this  i emancipate  it was with peculiar propriety that i put this resolution in practice by an appeal to the public in the course of such a length of time i must of necessity have noticed many shameful impositions to communicate such information as might go to the detection if not the cure of these i conceived it my duty  as a mite of gratitude in return for the innumerable instances of kindness i have received at the hands of my liberal benefactors and i flatter myself this duty is discharged in that proper candid way that actuates the feelings of all who aim at the good will of the benevolent and can smile with contemptuous disregard at the malignant and unworthy  i have purposely reserved this place to thank one more friend whose exertions in procuring subscribers for this work have been as flattering as beneficial to me i have already mentioned this gentleman for it was owing to him i am honored with that royal notice which so greatly distinguishes the  i hope  propitious hour that if fortune smile must lead me to independance his generosity however did not stop here for through the medium of his application has been procured the name of almost every noble personage in my list  besides a large number of others my only difficulty is how to thank him he will not feel the consciousness of any merit in what he has done  for his gratification has been equal to mine  nevertheless he must not be offended if i assure him with all this philanthropy he cannot be more pleased than i am nor more disinterestedly for when he shall have taken still further pains  which i know he meditates  his kind wishes and unparalleled attention will be a welcomer pleasure than  the advantages arising from them  and now  having paid this tribute of gratitude  nothing further remains than most seriously and solemnly to assure the public  that in the prosecution of this work i have not had an unfair an unworthy nor an unhandsome wish to gratify that if i have spoken in strong language it well became the dictates of truth and so may i prosper  as that cheerful fearless manly monitor prompts me  while i declare that in this moment of parting from every public connection i have not an ungenerous nor unkind wish to any human being in the whole round of existence  thus my dear friend i commit myself to the world and as to my particular good wishes to you when you shall have summed up the finish of every letter and seen what they all amount to i desire it may be considered that i subscribe to the truth of the sum total by assuring you now that i am as ever  most cordially yours c dibdin london may         finis directions to the binder
