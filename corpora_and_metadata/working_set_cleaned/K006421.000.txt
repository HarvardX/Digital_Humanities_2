observations on the bills of mortality in carlisle for the year      the advantages which may be derived from accurate registers of mortality are thus illustrated by an ingenious philosopher and physician the establishment of a judicious and accurate register of the births and burials in every town and parish would be attended with the most important advantages medical political and moral by such an institution the increase or decrease of certain diseases the comparative healthiness of different situations climates and seasons the influence of particular trades and manufactures on longevity with many other curious circumstances not more interesting to physicians than beneficial to mankind would be ascertained with tolerable precision in a political view exact registers of human mortality are of still greater consequence as the number of people and progress of population in the kingdom may in the most easy and unexceptionable manner be deduced from them they are the foundation likewise of all calculations concerning the values of assurances on lives reversionary payments and of every scheme for providing annuities for widows and persons in old age in a moral light also such tables are of evident utility as the increase of vice or virtue may be determined by observing the proportion which the diseases arising from luxury intemperance and other similar causes bear to the rest and in what particular places distempers of this class are found to be most fatal percivals essays vol  d  carlisle is situated in latitude      north and is surrounded by a wall about a mile and a quarter in circumference the situation is rendered exceedingly pleasant by its vicinity to three beautiful rivers with which it is almost surrounded viz the eden on the north east side peterel on the south east and caldew on the north west carlisle contains two parish churches viz st marys and st cuthberts beside two presbyterian and a quakers meeting house a very considerable linen manufactory is carried on in this city and the printing of calicoes is still more extensive the air about carlisle is pure and dry the soil chiefly sand and clay no marshes or stagnant waters corrupt the the atmosphere its neighborhood to a branch of the sea and its due distance from the mountains on all sides render the air temperate and moderate  in july      at the request of the late lord bishop of carlisle the inhabitants were numbered with great care and attention by the rev mr richardson the rev mr simpson and mr alderman hodgson there were at that time in the city and suburbs  0   families and      inhabitants  in january    0 a very careful and accurate survey was made by mr stanger and mr howard under my own inspection when there were in the district before surveyed     houses   0  families and      inhabitants for a more particular account of the survey see tables i ii iii  this astonishing increase of      inhabitants which is above half of the original number in the small space of seventeen years may in some measure be attributed to the establishment of manufactories for the printing of calicoes about the year      mr brummel introduced this kind of manufactory and notwithstanding the many difficulties which naturally attend any new institution by his activity perseverance and abilities he surmounted them all and the art is now brought to great perfection soon after several other gentlemen followed his example there are at present four companies who daily employ about eight hundred industrious poor in this manufactory  this increase of population too has taken place during that very period in which dr price asserts the depopulation of great eritain to have been rapid and progressive and what makes this increase more remarkable carlisle has during the whole period alluded to been constantly supplying the army the navy the metropolis and even the distant regions of india with her hardy active and enterprizing sons  from tables no ii and iv we can with pleasure demonstrate the extreme salubrity of carlisle even in a very unhealthy year a year in which no less than     persons were cut off by two epidemic disorders viz the small pox and scarlet fever by the bills of mortality published in different towns in england as well as the continent it appears on an average that in vienna about   in    and a half of the inhabitants die annually in london   in  0 and three quarters in edinburgh   in  0 and four fifths in leeds   in    and three fifths in dublin   in    in rome   in    in amsterdam   in    in breslaw   in    in berlin   in    and a half in northampton and shrewsbury   in    and a half in liverpool   in    and a half in manchester   in    in chester   in  0 but in the year      when the small pox were very general and fatal   in    and in the parish of sedburgh in the county of york   in    and a half and in blandford forum in dorset   in    in carlisle this year   in  0 and three ninths  tables no iii and v are of the utmost importance to the physician the politician and the calculator of annuities and to every one who has the health and happiness of himself and family at heart they at one view show what diseases are most incident and fatal to particular periods of life they clearly demonstrate as far as one years observation can have weight what periods of life are the most healthy what are the most obnoxions to disease  thus we see in carlisle one in   and nine tenths nearly of all the inhabitants under   years old die annually betwixt   and  0 years old   in    and six sevenths  0     in     and one sixth    0   in     and three fourths  0 0   in     and four fifths  0 0   in     and one sixth  0 0   in    and one third  0 0   in    and four fifths  0 0   in    and one third  0 0   in    and three fifths nearly  0 0   in   and five sixths and between  0 and  00 years exactly   in   as no particular epidemic disease occurred last year which had any considerable effect on the lives of adult persons it is apprehended these calculations for the periods above  0 years old will not be attended with much variation in other years  that women in general live longer than men is almost universally agreed and the following observations tend much to confirm the truth of this opinion during the last year    persons died between  0 and  0 years old   of these were females and between  0 and  00   died both females see table iv in table iii we see two people are above  00 years old and these likewise are semales  table ii which contains the number of husbands wives etc shows how inferior in number widowers are to widows there are above four widows to one widower an astonishing disproportion in what manner is it to be accounted for the following causes are conceived to operate considerably  i men are in general more intemperate than women ii they are exposed to greater hardships and dangers iii widowers perhaps in general have greater opportunities of getting wives than widows have of getting husbands iv widows have a greater propensity to live in towns than widowers v and lastly the constitutions of males as sitted for more violent and laborious exertions are firmer and more robust than those of females their muscular and nervous sibres may therefore be supposed to become stiff rigid and incapable of performing the functions necessary to health and life sooner than those of females both on account of their original texture and the friction which must necessarily occur from laborious exercise but from whatever causes the difference of longevity betwixt males and females may arise the fact itself is sufficiently ascertained by table iv where we find that between the ages of  0 and  0 although there are a greater number of wives than husbands yet    husbands and only four wives have died and of all different ages    husbands and    wives  the table of deaths and diseases no v is as accurate as circumstances and the situation of things would possibly admit with respect to the small pox and searlet fever their symptoms and marks are sufficiently evident to prevent any ambiguity    have died of unknown diseases which is a great number but which must ever be the ease at carlisle where many of the lower class although they may have advice gratis never call in medical assistance  only seventeen have fallen victims to consumptions a number but small when compared with the number which usually die of that disorder in other towns and still smaller when we consider how many are employed in the manufactories of weaving and calicoe printing notwithstanding the impurity of the air breathed by calicoe printers and the sudden changes of heat and cold which they are subject to yet men following that business are observed to be very healthy may not this be owing to the acid steams continually exhaling in a print shop  where they continually breathe air by no means the most pure and where they are subject to sudden alterations of heat and cold   persons have died of this disease between  0 and  0 see table no v which consirms the general observation that during that period of life people are most liable to consumptions it therefore behooves such to be very cautious upon catching cold least by neglect and delay a complaint which at the beginning might have been easily removed should gather strength and at last terminate in a fatal disease  three died of dropsy viz anasarca which in all was evidently occasioned by excessive intemperance nervous and putrid fevers are not very frequent no more than five have suffered by both these diseases which must appear somewhat astonishing to one who knows how many inhabitants there are of the lowest rank who are crowded in close and small apartments where they sleep eat and prepare their victuals whose food can not be the most nutritive who seldom change their clothes and who pay but little attention to cleanliness may not the streams of water which fortunately run near the most crowded parts of the town tend to purify the air and prevent putrid fevers  agues or intermittent fevers are scarce ever known a strong proof that the effluvia arising from marshes is the principle source of that disease  in february a poor girl either for some real or imaginary complaint was advised by an acquaintance as ignorant as herself to take a large quantity of steel filings which had been procured from a white smith or watchmaker not long after she had taken them she was seized with pains in her stomach and bowels which soon increased to a most violent degree every remedy which could be supposed useful either in a severe cholic or inflammation of the stomach was fried but in vain she continued in the greatest agony for two days and then expired  during her sickness she was repeatedly asked if she coud assign any cause for her disorder but she always answered in the negative soon after her death however some steel silings were found in her room and another servant in the house on being examined confessed that the deceased had taken three tea spoonfuls mixed with treacle a few hours before she began to be ill three tea spoonfuls of the filings which were found weighed six drams and a half and upon examining them with a magnet i found a quantity of lead and some copper filings had the steel been pure the quantity alone was sufficient to have produced fatal effects but here no doubt the lead and the copper would add considerably to its acrimony  let the death of this unfortunate young woman be a caution to others and let watchmakers and white smiths be careful to whom they sell steel filings especially till they are separated from every impurity by the loadstone or some other method  during this year two epidemics raged with uncommon violence and swept off a great number of children viz the small pox and a species of the scarlet fever as the scarlatina angiursa or scarlet fever and sore throat is rather an uncommon disease and not perfectly unerstood it will not be improper to take notice of it in this place the limits however of this sheet will by no means admit a thorough discussion of a disease which has within these two years been so general and so fatal to children i shall content myself with defining the scarlet fever and sore throat as it occurred at carlisle afterward attempt to point out its nature the symptoms by which it is to be distinguished from other diseases its terminations and lastly its method of cure this epidemic made its appearance in july was at its acme during september and october and gradually abated till the latter end of december when it almost entirely dissappeared  definition the scarlet fever and sore throat is a contagious inflammatory fever on the second day of the fever the throat becomes stiff and sore attended with some difficulty of swallowing on the third sometimes not till the fourth the face begins to swell and grows florid this swelling and redness soon become so universal as to make the whole body resemble a boiled lobster in color on the seventh or eighth day the swelling and scarlet color gradually abate and the scarf shin becomes rough and peels off in small branny scales  diagnostic symptoms to an inaccurate observer this disease may seem to bear a very near resemblance to many eruptive fevers the intelligent and attentive practitioner will however find no difficulty in discriminating it from all but the cynanche maligna or putrid sore throat which especially at the commencement of the epidemic will be no easy matter the distinction however is extremely necessary as the method of cure is almost diametrically opposite we shall therefore attempt it both diseases are highly contagious both attended with a fever both with an affection of the throat and both with an eruption of the skin yet each disease has its peculiar fever peculiar sore throat and peculiar eruption in the cynanche both for the sake of brevity and perspecuity we shall make use of the generic term the fever is constantly accompanied with a weak quick small and unsteady pulse in the scarlatina the pulse is quick full but seldom hard in the cynanche the throat and fauces are full of creeping ulcers covered with brownish ash colored sloughs in the scarlatina there are seldom any ulcers but often whitish mucous sloughs sometimes extending over the whole tongue and inside of the mouth which may be easily washed off with a little wine and water the eruption in the scarlatina is florid universal smooth seldom prominent and always dry in the cynanche neither so florid nor so universal and in general rough prominent and often moist the cynanche chiefly affects the weak and delicate females more frequently than males whereas robust and plethoric children are more subject to the scarlatina the cynanche is almost constantly accompanied with a fetid breath and an acrid corrosive humor is discharged from the mouth nose and anus which excoriates the skin these disagreeable symptoms rarely occur in the scarlatina in the cynanche the color of the blood is florid its texture loose and tender in the scarlatina it is firm and covered with a buffy coat the cynanche is cured by tonics and antiseptics bleeding purging and emetics are universally hurtful the principal remedies to be depended upon in the cure of the scarlatina are blood letting emetics and the antiphlogistic regimen lastly the cynanche is highly putrid the scarlatina is inflammatory as may be easily deduced from the following circumstances  st the robust and plethoric are more subject to it than the weak and delicate  d there is a manifest swelling redness and inflammation of the skin  d the pulse is full and generally rises after the first bleeding  th the surface of the blood is covered with a firm buffy coat  th in cases where the lancet was not freely used suppurations sometimes occurred in the throat  th and lastly evident advantages were derived from bleeding  terminations the scarlet fever and sore throat sometimes terminates in dropsies deafness tumors and suppurations in the neck  method of cure from the definition already delivered we learn that the scarlet fever and sore throat is a contagious disorder the occasional or immediate cause must therefore necessarily be a peculiar kind of poison of a volatile nature readily mixing with the air and many circumstances render it probable that it is first applied to the mucus membrane which lines the mouth nose fauces stomach etc emetics therefore are indicated as remedies the most likely to expel either the whole or a part of this poisonous matter and if they were used soon after the application of the poison it is probable the disease might in many cases be prevented it is a certain fact they have been employed with great advantage and ought never to be omitted the efficacy of emetics does not however by any means solely depend on their expelling the contagious virus they unload the stomach often gently move the belly and have considerable effect in producing a copious sweat and in removing a spasm of the small vessels on the surface of the body which is a part of the proximate cause of all fevers emetic tartar dissolved in water appears to be the best vomit  of all the remedies made use of in this epidemic none were of more real advantage than bleeding which was sometimes repeated three or four times so great was its efficacy that i believe not one patient died who lost a sufficient quantity of blood early in the disease many cases however occurred where the mildness of the complaint rendered bleeding and almost every other remedy unnecessary  the saline mixture with a small addition of tartar emetic was of signal service it acted as a diuretic sudorific and gentle laxative immersion of the feet and legs in warm water often promoted perspiration and a tendency to sleep a gargle of red wine and water was useful in washing off any mucous sloughs the judicious application of these remedies with plenty of diluents and the antiphlogistic regimen seldom or never failed to produce the most happy effects  nearly about the same time the small pox see table no v began to rage with great violence as the persons affected with this disease were chiefly of the lower class who seldom called in medical assistance it is impossible to ascertain the precise number from the information however which i have had it appears that about  00 were during the last six months of the year seized with the small pox in the natural way of these no less than  0 fell victims to its virulence hence near one in three died of all that were affected with the natural small pox which while at the same time it serves as a melancholy proof of its fatal effects points out the great and salutary advantages which are derived from inoculation during the same period several hundreds were inoculated in the neighborhood of carlisle and it is a pleasing truth that not one of them died had those  00 been inoculated it is more than probable that of the  0 not above   would have died and even these not of inoculation but of other disorders hence we see    persons might have been saved to their parents and the public yet so great is the prejudice against the salutary practice of inoculation amongst the vulgar that few very few can be prevailed upon either by promises rewards or entreaties to submit to the operation no wonder that in rude ignorant and barbarous times superstition hurried men into the grossest absurdities when in a polished and enlightened age in an age too when the experience of full twenty years has clearly demonstrated the utility of inoculation we see the bulk of mankind ready to sacrifice their children and all that is dear to them to a foolish prejudice  table i houses fami males fema total of both sexes englishstreet  0                   total within the walls houses     families   0
