history the author is translated from the greek by mr littlebury atys and adrastus a tale where hermus waters wash the lydian strand the powerful craesus stretched his wide command a warrior king whose willing subjects bowed to sceptred worth superior to the crowd vast was his wealth for conquest swelled his store nor what enriched the prince had left the people poor two sons he had alike in outward mien the tender pledges of a dying queen but speechless one never taught his sire to melt with lisping eloquence by parents felt and mimic art in vain expedients sought to form the tongue and free the imprisoned thought yet blooming atys well that loss supplied atys the peoples hope and monarchs pride his beauteous soul through every feature glowed and from his lips such soft persuasion flowed as nature had withheld the brothers share only to pour a double portion there but vain those graces since concealed from view they droop in shades and wither where they grew for one dread night as over the weary king the drowsy god had stretched his leaden wing he seemed he knew not where in wars engaged and whilst around the doubtful battle raged saw from some hostile hand unerring part a fatal spear that pierced his atys heart he starts he wakes  it is night and silence all yet scarce confirmed he still beholds him fall still bleeds in fancys eye the gaping wound on fancys ear the dying groans resound again he sleeps the same sad scenes return  restless he rolls and waits the lingering morn what can he do or how prevent a doom which heaven foretells and fate has said shall come and yet perhaps the gods these dreams inspire to save the guiltless son and warn the sire too fond of arms i have wandered far astray while youth and blind ambition led the way and ravaged countries may perhaps demand this bleeding sacrifice for wrongs sustained then hear me gods propitious while i swear peace only peace shall be my future care o would your powers but save my darling boy no more this breast shall glow this arm destroy nor ever shall atys the dire sport pursue still in my court and seldom from my view in ease inglorious shall he pass his days untaught to feel the insatiate lust of praise he spoke and cautious far away removed from atys what next atys most he loved the pomp of war no falchions guard the gate and chiefs unarmed around his palace wait nay farther still extends a parents fear even arms themselves he dreads and most the spear nor leaves of ancient wars the weak remains but strips their trophies from the mouldering fanes lest fixed too loosely form the faithless stone the casual steel should drop and pierce his son thus some sweet warbler of the feathered throng deep in the thorny brake secures her young yet vainly anxious feels a fancied woe and starts at every breeze that stirs the bough with silent horror hears the whispering groves and distant murmurs of the spring she loves unhappy sire but vainly we oppose weak human caution when the gods are foes thy storys sequel must too surely prove that dreams prophetic dreams descend from jove nor yet shall atys thwart thy fond designs he moves implicit as his sire inclines on every look his eager duty hung and read his wishes ever they reached his tongue with smiles he strips his helmets plumy pride with smiles he lays his useless spear aside nor lets one sigh confess a latent care reserving all his griefs for his adrastus ear adrastus early did his soul approve brave virtuous learned and formed for atys love a phrygian youth whom fate condemned to roam an exiled wanderer from a cruel home for yet a boy his inadvertent lance an infant brother slew the crime of chance in vain he wept no expiation knew and loaded with a fathers curse withdrew but not in vain the gods such ills dispense if softeyd pity takes her rise from hence if hence we learn to feel anothers pain and from our own misfortunes grow humane this young adrastus found and hence confessed that mild benevolence that warmed his breast hence too his fortune stretched a bolder wing and placed her wanderer near the lydian king there long the favored youth exalted shone dear to the sire but dearer to the son and powerful sympathy their hearts had joined in stronger ties than gratitude can bind with him did atys every sport pursue that health demands and earlier ages knew at morn at eve at sultry noon with him he roved the sunny lawn he swam the stream beside the brook that dimpling glides away caught the cool breeze and lured the finny prey urged the light car along the indented mead or hung impetuous over the loosereind steed beneath whose hoof unhurt the flowrets rise and the light grass scarce trembles as he flies but chief he loved to range the woods among and hear the music of adrastus tongue with graceful ease unlock the lettered store for that he learned from him endeared the knowledge more of thales wisdom often the converse ran how varying natures beauteous frame began and erst to different forms the waters flowed as over the chaos moved the breathing god and how confirmed when some few years had rolled expecting nations did at length behold predicted horrors of a darkened sun and spheres that shone with luster not their own of solon too he spoke and laws designed to guard fair freedom not enslave mankind  and hinted often what mutual duties spring twixt willing subjects and their father king how close connected greatness was with pain what earthly bliss and who the happy man nor less the while his youthful breast he warms with pictured fights the theory of arms lest honors barrier should be quite overthrown and virtue weakened ever she mounts the throne thee homer thee with rapture they peruse expand the soul and take in all the muse mix with thy gods with wars whole ardor burn or melt in silent tears over hectors urn how often transported would young atys cry thus might i fight twere glorious thus to die but why to me are useless precepts given tied down and pinioned by the will of heaven no early wreaths my coward youth must claim no just ambition warm me into fame hid from the world to rust in sloth and buy a poor precarious life with infamy happy thrice happy on each hostile strand the youths that perished by my fathers hand their honor still survives and over their tombs their countrys tears descend and laurel blooms to life alone the victor swords confined  would you indeed distress employ a love too kind as often adrastus studious to control with reasons calm the tumult of the soul would hint to what excess soever wrought paternal fondness was a venial fault perhaps as lenient time stole gently on his fears might soften or be quite oerblown and sunbright honor only be delayed awhile to burst more glorious from the shade yet think he cried whatever they appear few are the causes can excuse a war to raise the oppressed to curb the insulting proud or should your injured country call aloud rush rush to arms it is glorious then to dare delay is cowardice and doubt despair but let not idler views your breast inflame of boundless kingdoms and a dreaded name it is yours at home to stem oppressions waves to guard your subjects not increase your slaves on this just basis fames firm column raise and be desert in arms your second praise twas thus in converse day succeeding day they wore unfelt the tedious hours away till atys twentieth year to bloom began and the boy rose insensibly to man what now shall croesus find what siren voice to make retirement the result of choice no fathers stern command these years allow a chain more pleasing must detain him now in rosy fetters shall the youth be tied and mysias captive fair the chosen bride haste gentle god whose chains unite the globe known by the blazing torch and saffron robe to lydia haste for atys blames your stay nor fair idalias blushes brook delay over glorys blaze your soft enchantments breathe and hide the laurel with the myrtle wreath and now the king with secret transport found his hopes succeed nor fears a martial wound while lost in love the happier atys lies the willing victim of idalias eyes o thoughtless man from hence thy sorrows flow the scheme projected to avert the blow but makes it sure  for see from mysias land round listening atys crowds a suppliant band their tears their cries his easy breast assail fond to redress them ever he hears their tale a mighty boar the curse of angry heaven had from their homes the wretched suffrers driven waste were their viny groves their rising grain their herds their flocks the attendant shepherds slain and scarce themselves survive o would but atys lead the hunter train again their viny groves their waving grain might rise secure their herds their flocks increase and fair idalias country rest in peace the youth assents the exulting crowds retire when thus impatient speaks the trembling sire what means my son preserved alas in vain from hostile squadrons and the tented plain to rush on death  recall your rash design mine be the blame and be the danger mine myself will lead the band the youth returned while his flushed cheek with mild resentment burned will croesus lead the band a hunter now skilled in the fight and laurels on his brow alas such mockeries of war become the loitrer atys fearful of his doom to him at least these triumphs be resigned that not entirely useless to mankind his days may pass these triumphs all his aim these humble triumphs scarce allied to fame and yet dread sir if you command his stay o force of duty atys must obey alas on you whatever blame shall fall a fathers fondness can excuse it all but me of me if still your power withstands what must the lydian what the mysian bands what must idalia think adrastus here soft interposed great king dismiss your fear nor longer atys first request oppose war was your dream no war this region knows for humbler prey the hunters range the wood their spears fly innocent of human blood then fear not them  or had the phantom boar dug deep the wound and drank the vital gore that dreadful vision had excused your care nor atys offered an unheeded prayer i love the prince and but i think his life safe as my own would urge him from the strife permit him sir  this arm shall guard him there and safely may you trust adrastus care for should he fall this arm would surely prove my bosom feels a more than fathers love as when impetuous through the autumnal sky urged by the winds the clouds disparting fly over the broad wave or wide extended mead shifts the quick beam alternate light and shade so glanced the monarchs mind from thought to thought so in his varying face the passions wrought often on his son he turned a doubtful eye afraid to grant nor willing to deny often raised it tearful to the blessed abodes and sought in vain the unregarding gods then looked consent but added with a groan from thee adrastus i expect my son why should i tell impatient for the fight how atys chid the lingering hours of night or how the roseate morn with early ray streaked the glad east and gradual spread the day when forth he issued like the lycian god loose to the breeze his hovering mantle flowed waved the light plume above behind him hung his ratling quiver and his bow unstrung he mounts his steed the steed obeyed the rein arched his high neck and graceful pawd the plain even croesus self forgot a while his fear of future ills and gazed with transport there or why relate when now the train withdrew how fair idalia sighed a soft adieu how croesus followed with his voice and eyes fond to behold but fonder to advise and often repeated as they journeyd on from thee adrastus i expect my son suffice it us they leave the waves that flow over beds of gold and tmolus fragrant brow they pass magnesias plains caicus stream the mysian bound that changed his ancient name and reach olympus verge whose summit nods over phrygian fields nor boasts assembled gods here desolation spread her ghastly reign over trampled vines and dissipated grain and saw with joy revolving seasons smile to swell her pomp and mock the labrers toil led by her baleful steps the youth explore his dark retreats and rouse the foaming boar hard was the strife his horny sides repel untingd the plumy shaft and blunted steel the dogs lie mangled over the bleeding plain and many a steed and many a youth was slain when now his wellaimd bow adrastus drew twangd the stretched string the feathered vengeance flew and rased the monsters neck he roars he flies the crowd pursues the hills resound their cries full in the center of a vale embrownd with arching shades they close the savage round he wheels he glares he meditates his prey resolved to strike resolved to force his way but atys timely stopped his fierce career and through his eyeball sent the whizzing spear and joyful saw him reel with eager speed he bares his shining blade he quits his steed   ah stop rash youth not conquest you pursue death revels there the wretched victim you you rush on fate  in vain  he reached the beast he raised his arm and now had pierced his breast when in that moment from the adverse throng a heavndirected spear adrastus flung glanced over the falling beast the fated wood and fixed in atys breast drank deep the vital flood the struggling prince impatient of the wound writhed on the spear the crowds enclose him round then sunk in death unknowing whence it came yet even in death he called adrastus name where flies adrastus from his dying friend o bear me near poor prince thy life must end not in thy murderers arms he hears thee not like some sad wretch fixed to the fatal spot where fell the bolt of jove nor ear nor eye nor arm to help nor language to reply nor thought itself is his obliged to move as they direct his steed he leaves the grove as they direct to sardis towers again in silence follows the returning train there too we turn for there the pensive sire now hopes now fears and pines with vain desire in every dust before the wind that flies in every distant cloud that stains the skies he sees his son return till often deceived no more his eye the flattering scene believed yet still he wandered and with looks intent the fatal road his darling atys went there to averted heaven he tells his pain and slaughtered hecatombs decrees in vain there to idalia frequent by his side relates his fears or sooths the weeping bride with tales of atys worth and points the place where late he parted from their last embrace and now perchance in tears they lingered there when slowlymoving real crowds appear what means he cried and shot a trembling eye  a youth deputed by the rest drew nigh and in sad accents told the dreadful tale  rage seized the king expiring breathless pale idalia sinks the attendant fair convey with tears and shrieks the beauteous load away where is the wretch  hear hospitable jove  is this is this thy more than fathers love give me my son  why stare thy haggard eyes as fixed in grief here only sorrow lies  and smote his breast thy life in blood began a fated wretch a murderer ever a man o foolish king by my indulgence stole this serpent near me that has stung my soul this thy return for all a king could shower of bounty over thee life and wealth and power  but what are those how great soever they be i gave thee more i gave myself to thee i gave thee atys linked in friendships chain  o fatal gift if thus returned again reach me a sword  and yet dear bleeding clay can his can thousand lives thy loss repay then burst in tears heavens instrument i blame though by his hand from heaven the vengeance came this stroke o solon has convinced my pride o had i never lived or earlier died alas poor wretch why do thou bare thy breast and court my sword though lost himself to rest this cursed of heaven this croesus can forgive the unhappy cause and bids the murderer live ah stop he cried and write the milder fate here with thy sword i only lived for that undone i thought beyond misfortunes power o do not by forgiveness curse me more while yet he pleaded to the mourning crowd forth rushed idalia by her maids pursued eager she seemed with light suspicions filled and on her face heartpiercing madness smiled where is my wandering love ye lydians say does he indeed along meander stray and rove the asian plain  i will seek him there  ye lydian damsels of your hearts beware fair is my love as to the sunny beam the lightspread plumage on caysters stream his locks are hermus gold his cheeks outshine the ivory tinctured by your art divine  i see him now in tmolus shade he lies on saffron beds soft sleep has sealed his eyes his breath adds sweetness to the gale that blows  tread light ye nymphs i will steal on his repose  alas he bleeds o murder atys bleeds and over his face a dying paleness spreads help help adrastus  can you leave him now in death neglect him once it was not so what and not weep a tear at least is due unkind adrastus he would have wept for you come then my maids our tears shall wash the gore we too will die since atys is no more but first well strew with flowers the hallowed ground where lies my love and plant the cypress round nor let adrastus know for should he come new streams of blood would issue from the tomb the flowers would wither at his baleful tread and at his touch the sickening cypress fade come come  nay do not tear me from his side cruel adrastus am i not his bride i must  i will  me would you murder too at this unable to sustain his woe my soul can bear no more adrastus cries his eyes on heaven ye powers that rule the skies if your august unerring wills decreed that states and kings and families must bleed why was i singld to perform the part unsteeld my soul unpetrified my heart what had i done a child an embrio man ever passions could unfold or thought began yet then condemned an infant wretch i fled blood on my hands and curses on my head o had i perished so  but fortune smiled to make her frowns more dire  this vagrant child became the friend of kings to curse them all and with new horrors dignify his fall then eager snatched his sword for murders past what have i not endured  be this my last and pierced his breast this fated arm shall pour your streams of wrath and hurl your bolts no more for pangs sustained oblivions all i crave o let my soul forget them in the grave alas forgive the wretch your judgments doom dark are your ways i wander in the gloom nor should perhaps complain  be grief my share but if your heaven has mercy pour it there on yon heartbroken king on yon distracted fair he spoke and drew the steel the weeping train support him to the bier he grasps the slain there feels the last sad joy his soul desires and on his atys muchloved breast expires o happy both if ought my muse could shed of tears eternal that embalm the dead while round britannias coast old ocean raves and to her standard roll the embattled waves fair empress of the deep so long your names should live lamented by her brightest dames who often at evening should with tears relate the murdered friend and poor idalias fate and often enquiring from their lovers hear how croesus mourned a twice revolving year then roused at cyrus name and glorys charms shook off enervate grief and shone again in arms finis lately published by the
