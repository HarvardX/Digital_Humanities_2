edward and eleonora a tragedy as it was to have been acted at the theater royal in covent garden  by mr thomson  suspicione si quis errabit sua et rapiet ad se quod erit commune omnium stulte nudabit animi conscientiam phaedrus london printed for the author and sold by a millar over against st clements church in the strand mdccxxxix  to her royal highness the princess of wales madam if i take the liberty once more to crave the protection of your royal highness for another tragedy of my writing it is because i am led almost unavoidably to it by my subject in the character of eleonora i have endeavored to represent however faintly a princess distinguished for all the virtues that render greatness amiable i have aimed particularly to do justice to her inviolable affection and generous tenderness for a prince who was the darling of a great and free people  their descendants even now will own with pleasure how properly this address is made to your royal highness i am with the profoundest respect  madam your royal highnesss most humble and most devoted servant james thomson  prologue by a friend in former times when fierce religious rage and priestly sway deformed each suffering age all manly wit all useful learning lay in darkness lost nor hoped returning day religion then was stained by cruel deeds and freeborn reason stooped to craft and creeds but happier we  and though tonight we show what fatal ills from blind devotion flow it is not that we such rage renewed can fear or dread the hand of persecution here  our scene would wide humanity impart would breathe extensive candor through the heart show true religion even to error kind and claim the perfect freedom of the mind if too the poet paints a noble strife twixt the fond husband and the generous wife if all the father in his voice complains and all the mother in her tender strains if these best passions prompt the pleasing woe indulge it freely  nature bids it flow where parent nature leads you cannot stray and what she wills it is virtue to obey fond of britannias fame and just to you he bids old english honor live anew and calls your great first edward up to view but if his line too weak his stroke too faint the graceful figure in full light to paint in candid part his honest meaning take and spare the poet for the heros sake epilogue by a friend these poets are such fools  the man behind who wrote this play  a simple soul i find  believes with all his heart there was a wife who needs would die  to save a husbands life he in the printed chronicles has read it and true it is  sir richard baker said it why what an ass these books do make a man read nature  then believe it  you who can look round this town  the question is not  whether spouse dies for spouse but who will live together of old they say a husband was a lover but thank our stars these foolish days are over to such substantial prudence are we come we wed not heart to heart  but plumb to plumb what sense what beauty are not now the things but can he settle  up to what she brings yet in this easy allforgiving age bear with such moral fooleries  on the stage perhaps too there may be some gentle soul who rather likes to weep  than win a vole who thinks that there are charms in generous love and would to edward eleonora prove advertisement the representation of this tragedy on the stage was prohibited

tragedy act i scene i prince edward theald archdeacon of liege earl of gloucester edward i will no longer doubt it is plain my friends that with our little band of english troops by all allies all western powers deserted all but the noble knights that guard this land the flower of europe and of christian valor naught can be done naught worthy of our cause worthy of englands heir and of the name of lionhearted richard whose renown after almost a century elapsed shakes through its wide extent this eastern world what else could bend the saracen to peace who might with better policy refuse to grant it us yes to the prince of jaffa i will accord the peace he has demanded and though my troops impatient wait the signal to storm yon walls yet will i not expose in vain attempts valor that should be saved for better days and for the public welfare rash fruitless war from wanton glory waged is only splendid murder  what says theald approves my reverend father of my purpose  theald edward illustrious heir of englands crown i must indeed be blinded with the zeal of this our holy cause to think your arms thus allforsaken thus betrayed sufficient to reach the grandeur of your first design and from the yoke of infidels to free the sacred city object of our vows yet this methinks this jaffa might be seized that still were something an auspicious omen of future conquest  but unskilled in war to you my lord and glosters wise experience i this submit  edward speak gloucester your advice before i fix my latest resolution  gloucester you know my lord i never was a friend to this crusado my unchanged advice is strenuous then for peace nor this alone from your deserted circumstance i urge but from the state of our unhappy country behold her edward with a filial eye and say is this a time for these adventures behold her still with deep commotion shook beneath a false delusive face of quiet behold her bleeding still from civil war exhausted sunk drained by ten thousand arts of ministerial rapine endless taxes illmanagd expeditions strangers legates italian leeches and insatiate rome that never raged before with such gross insult with such abandoned avarice besides who knows what evil counselors again are gathered round the throne in times like these disturbed and lowering with unsettled freedom one step to lawless power one old attempt renewed the least infringement of our charters would hurl the giddy nation into tempest return my prince you have already saved your father from his foes from haughty leister now save him from his ministers from those who hold him captive in the worst of chains   edward you gloucester saved us both  gloucester i did my duty even while i joined with leister did my duty  i hope i did  he who contends for freedom can never be justly deemed his sovereigns foe no it is the wretch that tempts him to subvert it the soothing slave the traitor in the bosom who best deserves that name he is the worm that eats out all the happiness of kingdoms edward return lose not a day an hour before this city though your cause be holy believe me it is a much more pious office to save your fathers old and broken years his mild and easy temper from the snares of low corrupt insinuating traitors a nobler office far on the firm base of wellproportiond liberty to build the common quiet happiness and glory of king and people englands rising grandeur to you my prince this task of right belongs has not the royal heir a juster claim to share his fathers inmost heart and counsels than aliens to his interest those who make a property a market of his honor one reason more allow me to suggest for peace immediate peace  should blind misfortune in this fardistant hostile land oppress us a chance to which our weakness stands exposed what edward of thy princess would become thy eleonora she whose tender love through stormy seas and in fierce camps attends thee what of thy blooming offspring charged with these to give our courage scope were cruel rashness  edward enough my lord i stand resolved on peace and will to england strait  but where alas where shall we cover our inglorious heads when gay with hope the people round us press to hear by what exploits we have sustained the fame of richard and of english valor shall i my generous country i be ranked with those weak princes who consume thy wealth and sink thy name in idle expeditions  perfidious france be this the ruling point of my whole life the passion of my soul to humble thee proud nation  meantime gloucester see that the captive princess be restored daraxa to the sultan of this city whose bride she is  we wage not war with women  scene ii edward theald gloucester an officer belonging to the prince officer one from the prince of jaffa sir demands your secret ear on some important message  edward conduct him to my tent  officer goes out he brings i judge the sultans last instructions for this peace here wait i may your faithful counsel want  scene iii theald gloucester theald whatever woes of late have clouded england yet must i gloucester call that nation happy on whose horizon smiles a dawning prince of edwards worth and virtues  gloucester true my friend edward has great has amiable virtues that virtue chiefly which befits a prince he loves the people he must one day rule with fondness loves them with a noble pride esteems their good esteems their glory his one instance it becomes me to recount that shows the genuine greatness of his soul though i have met him in the bloody field he fighting for his father i for freedom yet bears his bosom no remaining grudge of those distracted times to me his heart is greatly reconciled  virtue beyond the little unforgiving soul of tyrants now will i tell thee theald whence i stoop to wear the gaudy chains of courtattendance at these gray years that should in calm retirement pass the soft evening of a bustling life and plume my parting soul for better worlds amidst his many virtues youthful edward is lofty warm and absolute of temper i therefore seek to moderate his heat to guide his fiery virtues that misled by dazzling power and flattering sycophants might finish what his fathers weaker measures have tried in vain and hence i here attend him in expeditions which i never approved in holy wars  your pardon reverend father  i must declare i think such wars the fruit of idle courage or mistaken zeal sometimes of rapine and religious rage to every mischief prompt  theald you wrong my lord you wrong them much to set this matter only upon a civil footing say what right had robbers rushing from arabian deserts fierce as the suns that kindled up their rage thus in a barbarous torrent to bear down all asia africa and profane their altars and to repel brute force by force is just nay does not even our duty interest glory the common honor of the christian name require us to repress their wild ambition that labors westward still and threatens europe  gloucester yes when they burst their limits let us check them and with a firmer hand than those loose christians the most corrupt and abject of mankind slaves doubly slaves who suffered these arabians in virtue their superiors as in valor to measure conquest with a travellers speed by rage and zeal it is true their empire rose but now some settled ages of possession create a right than which i fear few nations can show a better sure i am it is madness inhuman madness thus from half the world to drain our blood and treasure to neglect each art of peace to set mankind adrift and all for what by spreading desolation rapine and slaughter over the other half to gain a conquest we can never hold i venerate this land its sacred hills its vales its cities trod by saints and prophets by god himself the scenes of heavenly wonders inspire me with a certain awful joy but the same god my friend pervades sustains surrounds and fills this universal frame and every land where spreads his vital presence his allenlivening breath to me is holy excuse me theald if i go too far i meant alone to say i think these wars a kind of persecution and when that that most absurd and cruel of all vices is once begun where shall it find an end each in his turn or has or claims a right to wield its dagger to return its furies and first or last they fall upon our selves  edward behind the scenes inhuman villain is thy message murder  theald ha heard you not the prince exclaiming murder  gloucester should this barbarian messenger  moving toward the noise it is so  scene iv theald gloucester to them prince edward wounded in the arm and dragging in the assassin edward detested wretch and does the prince of jaffa send base assassins to transact his treaties there  take thy answer ruffian stabs him with the dagger he had wrested from him blow too hasty i should have saved thee for a fitter death  assassin i would have triumphed christian in thy worst for know thou vile destroyer of the faithful

short pause why stare you pale amazement on each other are we not men to whom the various chance of life is known  gloucester ha poison did he say then is at once my prince and country lost o fatal wound to england  theald quick my lord retire and have it dressed without delay ere the fell poison can diffuse its rage and deeply taint your blood  edward the princess comes o save me from her

alas you bleed  edward it is naught my lovely princess  a slight wound   eleonora but ah methought i entering heard of poison tainting the blood  what was the dagger poisoned  ha ssilent all will none relieve my fears   gloucester madam restrain your tenderness a moment  the prince delays too long  let him retire meanwhile the troubled camp shall be my care lest the base foe should make a sudden sally while yet our troops are stunned with this disaster  edward i thank thee noble gloucester nor alone support my troops go rouse them to revenge tell them their injured prince will try their love their valor soon  and you my friend good theald attend the princess  cheer thee eleonora i cannot will not leave thee long to vex thy tender soul with aggravated fears  theald behold daraxa the false sultans bride  scene vi eleonora theald daraxa daraxa princess of england let me share thy grief whence flow these tears and what this wild alarm this noise of murder and assassination  eleonora alas the prince is wounded by a ruffian and with a poisoned dagger as i fear yet none will ease me of this racking thought  nay tell me theald since to know the  is often a kind of miserable comfort what has befaln the prince for this slight wound could never thus overcast the brave with terror  theald i dare not princess dally with your fate an impious villain from the sultan selim pretended to the prince a secret message about the peace in treaty dreading naught he left us here and to his tent retired there to receive this execrable envoy strait with the prince alone the fierce assassin attempted on his life but in his arm he took it seems the blow and from the villain wresting the dagger plunged it to his heart this last we saw and heard the inhuman bigot who deemed himself a martyr in their cause boast as he died the princes wound was poisoned   eleonora then all i feared is true then am i wretched beyond even hope  daraxa a villain from the sultan   eleonora ah the distracting thought and is my life my love my edward on the brink of fate of fate that may this moment snatch him from me  daraxa what selim send assassins and beneath a name so sacred selim whose renown is incense breathing over the sweetened east for each humane each generous virtue famed selim the rock of faith and sun of honor  eleonora o complicated woe the christian cause has now no more a patron and restorer england no more a prince in whom she placed her glory her delight her only hope these desolated troops no more a chief no more a husband a protector i a friend a lover and my helpless children no more a father  daraxa pardon gentle princess if in this whirlwind of revolving passions that snatch my soul by turns i have forgot to pay the tribute which i owe thy sorrows  but i my self alas am more unhappy  eleonora what woes can equal mine who lose thus vilely the best the bravest loveliest of mankind   daraxa you lose the lover i must learn to hate him to scorn what once wasall my pride and transport should edward die by this accursed crime which heaven forbid he dies admired beloved in the full bloom of fame and spotless honor to you the daughter of illustrious grief your tears remain and sadlysweet reflection you with his image with his virtues still amidst the pensive gloom may converse hold while i  ah nothing meets my blasted sight but a black view of infamy and horror what is the loss of life to loss of virtue  and yet how can this heavenly spark be lost no virtue burns with an immortal flame he is belied  some villain has abused him  theald i honor madam this your virtuous grief but that the sultan did employ thassassin is past all doubt  behold the false instructions by which he gained admittance giving her the letter the prince had dropped daraxa ha  it is so his hand his seal  from my detesting heart i tear him thus for ever  perish selim perish the feeble wretch who more bewails him that were to share his guilt  unhappy princess now let me turn my soul to thy assistance  there is a cure it is true   eleonora a cure daraxa o say what cure  daraxa no it avails not madam none can be found to risque it  eleonora none to risque it quick tell me what it is my dear daraxa  daraxa to find some person that with friendly lip may draw the poison forth at least its rage and mortal spirit this will bring the wound within the power of art but certain death attends the generous deed  eleonora kneeling then hear me heaven prime source of love ye saints and angels hear me i here devote me for the best of men of princes and of husbands on this cross i seal the cordial vow confirm it heaven and grant me courage in the hour of trial  theald o tenderness unequaled  daraxa glorious princess  eleonora go theald quickly find the earl of gloucester and with him break this matter to the prince as for the person leave that task to me i with daraxa will your call attend o all ye powers of love your influence lend  end of the first act act ii scene i gloucester theald gloucester no theald no he never will consent  i know him well  he never will purchase life at such a rate besides in aid of love his generous pride would come and deem it baseness  theald then is yon sun his last the blackning wound begins already to confess the poison  meantime my lord both friendship and our duty demand at least the trial well i know that poise his life with hers he would as nothing esteem his own but sure the life of thousands the mingled cause at once of heaven and earth should over the best the dearest life prevail  gloucester alas my friend you reason edward loves how weak the head contending with the heart yet be the trial made  behold he comes  scene ii edward gloucester theald edward entering o thou bright sun now hastening to those climes that parentisle which i no more shall see and for whose welfare often my youthful heart has vainly formed so many a fond design o thither bear resplendent orb of day to that dear spot of earth my last farewell and thee eternal providence whose course amidst the various maze of life is fixed by boundless wisdom and by boundless love i follow thee with resignation hope with confidence and joy for thou art good and of thy rising goodness is no end well met my dearest friends  it was too true the villains threatening and i nearly touch that awful hour which every man must prove yet every man still shifts at distance from him come then and let us fill the space between these last important moments whence we take our latest tincture for eternity with solemn converse and exalting friendship  nay  theald  gloucester  wound me not with tears with tears that fall over venerable cheeks what could the princess more  ah there indeed at every thought of her i feel a weight a dreadful weight of tenderness that shakes my firmest resolution  where is she  theald she burns with fond impatience to attend you  edward and how brave gloucester did you leave the camp  gloucester the camp sir is secure each soldier there from indignation draws new force and spirit o it is a glorious an affecting sight those furrowed cheeks that never knew before the dew of tears now in a copious shower are bathed around your tent they various crowd rank over rank some pressing for a look some sadly musing with dejected eye some on their knees preserring vows to heaven and with extended arm some breathing vengeance  base saracens they cry perfidious cowards  but blood shall wash out blood  ah poor atonement  did the whole bleeding city fall a victim  edward what unbought love and generous valor fire the freeborn heart  yet moderate their zeal and let the sword of justice only strike the faithless selim and his guilty creatures my newdeparted spirit just escaped from the low fevrish passions of this life would grieve to see the blood of innocence with that of guilt confounded stain my tomb  theald permit me sir the hope that you your self  i speak it on just cause  may live to punish this breach of all the sacred rights of men  edward why will you turn my thoughts from earth enlarged to soft enfeebling views of life again  theald not to a vain desire of life my lord i would re them but inspire each hope advise each possibility to save it and there is yet a remedy  edward delusion  theald the fair arabian princess mentioned one  edward she one  daraxa  something to complete her lovers crime  theald you could not wrong her thus had you beheld the tempest of her soul her grief her rage confusion when she heard of selims baseness had you seen that honor that glorious fire that parted from her eyes till in a flood of virtuous sorrow sunk she almost equaled eleonoras tears  edward what was it she proposed  theald it was my lord to find some person who with friendly lip might draw the deadly spirit   edward i have heard of such a cure but is it not good theald an action fatal to the kind performer  theald yes surely fatal  edward name it then no more i should despise the paltry life it purchased besides what mortal can dispose so rashly of his own life talk not of low condition and of my public rank when life or death becomes the question all distinctions vanish then the first monarch and the lowest slave on the same level stand in this the sons of equal nature all  theald allow me sir if it is a certain an established duty than duty more the height of human virtue to sacrifice a transitory life for that kind source from whence it is derived and all its guarded joys our dearest country to sacrifice it in the cause of heaven author of every good by the same reason it may be justly sacrificed for those on whom depends the welfare of the public and there is one my lord who stands devoted by solemn and irrevocable vows to die for you  edward to die for me  kind nature thanks to thy forming hand i can myself cheerful sustain to pay this debt i owe thee without the borrowed sufferings of another no theald urge this argument no more i love not life to that degree to purchase by the sure death of some brave guiltless friend a few uncertain days that often rise like this serene and gay when with swift wing a moment wraps them in disastrous fate  gloucester did we consult to save your single life was that the present question thy refusal were just were generous but my lord this person who stands for you devoted should in that be deemed devoted for the christian cause the common cause of europe and thy country for that this martyr dies dies for thy children dies for the brave companions of thy fortune who weeping now around thy tent conjure thee to live for them and englands promised glory o i must give it way my heart is full of thee my country and my aged veins at thought of thee resume the fire of youth  if honor glory can exalt the mind above the common passions that involve the grovelling race of men if the first beauty if virtue dressed in her divinest charms all natures mingled tenderness the parent the brother lover friend can touch the heart o save our country edward save a nation the chosen land the last retreat of freedom amidst a broken world  cast back thy view and trace from farthest times her old renown think of the blood that to maintain her rights and nurse her sheltering laws has flowed in battle or on the patriots scaffod think what cares what vigilance what toils what bright contention in councils camps and welldisputed senates it cost our generous ancestors to raise a matchless plan of freedom whence we shine even in the jealous eye of hostile nations the happiest of mankind  then see all this this virtue wisdom toil and blood of ages behold it ready to be lost for ever behold us almost broken to the yoke robbed of our ancient spirit sunk in baseness at home corrupted and despised abroad behold our wealth consumed those treasures squandered that might protect and nourish wholesome peace or urge a glorious war on wretches squandered a venal crew that plunder and disgrace us in this important this decisive hour on thee and thee alone our weeping country turns her distressful eye to thee she calls and with a helpless parents piercing voice will thou not live for her for her subdue a graceful pride i own but still a pride that more becomes thy courage and thy youth than birth and public station nay for her say would thou not resign the dearest passions  edward o there is nothing which for thee my country i in my proper person could not suffer but thus to sculk behind anothers life it is what i scarce have courage to support it makes a kind of coward of me gloucester and yet the reasons urged i must acknowledge demand a deep regard  well  be it so  ere to this instance of amazing friendship i can submit let me behold the friend perhaps my bounty may requite his love to those he holds much dearer than himself conduct him hither theald  scene iii edward gloucester edward ah my gloucester you have not touched on something that here pleads for longer life beyond the force of reason perhaps too powerful pleads  my eleonora to thee my friend i will not be ashamed even to avow my love in all its fondness for oh there shines in this my dearer self this partner of my soul such a mild light of careless charms of unaffected beauty such more than beauty such endearing goodness that when i meet her eye where cordial faith and every gentle virtue mix their luster i feel a transport that partakes of anguish how shall i then behold her on the point to leave her gloucester in a distant land for ever in a stormy world to leave her there is no misery to be feared like that which from our greatest happiness proceeds  scene iv edward gloucester theald presenting the princess eleonora as the person he went to bring daraxa edward great god  what do i see  i am betrayed  turning away eleonora edward  edward o it is too much o spare me nature  eleonora not look upon me edward  edward eleonora how on this dreadful errand can thou come  eleonora behold me kneel   edward why kneel thou best of women thou never offended never in thought offended thou art all truth and love and angelgoodness why do thou kneel o rise my eleonora  eleonora let me fulfill my vow  edward o barbarous vow  eleonora let me preserve a life in which is wrapped the life of thousands dearer than my own live thou and let me die for thee my edward  edward for me  thy words are daggers to my soul and would thou have me then thus meanly save a despicable life a life exposed to that worst torment to my own contempt a life still haunted by the cruel image of thy last pangs thy agonizing throws the dire convulsions of these tender limbs and all for one  o infamy  for one by love by duty bound each manly tie even by a peasants honor to protect thee  eleonora this never can blemish thee i know full well there is no danger pain no form of death thou would not meet with transport to protect me but i alas an unimportant woman whose only boast and merit is to love thee ah what am i with nameless numbers weighed with myriads yet unborn all ranks all ages all arts all virtues all a state comprizes these have a higher claim to thy protection live then for them  o make a great effort what none but heroes can bid the soft passions the private stoop to those that grasp a public live to possess the pleasure of a god to bless a people trusted to thy care live to fulfill thy long career of glory but just begun to die for thee be mine i never can find a brighter gentler fate and fate will come at last inglorious fate o grudge me not a portion of thy fame as mixed in love o raise me to thy glory  edward in vain is all thy eloquence the more thou would persuade i with increasing horror fly from thy purpose  eleonora do thou love me edward  edward oh  if i love thee  witness heaven and earth angels of death that hover round me witness witness these blinded eyes these trembling arms this heart that beats unutterable fondness to what delightful agony i love thee  eleonora then will thou save me sure from greater pain  edward o that i could from all engross thy sufferings pain felt for thee were pleasure  eleonora hear me edward i speak the strictest truth no flight of passion i speak my naked heart  to die i own is a dread passage terrible to nature chiefly to those who have like me been happy  but to survive thee  o it is greatly worse it is a continual death i cannot bear the very thought  o leave me not behind thee  edward since naught can alter my determined breast why do thou pierce me with this killing image  eleonora ah selfish that thou art with thee the toil the tedious toil of life will soon be over thou soon wilt hide thee in the quiet grave while i a lonely widow with her orphans am left defenseless to a troubled world a false ungrateful and injurious world  oh if thou love me edward i conjure thee by that celestial flame which blends our souls by all a father all a mother feels by every holy tenderness i charge thee live to protect the pledges of our love our children   edward oh   eleonora our young our helpless   edward oh  distraction  let me go  eleonora nay drag me with thee  to the kind tomb  thou can not leave our children exposed by being thine beyond the lowest surrounded with the perils of a throne   edward cruel no more embitter thus our last our parting moments set no more the terrors of these best passions in array against me for by that power i swear father of life whose universal love embraces all that breathes this ample air whose perfect wisdom brings light from darkness and from evil good to whom i recommend thee and my children by him i swear i never will submit to what thy horrid tenderness proposes  gloucester my lord   edward oh  these emotions are too much  i feel a heavy languor steal upon me death or his image sleep weighs down my soul  conduct me to my couch  ah eleonora if we never meet again  this one embrace  absolute nature thou must be obeyed  eleonora i will not cannot quit thee   scenev eleonora daraxa daraxa princess stay resistless sleep now rushes on his powers for so the various poison often begins to spread its dark malignity   eleonora ha  sleep  then is the time  thanks to inspiring heaven but come and ere the poison sink too deep swift let me seize the favoring hour of sleep  end of the second act act iii scene i gloucester o miracle of love o wondrous princess it is such as thou who keep the gentle flame that animates society alive who make the dwellings of mankind delightful what is vain life an idle flight of days a stilldelusive round of sickly joys a scene of little cares and trifling passions if not enobled by such deeds of virtue and yet this matchless virtue what avails it the afflicting angel has forsook the prince and now pours out his terrors on the princess forsook him said i  no he must awake to keener evils than the body knows which minds alone and generous minds can feel o virtue virtue as thy joys excel so are thy woes transcendent the gross world knows not the bliss or misery of either  the prince forsakes his couch  he seems renewed in health  ah short deceitful gleam of ease  scene ii edward gloster edward advancing from his couch hail to the fresher earth and brighter day i feel me lightened of the mortal load that lay upon my spirits this kind sleep has shed a balmy quiet through my veins whence this amazing change  but be my first chief care author of good to bend my soul in gratitude to thee thou when blind mortals wander through the deeps of comfortless despair with timely hand invisible and by unthoughtof ways thou leadst them forth into thy light again  gloucester how fares my lord the prince  edward to health restored only a kind of lassitude remains a not unpleasing weakness hangs upon me like the soft trembling of the settled deep after a storm  gloucester father of health be praised  edward the moment that i sunk upon my couch a sick and troubled slumber fell upon me chaos of gloomy unconnected thought that in black eddy whirled made sleep more dreadful than the worst waking pang while thus i tossed ready to bid farewell to suffering clay methought an angel came and touched my wound at this the parting gloom cleared up apace my slumbers softened and with health returned serenity of mind and ordered thought and fair ideas gladening all the soul aerial music too by fancy heard soothed my late pangs and harmonizd my breast through shades of bliss i walked where heavenly forms sung to their lutes my eleonoras love  but where is she the glory of her sex o dearer justly dearer far than ever quick let me find her pour into her bosom my fullfull soul with tenderness oerchargd with glad surprise with gratitude and wonder  ha why this silence this dejected look you cast a drooping eye upon the ground where is the princess  gloucester she my lord reposes  edward reposes  no  it is not likely gloucester that she would yield her weeping eyes to sleep while i lay there in agonies  away i am too feeble then to know the truth say is she well  gloucester now show thy courage edward   edward o all my fears i shall start out to madnss what  while i slept  gloucester yes   edward misery distraction my peace my honor is betrayed for ever o love o shame o murdered eleonora  scene iii gloucester unhappy prince go find thy eleonora and in hearteasing grief exhale thy passion all other comfort now were to talk down the winds and raging seas  but yonder comes the arabian princess from her tears i learn the moving scene within  scene iv gloucester daraxa a messenger from selim attending at some distance daraxa oh it is too much i can no more support it  gloucester generous mourner how is it with the princess eleonora  daraxa struck by the poison on her couch she lies a rose softdrooping in sabean vales beneath the fiery dogstars noxious rage o christian chief i never shall forget the scene these melting eyes have just beheld with mingled tears of tenderness and wonder  gloucester how was it madam  daraxa when this pride of woman this best of wives which in his radiant course the sun beholds when first she sickening felt the imperious summons of approaching fate all robbed in spotless white she sought her altars and prostrate there for her departing soul the prince her husband and her orphanchildren implored the eternal mind  as yet she held her swelling tears and in her bosom kept her sighs repressed nor did the near approach of the pale king of terrors dim her beauty no rather adding to her charms it breathed a certain mournful sweetness through her features but as the increasing bane more desperate grew wild to her bed she rushed and then indeed the lovely fountains of her eyes were opened then flowed her tears  connubial bed she cried  chaste witness of my tenderness for him  to save whose life i unrepining die  in bloom of youth farewell  thou shall perhaps  receive a fairer a more happy bride  but never a more faithful never one  who loves her husband with a fonder passion here flowed her tears afresh with burning lip she pressed the humid couch and wept again at last while weary sorrow paused she rose and fearing lest immediate death might seize her demanded to be led to see the prince but fear of chasing from his eyes too soon the salutary sleep that healed his pangs restrained her trembling footsteps on her couch abandoned to despair she sunk anew and for her children called her children came a while supported on her arm she eyed them with tears pursuing tears adown her cheek with all the speechless misery of woe  i see her still  o god  the powerful image dissolves me into tears  gloucester madam proceed such tears are virtue and excel the joys of wanton pride  daraxa then starting up she went to snatch them to a mothers last embrace when strait reflecting that the piercing poison might taint their tender years she sudden shrunk with horror back  o wretched eleonora  she weeping cried and must i then not taste  the poor remaining comfort of the dying  to see a husband clasp my dearest children  and mix my parting soul with theirs i love her sad attendants that till then had mourned in silent sorrow all at this gave way to loud laments  she raised her languid eye and casting on them round a gracious smile to each by name she called

dervise theald with me what would thou dervise  selim the princess eleonora lives she still  theald she lives and that is all  selim allah be praised then lives the honor of the brightning name of saracen and mussulman  theald how dervise what can wipe out the horror of this deed  selim a holy mans humanity shall cancel the savage fury of an impious bigot but christian imam lead me to the princess for know a dervise who amid the rocks of cedarshaking lebanon beheld twelve hundred moons complete their pale career and who by fasting meditation prayer and silent converse with instructive nature had from his inward eye and peaceful heart purged off the mist and turbulence of passion this venerable dervise not confined to the still transports of unactive virtue felt a warm zeal to serve his fellow creatures and to his pious search the grace was given of finding out a remedy for poison nor can it come too late while wandering life yet with faint impulse stirs along the veins  theald ha dervise art thou sure of what thou say  selim yes he himself consigned it to my care the powerful juice of plants for which he scaled the tufted cliff and over the torrent hung the balm of mountainherbs where the gross soil but little mixes tempered sun and dew and not to those of his own faith alone he this from narrow charity bequeathed no as it was the gift of bounteous nature he bade it freely go to all her sons come lead me to the princess though she lay even in the last extremity though called by the fierce angel who compels the dead yet bold experience gives me room to hope often have i seen its vital touch diffuse new vigor through the poisoned streams of life when almost settled into dead stagnation swift as a southern gale unbinds the flood say will thou trust me with the trial christian  theald thou know we have great reason for distrust but fear in those who can no longer hope were idle and absurd  selim bright heaven what fear is there a slave of such inhuman baseness nursed on the sickening bosom of this earth to add fresh outrage to a dying princess for virtue dying look into my eye does one weak ray there shun thy keenest gaze say do thou there behold so foul a bottom  theald no seeming truth and generous candor shine in what thou say come follow me good dervise  selim a moment yet  should heaven accord success i have besides the life of

demands thy presence reverend christian  theald dervise come forbid it heaven this aid should be too late  scene v daraxa ha  let me think  i surely know this dervise  o my astonished fancy  can it be  but in his looks methought i marked the sultan and as he shot athwart me from his eye flashed the proud lightning of affronted virtue he must be innocent his being here is radiant proof he must  o weak daraxa what man of virtue more would deign to lodge his image in thy breast ah what avails the light unfounded love the treacherous friendship that with inhuman cowardice gives up a worthy man to infamy and slander they talked of aid  what aid a cry heard within alas it is past for death was in that cry  and now her soul exulting quits the coil of this dim world severe misfortune  if there was a cure that it should come too late  scene vi daraxa an officer officer madam the prince roused by that deathful cry from the cold earth where in his tent he lay to grief abandoned and told by an attendant of the princess that she this fatal moment breathed her laft now rushes hither to indulge his sorrows  daraxa unhappy prince i venerate his tears and will retire  but whither rage confusion despair and desolation frown around me  i must find out this dervise must discover if he indeed be selim  edward comes  scene vii edward she is no more the soul of every grace of every virtue

thy perfections  would i could think no more  what shall i do where go what say  that tent ah me that tent i dare not enter there there death displays his utmost terrors  pale and lifeless there she lies whose looks were love whose beauty smiled the sweet effulgence of endearing virtue  and here i last beheld her  ay and how and how beheld her  the remorseless image will hunt me to the grave  i see her suffering with female softness yet to pain superior fearful and bold at once with the strong hand of mighty love constraining feeble nature to steal me from affliction  in the camp can i appear a chief among his soldiers a chief who stoops to hold dishonored life life purchased by the death of one for whom the brave in every age have joyd to die  and england  o i cannot bear the thought of ever returning to that country more that country witness of our happy days where at each step remembered bliss will sting my soul to anguish i already hear malice exclaim nay blushing valor sigh where is thy princess where the wish of thousands the charm the transport of the public eye base prince and art thou not ashamed to bring no trophy home but eleonoras corse  the grave too is shut up that last retreat of wretched mortals  yes my word is passed to eleonora passed our orphanchildren bind me to life  o dear o dangerous passions the valiant by himself what can he suffer or what does he regard his single woes but when alas he multiplies himself to dearer selves to the loved tender fair to those whose bliss whose beings hang upon him to helpless children then o then he feels the point of misery festring in his heart and weakly weeps his fortune like a coward such such am i undone   scene viii edward gloucester edward my lord of gloucester i thought my orders were to be alone  gloucester forgive my fond intrusion  but i cannot be so regardless of thy welfare edward as to obey these orders  edward but they shall shall be obeyed  i will enjoy my sorrows all that is left me now  gloucester the more thy grief just in its cause but frantic in degree seeks aggravating solitude the more it suits my love and duty to attend thee to try to sooth   edward away thou never shall not all that idle wisdom can suggest all the vain talk of proud unfeeling reason shall rob me of one tear  gloucester of natures tears i would not rob thee they invigorate virtue soften at once and sortify the heart but when they rise to speak this desperate language they then grow tears of weakness yes   edward i care not weakness whatever they be i will indulge them will in despite of thee and all mankind devote my joyless days for ever to them  gloucester reason and virtue then are empty names  edward hence leave me to my fate  you have undone me you have made shipwreck of my peace among you my happiness and honor and i now roam the detested world a careless wretch  gloucester thy honor yet is safe how long i know not for full it drives upon the rocks of passion o all ye pitying powers that rule mankind who so unworthy but may proudly deck him with this fairweather virtue that exults glad over the summer main the tempest comes the bold winds speak aloud when from the helm this virtue shrinks and in a corner lies lamenting  heavens if privileged from trial how cheap a thing were virtue  edward do  insult me  rail spare me not  rail gloucester all the world  but know mean time thou can not make me feel thee  i have no more connection with mankind  gloucester insult thee edward do these tears insult thee these old mans tears  friendship my prince can weep as well as love  but while i weep thy fortune let me not weep thy virtue sunk beneath it  thou have no more connection with mankind put off thy craving senses the deep wants and infinite dependencies of nature put off that strongest passion of the soul soul of the soul love to society put off all gratitude for what is past all generous hope of what is yet to come put off each sense of honor and of duty then use this language  let me tell thee edward thou have connections with mankind and great ones thou know not of connections that might rouse the smallest spark of honor in thy breast to wideawakend life and fair ambition  edward what do thou mean  gloucester what mean  this day in england how many ask of palestine their king edward their king  read these   edward opening the dispatches o gloucester  gloucester  alas my royal father is no more the gentlest of mankind the most abused of gracious nature a fit soil for virtues till there his creatures sowed their flattering lies and made him  no not all their cursed arts could ever make him insolent or cruel o my deluded father little joy had thou in life led from thy real good and genuine glory from thy peoples love that noblest aim of kings by smiling traitors is there a curse on human kind so fell so pestilent at once to prince and people as the base servile vermin of a court corrupt corrupting ministers and favorites how often have such eat up the widows morsel the peasants toil the merchants farsought gain and wantoned in the ruin of a nation thus weak of heart thus desolate of soul ah how unfit am i with steady hand to rule a troubled state  she she is gone softner of care the dear reward of toil the source of virtue she who to a crown had lent new splendour who had graced a throne like the sweet seraph mercy tempering justice o eleonora any life with thee the plainest could have charmed but pomp and pleasure all that a loving people can bestow by thee unshard will serve alone to nourish the wounds of woe and make me more unhappy  gloucester now is the time now lift thy soul to virtue behold a crisis sent by heaven to save thee whatever my prince can touch or can command can quicken or exalt the heart of man now speaks to thine  thy children claim their father nay more than father claim their double parent for such thy promise was to eleonora thy subjects claim their king thy troops their chief the manes of thy ancestors consign their longdescended glory to thy hands and thy dejected country calls upon thee to save her raise her to restore her honor to spread her sure dominion over the deep and bid her yet arise the scourge of france angels themselves might envy thee the joy that waits thy will of doing general good of spreading virtue chearing lonely worth of dashing down the proud of guarding arts the sacred rights of industry and freedom of making a whole generous people happy o edward edward the most piercing transports of the best love can never equal these and need i add  thy eleonoras death calls out for vengeance   edward ha  gloucester if thou indeed do honor thus her memory then show it not by soft tears and womanish complaints but show it like a man   edward i will  gloucester yon towers   edward it is true  gloucester yon guilty towers   edward insult us still  gloucester the murderer of thy princess riots there   edward but shall not long  thou

flame from heaven that lights up higher being thrice welcome with thy noble servant anger and just revenge  hence let us to the camp and there transfuse our soul into the troops this sultans blood will ease my feverd breast yes i will take such vengeance on this city that all mankind shall turn their eyes to jaffa and as they see her turrets sunk in dust shall learn to dread the terrors of the just  end of the fourth act act v scene i selim o my daraxa thou have charmed my soul this reconciling interview has soothed my troubled bosom into tender joy as when the spring first on the softened top of lebanon unbinds her lovely treffes and shakes her blooming sweets from carmels brow  it only now remains to see the prince   scene ii selim theald theald i sought thee worthy dervise  selim reverend christian my toiling thoughts can find no fixed repose till the wronged sultans vindicated honor shine out as bright as yon unsullied sky conduct me to the prince  i claim thy promise  it stings my conscious soul with sick impatience to think what selim suffers for a man who loves the ways of truth and open virtue to ly beneath the burning imputation of baseness and of crimes  such horrid crimes  o it is a keen unsufferable torment come let me then discharge this other part of my commission  theald that thou soon shall do he strait will come this way the king of england such now he is mean time it is fit to tell thee he must be managed softly for his passions are all abroad in wild confusion hurled the winds the floods and lightning mix together i need not say how little in this uproar a vails the broken thwarted light of reason  selim fear not thou know that with with one softning word i can appease his highest storm of passion but let me take the method that will gain with most convincing evidence my purpose  theald he cannot long delay for as i entered i saw him parting from the hurried camp that lightened wide around him burnished helms and glittering spears and ardent thronging soldiers demanding all the signal when to storm these walls devoted to their vengeance   selim ha then let us quickly find him  but he comes  scene iii selim theald edward gloucester edward whence is it those barbarians here again those base those murdering cowards dare be seen what new accursed attempt is now on foot what new assassination  start not dervise tinge not thy caitiff cheek with redning honor what thou  do thou pretend to feel reproach art thou not of a shameless race of people hardened in arts of cruelty and blood perfidious all yes have you not profaned the faith of nations broke the holy tie that binds the families of earth together that gives even foes to meet with hostile joy and teaches war security your prince your prince has done it and you should hereafter be hunted from your dens like savage beasts be crushed like serpents  theald sir this dervise comes to clear the sultan selim from that crime which you with strong appearance charge upon him  edward appearance theald with unquestioned proof doubtless the villain would be glad to change the course by nature fixed enjoy his crimes without their evil  but he shall not escape me  selim if king of england in this weighty matter on which depends the weal and life of thousands you love and seek the truth let reason judge cool steady quiet and dispassiond reason for never yet since the proud selfish race of men began to jar did passion give nor ever can it give a right decision  edward reason has judged and passion shall chastise shall make you howl ye cowards of the east what can be clearer this vile prince of jaffa this infamy of princes sends a ruffian by his own hand and seal commissioned sends him to treat of peace and as i read his letters the villain stabs me  this if this wants light there is no certainty in human reason if this not shines with allconvincing truth yon sun is dark  and yet these cowards come with lying shifts and low elusive arts  o it inflames my anger into madness this added insult on our understanding this treacherous attempt to steal away the only joy and treasure of my life sweet sacred vengeance for my murdered princess  selim the cursed wretch who did assail thy life o king of england was indeed an envoy sent by the prince of jaffa this we own but then he was an execrable bigot who for such horrid purposes had crept into the cheated sultans court and service as by the traltors papers we have learned for know there lives upon the craggy cliffs of wild phenician mountains a dire race a nation of assassins dreadful zeal fierce and intollerant of all religion that differs from their own is the black soul of that infernal state soon as their chief the old man so they style him of the mountains gives out his baleful will however fell however wicked and abhorred it be though clothed in danger the most cruel death they swift and silent glide through every land as fly the gloomy ministers of vengeance famine and plague they ly for years concealed make light of oaths nay sometimes change religion and never fail to execute his orders of these the villain was these ruffian saints the curse of earth the terror of mankind and the engagement prince in this crusado that was the reason whence they sought thy life  edward false false as hell the lie of guilty fear you all are bigots robbers ruffians all it is the very genius of your nation vindictive rage the thirst of blood consumes you you live by rapine thence your empire rose and your religion is a mere pretense to rob and murder in the name of heaven  selim be patient prince be more humane and just you have your virtues have your vices too and we have ours the liberal hand of nature has not created us nor any nation beneath the blessed canopy of heaven of such malignant clay but each may boast their native virtues and their makers bounty you call us bigots  oh can thou with that reproach us christian prince what brought thee hither what else but bigotry what do thou here what else but persecute  the truth is great greater than thee and i will give it way even thou thyself in all thy rage wilt hear it  from their remotest source these holy wars what have they breathed but bigotry and rapine did not the first crusaders when their zeal should have shone out the purest did they not led by the frantic hermit who began the murderous trade through their own countries spread the woes their vice could not reserve for ours though this exceeds the purport of my message yet must i thus insulted in my country insulted in religion bid thee think o king of england on the different conduct of saracens and christians when beneath your pious godfrey in the first crusado jerusalem was sacked and when beneath our generous saladin it was retaken  o hideous scene my soul within me shrinks abhorrent from the view  twelve thousand wretches received to mercy void of all defense trusting to plighted faith to purchased safety behold these naked wretches in cold blood men women children murdered basely murdered the holy temple which you came to rescue regorges with the barbarous profanation the streets run dismal torrents drowned in blood the very soldier sickens at his carnage could thou o sun behold the blaing sight and lift again thy sacred eye on mortals a ruthless race who can do this can do it to please the general father of mankind while nobler saladin   edward away be gone with thee vile dervise what have i to do i lose my hour of vengeance i debase me to hold this talk with thee  selim while truth and reason speak from my tongue vile dervise as i am yet am i greater than the highest monarch who from blind fury grows the slave of passion besides i come to justify a prince however in other qualities below thee in love of goodness truth humanity and honor sir thy equal  yes thy equal   edward what how compare me with a damned assassin a matchless villain  ha presumptuous dervise thou gnawst thy quivering lip  a smothered passion shakes through thy frame  what villainy is that thou dare not utter  were thou not a wretch protected by thy habit this right hand should crush thee into atoms  hence away go tell thy master that i hold him base beyond the power of words to speak his baseness a coward an assassinating coward and when i once have dragged him from his city which i will straitway do  i then will make him in all the gall and bitterness of guilt grinding the vengeful steel betwixt his teeth will make the traitor own it  selim discovering himself never  edward ha  selim thou can not haughty monarch  i am he i am this selim this insulted selim yet clear as day and will confound thy passion  edward thou selim  selim i  edward was ever guilt so bold  selim did ever innocence descend to fear  edward this bears some show of honor will thou then decide it by the sword  selim i will do more   edward how more  selim decide it by superior reason  edward no weak evasions   selim if i not convince thee if by thy self i am not of this crime acquitted then i grant thee thy demand nay more yon yielded city shall be thine for know hot prince i should disdain a throne i could not fill with honor were i guilty i would not tremble at thy threatening voice no it is my self i fear  edward what shall i think  selim hear but one witness and i ask no more to clear my name the witness is a woman her looks are truth fair uncorrupted faith beams from her eyes thou never can doubt such beauty for it is the expression of a spotless soul  edward curse on thy mean luxurious eastern arts of cowardice thou would seduce my vengeance  but i detest all beauty  barbarous sultan ah thou have murdered beauty thy fell crime  haste gloucester haste  in sight of camp and city prepare the lists  now show thy self a prince or die in shameful tortures like a slave  selim i came not hither or to dread thy wrath or court thy mercy  gloucester sir you cannot justly refuse him his demand the servent soul of undissembled innocence methinks is felt in what he says first hear this person and if she gives not full conviction then have then recourse to what should always be the last appeal of reasonable beings brute force  edward well then conduct her hither sultan   selim goes out ah my disordered mind from thought to thought uncertain tossed the wreck of stormy passion this rage awhile supports me but i feel it will desert me soon and i again shall soon relapse to misery and weakness o eleonora little did thou think how deeply wretched thy dire gift of life would make me  scene iv edward gloucester theald to them selim conducting eleonora daraxa selim raise thy eyes o king of england to the bright witness of my blameless honor  edward no beauty shall no more engage my eyes it shall no more profane the shrine devoted to the sweet image of my eleonora  let her declare her knowledge in this matter  eleonora will not my edward bless me with a look  edward what angel borrows eleonoras voice  o thou pale shade of her i weep for ever permit me thus to worship thee  thou art  amazing heaven  thou art my eleonora my eleonoras self my dear my felt my living eleonora  what  to whom owe i this miracle this better life  oppressive joy  owe i my eleonora  eleonora to him that generous prince who put his life his honor on the desperate risque to save me when numbered with the dead who brought himself a swift and powerful remedy by which i am to light restored  to thee my edward  edward to him to him  o monstrous  whom i thus have with such inhumanity insulted o blind o brutish o injurious rage they they are wise who when they feel thy madness seal up their lips and can thou then forgive me thou who have over me gained that noblest triumph the triumph of humanity  thou can it is easier for the generous to forgive than for offense to ask it  selim use not prince so harsh a word more than forgive i love thy noble heat thy beautiful disorder o i am too much man i feel myself too much the charming force of human passions ever to pretend with supercilious brow with proud affected virtue to disdain them  edward how generous sultan how shall i requite thee here  take thy loved daraxa whom i meant to have restored when this misfortune happened but secretworking heaven ordained her stay to save us all  selim were thou the lord of earth thou could not give me more  my dear daraxa  edward hence to the camp my gloucester  bid the soldiers forsake the trenches  let unbounded joy reign fearless over the mingled camp and city  go tell my faithful soldiers that their queen my eleonora lives a prize beyond the chance of war to give she lives to soften my too imperious temper and to make them to make my people happy  o my soul what love ever equaled thine o dearest best pride of thy sex inimitable goodness whenever woman henceforth shall be praised for conjugal affection men will say there shine the virtues of an eleonora transporting bliss  how bountiful is heaven depressing often but to raise us more let never those despair who follow virtue love  gratitude  divide me  once more sultan forgive me pardon my mistaken zeal that left my country crossed the stormy seas to war with thee brave prince to war with honor now that my passions give me leave to think the hand of heaven appears in what i suffered my erring zeal has suffered by a bigot  selim it does o king and venerable christian i know thy moderation will excuse me but since by ruling wisdom who unweighd unmeant does naught men are so various made so various turned that in opinions they must blindly think or take a different way in spite of force since judgment will be free then let us in this righteous mean agree let holy rage let persecution cease let the head argue but the heart be peace let all mankind in love of what is right in virtue and humanity unite  the end
