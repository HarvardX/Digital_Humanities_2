commonplace arguments etc  commonplace arguments against administration with obvious answers intended for the use of the new parliament  london printed for r faulder new bond street m dcc lxxx  advertisement in most of the arts and sciences professors have formed general outlines of the plan method and arrangement to be followed by the pupils who study them  some sort of analysis might be of equal service to young proficients in parliamentary eloquence  a multitude of words delivered with rapidity and vehemence puzzle and confuse those who are unacquainted with the technical trick of debate  it will be of use therefore to prepare for our juvenile senators a compendious outline of such arguments as may most probably be employed at the opening of the approaching session  and in order to detect the fallacy of much popular rhetoric brief observations will be annexed to each of the commonplace topics by which means when any of the old opposition orators begin to flourish away on these trite arguments the young members may by recurring to the proper section in the analysis immediately find most of the thoughts and many of the words that will be used for or against the question with this main difference that each will be much shorter and probably both more intelligible  the author is aware that nothing can be simpler than this plan it being much of the same nature with an exhibition catalogue which merely describes the subjects of the several compositions presented to public criticism and possibly some readers may think it might have been well to complete the simile by subjoining in this instance as well as in the former the names of the several artists but though something of that dramatic kind was rather successfully attempted in a pamphlet called anticipation it seems more adviseable to avoid the least appearance of personality on the present occasion  the ridicule that was then with some propriety directed against the tediousness or the pedantry or the droll dotage that characterized some individual speakers would now be wholly unnecessary it never was a task of difficulty to expose the folly of mock eloquence once achieved the repetition would be as disgustful as the subject  but sophistry assumes new shapes and acts under various disguises like the malicious enchanter in romance to be finally overcome it must be attacked in all its transformations yet he who engages in this war of words can be but little exposed to any charge of presumption it is a combat far more tiresome than perilous and however severely his patience may be exercised he will have but few occasions to exert his strength so that as his utmost triumph can be only proportionable to so inferior a contest he may be secure at least from the

sordid venal mean inconsistant despicable parliament that ever existed  it betrayed the rights of the people trampled on their privileges violated their majesty servilely crouched to prerogative and wasted the blood and treasure of the public to satiate private ambition and avarice  hence national resentment was universally rouzed the elective body to a man despised the representative and all ranks and orders of people anxiously expected the happy moment of the dissolution at the approach indeed of that awful crisis political frailty felt a sort of deathbed penitence it was the hectic virtue of a moment the panic however soon subsided and flushed with new hopes of a protracted existence the old septennial methodist rose like voltaire from sickness impatient for deeper vices and anxious for more aggravated profligacy  such was your parliament  look you now what follows  a young phoenix rising from the ashes of the old  the best of all possible parliaments  a pure incorrupt delegation from the true source of all real power the people unfettered by connections unclogged with errors free to consult to deliberate to determine for the public safety such is your parliament  answer it is difficult to give a just idea of the animated style of opposition invectives particularly on such a theme as the present where the free indulgence of them is unchecked by any of those awkward restraints which some young men have of late so unconstitutionally thrown on them  a deceased parliament is one of those immaterial objects that every one may attack with perfect impunity and indeed under the present restrictions it is no small convenience to the component parts of such a corporate body to have in the very nature of their constitution a safe resource for the exercise of their wildest rancour and most fanciful asperity it is however uncommonly whimsical that almost the very same set of men who actually composed the subject of this invective should be themselves the auditors of it and at the same moment that they are stigmatized in their late capacity they should receive so premature a panegyric in their new one yet such is almost precisely the case  the last parliament and the present parliament being very nearly one and the same  it is true indeed there have been some exchanges and different branches of particular families have taken their rotation in election honors but still both parliaments are essentially and effectually alike so that with a few inconsiderable exceptions the returns and reelections incontrovertibly prove that all the imputations of national odium and contempt so industriously thrown on the last parliament must at least have been grossly exaggerated if not entirely false  as to the penitential vote so often and so vauntingly relied on it will always be remembered that the house at large refused to report the abstract proposition so fearfully passed by a committee of inferior numbers  it was indeed a florid weakness the hectic effort of exhausted sedition that like the faint offer of a latter spring served but to usher in the fall and withered in an affected bloom  complimentary invitations to be scattered among the young members as it is scarcely possible that any gentleman of spirit or independence can support the ministry without forfeiting all pretensions to virtue justice honor and common sense there can be still less doubt that those who are least hackneyed in the ways of public life and consequently most accutely sensible of the allurements of popularity will instantly join the present constitutional upright consistent generous just opposition  what can be so flattering to youthful ambition as being immediately enrolled in a band of genuine patriots and registered among the only british worthies of the age what ampler field can the world afford for the display of genius learning and eloquence than that glorious contest of america with england of freedom against tyranny  in the most prosperous times the support of ministers is an inglorious and vulgar task compared to the control of them there is little or no scope for rhetoric in plain statements regular calculations legal precision and such other trite and plain modes as men in office must necessarily pursue on the contrary opposition has inexhaustible themes of eloquence  suspicions alarms menaces and predictions not to mention impeachments which cannot well recur so regularly are rich and constant sources of popular declamation besides one of the chief benefits that arise from new parliaments is the accession of fresh supplies of genius and cultivated abilities and perhaps there never was a time when such immense quantities of both were introduced into the house of commons as upon the present occasion  young gentlemen not only endowed with prodigious abilities but who have been for many years back in training for debate abound on all sides  what an infinite pity would it be then were such improved talents obscured and shrouded from public admiration in the dull details of official politicians  in the moment of peril and dismay it is happy for this nation at large to have selected men formed as it were for the salvation of their country  it is no less fortunate for those who possess such talents to have them called into action at so aweful a crisis  indeed it is one of the great benefits arising from the present calamities that gentlemen have now much finer opportunities and more numerous subjects for displaying their talents than they could possibly have enjoyed in more quiet times and which too if not immediately taken advantage of may irretrievably escape by some unlucky change to prosperity abroad or humanity at home  answer what antidote can reason provide against such potent incantations  the cold suggestion of more temperate advice would feebly resist the siren voice of popular allurement and vainly is judgment addressed where the subtle appeal is more fancifully made to vanity and inexperience to examine and analize the several properties of real debate in distinction to those of wild declamation would appear too refined to ridicule the prevailing passion for oratory too trite still less would it be proper under this division either to enquire into the merits of minority or to discuss the justice and sincerity of their claims to public confidence  to raise new levies for the service of opposition is so entirely the interest of that set of men who command the old troops that it cannot fail to create some flight doubts of the perfect sincerity and pure zeal of their complimentary invitations but without considering such an adventurous junction in the more serious light of a desertion from every solid and substantial interest of our country it may not be wholly unuseful to suggest how impossible it is for the opposition in its present state to afford those numerous and happy occasions for the display of genius and eloquence which its advocates so speciously hold out as the strongest incentives to youthful ambition  the minority has long been directed and controuled by a few leading orators who after years of fatiguing service are most justly entitled to rank as veterans in their profession and are now too reasonably jealous of their established precedence to participate in fame with the raw recruits they are so anxious to enlist  one of their leaders has expressly published the articles of party with much fairness and candor avowing the necessity of obedience to a common leader and of acting in due subordination to his commands with more zeal indeed than policy this champion of party very frankly decried and ridiculed all separate exertions and individual efforts as attempts of equal inefficacy and presumption and rather rashly discovered so much more of this degrading system than former politicians had thought it wise or decent to reveal that many men of proper pride and spirit were disgusted with the rockingham service and begged leave to resign their commissions  others of subtler talents labored with more art and casuistry to explain away these dangerous articles but still however speciously they argued they always had the precaution to maintain their rank in eloquence by the exclusion of every new competitor and to secure the credit by monopolizing the time of debate   no young man of talents has for years back met with the patronage of opposition every succeeding session was the echo of the former the same quantity of time has been annually devoted to the same tediousness and protraction of debate even stated hours seemed almost appointed for each particular orator nor was it ever a very difficult calculation to imagine who was actually speaking at any given time by only looking what oclock it was for the daily movements of their rhetoric were as mechanically exhibited by a periodical succession of figures as those of the famous strasburg clock except indeed when some rough unmanageable countrygentlemen would start out like the savages of st dunstans to give a hasty stroke or two and then retire again to rest in peace on their unpolished clubs  but above all the particular style of abilities which characterize the present manager of opposition renders all inferior exertions in eloquence almost useless and ridiculous  there is a magnitude in extraordinary talents that contrasts and caricatures the comparative inequality of those who are placed in competition with them qualities which carried to an extreme are striking from their enormity such as desperate vehemence and outrageous acrimony become ridiculous in imitation and impotent by inferiority they resemble theatrical thunder compared with real and serve only to burlesque an original that can never be successfully imitated the minor malcontents and mimic republicans of the present day would do well therefore to reflect how very contemptible the petty partisans of faction have been in all ages and countries there were dozens of duodecimo catilines who buzzed conspiracy in every corner of the forum though history has scarcely stooped to name them ravaillac had his monk committees and holy associations whose debates and resolutions have been charitably consigned to oblivion nor has there ever been any desperate leader from the rank of catiline to cade who has not boasted a gang of followers officious and obscure busy and forgot  prophecies of opposition in stating contingent events and deducing the future consequences of any measure now in agitation opposition should always be deemed infallible  they are entitled to this dependence on their present predictions because all their former prophecies are fully accomplished  lest a point of such consequence to their credit should have remained unrecorded a copious list of these divinations was published in a periodical paper devoted to their service and to authenticate more indubitably the evidence of this political foresight any gentleman who will be so obliging as to refer to the list will find the date of each prediction accurately subjoined the place of utterance in a marginal note and the full accomplishment in the opposite column it will be equally apparent that the ministry in several instances received and treated these prophecies with most irreverent skepticism with great justice and propriety therefore no circumstance is more perpetually and more successfully urged than the prophecies of opposition and hence it is most fairly inferred that their past sagacity invests them with an indefeasible and perpetual infallibility in future  answer the gipsey fortune tellers takes a bond of fate and to ensure her skill most generally perpetrates the mischiefs she predicts  to this judicious policy it may be chiefly owing that egyptian divination has so long survived all other oracles and supernatural inspirations of antiquity  the pythian priestess became suspected or unintelligible from evasion or ambiguity and was equally stigmatized by philips gold or the chains of craesus  even our homespun witches palterd in such double sense that by their own equivocation more than any terrors of law they forfeited the credulous veneration they had so long usurped  in short the gipsey pursues the best system for all human prophecies this ensuring sybil boldly corrects the uncertainty of time and chance and with great prudence relies on her own dexterity for the securest voucher of her prescience   a similar wisdom has guided the prophets of opposition  i pledge myself to this house says one of them that the confidence which america may justly repose in the sympathetic ardor that inspires a very great part of this nation will make her scorn your menaces and fly to arms to vindicate her rights  here is one instance among a thousand others of a patriotic prediction that by the liberal encouragement it holds out goes great lengths to effect the event it foretells and is in fact the leading cause of its own accomplishment  away with the idle notion says another prophet of success in your northern expedition i am bold to say and i wish my words to be taken down that miscarriage and ruin will attend that devoted army  not to comment too harshly on the very extraordinary precision and accuracy of these terms it is fair to observe thus much on all predictions of this nature that they act with a double influence first by dispiriting our friends and then by encouraging the enemy consequently if they are not condemned as principals they may at least be arraigned as active accomplices in producing the calamity they foretell  but as many people have thought that too large a portion of debate has been employed of late years in recounting the utterance and expounding the final completion of these prophecies it might tend to abbreviate this article of oratory if a committee of parliamentary prophets invested with the ensigns of augural authority were ordered forth with to prepare and bring in a kind of political almanac or patriots calender for the use of the current year wherein all minor victories and defeats should be set down as feasts and fasts and redletter days set apart for more important losses  it might enrich a work of this nature to interleave each month with pages of collateral philosophy opposite to its subjects such as refutations of several vulgar errors too commonly enterained relative to some military misdeeds in the late campaigns by comparing them to the retrogade motion of the planets which every more enlightened observer can easily prove to be quite contrary to appearances and merely arising from our vast distance from the objects and the gross medium through which we view them so too any tediousness in crossing the delaware or obscurity in the saratoga business might receive great light from the philosophy of transits and eclipses while the doctrine of comets would furnish infinite analogy to all kinds of excentricity civil military or naval  these together with proper tables for calculating the influence of the moon on the rise and fall of stocks would form a very compendious and handy diary in state affairs and in a short time must become as infallible a guide in politics as partridges predictions formerly were in astrology  annual parliaments in the moment of most general danger to the very existence of a state from a rebellion and a foreign war it becomes all wise good and prudent men to devote their whole time to the concerting measures not to overcome the common enemy but to new model and patch up the constitution just as in a closely besieged town every clever fellow should leave it to his inferiors to repel the assailants from the walls and busy himself and his neighbors in drawing plans to repair and beautify the old town hall the assemblyrooms and other buildings of the city and this not from any paradoxical confusion or ideal refinement that the inside of the town is to all intents and purposes the outside or that the said edifices are virtually the fortifications but for a much simpler and more substantial reason namely that the day of distress and danger is the true time to frighten the magistrates into receiving their terms which if the siege is raised will set them up for ever in fame and fortune and if it be not will serve at least to recommend them to the victorious enemy as very shrewd and notable projectors  now in a state like ours it is clear that the constitution of parliament must always form the grand subject of political theory hence various schemes have been propounded to purify and refine it from all corruptions and many tedious preparations in the nature of chemical processes have been occasionally invented to exalt it to what it really should be a kind of compound elixir of popular spirit  in the course of these experiments some professors insisted that its whole efficacy must depend on the ingredients that compose it being brought from their several native soils free of all charges  others held that larger quantities of its most wholesome simples should be gathered out of the richest and best cultivated lands and not picked up like mushrooms from old wastes and barren commons but however composed sifted and refined several concurred in opinion that it never could keep its spirit above three years because formerly they only made it up for that time  but the last and far most important discovery of all is that it never possibly can be fit for use or good for any thing at all above a twelvemonth after it is first put together  or to release the metaphor before it is quite exhausted that annual parliaments are the grand arcanum and sovereign panacea for all the distempers of our decayed and perishing constitution and in order to establish this important point first they affirm that the virtue of that restricted duration beyond a triennial one is very clearly proved by a converse ratio of the old homely adage there can never be too much of a good thing which being inverted very fairly carries the question by three to one against triennial in favor of annual parliaments  and next the ingenious advocates of this improvement as clearly prove the undoubted use and pleasure that would naturally result both to constituents and representatives from this annual revolution of intercourse by showing how infallibly it must promote the health and spirits of the former to be under a sort of pleasing necessity to keep up a visiting acquaintance with their constituents in the purer air of the country to whom in their turn it would prove equally beneficial and delightful by encouraging the briskness of trade and cheapness of provisions at such constant repetitions of election festivity and convivial fellowship  but these and many secondary motives are lost in the beauty depth and curiosity of the main argument that is the foundation of this plan which is briefly this the mysterious excellence of the number twelve that limits the months in this constitutional period a cabalistical idea which though too subtle and complex to be dwelt on minutely in this place cannot fail to strike every impartial mind with sufficient force on the mere mention of a few instances among the millions which exist wherein this number of twelve predominates with which short enumeration the subject shall be closed  first then all the world knows that the earth revolves in twelve months round the twelve signs of the zodiac and this too as monsieur gebelin very critically expounds was typically illustrated in pagan mythology by the twelve labors of hercules all which like our corporate and parochial offices were performed exactly in the good even space of a twelvemonth next all petty juries are composed of twelve and grand juries of twice twelve good men and true so too there are twelve judges and though the bishops exclusive of the two metropolitans are just twice that number yet there is a relative proportion even in this difference which was certainly designed to signify the double glory of ecclesiastical united with temporal dignities as well as the exact increase of piety in these latter compared to the primitive times when in truth as every one knows there were but twelve apostles  add to these therefore the twelve candlesticks in the revelations the twelve tribes of israel the twelve caesars and dozens of other duodecimo examples and you will then have the very essence of all the arguments in favor of parliaments for twelve months  answer previous question  best officers driven from the service ministers have the art to connect contrarieties of baseness they dismiss without cause or employ to no end our best officers  examples of the former have appeared in the militia the latter has been equally instanced both in our army and navy  there is something of pagan craft in this crooked policy  the virtue and valor of theseus were too formidable to a feeble and suspicious tyrant to be overlooked with affected contempt or openly degraded it was a safer and subtler cruelty to exhaust this dangerous heroism in remote and perilous enterprises which if achieved would give credit to the wisdom of those who projected them but if attended with shame and disappointment might lower if not entirely destroy the reputation of their conductors  the hero of antiquity indeed defeated this pernicious system and returned in triumph to greet his insidious employers with unwelcome successes and offensive victory but however fatally imperfect the parallel of devoted valor must appear in modern annals every generous mind will equally abhor the same base and mean policy which in both instances veiled ruin beneath its bounty and exalted only to destroy  such has been the odious system of government toward those whose professional eminence joined to their popular attachments and connections pointed them out as the fittest objects for temporary banishment at least if not shameful captivity abroad or more degrading impotence at home  nor has the executive power been less busily oppressive in the domestic arrangements of our great internal and constitutional defense the militia  it is the extreme of tyranny to control the freedom of thought  sidney lost his life for his written principles  with more cautious injustice the patriots of the present day are deprived of their hereditary honors for daring to speak their independent opinions  to release the mind from the oppressive awe of of authority the patriotic parliament of charles the firsts reign claimed and exercised their just right of appointing the lord lieutenants and other officers that array and command our militia  it was too well foreseen that a right of so extensive a nature might in the hands of regal caprice become a convenient instrument to check the spirit of liberty or to punish its generous exertions  could it have been imagined that the time would arrive when the highest and most important ranks of that very armament should be rashly invaded and revengefully violated by prerogative if on any occasion their established possessors dared to exercise the right of thinking for themselves it might have damped the zeal of precipitate loyalty in resigning so important a right to the discretion and virtue of a monarch unfortunately however this very right was as rashly surrendered by the parliament of charles the second as it was manfully maintained in the reign of his tyrannical predecessor  what has been the consequence  we have lived to see the day when a ruinous and wretched administration that administration which has invariably pursued the wicked system of division that administration which has set friend against friend relation against relation and connection against connection that administration which has robbed us of thirteen colonies and plunged us in a shameful and calamitous war with the whole world has insolently dismissed the accomplished descendants of two of the noblest and most ancient families from those commands to which their superior rank and property had most justly elevated their ancestors and themselves for  only happening to vote in opposition to the minister of the day  answer there is but little necessity to consider the fabulous allusions and ideal parallels of declamation the legendary tale of demagogues had its use in the decline of athenian freedom but if its boasted hero had surrendered to his worst and basest antagonist without fighting and in a short time after some happier hero had fought and conquered the very same combatant probably no grecian orator would afterward have much insisted on the visionary speculation of an armys being devoted to sacrifice an individual  it is necessary to treat the latter part of this argument with some degree of seriousness and solidity least however too much time may appear to be wasted on it it may be prudent to premise that objections founded on popular notions and prejudices are easily conveyed in few words and so conveyed make strong impressions but whoever answers those objections must encounter all the notions to which they are allied and to which they owe their strength and it is well if any words find admittance to remove the first impression  the appointment of party men to places of trust and power was indeed a very hazardous policy it must however be remembered that this policy was founded on a very liberal and generous hope that however the forms of opposition might be kept up and even the technical licentiousness of debate persevered in yet that every man of honor at so awful a period would divest himself of all the little prejudices and passions of party and feel his mind actuated by the noblest impulse to suspend at least all private resentment if not to form a truly glorious coalition founded on public principle and national honor  certainly the accomplishment of so noble a purpose would have been crowned with far different success from that which has actually attended its attempt  but to avoid these painful and vain reflections in proceeding to answer the charge of violent and unconstitutional dismission it must first be remembered that removals are not punishments  it would be absurd to imagine that a mere private prejudice in political measures however vague and fancifull or even pernicious in its tendency to the general welfare of the state can become an object of penalty but it is indeed a very different question with what propriety those persons who not only avow such opinions with the fond attachment of innovation but also disseminate them with most active zeal should be continued in those very stations which afford most frequent and most extensive opportunities to spread them with all the weight of influence and authority  and next as to the right of dismission it is obvious that the same power which appoints to offices must necessarily remove from them both are exercises of that plain discretionary trust necessarily reposed in all governments to the end that every delegation of their authority may be lodged in such hands as shall seem best affected to those who employ them  nor is this preventive policy of guarding against dissaffecton less congenial with the spirit of our constitution  the prerogative of appointment to offices was originally unlimited but at the restoration the parliament most expressly declared the necessity of guarding with jealous vigilance against the introduction of those persons into places of power and trust whose opinions and prejudices rendered them dangerous servants for the state to employ  hence the corporation and test acts which though at first they may seem rather formed to guard the mitre than the crown were in fact more really directed against the civil than the religious principles of the dissenters  these disabling statutes very clearly prove two points both of which are material to this question  first that it is perfectly constitutional to exercise the prerogative of appointment to offices with a strict and cautious attention to the principles of those who are to be employed in them and next that in every other instance except in these statutable disqualifications this prerogative is entirely unlimited and absolutely discretionary for it is plain that the very restriction in those excepted cases virtually establishes its independance in every other but so anxious were the restoration parliament to remove all possibility of any future encroachment on the discretionary prerogative of militia appointments that an act was unanimously passed expressive of the national abhorrence of that recent usurpation of them which had fatally given arms to innovation and overturned the constitution under the specious pretense of amending it  by the same act also it was directly declared that those very appointments had ever been and for ever should continue the unalienable and uncontrouled right of the crown  such then being both the letter and the spirit of the law on this point it is but mere matter of curiosity to consider the plain principles on which this power is founded both in natural and civil society  in the former though all men were originally on an equality yet the distinction of abilities set the first bounds  it required wisdom and courage for council and arms  and it was necessary of course to exclude from each such as were respectively deficient in either  so far forth therefore there was a natural limitation  but in civil society it is equally important in all delegations of power to connect affection to the government with the other leading qualifications for as has been too often proved a courageous man who hates his employers is at least as unfit to be trusted as a coward and wisdom connected with enmity would only serve to aggravate treachery in council  the plain consequence of which is this that either no government has a right to preserve itself against the disaffection of a subject or else that every government has a right to exclude from offfices of power and trust such as render themselves suspected of disaffection  opinion of things in general or conversation politics every thing is as bad as bad can be  indeed it is now my only comfort that any change must be for the better  it cannot be for the worse  as to america the game is up  it was always a mad visionary scheme without an object or an end  poor sir robert walpole who after all was a very great man used always to say he would never set that stone a rolling  france is amazingly populous  it is nonsense to talk of a rebellion in south america  spain has all that immense wealth under her thumb  so we are to fight them and all the world for what i see  and how  we have no men at home  and how are we to get them  i am sure we have no money  formerly we had friends abroad to apply to  the old king of prussia for one  but surely we cannot go on as we have year after year with loan upon loan and tax upon tax  why if a gentlemans going post now he cannot sleep in peace in his chaise  he is sure to be woke by the turnpike man hollowing for the new tickets indeed  what will they tax next  not air i hope  then there are these northern power  i dont know what they mean  i repeat it i havent an idea what they would be at  let me tell you it is a very black cloud hovering over us and bodes no good  why dont we employ new men  we want some great original genius like a chatham to come forward and act  then we should get on  we dont get on  such a monstrous fleet as ours should have pushed into breast water at once  or bombarded cadiz  why did not they convoy all the ships we have lost  all i see that they are ever about is victualling  they are taking in fresh provisions and water from morning till night  yet they are always sick too  lord sandwich mistook his line  i want to see a seaman at the head of the navy  i doubt there is some mystery at the bottom of those captures  people shake their heads in the city  depend on it there has always been an overruling influence in the cabinet  ant every thing given to scotchmen  we should set the axe to the root  in short i fairly own things are come to such a pass that  i really dont know what to advise  equivocal answer by a trimmer come come my dear sir now you go too far  as long as you confined yourself to wit and humor it was all very fair  but dont be too severe  not that i absolutely differ from you in what you assert for i have by no means made up my mind on any of these matters  i own i wish to see a little more what turn things may take before i declare myself  this country has certainly very great resources  but at the same time we are in a mighty hazardous way  yet america is a great game  heaven only knows though what should be done  it is very true i have mostly voted with ministry  indeed i did live in habits with a good many of them  but i never will commit myself to any set of men  i own i always thought the lessening the burdens of the landed interest a very fine object  and to be sure it was my opinion that our colonies should bear a part in redeeming the debts we incurred for their defense  but i dont know that every thing has been carried on right in america  yet i dont throw blame any where  though there may have been faults  on both sides  however we shall see  i must talk with ministers about these things  but thus much i will say  i dont at all disapprove of the conduct of the states general nor indeed of any of the northern powers for they act only with proper precaution and it is quite right for nations as well as individuals to be on their guard and take care of themselves  the praise of party independance is a wild unsocial idea  even a monk confessed that to absolutely enjoy this mental solitude man must change his nature to that of angels or demons  in the progress of civilization every approach to perfection is founded on relinquishing this solitary pride of thinking or acting for ourselves alone  the rudest savages have their clans and chiefs the freest republics their heads and statholders  from different degrees of strength courage or abilities subordination arises  to the boldest or hardiest or wisest the supreme command in war or in peace is confided  and the natural equality of each is prudently resigned for the benefit of all  but chiefly on the spur of necessity and the pressure of complex operations is the increase of dependence originally grounded and ultimately established  the former createa roman dictatorship by the latter it was perpetuated  thus then as it appears that all natural independance has been exchanged as the barter for social happiness so it is equally evident that in the perfection of a civil state combinations and confederacies must be encouraged and perfected and finally that in the conflict of opposite contentions the decisive weight and efficient force of party must depend on its disciplined submission to the control of one common leader  nor let it be objected that the avowed hostilities of party may in the present times provoke a closer union of ministerialists than might otherwise subsist among so divided a body  it is true indeed there is a gloomy cloud of discord and dissension that overspreads those common foes of opposition and of their country  auspicious may it prove and happy be the presage of their dispersion and their ruin  but let it not inspire a sanguine and premature confidence which by relaxing the ardour of pursuit may in the end defeat our hopes and rob us of the glorious object of all our toils  besides at this crisis there are those who are yet free to choose their political line  and if properly incited what doubt can long remain in favor of which they will decide  is not the support of ministry but another term for meanness and venality are not opposition and party the very echoes of virtue and genius the former is indeed a phalanx of baseness  the latter the sacred league of wisdom and of honor  if then the lists of parliamentary fame must be martialed for the combat who is there can a moment hesitate what arms to wield whence the champion should begin his bold career or what is the enterprise his courage should atchieve to win the immortal guerdon of renown  minions of power yours be the inglorious task in tinsel pomp and flimsey pride to wave your silken banners in the sunshine of a courtly pageant  labor and vigilance and patience are the badge of all the patriot tribe  but reputation is the palm  and if they perish in the cause of liberty welcome be the stroke that consecrates their doom with more than martyrs glory and transmits their fame from age to age with undiminished honor  answer though nothing is more certain than that public spirit is equally abhorrent from credulous adherence or cowardly indecision yet to define the precise limits of either extreme would be to renew the commonest of all commonplace theories  it may be more useful to state a few points admitted by the disputants on both sides  it is allowed then that fixed principles and general maxims should be the established guides of all bodies of men whose office it is to act together  this conformity is restricted however to opinions though it naturally inclines to a consistence in public conduct  but leagues and confederacies founded on private attachments only lead to mean and degrading subservience for more personal association is little better than conspiracyhence to desire a body of english gentlemen who are chosen by the nation to consult deliberate and then determine to herd at once under any individual leader and follow wherever he calls is equally absurd and insolent  it must be repeated however that established principles and unequivocal maxims are great and proper guides  to act consistently with them is sense and honor  how contradictory to this system are the language and the conduct of opposition  i boast myself a partyman and therefore will oppose the minister are the very words perpetually repeated in the house of commons by the greatest advocates of minority  thus the badge and livery of faction are ostentatiously displayed on one side of the house  on the opposite ask one of the equivocal politicians how he means to act and he will answer you and with perfect honor that he is no partyman but will freely tell you his general principles and avow his former line of conduct  and so far forth he acts up to the spirit of the constitution  but if afterward his conduct is a desertion of those principles and totally inconsistent with what he himself declares it to have formerly been if in short it is evasive shuffling and mean if he hangs aloof in the lobby takes an impartial dinner in the adjoining coffeehouses or happens unluckily to be called out on very particular business just before the division and then sails up and down the passages cruises in the committeerooms bears away for the court of requests or steers directly home in his coach with his light out then indeed the previous acknowledgment of his former principles and conduct is equally useless and ridiculous and he must be content to rank in future with those homehollanders or domestic dutchmen whose cold ungrateful caution and armed neutrality is nearly as pernicious and far more despicable than the bolder hostilities of open enmity  the last campaign and general state of the nation after the ruinous experience of a ten years war the moment is arrived when a new parliament are to deliberate and determine on the expediency of prosecuting or relinquishing of accomplishing or abandoning american subjugation  let the last campaign and the present state of the nation be the fair and substantial grounds of argument to decide upon this extensive and important question  first then as to the latte campaign it is apparent to the whole world that the daring spirit of enterprise which once distinguished the councils and elevated the valor of this country above her ancient enemies is now fatally changed to cold and ignominious caution to narrow and temporary prudence  it is no longer conquest or death  it is lingering shame and protracted disgrace  that fleet which once commanded the homage of nations is become now the object of pity or contempt  those arms that for ages snatched uncertainty from fortune are at length the splendid pageant of defensive pride and wasteful inactivity  on the contrary what is the situation of our enemies in both these respects  to the accident of an epidemical disease alone it is owing that count destaign at the head of the combined fleets did not drive us from the channel  yet the moment he had steered from spain by the ignorance and folly of our admiralty and the miserable meanness of the convoys two of the most valuable fleets that ever sailed from this country were instantly capturd to the aggrandizement and glory of our enemies to the disgrace and ruin of ourselves  in the west indies such is the decided superiority of the french and spaniards that it may be boldly predicted jamaica must immediately be the victim of spanish avarice and halifax become the support and resource of the ambition of france nor have their arms been less successful by land monsieur de ternay is in complete possession of rhode island an acquisition in itself fatally accommodated to impede every enterprise of england but still more ruinous by facilitating and hastening the entire loss of canada  unlike the slight and single advantage which has been dearly acquired by our army and which indeed will too probably become more ruinous to this country that its fatal surrender or captivity could possibly have proved by madly encouraging the further prosecution of destructive temerity and by deluding the giddy unthinking multitude to a longer endurance of this accursed war  such being the comparative state of the last campaign let us in the next place consider the situation of continental politics  commodore johnstone has been driven from portugal  that nation is crouching to spain  there is an officer in the house of commons who may be appealed to to tell his experience of the duplicity and meanness of portugal  indeed the conduct of portugal is now but a proper return for our additional impositions on her trade as well as the unparalled audacity of seizing american vessels laden with her produce  it is a similar perfidy that has provoked the resentment of all the nothern nations  the portuguese are not more our enemies than the russians the swedes the danes and the dutch  turks jews and infidels conspire to drive us from the mediteranean  with our trade our possessions also in those seas must inevitably perish  minorca cannot long escape gibraltar was saved last year by an experiment and preserved only by the indolence of spain  a ridiculous embassy indeed has been secretly undertaken and the literary west indian translated to the spanish friar  but while political credulity consults its delphic oracle or weakly trusts the visionary hope of a congenial rebellion in south america our vigilant and determined enemies are somewhat more seriously employed  france has sent troops to holland and the dutch must be compelled to go to war with us  in short the whole continent of europe is united in one common and equal league against this devoted country  to oppose so powerful a confederacy what are our resources  there are none that the ablest financier could invent sufficient to contend with the whole world but the nation is already exhausted and ruined  the spirit of commerce is for ever annihilated by our recent irreparable calamities nor can the most adventuring industry any longer confide in the despicable conductors of our naval strength to hazard any new enterprise  but supposing the possibility that added burdens of imposts and taxes could be explored what force have we to oppose the matchless superiority of our enemies  young undisciplined regiments must be sent to baneful climates while our old establishments are confined at home and excellent officers are either necessarily detained with them or insolently superseded by adventurers without a claim or pretension to so dangerous an innovation  and this too while the commander in chief in america calls for new supplies of men which it is impossible to provide and yet without which those already there must be totally ineffectual  such is our miserable inability in arms resources officers and men to continue this ruinous destructive desolating war against america against the world  what is our situation at home  a settled gloom of discontent  the petitions of the people for a while gave place to more immediate and pressing objects  but let not the authors of national ruin exult in secure tranquillity  the momentary calm may yet be succeeded by tempests that shall overwhelm them in misery and destruction  and if the most shameless corruption if an accumulation of injuries and insults can awaken us to a just feeling of our wrongs it will be easy to discover and meritorious to employ the most effectual means of redressing them  every lenient and peaceable method has long been pursued in vain  authority has been entreated with submission haughtiness has been soothed with humility profligacy has been tempted to reformation by allurement of pardon and even by the prospect of praise  that weight and authority which from the chair of office turned the scale of debate and with liberal and disinterested magnanimity supported the petitions will now be exerted though not with equal dignity yet with superior force to give effect to those principles which it so liberally avowed  our only remaining hope is in the union of disinterested and independent spirits throughout the kingdom such an union directed to one view and pressing to one object will not easily be resisted by the arms of power or frustrated by the arts of corruption  answer such is the gloomy and exaggerated picture of our national distresses  such are the pretenses for cowardly despondency for weak contemptible desertion of all our interests and of all our hopes and for a rash and giddy subservience to that fatal spirit of innovation in the pursuit of improvements we never may obtain and to the risque of calamities which we may never remedy  but it is not now the question whether a season of external danger and hostility is the fittest for new arrangements of internal polity  when it was seen with what industry and activity the same set of men were busied in running from one country to another in private intrigue and public incitement in dictating where they had no property and canvassing where they had no connexious impartial men were led to suspect that the independent and respectable part of the confederacy far from being the real contrivers were but the ostensible authors of the farce of reformation  to erect new assemblies unknown to the constitution which they purposed to reform and paramount to the legislature which they professed to supplicate was a system as suspicious in its motive as alarming in its tendency  a legislature insulted and menaced became the object of factious insolence from every desperate cabal  even opposition themselves who had first instilled into the minds of men a contempt of order felt in their turn the miseries of lawless uproar and lamented the mischiefs they had produced  it shall not therefore be the present enquiry whether the worst and most ruinous situation that fancy can imagine could justify a wild licentious anarchy at home  it is a far plainer and more limited enquiry whether the present is in any degree that ruinous crisis which by extirpating every present hope throws us at once on the unprincipled and profligate violence of theoretic enterprise and speculative despair or rather whether we may not still preserve our expectations still sustain our spirit and confide both in our national resources and the courage of our people to reestablish our welfare and regain that respect and consequence in europe which the generous spirit of england has ever entitled her to maintain as the protectress of liberty and the arbitress of continental freedom  it is a glaring proof of the inconsistency of opposition that at the same moment when the complicated concerns of so extensive a system are exaggerated with every fanciful aggravation the impolicy of a defensive war should be grafted on the former proposition  to have maintained an equality at least against combined hostilities does not appear to merit the imputation of ignorance so repeatedly thrown upon that department to which the conduct of our navy is entrusted  it is stated as a providential escape that count destaign by the epidemical sickness of his armament was prevented from entering the british channel  but on the contrary that calamity was indeed in its effects a national misfortune to great britain  for nothing but sickness could have checked the rash presumption and impetuosity of that commander from hazarding an action for which our fleet was perfectly prepared and which too as it was impossible to be foreseen became the accidental cause of those very captures which are injuriously stated as the effects of rashness and ignorance in our admiralty  it is clear however that convoys can only be protections against resistance of an inferior kind  it is impossible to provide a convoy for every inward and outwardbound fleet sufficient to defeat the combined fleets of france and spain  nor indeed were grand fleets ever directed against mercantile fleets except in those cases where as in the present instance their greater operations had been absolutely prevented by sickness and other accidents equally unforeseen by both parties  whether an implicit reliance must be paid to those illomened predictions which menace ruin and desolation to our foreign possessions from the enemies fleets abroad must remain a doubt  it will always be remembered that two years have already elapsed since that period when the same prophets of opposition so peremptorily foretold the absolute impossibility of continuing the war for one year longer  with equal solemnity however the loss of canada is predicted from the terrors of a french proclamation joined to the evidence of monsieur de ternays possession of rhode island  but however mysterious the former may be little stress can be laid on the latter for the weakness of the americans in the desertion of an island to their insidious protectors is a very strange proof of english cowardice in surrendering a whole continent which they have gained with glory preserved with humanity and are resolute to defend to the last extremity it must be remembered that admiral graves sailed after the french squadron and arrived at rhode island much about the same time as monsieur de ternay had been admitted there but since that arrival of the english fleet the french have remained totaly inactive we have the superiority and they havent dared to fight indeed the french assistance is far more calculated to support the spirit of party there than to form an expectation of cooperating where they will always disagree  but if at length the french should determine to make north america the seat of war we certainly may as well fight them there as any where else  we can but lose america at last  and they themselves gain nothing but blows and losses  yet in contrast to this pacific resignation to monsieur de ternay is lord cornwalliss victory compared by those who consider surrenders glorious and victories ruinous  happy had it been for this country if military wisdom had been exerted in this as in the last war to justify and immortalize valor not to depreciate achievements which indeed are the decisive condemnation of those who disparage them  if such a principle is once admitted that defeat and ruin will be our real advantage it would overturn every spirited exertion to obtain a favorable peace by demonstrating every new acquisition to be a motive for submission every gallant and honorable enterprise a ground of tame acquiescence to degradation and disgrace  it would rob heroism of its best reward and convert victory and triumph to a mere quibbling paradox of debasement and infamy  but with the same policy the misfortunes of our continental situation are exaggerated and proclaimed it is admitted to be too plain a truth that far less hopes can be entertained from a rebellion in the spanish colonies than were confidently cherished in england upon the first idea of american resistance  the spanish colonists want indeed the main force and decisive stress of insurgency and rebellion  they want a south american party in spain to countenance their disaffection to exalt their profligacy to pronounce in a senate the eulogiums of their leaders to distract the national councils in their support to menace the legislature in their defense to sympathize with their sufferings and to triumph in their success  but as to portugal it is a subject of double grief that to establish the perfidy of that state a military officer once gloriously engaged in its defense should now be the tame witness not the gallant avenger of ingratitude and falsehood  in fact the the learned commodore was very much courted by the portuguese nor will that people ever actually quarrel with those whom every commercial interest has fixed their best and surest allies  the extreme of danger that political prediction can menace is the loss of minorca which however has always been retained as a point of honor rather than as a necessary possession  when we are at peace gibralter is sufficient for the mediterranean trade and when at war we have none at all  as to holland the dutch have too great a property in our funds to assist in destroying our settlements abroad  nor is it possible that the northern powers of europe can consider it their interest to overturn a nation to which some of them almost owe their existence others their preservation from the jealousy of the house of bourbon and all have derived a generous liberal mediation and protection  great britain that formerly established holland can now resist any similar confederacy and in this glorious struggle if she does not ultimately secure a more firm independance she has already maintained at least an equality of strength every where and has vanquished her enemies whenever they have ventured to contend with her  her situation in point of defense is better and becoming still more so every hour  both our army and navy are greater in number and better in discipline and order than ever they were  wherever fleets and armies have been sent ours have pursued them  it has always been the rule to fend the newraised regiments abroad in time of war because the few we retain at home should lead and be an example to the militia in case of invasion but to add new force to the national armaments there is no boundary to the spirit readiness and exertion of individuals at home to support the dignity and the rights of this country  in one or two instances such singular zeal has called for uncommon honors and in those extraordinary cases alone for a limited time and for a specific service those gentlemen who have hazarded their property and lives for the public safety without any condition of rank or emolument for themselves subsequent to such service have been raised to temporary rank  the complaint of our resources has constantly been repeated when we have actually found them most efficient  ten millions were raised last year almost in the course of a day nearly as much the year before our revenues are improved the sinkingfund is certainly increasing  war has hitherto produced no immediate distress to the state and creates a more general circulation than peace  the captures indeed are an exception  but let opposition explain these effects of their jealous dissatisfaction against the profits of individual contractors who formerly conducted the whole business and periods of sailing for our mercantile fleets  but the navyboard having undertaken it of late and in the midst of more complicated operations the consequence has been that too many of the convoys of transports with stores men and provisions have failed  the former effected the business well being well paid for it  the latter have done it ill because they are not paid at all  in such a situation the sense the spirit of this country will still persevere in a just and honorable cause  the happy appearance of returning loyalty in the southern colonies with the certainty of their resources being cut off joined to the gallantry of lord cornwalliss expedition up the chesapeak bay give the fairest presage of connecting also the submission of the northern colonies  the former are most important to us because they are more productive and the inhabitants more naturally inclined to us  with such prospects therefore the weak murmurs of domestic disaffection will be despised  the tyranny of that monster association will only be a rule to its own miserable vassals  the independent countrygentlemen who have seen the baneful effects of this fatal spirit in that county where it first arose will guard against the specious impostures of so dangerous an innovation  they who in return for a hasty and misplaced confidence received every contumelious and insulting reproach will act with more caution in avoiding those plausible pretenses which involve the most fatal consequences  the little ill that followed in that instance will hence be productive of the greatest good every independent character will now be no longer alarmed by association or insulted by instructions but persevere in that bold decided manly firmness that has ever been the surest guardian of the rights and liberties of great britain  miscellaneous eloquence or collateral rhetoric for the gallery in a mixed government like ours public speaking has a sort of relative analogy to the compound structure of our constitution and to the different orders of which it is composed thus the highest and most exalted rank possesses a proud preeminence of phraseology evidently characteristic of its sovereignty and excellence while the second degree preserves a kind of equipoise in style which by a due mixture of dignity with plainness denotes its intermediate balance in the scale of legislative eloquence  but chiefly in the third estate it is peculiarly necessary that the stream of rhetoric should have certain particles of popularity perpetually floating on its surface as testimonies of the parent source and fountain from which it springs  upon this system analogous principles might be formed for the respective oratory of the several degrees  at present however a few documents only shall be suggested for the particular application of this principle to the rhetoric of the house of commons more especially to that truly constitutional part of it occasionally addressed to the strangers in the gallery whose good report as it is indeed the brief and abstract chronicle of parliamentary fame it becomes peculiarly prudent as well as honorable to obtain  in general then as to the mode of exercising this miscellaneous eloquence with most ease and efficacy it may be fairly laid down that all eminent and projecting sentences all pointed and epigrammatic quibbles all metaphorical menaces violent tropes forced figures and glaring ornaments are well calculated to rouse the attention and hitch upon the memory of the gallery  these like the emphasis of italics in printing summon the too negligent and careless mind to pay a proper attention to many choice and curious researches intimately connected with the other matter but which might otherwise perish from their refinement or irretrievably slip bye unnoticed  but one of the more certain and secure resources of miscellaneous rhetoric and which i prefer mentioning from its double illustration of precept and example is that conciliating respect which some popular orators more directly pay the gallery in downright acknowledgment of the respectable appearance of its company on important occasions  this condescending recognition as it well deserves indeed generally meets with a proper return and it is pleasing to observe how wonderfully attentive the whole body of strangers become at the first mention of this general respectability  on some late occasions this idea has been carried somewhat too far for there have not been wanting certain popular orators who politely withheld their arguments after each division and avowedly stopped all business till the readmission of the audience  this however though uncommonly handsome is dangerous as it may give a handle to some moody malignant mutes for the absolute exclusion of all interlopers on debate  but it will always be good to prepare and scatter as occasion offers some promiscuous panegyrics of nearly the same though not absolutely so direct a tendency  for example  that in a constitution like ours every thinking man has a natural interest in public debate which it is tyrannical to abridge or violate  or that it becomes all wise and cautious constituents to hear in order to judge of their representatives  or again that it is no small consolation in the present aweful crisis to find a general diffusion of public vigilance and anxiety disseminated among all ranks and orders of men and more particularly in the present numerous and respectable appearance  these and all others of the same kind properly accompanied by submissive tones modulated breaks in the voice and collateral attitudes of respectful inclination toward the gallery scarcely ever fail of awakening the grateful attention and sometimes dormant curiosity of the strangers especially at such times as they have painfully and patriotically persevered to combat both fatigue and appetite in hourly expectation of collecting some scattered scraps of mutilated eloquence for their own private or domestic consumption at the lycaeum or belle assemblee  but in this species of miscellaneous eloquence the effect is comparatively weak and contemptible considered with others that are founded upon the same principle  those already mentioned can only be scattered occasionally in the exordiums and some episodical parts of an oration  the latter and more efficient class must take their station in the peroration and declamatory close of prolix speeches as a corpse dereserve to support and reinforce the main body of argument after the harder service of the day  these ought chiefly to consist of some very new and deep theory abstract and metaphysical and calculated to give an idea of the originality extent and boldness of its authors mind which by connecting so many ingredients of sublimity tends to inspire a sort of awe for such preeminence of genius and to create a confused notion that this inventive wildness if it could but be applied to the more serious business of politics would with equal brilliancy strike out fresh systems of calculation explore new resources of finance and produce unheard of wonders and revolutions in all the complicated concerns of political enterprise  as this description may serve to convey some idea of the last and highest style of miscellaneous rhetoric it will be sufficient to elucidate the principle by a single example on a subject too not wholly untouched in the last session  universal whiggism  which is the better adapted for the proposed illustration from its uniting wildness sublimity invention originality and a proper degree of extravagance together with various other requisites equally necessary for the perfection of this species of eloquence  well has it been imagined that every human entity has universal fixed and innate ideas from the first infused in every created soul common to all  equal to all  perfect to all  as perfect to the savage in his cave as to an englishman in the senate  thus has universal nature endowed the whole stock of human race with equal and impartial powers to receive and to enjoy the perfect completion of universal rights those rights which our first thoughts inspire and which are unalienably the pride and passion of man the rights of universal whiggism  to dispense and perfect these vast original blessings to the whole world at large was the great work reserved for our own times and for our own country  now then let every nation and people of the earth confederate in one universal crusade to rescue these sacred birth rights from barbarous violation  the spirit of liberty is gone forth  her voice is the universal language of mankind  let it be heard in the echoed thunder of the world  till universal whiggism incorporate with human nature and blend its essence with the soul  answer if the form of these essays did not call for some comments on each subject no answer would be attempted to such indisputable truths as are contained in the foregoing documents  a very few words will be offered on this occasion rather as additions than amendments  it is apparent that in the several precepts for miscellaneous eloquence there is least novelty in those of the first mentioned class touching the direct or collateral appeals to the judgment and the taste of the gallery most of which every judicious critic will immediately discover to be closely copied from the higher models of this collateral rhetoric exhibited by the professors of our modern drama wherein it is invariably the custom to overcharge particular passages as attractive appeals to their gallery also which when properly given as the actors phrase it tell most surprizingly  but it must be remembered that much of the success in both case depends on a curious interspersion of these brilliances so as to relieve the heavier masses and sustain due proportions of light and shade  for rhetorical flowers must be disposed and mingled with a studious delicacy of arrangement and interweave their blended beauties in just contrast to the coarser texture of more substantial argument  thus to adapt our expressions to the subject in some parts of the rhetorical groundwork small seedlings of little violettropes should seem to fearfully revoke even the minuter elegance they so faintly disclose  while in others more fullblown metaphors may diffuse their roseat luxuriance and prodigally extend both stem and foliage among the thorny sweetbriars of irony or entwining knots of syllogistic woodbine  with these also there should occasionally be interspersed some brighter ornaments of wit like the spangles of the pattern to variegate the silken sentences of persuasion and set them off with more dazzling decoration  as to the latter and far more original division of miscellaneous eloquence though something it must be owned of its baser kind is equally observable in the fustiantags and finales of our more ancient tragedies and on the same plan too of leaving a good impression on the gallery yet it is certainly in its true nature and perfect state most completely sublime and in the exemplified instance defective only in its unaccountably narrow and restricted limitation to this world alone when with equal ease and efficacy it might and ought to be extended not only to the inhabitants of our own moon and other lunatic countries but also to every nation and people in the whole planetary system so that in any great congress of astronomical worlds universal whiggism should as certainly be the ruling principle of the delegates of jupiters satellites as a whigpresident must be deputed by the constituents of saturns ring  it is only necessary therefore to add that the respect for this kind of gigantic rhetoric will be greatly enhanced by a proportionable elocution and action to justify and grace its magnificence  for here though the figures are intentionally dilated and monstrous and the coloring systematically overcharged like those of cupola paintings yet to the ignorant auditor above the rhetoric of the former will seem as natural and just as the symmetry of the latter appears exact and proportionable to the stupid gazer below  for the eye and the ear are equally delighted and deceived in both the one and the other case  in the delivery therefore of these rhetorical caricatures all that can be requisite to complete their effect is to accompany them by congenial degrees of violence and vehemence in expression and deportment or in short that the gestures and elocution of the orator who pronounces them may somewhat resemble those of a furious feugleman or a fanatic in a frenzy  change the ministry as most of the writers who have treated of the english constitution particularly those of foreign countries very ingeniously prove that a revolution is necessary once a century to renovate its spirit so in order to proportionably purify our interior government the ministry by a fair and equable calculation should undergo a change once at least if not much oftner in the course of every ten years  more or less degrees of this principle of mutability are incident to all bodies natural or politic and universally tend to renew their genuine force and purity  but if this theory had never before been applied to the administrations of this country surely the present ministers and the present times would be admitted as irrefragable arguments in favor of that national supplication which now universally prevails for the dismission of a ruinous ministry and the substitution of a virtuous opposition  this national demand is grounded on principles as plain as they ought to be decisive namely that the present ministry are the sole and original causes of that fatal source of all our miseries the american war and on the contrary that opposition have from the first moment unanimously reprobated the policy and with uniform consistency ever afterward condemned the principle of colonytaxation  such is the plain broad basis of that national supplication to change the present ruinous and execrated ministers  a supplication which every district of this country has not only united to enforce but more distinctly promoted with peculiar wisdom in the late honorable delegation of its best and greatest supporters the members of westminster and surrey unawed by the menaces uncorrupted by the odious influence of prerogative  to this national supplication for the dismission of the present flagitious ministers the substitution of their virtuous opposers is by necessary implication inseparably connected  but if the public virtues of that patriot band have not sufficiently stamped the justice of their claims on every english heart let cooler and more deliberate judgment trace their higher title to preeminence of station in unrivaled superiority of genius in unparallelled excellence of education let their habits studies and private virtues all exercised with undissipated attention to advance the public good all directed to the enrichment of their fellowcitizens the diminution of national expense and the promotion of justice probity and honor be at once the plainest and surest proofs of their disinterested views as well as the best pledges of their future upright and honest conduct  answer to this great and most important of all questions this cause and end of all logic argument and eloquence this attractive power to whose magnetic force all the lightest or weightiest bodies of reasoning must irresistably gravitate with mixed sensations of regret and satisfaction we are at length arrived  here should every specious deduction and every established proof be equally admitted both from the advocates who attack and the witnesses who defend the cause of administration  here should each slightest particle of evidence each minute and shadowy distinction of opinion be fairly and impartially deposited in that golden balance which evenhanded justice should suspend and poise to weigh the doubtful conflict of political warfare  but to assist at such a trial would be far too solemn too laborious for profaner pens  it is a task that may be consigned with far greater security to the busy zeal and persevering patience of polemical politicians  a hasty and imperfect answer to the foregoing argument shall conclude these slighter toils  it must be owned then that the philosophy of ministerial changes is worthy the solidity of its foreign theorists  it seems indeed very closely borrowed from the parisian vicissitudes of fashion dress and even furniture for the respective seasons  on so accommodating a system many fanciful varieties might be practiced to variegate successive administrations which with that view might be quarterly and composed of more decided characters for the two greater divisions of the year and a kind of demisaison statesmen for the lesser  this would give an impartial rotation to all sorts of parties and by a just adaption of dispositions and tempers analogous to their successive periods might produce the happiest and most extraordinary effects  for young adventuring politicians might sow the principles of a scheme in the spring administration which when cultivated and matured by coalitions of the summer and autumnal ministries would finally produce the richest fruits to be treasured and dispensed by the colder caution and wintry wisdom of more experienced counselors but after all changes of ministry are neither as sudden nor as easy as changes of weather or changes of scenery at a play house  and as the principle of mutability was not much insisted on it will be fairer to recur to the more serious and material substance of the argument  the petitions  and the two other great points  the origin of our troubles  and the consistency of opposition  to these it may be briefly answered that if it can possibly be proved that one of the petitions was not invented framed and circulated by those gentlemen whose appointment and elevation they severally dictate the truth of them all shall be universally admitted  but on the contrary if the whole pile of them was raised fabricated and supported by one and the same set of men for one and the same purpose the force of their evidence will not be much relied on  next as to the origin of the war it is sufficient to repeat that trite truth  the stamp act was not the work of the present ministry and in respect to the uniform resistance to the principle of american subordination the equally selfevident proposition must always be remembered that to opposition alone are we indebted for that absolute and universal claim to it the declaratory law  two most trite refutations of the two tritest of all charges which however as indisputably disprove the imputed delinquency on the one side as they absolutely overthrow the ridiculous claim to consistency on the other  but with regard indeed to the great criterion of national opinion the two popular elections certainly much stress is wisely and justly laid upon that point  nor would it prove an unpleasing task for some advocate of opposition to draw an exact parallel in the manner of plutarch between the four triumphant candidates wherein it would as evidently appear that the two admirals who severally share these domestic honors are not more precisely alike in principles and conduct than the two statesmen also of the same elections resemble each other in high birth exalted genius cultivated taste sound reasoning strict honor and undamped fortitude  which close and mathematical consideration of the several relative proportions of merit thus mutually compared in their respective parallels must not only demonstrate the exact correspondence of their reciprocal excellencies and therefore by fair consequence the truth and justice of declaring these two elections a common and equal standard of national opinion but also at once overthrow every cavilling notion that may arise of their rediculous dissimilitude and establish them for the whole succeeding session of parliament as the great political parallellogram of public spirit  it may however be unnecessary to continue much longer the mysterious insinuation of influence so industriously circulated preparatory to these boasted triumphs  at the moment it might have been judicious nay possibly necessary to lean on this popular argument  but to continue it might now appear unworthy the gallantry and spirit of its author if not too like the fretful resource of disappointed pride  when the tempest had dissevered the good old vessel despair might fly to any refuge  the gilded lion at the head was then no longer to be upheld by romantic enthusiasm as the glittering sign and splendid presage of victory distress and danger had destroyed all fanciful respect and exhausted sinking strength caught at that majestic ruin which faithful even to its debaser elevated and supported the very hand that selfishly depressed it  it has had its use  performed its service  let it be no longer exposed and dragged about for low mockery and insolent profanation but generously and gratefully laid up like a votive tablet in the temple of neptune the consecrated record of unhopedfor refuge  it remains only to say a few words on the last and powerful argument for the change of ministry namely the decisive superiority of abilities on the part of opposition  this favorite common place so perpetually and so modestly urged might lead to personal parallels of all others the most invidious as well as disputable  on this question every man must judge for himself  all that shall be said here  is this that it must indeed be a much more infinite superiority of talent than frequently occurs in the scale of human understanding that can at once render the qualifications of any set of men who are comparatively unconversant with official business or at least not equally versed of late years in political negociations foreign or domestic so supremely superexcellent to those of others some of whom have been literally educated in office others passed the greatest part of their lives in foreign embassies of complicated concern with the ablest and purest reputation and all are perfectly equal to their competitors in every advantage of rank and situation  to this the thousand declamatory common place replies of practiced fraud veteran subtlety and professional treachery as they may be easily imagined shall be silently despised  certainly there are individuals in opposition of most extensive and possibly unequalled understanding the accession of whose abilities would give luster to public council and be indeed almost a national blessing  but if the miserable appendages of party must for ever fix their ponderous and oppressive influence on talents formed for free and bold aspiring then may their perverted excellence be justly pronounced the ruin of their country and while to vulgar observation this luminous and malignant prodigy this splendid but baneful portent scatters terror and amazement by every more thinking mind it will at once be wondered at and lamented admired and deplored  for preeminence of genius becomes doubly pernicious by the abuse of its own superiority and the contaminating degradation of the faculties of others and is indeed both in effect and by example  the decay of a whole age  finis
