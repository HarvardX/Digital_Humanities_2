the harmony and agreement of the collects epistles and gospels as they stand in the book of common prayer from the first sunday in advent to the last sunday after trinity  in which is shown from the first sunday in advent to trinitysunday what relation they bear to their respective times and seasons and from trinitysunday to advent how they agree with each other  proper to be bound up with the common prayer and looked into every sunday and holyday herein taken notice of and compared with the collect epistle and gospel of the day  by henry bourne m a curate of allhallows in newcastle upon tyne  they are ignorant who do not and obstinate who will not understand the wisdom of the church so fitly disposing of the epistles and gospels as that often the one may serve for a commentary to the other boys epist and gosp newcastle upon tyne printed by john white for the author and sold by mr bryson in newcastle mr waghorn in durham and by the booksellers in london and york mdccxxvii  to granville wheler esquire sir the labors of study of whatsoever kind they are do naturally choose their proper patrons there will be always some excelling in every sort of knowledge to whom the various parts of learning will be more justly adapted  as then every part of the common prayer speaks the breathings of the greatest of saints the earliest antiquity and the soundest faith so a treatise on any part of it will be most suitably patronized by a lover of our church and a practiser of her doctrines by one skilled in her offices and unshaken in her faith i hope therefore you will excuse the freedom of a dedication since the nature of this performance calls for your protection of it  or whether you are considered as sprung from a great ornament of our church from one learned in antiquity truly orthodox primitive in his example and holy in his life or whether as you are allied to that noble family which gives examples to the world of the earliest virtue and a lasting piety of veneration for the church and esteem for her clergy of such as rejoice in doing good works to the one and deeds of hospitality to the other your right to this treatise is not a little strengthened  but when together with these i reflect on your placing me in your friendship and familiarity and the many kind and affectionate offices you have done me you will easily pardon my choice as it affords me so just a patron and gives me an opportunity of somewhat acknowledging your many favors to  sir your most obliged and most humble servant henry bourne  the preface the design of the following pages is to show the relation the collects epistles and gospels from the first sunday in advent till trinitysunday have to their respective times and seasons and what connection and agreement every collect epistle and gospel for the sundays after trinity till advent have among themselves and this i hope may be of some service not only as it is exceedingly delightful to the mind to consider the order and fitness and harmony of these offices but as it will make them have that esteem and regard paid them they justly deserve as it will speak clearly the wisdom of the church in so compiling them as it will instruct in a due knowledge of times and seasons and make them be a more reasonable service than they usually are with the most of people  bishop sparrow and mr wheatley in their excellent treatises of the common prayer have both of them treated of this in the sundays before trinity but then what they have wrote on this subject is lodged in a book which is not easily got by those who will reap the greatest benefit from a work of this nature i have therefore considered in as narrow a compass as i conveniently could both the offices before and after trinity in the manner above mentioned and this i have done not only from such hints and passages of the moderns particularly the two great men abovementioned as give any but also from the ancient ritualists  i hope it will be no fault that it comes after so many much more valuable and learned treatises on the common prayer as it aims at nothing more than the instruction of the ignorant in this part of it which as far as i know has not hitherto been so published as to be of service to them  of advent the word advent signifies coming and is appropriated to the time preceding christmas hug a san vict lib   c   to commemorate that time in which the messiah was so much expected and also to prepare us for his coming in the flesh for this season is to christmassday what john the baptist was to our lord a forerunner and preparer of the way  it is observable that the church in celebrating the most remarkable histories of our saviors life and death has followed the order they were done in and placed them answerable to their respective times thus she commemorates his nativity before his death and his death before his resurrection and ascension and this is the reason why the office of our lords advent precedes the other offices of the church viz because his coming in the flesh was prior to all the transactions the other offices were compiled of and as by the advent of our lord there was a renovation of things agreeable to that of st john rev xxi    behold i make all things new so the church in honor of his advent begins her year of offices at the time of renovation  this advent lies in four weeks though as the ritualists tell us these four weeks are never held entire the church say they has set these apart to denote and point out the fourfold coming of christ and that the last is christmasseve they say is no part of advent and therefore the last week is never complete incomplete because when he makes his last appearance the glory of his saints shall have no end the first week say they of this holy season represents to us his coming in the flesh of which it was said mat xxi hosanna to the son of david blessed is he that comes in the name of the lord the second denotes his coming and descent into the hearts of the faithful of which it is said john xiv we will come unto him and make our abode with him and of which also that in the prophet relates to habb ii though it tarry wait for it because it will surely come it will not tarry the third signifies his third advent which is in the hour of death to which that of st james relates be ye also patient stablish your hearts for the coming of the lord draws nigh the fourth is an emblem of his last coming when he shall come in majesty to judge the world of which it is said in the propet isai iii the lord will enter into judgment with the ancients of his people  thus the church delineates these four comings of our savior in her setting apart the four weeks of these seasons though it is observable in her offices appointed for them she only commemorates two of them viz his coming in the flesh and his coming to judgment for his coming in the flesh and his coming into the hearts of good men are in effect but one coming as are also his coming at the hour of death and in the day of judgment  of the collects the collects are most of them of great antiquity as is evident from many authorities they are so called either microl c   because the priest that officiated collected into them the devotions of the people or as being used upon the peoples being collected or gathered together or as others think and with greater probability because of their being chiefly collected from the epistles and gospels but however this be they are the breathings of the holiest times and have been used by the best of men and must therefore be acknowledged of great benefit and advantage  of the epistles and gospels the epistles and gospels are of equal antiquity with the collects and are ranged in an admirable order following each other in a natural series of things and expressing the history of the season they relate to they are divided as the year is into two parts the one beginning at advent and ending at trinity sunday the other then beginning and ending at advent the former shows us the example of our lord the latter instructs us how to follow his example  the first sunday in advent the collect for this day is taken out of the epistle and gospel and has a twofold view the one to remind us of his coming in the flesh the other of his coming to judgment it therefore implores the grace of god that now in our saviors first advent when he came to visit us as the prophet intimates in the gospel in great humility we may so cast off the works of darkness mentioned in the epistle that at his second coming we may rise to the life of light and glory  the epistle is an exhortation to love which is in effect the fulfilling of the whole law and this it also excites us to from the present consideration of things that now it is high time to awake out of sleep the night is far spent the day is at hand which though first of all wrote by the apostle to the christian converts to shake off their sleep and drowsiness and excite them to vigilance and activity in the christian life and though the night here will undoubtedly signify the time of life in which we grope about and wander in darkness in comparison of that day we shall afterward behold cor i    when the vail shall be taken away and we shall no longer see through a glass darkly yet it also must remind us of the circumstances of the present season and bring into our minds that night which hung upon the world before our saviors coming and how it was dispelled and driven away by the dayspring from on high when then these words are read the night is far spent etc our hearts should be filled with joy and comfort for they should represent to us the worlds long lying in darkness that now the shadows are fleeing away and that the sun of righteousness is approaching that the nativity of the messiah the savior of the world is near  the gospel of our saviors riding to jerusalem has been the peculiar of this first sunday in advent microl de eccles obs c    from ancient times it seems indeed rather proper for palm sunday which was the day he made this journey on to his passion and is accordingly used by some churches but yet when we consider the words blessed is he that comes in the name of the lord hosanna in the highest i e blessed be his coming in the flesh for which is due the greatest hosannahs we may see manisestly its harmony to the season in the bish spar rat dur lib   c   opinion of both the ancient and moderns and also how agreeable it is to the epistle which tells us now is our salvation near the day is at hand etc  the second sunday in advent the collect is taken out of the epistle which mentions that whatever things were written aforetime were written for our learning that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope and therefore it says a little after as it is written and so mentions some prophecies relating to our saviors first coming into the world the collect therefore will appear very suitable for the time if it be considered as a petition to god that we may receive all coll his holy world and at this season that part of it in particular which prophesies of our lords first coming into the world that me may be fpist comforted by it and ever hold fast the blessed epist hope of everlasting life  the epistle treats of our lords first advent and in a particular manner how he came to save us of the gentile world and mentions some prophecies relating to us that we may be comforted by them and epist glorify god for his mercy as first that in the   th psalm for this cause i will confess to the among the gentiles and sing praises unto thy name and that in deuteronomy the xxxii rejoice ye gentiles with his people and again psalm the cxvii praise him all ye gentiles and laud him all ye people and lastly isaiah in his xi chapter says there shall be a root of jesse and he that shall rise to reign over the gentiles in him shall the gentiles trust  the gospel treats of our lords second coming to judge the world as the epistle did of his first coming into it which may teach us that those men who will not receive the first coming of their savior will be compelled to acknowledge him at his second they who will not epist confess to him among the gentiles shall have gosp hearts failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth at the day of judgment but on the contrary epist they who are filled with all joy and peace in believing and abound in hope through the power of the holy ghost when gosp these things begin to come to pass they shall look up and lift up their heads because their redemption draws nigh  thus the church in this days office prepares us for the first coming of our lord by threatening us with the terrors of his second by assuring us we must bear the troubles of that evilday if we answer not the end and design of our saviors first coming by leading holy and religious lives  the third sunday in advent this week being the last of the four seasons or ember weeks set apart by the church for the dedicating of the seasons to god and imploring his blessing upon the ordinations then performed the church has made the collect suitable to this occasion not that she forgets our saviors first advent but along with it takes notice of the practice of this season  the collect is taken out of the epistle and gospel and is a petition to our lord that epist the ministers and stewards of his mysteries may in like manner gosp prepare his way against his coming to judgment as gosp his messenger at his first coming prepared it before him  the epistle treats of the ministers of gods word and of our saviors second advent showing the dignity of their office and how wrong it is in the world to throw its censures upon them as is frequently done that they should be left to the judgment of the lord who when he comes the second time to mat xviii take an account of his servants will render to every one according to their works  the gospel treats of our saviors first coming and gives us the history of johns sending two of his disciples to him who were to learn from himself whether it was he that should come or they were to look for another this the baptist did not to satisfy any doubt of his own for he was perfectly convinced of the truth of our saviors mission but that as he was shortly to leave the world his disciples who were not as yet fully satisfied might be convinced and become his disciples  the close of this gospel behold i send my messenger etc seems to have been the chief reason of the churchs using this gospel at this season that it might teach us that the way of the lord was to be prepared by his messenger and that therefore we must expect this messenger before the lord himself come  the character our savior gives of john of his constancy in the faith and his austerity of life makes the gospel also answerable to the ember season  the fourth sunday in advent the collect prays for christs coming and succor in a most ardent manner that the sins and wickedness which stop us in our christian race may be removed through grace and mercy the consequents of our saviors coming in the flesh  the epistle does as it were point out the coming of our lord not as at a distance but in have and immediately the lord is at hand how seasonably therefore does it advise us to rejoice in the lord as it were exhorting us to be cheerful because of the messiahs near and speedy coming into the world  as the gospel of the last sunday told us of the messenger who should prepare the way before our lords coming so the present gospel shows us this messenger in the exercise of his errand in an actual preparation for christs coming and making straight the way of the lord and these words there stands one among you whom ye know not he it is who coming etc are very agreeable to the season they do all but bring the messiah and as the epistle tells us that he is at hand so here the gospel tells us as it were that his manifestation is so near that he is even just now among us but we know him not yet which is answering exactly the nearness of this sunday to christmassday before which time we knew him not  christmassday he whom we have been expecting in this season of advent and whom the offices of that season spoke of as coming has now really come and appeared in the world and therefore the offices speak no longer of a state of expectancy but of a state of fruition they speak not of him as coming but really come  the collect mentions him as born at this time and prays that we may be regenerated and made the children of god by adoption and grace and be daily renewed by the holy spirit which are the benefits of christs birth  the epistle speaks of his being actually come into the world and assures us that in these last days god has spoken unto us by his son  the gospel also answers the season as it speaks of our saviors being come into the world he was in the world and he came unto his own  saint stephens day there are several reasons given for the placing of this and the two following festivals in the order they now stand immediately after christs nativity and before the rest of the saints the most probable of which seems to be this as our lord in his gospel says if any man will come after me let him take up his cross and follow me so it has pleased the wisdom of the church that those who took up their cross and followed him by martyrdom should be first in his retinue now there are three sorts of martyrdom one in will and in deed another in will not in deed the other in deed not in will saint stephens martyrdom being therefore the first and highest of those it has deservedly the first place after our savior yesterday says st austin we celebrated the birth day of the king of martyrs born in the world and to day the first of martyrs going out of the world it was fit the immortal should first take upon him flesh for mortals that so the mortal might despise death for the immortal the lord was therefore born to die for his servant that the servant might not fear to die for his lord christ was born in earth that stephen might be born in heaven  the collect acknowledging with the martyr of the day the divinity of our lord prays to him in imitation of the martyr that in all our sufferings here for the testimony of the truth we may with him look up steadfastly into heaven and by faith behold the glory which shall be revealed and being filled with the holy ghost as he was we may learn from him to pray for our persecutors to our lord who stands at the right hand of god as he saw him to succor those who suffer for him  the epistle is the story of stephens martyrdom  the gospel is very suitable to the occasion as it mentions our saviors prophecy of the treatment that his followers should have among the jews especially as it speaks of their stoneing them which were sent unto them and in instancing chron ii xxiv    zacharias who was stoned to death and as it also makes mention of abel who was the protomartyr of the old testament as st stephen was of the new  saint johns day the festival of st john stands next to that of st stephen because his martyrdom was next in kind to that of st stephens that is he was a martyr in will though not in deed for he was miraculously delivered from the caldron of boiling oil which he was thrown into at rome coming out without any maim or hurt  the collect from the light mentioned in the epistle prays for the illumination of the church that it may be enlightened by the mysterious doctrines of the apostle of this day and so walk in that light as at last to obtain that light which we are told in the epistle is god  the epistle mentions the doctrine of this holy apostle and evangelist which the collect prays the church may be enlightened by viz the doctrine of our lords divinity which he so sublimely treats of in his gospel beginning it in the same manner he begins the present epistle it was the handling of this lofty doctrine that made him be compared to an eagle flying within the clouds beyond the narrow sight of men and for which also he has the peculiar character of john the divine  the gospel is that famous passage where our savior answers the curiosity of peter about the death of john if i will that he tarry till i come what is that to thee follow thou me which though some of them interpreted that john therefore should not die yet we have both the word of john himself which teaches us that jesus said not unto him he shall not die but if i will that he tarry till i come what is that to thee and also ecclesiastical history assuring us that he did die for he died twentyeight years after our lord came to destroy the city jerusalem which is the coming spoken of in the gospel  the innocents day next to the feast of st john stands the day of the holy innocents their martyrdom being that of the last kind a martyrdom in deed not in will they showed not forth the praise of the lord in speaking but in dying for him for for his sake and in his stead were they slain thus beautifully and wisely are these festivals placed after the birth of christ they answer as it were the churchs description of him in the canticles cant v  0 my beloved is white and ruddy and the chiefest among ten thousand for he is white in the chastity and purity of john ruddy in the blood of stephen and the chiefest among ten thousand by the suffering innocents  the collect prays god who out of the mouths of babes and sucklings have ordained strength and made the infants of bethlehem to give him glory by their deaths to mortify in us all vices that we may have the innocence of this days martyrs and be so strengthened with his grace that if called upon to suffer we may be constant in the faith even to death and so may glorify his holy name  the epistle is no doubt a description of the whole church in christ but yet there are several things in it suitable to this occasion as it describes in particular the martyrs of the day for it says these are they which are not defiled with women for they are virgins these were redeemed from among men being the first fruits unto god and to the lamb and in their mouth was found no guile for they were without fault before the throne of god  the gospel gives the history of josephs flight into egypt with our lord and the murdering of the children of bethlehem  the sunday after christmas it was usual in the primitive times for some part of the offices of great festivals to be repeated every day till the octave or eighth day after which was the last day of its being repeated and the end of the festival the church therefore in imitation of this ancient custom has the collect of christmassday for this day also which generally falls within the octave of christmas bishop sparrow tells us the observation of octaves is done out of honor to the feast and that greater solemnities have some days after them to continue the memory of them  the reason of their being lengthened to eight days is taken from the jews who observed some of their higher festivals for the amar gor lib   c    same number of days it being thought by the primitive church that those jewish feasts which were only the shadow should by no means exceed their feasts which were the substance  but according to others there rupert de divin offic lib   c   b juon carnot sermon de circum etc is a mystical meaning in the observation of octaves and that is that the octave is an emblem of the mystical eight day which is the day of the resurrection for as on that day we shall return to our former innocence so the church as an emblem of it repeats on the octave and the days between the festival and it some of the first days office thereby teaching us that if we continue in the worship of god after being regenerated by baptism we shall on the octave of the resurrection after the seven days of our life have passed away return to our first purity and holiness  the epitle treats of our saviors birth and mentions the advantages accruing to us from thence that whereas before the church of god like an heir under age differed nothing from a servant being burdened with ceremonies and the observations of the law it was now by the coming of his son arrived at maturity and freed from those encumbrances so that its members are no more servants but sons and heirs of god through christ  the church seems to have chosen this epistle with a view to our saviors infancy for the heir under age differing nothing from a servant though he be lord of all is no obscure or mean remembrancer of our saviors condition at this time heb i who was appointed heir of all things and phil ii   yet took upon him the form of a servant though he acts x    was lord of all  the gospel also treats of our saviors birth and is an explication of gods epist sending forth his son made of a woman when the fullness of time was come for it relates to the human nature of our lord as that of christmassday does to the divine  the circumcisions of christ this day though the octave of christmassday isidor c  0 de eccl offic was formerly observed a fast by the church because of those sports and abominable customs practiced on it by the heathen in honor of their god janus afterward it was changed into the feast of the circumcision it being the day from the nativity of our lord and therefore the day on which he was circumcised according to the command given to abraham genesis xvii    he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you  the collect is a petition to god that as he made his own son to be circumcised so he would grant us the circumcision of the spirit which is the cutting off from our hearts and members all worldly lusts that as our lord by the circumcision of the flesh was obedient to the law so we by the circumcision of the spirit may be obedient to his will  the epistle also is very suitable to the festival as it shows who they are that are the blessed of god whether those of the circumcision or those of the uncircumcision that those who follow the faith of our father abraham which he had yet being uncircumcised will have righteousness imputed unto them as he had and be numbered among the blessed though they are not of the circumcision  the gospel is also very proper for the occasion which as it mentions the circumcising of the child after eight days is exactly suitable to the feast of the circumcision  of the epiphany this day is called by the church the epiphany which in greek signifies manifestation it is called in our common prayer book particularly the manifestation of christ to the gentiles because on this day our lord was manifested to the gentile world by the appearing of a star to the wise men in the east that they might be conducted to worship their savior  the collect is very suitable and full of devotion and begs of god who by a star manifested his son jesus to the gentiles to grant us after this life the fruition of himself whom we only know now by faith  the epistle answers the nature of the season and tells us that the gentiles should be fellow heirs and of the same body and partakers of his promise in christ by the gospel and that st paul preached among the gentiles the unsearchble riches of christ  the gospel is the history of the stars appearing to the wise men in the east and how it guided them to the place where our savior was  but this is not the only manifestation which the church commemorates this day there are other two besides one the manifestation of the most glorious trinity at his baptism the other that of his own divinity when he turned the water into wine at the marriage of cana in gallilee the first of these the church commemorates in the second lesson at morning prayer and the latter in the second lesson at evening the reason why the church celebrates these three manifestations on this day of the epiphany is because they all happened upon this same day durand lib   de fest ep though in different years  the first sunday after the epiphany the collect prays that we may have a right knowledge of our duty and sufficient strength to perform it  the epistle mentions the things the collect prays for and is first an exhortation to mortification and chastity  dly to the renewing of our minds and thereby in effect to hope prayer and obedience  dly to unity as we are members one of another now these three things are the virtues pointed out to us by the wise mens offerings the myrrh they offered signifies the first the incense they offered signifies the second and the gold they offered signifies the third how suitable then is this epistle to this season for in the gospel for the epiphany we have the wise men making their offerings and in this epistle for the sunday following we are exhorted to imitate them  the gospel of this day is also very suitable to the season for as this sunday is the next after the epiphany so the first memorable action we meet with of our savior in his younger years is this of his coming up to jerusasalem at twelve years of age and disputing with the jewish doctors at comber in catechis thirteen years of age the jews were wont to bring their children to the house of god there to be publicly examined and being then approved they were then declared to be children of the precept that is obliged to keep the law and whereas our savior came up at twelve years old it was because of his pregnancy according to that saying of the rabbis the ingenious do run before the command  it is observalbe that as from christmas to epiphany the church in her offices sets forth christs humanity so from the epiphany to septuagesima she sets forth his divinity in the present gospel it is manifested when he says to his mother wist ye not that i must be about my fathers business for he says in another place all things that the father has are mine and therefore he attests that in the same manner the temple belonged to his father it belonged to him bed in dom post epiph  the second sunday after the epiphany the collect having acknowledged god who wrought the miracle in the gospel to be the governor of all things in heaven and earth prays that the would mercifully hear the supplications of his people and grant them that peace all the days of their life which the epistle puts them into the method of acquiring  the epistle also is conformable to our saviors goodness in the gospel and advises us to a right use of the gifts god has bestowed on us of whatsoever kind they be that we should not keep them to our selves but make them of service and advantage to others that we should be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love and of the same mind one toward another  the gospel gives us and example of our saviors goodness in supplying the wants and necessities of others by his turning the water into wine it is used on this day as being the history of our saviors first miracle and therefore what most naturally follows his going up to jerusalem and because also it manifests as is observed above the sundays after the epiphany do manifest the divinity of our lord for it is only in the power of god to change the nature of things  the third sunday after the epiphany the collect considering the mercy of our lord in the gospel desires god mercifully to look upon our infirmities and from his gosp putting forth his hand to cleanse the leper it prays that he would be pleased to stretch forth his right hand to defend us in dangers and help us in necessities  durand in domin   post epiph the epistle though at first sight it seems not any way agreeable to the gospel yet if taken in the mystical sense will appear very suitable to it for as the gospel relates our saviors cure of the leper so the epistle tells us how we may prevent the leprosy of sin be not wise in your own conceits will teach us how to prevent the leprosy of pride and recompense to no man evil for evil how we may not be infected with envy and malice  the gospel is the history of our lords curing the leper and the centurions servant who was sick of the palsy it seems to have been pitched upon as suitable after our lords epiphany as being a clear manifestation of his divinity in the cure of the leper he showed forth his almighty power and in curing the other at a distance he gave an undeniable proof of his omnipresence  the fourth sunday after the epiphany the collect is founded upon the gospel and because we are set as were the disciples of our lord amidst waves and storms and since through the weakness of our nature we often as they did imagine we perish it therefore prays god to support us in all dangers and carry us through all temptations as our lord supported his disciples in the midst of seas and tempests  the epistle if rightly considered is not nsuitable to the gospel it speaks the power f christ upon earth by his ministers as the gospel does that of his own word upon the ea and as by the later he asswages the winds and waves and makes a great calm so by the ormer he asswages the swelling waves of a empestuous world and becalms and quiets he madness of the people  the gospel seems to have been chosen or this season because it is a manifestation of our saviors divinity his commanding of the winds and seas speaks him to be no other than he at whose word the stormy wind arises and steth up the waves thereof and who makes the storm to cease so that the waves thereof are still  the fifth sunday after the epiphany the collect prays for such holy men as are mentioned in the epistle for the merciful and meek and charitable which constitute the church and household of god  the epistle exhorts us to be part of that household by putting on the bowels of mercy and kindness and above all charity which is the very bond of perfectness  the gospel under a parable mentions the last manifestation or epiphany of our savior viz his coming to judgment when the tares will be burnt but the wheat gathered into the barn the angels who are here called the reapers shall at the time of harvest or at the end of the world gather together the tares which are the emblems of the wicked that they may be burnt but they shall gather the wheat that is just men into gods barn to the general assembly of the first born where these   iv    they shall ever be with the lord  the collect then of this day prays for the safety of good men the epistle advises us to be of their number and the gospel shows the greatness of their reward  the sixth sunday after the epiphany wheatley com prayer the collect epistle and gospel for this sunday were all added at the last review till when if there happened to be six sundays after the epiphany the collect epistle and gospel for the fifth sunday was repeated the office therefore for this sunday is of the same nature with that of the last and treats of our saviors last epiphany when he comes to judge the quick and the dead  the collect desires god in the words of the epistle whose son was manifested to destroy the works of the devil and make us the sons of god that having this hope we may purify our selves even as he is pure and that when our lord shall appear in the power and great glory mentioned in the gospel we may enjoy what the epistle tells us will be the portion of good men viz to be made like unto him in his eternal and glorious kingdom  the epistle very suitably to the season of the epiphany mentions our saviors first mafestation and tells us he was manifested to destroy the works of the devil and it also very suitably as this is the last sunday after the epiphany in conformity to the gospel takes notice of our saviors last appearance and tells us we shall then be like him and see him as he is  the gospel treats of the last epiphany of our savior and is therefore very fitly adapted to this sunday it being as it was just now observed in the epistle the last sunday after the epiphany the collect prays that we may be with him in his kingdom the epistle shows that if we would see him as he is we must purify our selves etc the gospel opens the scene of the day of judgment and our lords last epiphany and shows that those the collect prays for and the epistle gives advice to will be gathered together by the angels from the four winds from the one end of heaven to the other  septuagesima sunday there are many reasons given by the roman ritualists for the names of this and the two following sundays the most probable of which seems both to them and others to be propter consequentiam numerandi for the fin sunday in lent being called quadragesima because it is about forty days from easter the sunday before is called quinquagesima because quinquagesima is the next round number abo quadragesima and so in like manner the ther two sundays as they are still further rmoved from easter so they answer to the ne great numbers and are therefore called sexgesima and septuagesima  the design of the church in setting ap this time was to prepare her members for  lent fast and therefore former the dur in septuag regulars began to fast after septuagesima the greeks after sexgesima the clergy after quinquagesima and  whole christian church on ash wednesday  the collect very seasonably prays to be dlivered from sin and punishment which we  never be freed from without the struggles a hardships of mortification  the epistle therefore persuades us  the exercise of the duties of the christian li which are here represented to us under the na of a race teaching us that as they who str for the mastery in a race are temperate in  things so should we be in all our conversation we should keep under our body and bring  into subjection by acts of penance and mortification if we would receive the prize here mentioned the incorruptible crown  the gospel assures us that the rewar is not to be acquired without labor that the toil of the christian life is absolutely necessary to the gaining of the heavenly and that without our cross we shall wear no crown if we stand idle in the marketplace all the day long we have no wages to expect in the evening but if we labor in the vineyard we shall receive our penny  sexagesima sunday the collect is a prayer to god for his aid and assistance in all dangers and adversities that we may be supported by his power as was the apostle st paul in all the adversities the epistle mentions  the epistle before persuades us to the duty of penance and austerity and the present epistle gives us a noble example for our imitation that of the sufferings of the great st paul who by having in him that trust which the collect mentions surmounted the greatest of dangers and bravely underwent the most mortifying penance he suffered stripes and imprisonment and deaths often he was beaten and stoned and suffered shipwreck a night and a day he had been in the deep in a word he endured the greatest hardships of earth and sea nor were his voluntary sufferings much inferior he was more abundant in labors than others in journeying often in weariness and painfulness in watchings and fastings often in cold and nakedness  the gospel is the parable of the sower and answers of the epistle in telling us the dangers we are in when we neglect the duties the apostle st paul was so eminent an example of for it is observable that the seed fell in four places and brought forth but in one which as it intimates to us that scarce one in four attain salvation so it lets us plainly see the necessity of mortification especially when it tells us that they on the good ground bring forth fruit with patience the higher they rise in piety the greater will be their trials the nearer they are to heaven the greater are their temptations but luke xxi in their patience they possess their soulds till acts xiv through much tribulation they enter into the kingdom of god  quinquagesima sunday the collect for this sunday prays for the most excellent gift of charity which is so beautifully commended in the epistle  the epistle is very suitably chosen by the church for the two last sundays having proposed to our imitation in the coming lent some of the sublimest acts of mortification and given us one of the greatest examples of it she now treats of charity the very bond of peace and of all virtues to show us that all the doings of austerity and penance without charity are nothing worth  the gospel teaches us the story of the blind beggar to add to our charity faith that we may rightly perform the duties recommended to us spar rat for by faith our darkness is enlightened as the blind mans eyes were who wisely desired that he might see for in sight of god consists our happiness one of the ritualists observes that these three gospels are placed in a very rational order in septuagesima says he the vineyard is dressed in sexagesima the seed is sown and in quinquagesima the fruit of light is gathered the light of that place which needs no candle neither the light of the sun  ash wednesday the word lent in the saxon tongue signifies spring and because this time of fasting begins in the spring it therefore borrows its name from the season and is called lent  this fast is of such great antiquity that is seems to have been used from the days of the apostles it is of forty days continuance beginning at ash wednesday and ending at easterday the sundays excepted which were always festivals in memory of our saviors resurrection  the reason of its continuing forty days is because that forty days were of old the allowed and stated times of great fasts witness the fasts of moses and elias but the chief reason with us is that our savior fasted forty days  it always ends at easters to point out to us that as our saviors sufferings were done away at his resurrection so after the troubles of this life which are shadowed out by the time of lent we shall enjoy peace and rest and a glorious resurrection which are shadowed out to us by easter  this is called ash wednesday wheat com prayer from a custom in the ancient discipline the loss of which custom or godly discipline our church laments in her office for this day called the commination which began to be very early exercised on this day an account whereof we have in gratian as follows  on the first day of lent the penitents were to present themselves before the bishop clothed with sackcloth with naked feet and eyes turned to the ground and this was to be done in the presence of the principal clergy of the diocese who were to judge of the sincerity of their repentance these introduced them into the church where the bishop all in tears and the rest of the clergy repeated the seven penitential psalms then rising from prayers they threw ashes upon them and covered their heads with sackcloth and then with mournful sighs declared to them that as adam was thrown out of paradise so they must be thrown out of the church then the bishop commanded the officers to turn them out of the church doors and all the clergy followed after repeating that curse upon adam in the sweat of thy brows thou shall eat thy bread  the collect for this day prays that god would send us new and contrite hearts that we may lament our sins in a sincere and unfeigned manner and so obtain the pardon and remission of them  the portion of scripture for the epistle is taken out of the prophet joel and exhorts us to what the collect prays for viz to turn to the lord with all our hearts to fast and weep and mourn and to rent our hearts and then to rest assured that the god of all mercy will repent him of the evil and give us perfect remission and forgiveness  the gospel cautions us to be sorrowful in the manner the epistle mentions lest if we appear only with the external signs of sorrow we receive the reward of the hypocrites who only disfigure their faces that they may appear to men to fast it may also teach us that as we hope god will be merciful to us we should also be merciful to the poor by giving to them what we save by fasting if we do so we lay up treasure in heaven if not it is only treasure which the moth and rust does corrupt etc  the first sunday in lent the collect is a prayer to christ which shows the church believes him to be god it is very suitable to this season of fasting and abstinence and prays our lord that in imitation of his fasting forty days and forty nights we may by his grace use such abstinence as to subdue the flesh to the spirit and so ever obey his godly motions  the epistle exhorts us to patience in all things belonging to our spiritual warfare whether we be in afflictions in watchings in fastings or whatever condition else  the gospel is the history of our saviors being tempted and his conquest over temptations and is therefore highly suitable for our entrance on our spiritual combat in this season of lent our great day of battle as it emboldens and animates us with the hopes of victory against our spiritual enemies for we know in that he himself suffered and was tempted he is able to succor them which are tempted  the epistle and gospel are also not unsuitable to the there be four emberweeks called in latin jejunia quatuor temporum the fasts of the four seasons because they were kept in the four parts of the year spring summer autumn winter the first of these begins upon wednesday next after ash wednesday the  d upon wednesday next after whitsunday the  d upon wednesday next after holycross sept    the last upon wednesday next after st lucy dec    the days of fasting and prayers in those weeks are wednesday friday and saturday wednesday because then our lord was betrayed by judas friday because then he was crucified saturday because then we represent the apostles sorrows for the loss of their lord lying in the grave the causes of such religious fastings and prayers were formerly many as namely that christians in these religious duties might let the world know that they were as devout as the jews had formerly been whose custom it was to observe four solemn fasts zach    that they might dedicate to god as the first fruits the beginning of the several seasons of the year set a part to his religious worship and by this means obtain gods blessing upon them the remainders of those times but the principal cause was for preparation to the solemn ordination of ministers holy church imitating the apostles practice who when they were to set apart men to the ministry prayed and fasted before they laid on their hands act xiii   spar rat com pr emberweek beginning on this day the epistle shows how a minister should behave himself in his calling and the gospel what he must expect to meet with after he has entered on it no sooner did our savior enter on his public ministry than he was tempted of the devil and we know the servant is not greater than his lord  the second sunday in lent the collect after acknowledging from the petition of the woman in the gospel viz lord help me that we have no power of our selves to help our selves prays god that he would keep us outwardly in our bodies from all adversities and inwardly in our souls from all evil thoughts  the epistle exhorts us to avoid all uncleaness and be studious of holiness which is undoubtedly very fit advice at this season when we are more particularly assaulted both outwardly in our bodies and inwardly in our souls  the gospel put us into the method of obtaining what the epistle persuades us to by giving us the story of our lords curing the woman and canaans daughter that was vexed with a devil as she by her steady faith and earnest prayer crying have mercy on me o lord thou son of david and lord help me got the devil thrown out of her daughter so may we in like manner be disposessd of the uncle all spirit of lust and incontinence  the third sunday in lent the collect with a view to the finger of god and that stronger man mentioned in the gospel desires god to stretch forth the right hand of his majesty to be our defense against all our enemies  as the season of penance is thus far advanced the church is careful that her sons should not flag but rise in their piety and therefore the epistle does not only persuade us to avoid fornication and sins of a deeper color but even foolish talking and jesting which are not convenient both as they are unbecoming the gravity of this penitential season and are sinful in their own nature  the gospel confirms the advice of the epistle and endeavors after our continuance in our holy violences by showing us the danger of ii pet    falling from our own stedfastness and how needful it is for us to grow in grace for it assures us if the unclean spirit which has been once cast out of a man eater into him again the last state of that man is then worse than the first  this gospel as it aims at our keeping out the unclean spirit when he is once dispossessed is very fitly placed after that of the last sunday which shows us the way of getting him cast out  the fourth sunday in lent in the last sundays office the church laid before us the danger of lapsing from the austerities of the season and having now brought us to the this sunday is called midlentsunday middle of the thorny way of mortification she chears and comforts us with the end of our journey and the promise of refreshment lest we faint upon the road  the collect having acknowledged that for our evil deeds we worthily deserve to be punished prays god that we may mercifully be relieved by the comfort of his grace  the epistle encourages us to go on cheerfully in our holy penance and hardships as it tells us of the jerusalem which is above which is free from all these troubles and where we shall be relieved with everlasting comforts  the gospel tells of christs relieving the five thousand miraculously intimating to us that after the hunger we suffer here we shall be refreshed by our lord for blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled there is also another reason of this gospels being read at this time which see in the  th sunday after trinity  this sunday is also called dominica de panibus the sunday of the loaves or dominica refectionis the sunday of refreshment because it does not treat of mortification but tells of the heavenly jerusalem and that refreshment our savior will there give us mr wheatley says or perhaps it is so called from the first lesson in the morning which gives us the history of josephs entertaining his brethren and he adds that the appointment of the gospel and the first lesson for this day might probably give the first rise to a custom still retained in many parts of england and well known by the name of midlenting or mothering  the fifth sunday in lent this sunday is called passionsunday because as the ritualists tell us what the jews transacted on good friday was begun on yesterday evening from john ii that day it was that they took council together to put him to death and after this jesus walked no more openly among the jews till palm sunday on this sunday therefore is very justly celebrated the beginning of his passion durand in dom pass rup in dom pass which follows on good friday as a corpse after a pompous train of mourners  the collect prays that god of his mercy would preserve our bodies and souls  the epistle relates to our saviors passion and tells us of the benefit we have obtained by the shedding of his blood how he thereby entered into the holy place and obtained eternal redemption for us that we might receive the promise of eternal inheritance it very suitably rupert de div offic l   c   represents to us what is to come as it were at the day of our lords passion viz a dereliction of the old jewish priesthood by the mediator himself of the new covenant and the high priest of a new sacrifice  the gospel says bp sparrow treats of our lords being slandered by the jews which must needs be a thorn in his side and a part of his passion and some of the ritualists observe that this gospel in it is mystical meaning is somewhat answerable to the epistle for when it is said then took they up stones to cast at him it is added then jesus hid himself and went out of the temple by which is represented that truth is self was hid to them because they despised his words and that he had now forsaken the jewish temple and was as the epistle has it become an high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands and when our lord says in the gospel which of you convinces me of sin it is agreeable to that of st paul in the epistle that christ offered himself without spot to god  the sixth sunday in lent this sunday has the name of palm sunday because it was on this day our lord rode in triumph to jerusalem when the people took john xii    the branches of palm trees and went forth to meet him and cried hosanna blessed is the king of israel that comes in the name of the lord it was a custom in the ancient church to go in procession on this day bearing palms in their hands and it was also observed in our own till the reformation when it was abolished because of the superstitions attending it  the collect from these words in the epistle epist let this same mind be in you which was in christ jesus  who was made in the likeness of men and humbled himself and became obedient to death even the death of the cross prays god coll who sent our savior jesus christ to take upon him our flesh and to suffer death upon the cross that all mankind should follow the example of his great humility that he would mercifully grant that we may follow his example or epist be of the same mind with him and so partake of his resurrection  the epistle advises to what the collect prays for when it says let this same mind be in you which was in christ jesus that is do ye humble your selves as he did and so ye may be partakers as it were the sunday following of his resurrection  the gospel is the history of our saviors passion and gives us the particulars of what the epistle recommends to our imitation the gospel then shows our lords patience and sufferings the epistle persuades us to imitate them and the collect prays for gods assistance in following his example  this week is called the great the holy and the painful week the great as being that in which were transacted the great affairs of mans salvation the holy as being that which was spent in the exercise of prayer meditation frequenting the church stricter fasting then usual and greater actions of charity and the painful as being that in which our lord underwent such exceeding pains and tortures for the sins of the whole world our church comes as near as she can to the devotions of the ancient christians in this week of humiliation by setting apart for every day a particular service suitable to the occasion  the thursday before easter this day is called maundythursday from that new commandment our lord gave his disciples to love one another on this day he washed his disciples feet and therefore the second lesson for the morning is the history of that transaction on this day also he instituted the sacrament of his body and blood and therefore the epistle gives an account of that institution the gospel is very suitable being as the others the history of our saviors passion  this spar rat day the penitents that were put out of the church upon ash wednesday were received again into it for this reason chiefly because on this day our lord was apprehended and bound which binding wrought our deliverance and freedom  the form of reconciling penitents was in short this the bishop goes out to the doors of the church where the penitents lie prostrate upon the earth and thrice in the name of christ he calls them come come come ye children hearken to me i will teach you the fear of the lord then after he had prayed for them and admonished them he reconciles them and brings them into the church the penitents thus received trim their heads and beards and laying of their penitential weeds they recloath themselves in handsome apparel  the church doors were wont to be set open all this day to signify that penitent sinners coming from north or south or any quarter of the world shall be received to mercy and the churches favor  good friday this day is called good friday from the good we received o it viz the redemption of our souls by the death of our lord  it is to be observed with the strictest fasting though the passion of our lord was the cause of all our joy if dur i paras it be asked why we do so when the saints days are observed as feasts and right dear i the sight of the lord is the death of his saints and when the apostle st paul glories in the cross of christ i answer because he died for our sins as says the prophet isaiah for the transgressio of my people was he stricken we ought therefore to be sorrowful rather than joyous and fast rather than feast lest we be more obdurate tha the rocks themselves who rent at his passion  the church on this day prays god to look upon his family the church for which christ dyed to receive our prayers which we offer for all estates of men within it and to have mercy upon all jews turks infidels and heretics without it that they may be converted and saved dur ibid christ prayed not only for his friends but also for his enemies and therefore this day the church in imitation of him prays for all  the epistle shows the sacrifices under the jewish law incapable of attoning for the sins of men for it tells us it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins that those were only the shadow of good things to come and did but typifie the great sacrifice of our savior christ which he offered up this day for the sins of the whole world epist when god had no pleasure in burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin then said he lo i come in the volumn of the book it is written of me to do thy will o god  the rupert de divini offic lib   c   gospel for this day is not only taken out of st john because in order it follows the other evangelists it not having been wrote till after he returned from the isle of patmos where he was banished to and consequently wrote later than these of the other evangelists but also because he was present at the crucifixion whilst the other disciples were not for as he says of himself and as st jerome writes he being known to the high priest did therefore follow him with great confidence and stood by the cross for john xix    there stood by the cross of jesus his mother and his mothers sister and when jesus saw his mother and the disciple standing whom jesus loved he said unto his mother woman behold thy son then said he to that disciple behold thy mother and from that hour that disciple took her to his own home and a little after he says v    and he that saw it bear record and his record is true this gospel is therefore taken out of st john rather than the others because he was an eyewitness of the passion sparrow which example should teach us not to be ashamed nor afraid of the cross of christ  eastereve this day was observed in the ancient church as one of the strictest fasts in the year in memory of our saviors lying in the grave and the sorrow of the apstoles who when the bridegroom was taken away from them did fast in those days the church of england in imitation of that advises us also to a strict fast in private and calls us to the place of worship by the public office of the day to employ our selves in meditating on our saviors burial and descent into hell  the collect prays in a most moving and solemn manner that romans vi   as we are baptized into christs death so by continual mortifying our corrupt affections we romans vi   may be buried with him and not fear the grave but pass joyfully through it to our resurrection  the epistle treats of the descent of our saviors soul into hell that is into the mansions of holy souls where epist he went and preached unto the spirits in prison where by taylors antiq christ on the resur he communicated to them the mysteries of the gospel the secrets of the kingdom the things hidden from eternal ages and taught them to look up to the glories purchased by his passion and made the term of their expectation be his second coming and the object of their hope the glories of the beatifick vision  the gospel treats of our saviors body as the epistle does of his soul and is an account of his burial as the gospel of yesterday was of his death it tells us also of what happened after he was interred and ends in such a manner by telling us that they went and made the sepulcher sure sealing the stone and setting a watch that we leave reading it with heavy hearts and forced away as it were mourning from the sepulcher  easter day the word easter comes from the saxon word oster which signifies to rise or from the name of a goddess which the saxons worshipped at this time of the year called easter  it is the highest of festivals as bringing us the comfortable news of our lords and in due time of our own resurrection in the season before the church was in mourning and sorrow an emblem of the troubles of the present life but now on the day of her saviors resurrection the emblem of our future happiness in the kingdom of heaven she is in the compleatest joy whereas therefore it was always customary in the primitive times to be in sorrow for the season of lent especially in the holy week when they beheld the passion and bewailed at the cross and sat weeping by the sepulcher it was now usual to show tokens of the greatest joy and therefore their morning salutation was the lord is risen and the answer was the lord is risen indeed or and has appeared to simon in imitation of this our church begins her office of praise with salutations of the same nature christ our passover is sacrificed for us therefore let us keep the feast etc christ being raised from the dead dies no moe etc christ is risen from the dead and become etc  the collect having acknowledged that god through his son his conquered death and set open to us the heavens prays that the good desires of a joyful resurrection which are owing to his grace may by his continual help be brought to good effect  the epistle directs us how to obtain what the collect prays for when it advises us to mortify our members which are upon the earth and to set our affections on the things above for if we be risen with christ we must seek those things which are above  the gospel very suitably gives us the earliest account of his resurrection and mentions the first evidences of it  easter monday in the primitive times the feast of easter was solemnized even till whitsunday in honor of our lords resurrection afterward the whole week following was observed which our church approves of by appointing a preface in the communionoffice for eight days following though she has only appointed an epistle and gospel for the monday and tuesday  the epistle gives and account of our saviors resurrection from st peter who tells us that he was raised up the third day that he was seen of them whom god had chosen witnesses and that they eat and drank with him after his resurrection  this epistle is conveniently and judiciously placed before this gospel as it contains the words of peter who had the honor of seeing his lord before the two disciples or any of the apostles  the gospel is the history of what happened on the afternoon of our saviors resurrection viz his walking to emmaus with the two disciples and his discovering himself to them in the breaking of bread  easter tuesday this epistle also is an account of our lords resurrection from the mouth of peter showing as the epistle yesterday did that he was raised from the dead and that he was seen of them his witnesses many days  the gospel tells us what happened in the evening of our lords resurrection how when the disciples were come from emmaus jesus himself stood in the midst of them and says unto them peace be unto you  the first sunday after easter this sunday is called lowsunday because it is easter repeated spar rat the octave of easter but the sunday before is higheaster and this a lower feast loweaster  the collect prays for such purity and holiness as may entitle us to a share in our lords resurrection  the epistle advises those who are born of god or baptized into the faith of christ to overcome the world as they promised when they were baptized  the reason why the church chooses this epistle for this season is because it was proper for those who were baptized on the ancients had only two times of baptizing viz the eves of easter and whitsunday except in cases of necessity ber augiens c   eastereve who came to church every day in easterweek with these lights were an emblem of the ilumination they had acquired by baptism and the white vestures otherwise called chrisms were an emblem of their inward purity by baptism the vestures being laid aside this day gives if the name of dominica in albis or the sunday of saying aside the white vestures lights before them and clad in white vestures which they laid aside this day in the church that they might rise up in judgment against them if they afterward violated the faith they professed in their baptism this epistle therefore was very suitable as putting them in mind of what they promised  the gospel is answerable to the season and as the sunday is lowsunday or loweaster so it treats of our lords resurrection  the second sunday after easter durand in dom secu a pasch as by the resurrection not only the young and newly baptized were instructed but also the grown and the mature this sunday therefore treats of those who are arrived at maturity as the sunday before did of those who had not so far advanced it treats of the pastors of the church and shows them how they must follow the example of the lord as the other instructed the newborn christians how they should imitate christs resurrection by pureness and holiness of life  the collect from these words in the epistle because also christ suffered for us leaving us an example that we should follow his steps having acknowledged that god gave his only son to be unto us both a sacrifice for sin and also an example of a godly life prays god to send us his grace that we may be thankful for the benefit of his dying for us and may also follow his steps  the epistle shows to all the example of our lords patience and holiness that they may follow his steps for it tells us that he suffered for us that he was reviled that he bore our sins in is own body on the tree and it also shows us his manner of bearing sufferings he did no sin neither was any guile found in his mouth her viled not he threatened not but committed himself to him who judges righteously and so he suffered and took it patiently which was acceptable with god  the gospel in a more particular manner relates to the pastors and bishops of the church and sets before them our blessed lord the good shepherd for their imitation  the epistle and it are parallel in several places the gospel tells us that jesus is the good shepherd the epistle that he is the shepherd and bishop of our souls the gospel that he lays down his life for his sheep the epistle that he bore our sins in his own body on the tree the gospel shows the master foretelling that he has other sheep which are not of this fold and that them also he would bring and they should hear his voice and they should be one fold and one shepherd the epistle shows the servants fulfilling the prophecy of their lord when it says ye were as sheep going astray but are now returned unto the shepherd and bishop of your souls  the third sunday after easter it is observable that the collect and epistle of this day have a particular view to baptism which was undoubtedly to remind the newly baptized at easter what obligations they lay under to perform their duty  sparr rat microl c    the ancients were wont to observe an anniversary in commemoration of their baptism which was called pascha annotinum they that were baptized at easter the year before came the year following the same day to church and solemnly with oblations and other religious offices commemorated the anniversary day of their new birth though our church does not in every particular observe the same custom yet she draws near to the ancient practice in this solemn though general anniversary commemoration of baptism this day minding us all this day of our baptism and our vow made therein and praying to god to enable us all to keep it  the collect is very suitable to this commemoration of the church and prays god wh enlightens by baptism that all those who ha been admitted into the fellowship of christs religion or baptized into the faith of christ may perform the promises and vows made in their baptism  the epistle is also very suitable and persuades the newborn or those whom god has brought coll from error to the light of his truth to walk as childeren of light and to live up to what they vowed in their baptism epist by abstaining from the lusts of the flesh and having an honest conversation among the gentiles  the gospel is answerable to the season of our lords being in the world after his resurrection till the ascension a little while and ye shall not see me is to say in a little while i shall be laid in my grave and so be taken from your eyes and again a little while and ye shall see me is to say you shall see me again for a little while after my resurrection a little while and ye shall weep and lament for my death but after my resurrection your sorrow shall be turned into joy this gospel therefore should represent to us the joyfulness of this time by the joy the apostles had after our lord was risen  the fourth sunday after easter the collect considering that the epistle says every good and every perfect gift comes down from above etc and therefore that whatsoever good we do is owing to the gifts and will of god epist who of his own will begat the apostles with the word of truth that they might be a kind of first fruits of his creatures acknowledges god to be almighty and that he alone can order the unruly wills and affections of sinful men and then it prays that he would grant the like unto his people that they loving the things which he commands and desiring that which he does promise may have their hearts fixed upon such heavenly objects as redound to them from christs resurrection and the holy ghost the promised comforter  the epistle telling us that every good and perfect gift comes own from the father of lights does thereby teach us that the holyspirit and his blessed fruits are the gifts of god and comes down from him and as it tells us that god of his own will begat the apostles with the word of truth etc so it confirms the promise of christ to his apostles in this days gospel viz gosp when the spirit of truth was come he should guide them into all truth this epistle therefore is very suitable to this season in which we read the promise of the comforter  the gospel also is very suitable to this season of our lords going in and out for forty days among his disciples in the gospel before he tells them of his being with them a little while in the present gospel he tells them he must shortly go away to sent unto them the spirit of truth to guide them into all truth  the fifth sunday after easter this sunday has the name of rogation sunday and is so called because of the three days following it being set apart by the church as days of abstinence and putting up of rogations and litanies which are requests and supplications to god  the reason of this exercise at this time is that our hearts and minds may be the better prepared to ascend with christ the thursday following and that the fruits of the earth which at this time are young and tender may avoid being hurt that god would avert his judgments from them and let us enjoy them in due season  the collect observing in the gospel that whatsoever we ask the father in christs name we shall receive acknowledges that it is god from whom all good things come and then prays that he would send his holy ghost into our hearts that by his holy inspiration we may be purified with good thoughts and obtain strength and power to bring them to good effect  the epistle teaches us how we may obtain the comforter the collect prays for viz by being doers of the world and not hearers only for they who hear the word only are like the seed which fell upon the wayside on the rock and among the thorns which were trodden down withered away and choked but epist the doers of the word are sexag sun they which hear the word of god and keep it are the seed which fell on good ground which brings forth fruit with patience and therefore epist not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work shall be blessed in his deed or shall obtain the promised comforter  the gospel before acquaints us with our lords leaving the world and sending to us the comforter the present gospel shows us how we may obtain him ask and ye shall receive that your joy may be full this is therefore very suitable for the sunday before the ascension as it assures us that our lord did not ascend till he had promised us a comforter in his stead and showed us the way of obtaining the promise  the spar rat gospel is concerning rogations teaching us how to ask of god so as we may obtain and withal foretells his approaching ascension  the fast this week is voluntary for there is no fast commanded betwixt easter and whitsunday all that time being spent in joy on account of the lords resurrection  ascensionday the church having celebrated the resurrection of her savior does in a regular course of things come to his ascension she shows him telling hid disciples how he would be in the world a little while then talking of his going away then sending to us the comforter and lastly showing us the way and method of obtaining him and having thus celebrated these things in her gospels for each sunday she now celebrates the day of his ascension after all when he visibly ascended into the heavens with his humane nature after he had been with his disciples forty days upon earth  the collect prays that god would send us grace to imitate as much as we are able the ascension of our savior that as he really ascended in his humane nature so we may also ascend in our hearts and minds and dwell continually with him there  the epistle gives us a particular account of our lords ascension in the presence of his disciples how after he had been with them forty days he assembled them together and having assured them he would send them the comforter he ascended into heaven  the gospel also is the history of our lords ascension and tells us in a particular manner how he ascended into the heavens and when he came there that he sat down at the right hand of god  the sunday after ascensionday this week has the name of expectationweek because now the apostles expected the fulfilling of our saviors promise of the comforter if i go away i will send the comforter to you  the collect is very suitable to the season and in imitation of the condition the apostles were in at this time prays as the apostles may be supposed to have done that god would not leave us comfortless but send to us the holy ghost to comfort us and exalt us into the same place whither our savior christ is gone before  the epistle considering what the collect prays for viz that we may obtain the comforter and be exalted into the heavens shows us the way of obtaining both the one and the other if we be sober and watch unto prayer as it advises us following the examples of the apostles at this time gosp the comforter will come unto us according to what our lord himself tells us as it were a little before his ascension ask and ye shall receive durand in dominic pst ascens and by good works by charity and mercy which it also exhorts us to we may fly after our savior into the heavens as it were from the mount of olives  the gospel is the promise of the comforter which the epistle exhorts to pray for and which therefore our church does pray for in this days collect it is suitable to this time as it is the promise of the comforter the apostles were now expecting  whitsunday this day is called whitsunday because of that light the apostles were illuminated with by the descent of the holy ghost but it is chiefly so called because the new baptized were wont at this time to be clothed with white garments  it has the name of pentecost because there are fifty days between easter and whitsunday as it was fifty days between the passover and the jewish pentecost among the jews it was celebrated because the law was then given on mount sinai and among the christians because on this day the holy ghost was given to the church  the last sunday the church being as it were in expectation of the coming of the comforter prayed in the collect that god would send him but now the comforter being come she prays in this days collect that god would send her a true judgment in all things and everlasting joy in the comfort of that holy spirit  the epistle is the relation of the wonderful descent of the holy ghost upon the apostles on this day of pentecost when he sat upon each of them in the shape of cloven tongues like as of fire and gifted them with speaking in all languages the wonderful works of god  the gospel is very suitable for the festival as being our saviors promise of the comforter which the epistle tells us he sent down on his church on this day  monday in whitsunweek the collect is the same with that of yesterday it having been always customary in the week following any great festival to repeat some part of its office  this week is not celebrated quite through in a festival manner as was the week of easter the former part of it is only festival the latter part is east the former is festival because of the descent of the holy ghost and because also the church at this hugh de sanct vic in vg l peec season performed the office of baptism to converts but the later was spent in fasting because of the emberdays the wednesday friday and saturday following which were always observed a fast in conformity to the apostles fasting before ordination act xiii    as then the church at this season not only celebrates the descent of the holy ghost but likewise performed the solemn acts of baptism and ordination and also confirmation at this season so in her offices for the days attending this great festival she solemnizes the feast and commemorates the churchs practice  the epistle mentions the descent of the holy ghost upon the gentiles as peter was preaching to them and at the close it mentions baptism telling us how the gentiles were baptized in the name of the lord the epistle therefore is very agreeable to the season in which we commemorate both the descent of the holy spirit and the custom of the church of baptizing at this season and therefore it lays before the newly baptized the necessity of walking as children of light and believing in christ for he that believes shall not perish but has everlasting life but he that believes not is condemned already because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten son of god  tuesday in whitsunweek the epistle suitable to the custom of baptizing at this season and of confirming which was also now used is concerning baptism and confirmation and is also very proper for the practice of the church at the latter part of the week the time of fasting and praying for an holy and regular ministry it tells us therefore that when the apostles had heard that samaria had received the word of god they sent to them peter and john who when they had laid their hands on them they received the holy ghost philip had baptized them but being only in the inferior orders he could not give them confirmation which was the province of peter and john they being bishop or of the highest order we may see therefore how agreeable this is to the custom of ordaining at this time for it teaches us that there is a difference of orders because there is a difference of power philip could baptize but he could not confirm which shows that the power of ordaining being at least equally great with that of confirming can be lodged no where but in the bishop or the highest order this epistle then mentions baptism the descent of the holy ghost confirmation and lastly inferrs the validity of an episcopal ordination which is going to be performed at this time and so is highly suitable to the season  the gospel answerable to he emberweek and the ordination shows which are the lawfully appointed ministers of god which are not which are the shepherds of the sheep which are the thieves and robbers those who enter not into the sheepfold by christ who is the door and consequently by those whom christ sent as he himself was sent but climbeth up some other way are the thieves and robbers  trinitysunday this is called trinitysunday because on it is celebrated the festival of the holy trinity it is celebrated at this time as coming in at the close of the festivals which have been dedicated to the several persons of the godhead duran in dom san tr on the nativity is celebrated the festival of the father for the nativity is called the festival of the father on easter day the festival of the son and on whitsunday the festival of the holy ghost and therefore very fitly on this day in celebrated the feast of the trinity to show that those three persons are one god for as the church by observing these days separate to the persons in the ever bless trinity shows her faith in the unity in trinity so by the observation of this in particular she shows her faith in the trinity in unity another reason for observing this particular time for the celebration of this festival is because the lord had no sooner ascended into heaven and the holy ghost descended upon the church than the knowledge of the most glorious trinity became more conspicuous than ever it was before  the the collects of the book of common prayer may arm us with a compendious and ejaculatory prayer of the churchs composure pertinent to all occasions which may be of excellent use to those who desire to be always on their guard against the enemy of their souls thus on the third sunday after easter we pray for sincerity on ash wednesday for contrition on this day for a right and firm faith etc dr comber bishop fox the founder of corpus christi college in oxford obliges all his fellows to repeat this days collect every morning and evening of their whole life as a necessary part of their private devotions ex m s dr ellison collect prays to god that he would keep his servants in the steadfast confession of the true faith the unity in trinity and trinity in unity  this sunday in the ancient church having been the last of the days of baptism at this season of pentecost the rupert de offic sanct trinit epistle has relation to baptism particularly in that part of it and before the throne there was a sea of glass like to crystal which the ritualist says signifies the baptism of a pure confession and a solid faith but however it is still very fit for the season as having in it that angelical hymn holy holy holy lord god almighty which is it self a proof of the trinity in unity  the gospel also suitable to the custom of baptizing at this season of pentecost treats of baptism and shows the great necessity of it verily verily i say unto you except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of god which is exactly answerable to the epistle and is as much as to say that we must sail through the sea of glass there mentioned before we arrive at the port of happiness or enter into the kindom of god mentioned in the gospel but however though it answers the epistle so exactly in the custom of the church of baptizing at this season yet it is still very proper for this festival of the blessed trinity for the three persons of the godhead are mentioned in it in whose names the whole church is baptized  the first sunday after trinity the whole time from advent to trinitysunday having been chiefly spent in commemorating the most remarkable transactions of our saviors life and death the offices appointed by the church were always answerable to the occasion and having celebrated the mysteries of our redemption and proposed to our imitation the example of our lord she comes now in the offices from trinity sunday to advent to instruct us in our duty that we may follow rightly the example which has been given us the epistles and gospels therefore of the following sundays are instructive of an holy life teaching us the road of virtue and how we may avoid the byways of vice and though they are not suited to the sundays they were fixed to as the others before trinitysunday are to their respective seasons that being impracticable yet the office for each sunday has generally an agreeable harmony and fitness in itself the collect epistle and gospel having for the most part some likeness and analogy to one another  the collect considering from a view of the rich mans uncharitable behavior in the gospel coll the weakness of our mortal nature and therefore how of our selves coll we are able to do no good thing prays god that he would grant us the help of his grace that coll we may keep his commandments or the commandment of loving our brother mentioned in the epistle which will enable us to coll please god both in will and deed  the epistle tell us how god sent his son into the world that he was the propitiation for our sins and how after that he gave us of his spirit by which is mentioned in short the great acts of our redemptions viz our saviors brith and death and the coming of the holy ghost which by the way is very suitable for the first sunday after trinity from those acts of love and mercy it exhorts to charity which the rich man in the gospel wanted for the apostle argues if god so loved us we ought also to love one another and that we cannot love god but we must love our brother also that it is not enough to be holy in our desires and thoughts that we may coll please god in will but we must also be charitable to our brethren coll that we may please him in deed  the gospel is the parable of dives and lazarus which tells us the fate of the unmerciful and uncharitable and which therefore both deters us from that hatred and excites us to that love of our brethren mentioned in the epistle for whoever would avoid being in hell and in torments as dives was must not only not epist hate but love his brother also the collect then prays that we may be able to do good or deeds of charity the epistle excites us to this great duty by showing us the love of god toward us and the gospel threatens us with the flames of hell and everlasting death if we do it not  the second sunday after trinity the collect as it were from these words in the epistle and whatever we ask we receive of him because we keep his commandments etc having acknowledged that god never fails to help and govern those whom he brings up in his steadfast fear and love beseeches him to keep us under the protection of his good providence that we may have a perpetual fear and love of his holy name that by the former we may not dare to excuse our selves from the great supper mentioned in the gospel and may by the latter have grace readily to accept of the invitation  the epistle excites us to actions of charity and love to each other and to the love of god and therefore advises us out of the abundance and affluence of things god has bestowed on us to be merciful to our poor and indigent brethren in imitation as it were of the man in the gospel who brought into his supper the poor and the maimed and the halt and the blind for whos has this worlds good and sees his brother have need and shuts up his bowels of compassion from him how dwells the love of god in him it therefore advises us not to love our brethren in word neither in tongue as those loved god who excused themselves from the great supper but to love them in deed and in truth as god loved those he invited to it  the gospel is the parable of the great supper in which is represented the wonderful love of god to his indigent creatures in inviting them to the good things of his heavenly kingdom and the ingratitude of the sons of men in not accepting of them  the third sunday after trinity the collect considering that the epistle and gospel show that we are exposed to many and great dangers prays that we may be defended and comforted in all dangers and adversities  the epistle mentions what those dangers are and shows what is requisite to support us under them it tells us the dangers are the devil and his angels who walk about seeking whom they may devour and that by being humble sober and vigilant and by casting all our care upon god who cares for us we may be able to resist them  the gospel also under the parable of lost sheep shows us the dangers we are exposed to and that god cares for us when we are in them when the devil who is the roaring lion in the wilderness of this world finds one of the sheep of christ wandering and straying from the flock and not using that vigilance the epistle advises him to he immediately seizes him that he may devour him but jesus christ the good shepherd who cares for his sheep goes after that which is lost until he finds it and then sam i    delivers him out of the jaws of the lion and brings him back to the fold  the fourth sunday after trinity the collect seems from a view of the blind guides mentioned in the gospel to acknowledge god the protector of all that trust in him and to be him without whom nothing is strong nothing is holy and then considering the sufferings of this present world mentioned in the epistle and the danger of meeting with the blind guides in the gospel to carry us through them it prays god gosp our father which is merciful epist that he would increase and multiply upon us his mercy that instead of the guides in the gospel coll he would be our ruler and guide that we coll may so pass through things temporal that we finally lose not the things eternal or as the epistle has it that we may pass through the sufferings of this prefent world to the glory which shall be revealed  the epistle mentions the sufferings of the world and tells us that the whole creation nay even those who had the first fruits of the spirit groan and travel in pain together waiting for the manifestation of the sons of god and the redemption of the body  the gospel shows us the way of obtaining what the collect prays for if we would have god multiply upon us his mercy we must be merciful as he is merciful we must not judge nor condemn but we must forgive and we must be charitable and if we would have him to be coll our ruler and guide in passing through things temporal we must guard against blindguides who are leaders of the blind who together with those they lead fall both into the ditch and coll so finally lose the things eternal  the fifth sunday after trinity the collect is founded upon the epistle and gospel and begs of god the peace of the world that the church may serve him in joy and godly quietness  the epitle shows the method of acquiring what the collect prays for epist if we be all of one mind as were the partners in the gospel if as they did we epist love as brethren and are ready gosp to come and help each other if epist we be pitiful and courtous etc coll we shall keep the church in godly quietness but epist if we render evil for evil or railing for railing we shall occasion schisms and divisions and put the church into disorder and confusion  the gospel is the miracle of the draught of fishes when the lord entered into simons ship though they had toiled all the night and had taken nothing yet at his word they let down the net and when they had this done they enclosed a great multitude of fishes and their net brake beda dom   post trin corn a lapid in lor by the ship is represented to us the catholic church by the net the catholic faith and by the multitude of fishes the vast numbers of converts the apostles should bring over to the christian religion when they became fishers of men so that by the nets breaking with the multitude of fishes is represented to us how the faith of the church is rent and torn by heresies and schisms which the epistle cautions us and the collect prays against  the sixth sunday after trinity the collect prays for the love of god that by loving him above all things we may obtain his promises which exceed all that we can desire  the epistle tells us what these promises are and how we may acquire them it assures us we shall be planted into the likeness of christs resurection and that we shall live with him provided that we walk in newness of life and have destroyed the body of sin  the gospel also excites us to newness of life by commanding us not so much to regard what was said by them of old time as what our savior says unto us and as the epistle tells us that our old man is crucified with christ so the gospel tells us that our righteousness must exceed the righteousness of the scribes and pharisees or else we shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven or obtain the promises which exceed all that can be desired  the seventh sunday after trinity the collect having acknowledged god from a view of the miracle in the gospel to be the lord of all power and might and from our saviors compassion to the hungry multitude to be the giver of all good things prays god that he would graft in our hearts the love of his name increase in us true religion nourish us with all goodness and of his great mercy keep us in the same  the epistle persuades us to what the collect prays for and advices that we should turn from being the servants of sin to be the servants of righteousness that we may avoid the wages of sin which is death and obtain the gift of god which is eternal life through jesus christ our lord  the gospel is the miracle of our saviors feeding the four thousand with seven loaves and a few small fishes where we may observe upon what bottom the church in this days collect puts up her petitions by the staying of the people so long and their eager desire for the doctrine of christ she prays for the love of god and the increase of true religion and from the refreshment of the loaves she prays that we may be nourished with all goodness the ritualists tell us that those of the people who came from far are a representation of those who hunger and thirst after righteousness which they have so long fasted from and that therefore the epistle answers exactly in saying when ye were the servants of sin ye were freed from righteousness  boys in  th sunday after trinity christs miraculous feeding of many people with a few loaves is read in the church every year thrice to wit in winter when wheat is sown in lent when it is in hopeful spring and in harvest when it is ready for the barn the reason hereof is manifold  first that in sowing seeing and reaping our corn we might not ascribe this wonderful increase to the fatness of our land or greatness of our skill or goodness of our seed but only to the blessing of god ps clxxv    opening his hand and filling all things living with plentiousness who does every year make a great harvest of a few grains as he did here make a great feast of a few loaves   dly that we may be well assured of christs bounty toward all his followers hungring and thirsting after righteousness providing for them abundantly least they faint in their way   pet v   caring for such as cast their care upon him as he promised in his gospel first seek the kingdom of god and his righteousness and then all other things shall be ministered unto you   dly that we may learn to use these temporal blessings in thanksgivings to god in hospitality toward the poor feeding such as have nothing to eat in frugality taking up the broken meat not suffering any of gods good creatures unprofitably to be spoiled or wastfully to be cast away  the eighth sunday after trinity the collect prays that god would put away from us all hurtful things and give us such things as are profitable to our salvation  the epistle shows what is hurtful and what is profitable that it is hurtful to live after the flesh and profitable through the spirit to mortify the deeds of the body because if we live after the flesh we shall die but if through the spirit we mortify the deeds of the body we shall live  the gospel is careful that we be not drawn away  to live after the flesh by false prophets epist it therefore bids us beware of them and then tells us how we may know them in disguise you shall know them by their fruits that is you shall find that they epist live inwardly after the flesh though outwardly by a seeming continence chastity and fasting they appear to epist mortify the deeds of the body and then agreeable to the epistle which says that they which live after the flesh shall die it also deters from such a life and conversation by mentioning the punishment due viz that they shall be cast into the fire  the ninth sunday after trinity the collect considering the fate of the israelites in the epistle and how we are there advised to take heed lest we also fall epist and how the steward in the gospel was turned out of his stewardship for unjustly managing the things he was entrusted with prays god that he would send us coll his spirit to do always such things as be rightful that we who cannot do any thing that is good without him more than could the israelites in the epistle when they fell from their own steadfastness or the steward in the gospel when he became unjust may by him be enabled to live according to his will  the epistle shows the necessity of our being assisted by gods spirit coll to do always such things as he rightful the israelites had obtained many blessings and tasted of the coll good things of god but when they epist lusted after evil things became idolaters fornicators etc and gods spirit forsook them they were overthrown in the wilderness wherefore let him that thinks he stands take heed lest he fall  the gospel also teaches us that the spirit of god is always necessary to keep us in coll doing these things that be rightful whilst the steward walked in the spirit he was faithful to his lord but when he ceased to be so guided he became unjust the gospel in this parable runs parallel to the epistle the rich man who had a steward is no other than god who is rich in goodness toward all and who committed his blessings to the israelites in the epistle as he did his goods to the steward in the gospel as the israelites in the epistle abused his great goodness to them so the steward wasted his goods and as the israelites were therefore overthrown in the wilderness so was the steward put out of his stewardship  the tenth sunday after trinity the collect having as it were before its eyes the gifts mentioned in the epistle some of which will always be necessary for the church prays god epist who works all in all and divides to every man severally as he will that coll we may ask such things or gifts as will please him or be according to his will which works all in all  the epistle is chosen from a view of the gospel as the gospel mentions our saviors weeping over the city jerusalem and lamenting that the things belonging to her peace were hidden from her eyes so the epistle instructs us as to spiritual gifts and tells us that whoever calls jesus accursed or opposes christ and his religion does not speak by the spirit of god and that no man can say that jesus is lord or the messiah but by the holy ghost and that all manner of gifts whatever are from the same spirit  the gospel is the story of our saviors weeping over the city jerusalem the epistle is parallel to it in several places the gospel tells us that the jews knew not the things which belonged to their peace the epistle therefore concerning spiritual gifts would not have us ignorant as they were the gospel shows that our lord the messiah of the world was hidden from their eyes the epistle shows that they wanted the holy ghost because they were the persons who called jesus accursed and who would not say that jesus is the lord  some of the ritualists observe that be our lords casting them out that bought and sold in the temple is represented that the lord will throw those out of the church who are buyers and sellers of holy orders and therefore the epistle very suitably tells us before that spiritual gifts cannot be given much less sold by man but they are the gifts of the holy ghost who divides to every man severally as he will  this gospel is read at this season because in the month of august the temple was burnt and in september the whole city was set on fire and so was our lords prediction of it fulfilled  the eleventh sunday after trinity the collect as it were from the mouth of the publican in the gospel god be merciful to me a sinner and from the apostle in the epistle acts who obtained mercy through the epist grace of god acknowledges god to be a god of mercy and piety and prays that god would mercifully grant unto us his grace as he did the apostle in the epistle that we may run the way of his commandments and be made partakers of his heavenly treasure  the epistle gives us the apostle st paul for an example of that humility which is recommended in the gospel for says he i am the least of the apostles that am not meet to be called an apostle because i persecuted the church of god observe how answerable this is to the publican in the gospel the publican stands afar of and dare not so much as lift up his eyes to heaven the apostle with the same humble mind says i am the least of the apostles etc t publican confesses that he is a sinner the apostle that he persecuted the church of god  the gospel in the parable of the pharisee and the publican shows that they which exalt themselves shall be abased and they that humble themselves shall be exalted the boasting pharisee is an instance of the former and the humble publican is of the latter the publican boasts not with the pharisee that he is not as other men are extortioners unjust etc but he stands afar of and dare not so much as list up his eyes to heaven and with a deep sense of his guilt he smites upon his breast saying god be merciful to me a sinner and therefore he went down to his house justified rather than the other  the twelfth sunday after trinity the collect considering our saviors goodness in giving the man in the gospel speech instead of dumbness and hearing instead of deafness prays for such abundant mercy that we may be forgiven those things whereof our conscience is afraid and given these good things which we are not worthy to ask but through the merits and mediation of our savior  the epistle seems to have been chosen as suitable to the gospel because the gospel in its mystical meaning shows that the priests of the new testament should bring over to christs doctrine the unbelievers of the world it therefore shows that god made the apostles and their successors able ministers of the new testament and that the ministration of death or the ministry of the law was inferior to the ministration of the spirit or the ministry of the gospel for in the times of the former it was only prophesied that isaiah chapter xxxv the ears of the deaf should be opened and the tongue of the dumb should sing but under the latter we see the prophecy completed  the gospel is the history of our lords curing the deaf and dumb under which is couched a luth in domin     trin mystical meaning by the deaf and dumb is to be understood those who hear not the commands of god nor speak forth his praise and those who bring them to christ and beseech him to put his hand upon them are an emblem of the preachers of the gospel who by the charge of the ministry committed to them bring such dumb and deaf to christ and to a knowledge of their duty  the thirteenth sunday after trinity the collect observing that both the epistle and gospel show that salvation is by the free promise of god and not by the jewish law acknowledges that of gods only gift it comes that we do unto him true and laudable service and then from these words in the gospel this do and thou shall live it prays god that we may so faithfully serve him in this life that we fail not finally to attain his heavenly promises  the epistle treats of the promise god made to abraham and his seed which was in thee shall all nations be blessed this was promised not to many seeds but to his only which seed is christ it therefore tells us that the right of inheritance was by that free promise and not by the observation of the jewish law epist for if there had been a law given which could have given life verily righteousness should have been by the law but the scripture has concluded all under sin that the promise by faith of jesus christ might be given to them that believe those then only are saved who believe in jesus christ and there is no salvation by the jewish law  the gospel shows us this seed viz christ in whom all the nations of the world are blessed verifying the promise and saying blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see etc and by the following parable most beautifully points out to us that salvation and the blessing promised is not by the jewish law but by jesus christ the promised seed by theophy in loc bed in dom    post trin the man who went down from jerusalem to jericho who fell among thieves etc is to be understood the sons of adam stripped naked of their innocence and left almost dead in their sins by the priest and levite passing by on the other side we have an emblem of the weakness of the jewish law in taking away sins for as the epistle infers it was not a law that could give life see the epistle for goodfryday for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins by the good samaritan is to be understood our blessed lord who according to the promise repaired our lost innocence and bound up the wounds of our sins  the fourteenth sunday after trinity the collect having as it were in view the faith of the samaritan leper the hope and confidence of the ten when they listed up their voices and the charity of our lord in healing them prays for the increase of faith hope and charity and probably from their being cleansed as they were going to the priest as christ commanded them it also prays and that we may obtain that which thou do promise make us to love that which thou do command  the epistle is answerable to the gospel for as the gospel gives us the history of the ten lepers whose disease is an emblem of sin the leprosy of the soul so the epistle mentions the substance of which the leprosy of the ten was but the shadow for the works of the flesh says it are adultery fornication uncleannses lasciviousness etc and as the gospel tells us how the leprosy of the body was healed so the epistle tells us how we may cure the leprosy of the soul i say then walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfill the lusts of the flesh etc  the gospel is the history of the ten lepers as our lord was going to jerusalem they met him and prayed him to cure them of their leprosy upon which he told them to go show themselves unto the priests and it came to pass that as they were going they were cleansed for levit iv   it was commanded that whoever was cured of the leprosy should go show himself to the priest that he might make the offering which the law required and so be pronounced clean of the leprosy  now under this is couched that when we are tainted with the leprosy of sin we should go to those who are the judges of the uncleanness of the soul the successors of those who judged of the leprosy of the body bp hall whether an act be sinful or in what degree it is such what grounds are sufficient for the comfortable assurance of repentance of forgiveness what courses are fittest to avoid the danger of relapses who is so like to know so meet to judge as our teachers who are the cleansers of the spiritual leprosy under their master christ for they take away sins by the power and authority he endowed them with not that they do that of themselves but through their lord and master who cleansed the lepers as they went on their way to the priests and who really   john i   cleanses us from all sin agreeable to that in the epistle that they who are christs or who walk in his spirit have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts  the fifteenth sunday after trinity the collect as it were from a view of the falsebrethren in the epistle prays for the preservation of the church and considering their failing it acknowledges the frailty of man without gods assistance and then from a deep sense of the great danger of too much desiring those gosp things which the gentiles seek after and the great necessity of gosp seeking first the kingdom of god and his righteousness it prays god to keep us from all things hurtful and lead us to all things profitable to our salvation  the epistle by giving us an account of the behavior of those mentioned in it shows plainly what is hurtful and what is profitable to our salvation it tells of some who desired to make a fair show in the flesh by constraining others to be circumcised and this they did that they might not suffer persecution for the sake of the emperors caius octavian and tiberius had given liberty to the jews to live according to their own law without molestation or disturbance throughout all the roman empire so that if a jew turned christian he had the privileges of a jew so long as he kept the ceremonial rites of moses whereas they who taught that ceremonies were abrogated and that men were justified only by faith in christ wanted those priledges and were persecuted by the jews and gentiles boys n lo christ by which words the apostle cautions his galatians against the practices of those christians who out of the fear of being persecuted for the cross and of not carrying on their worldly affairs observed the rites of the jewish law and taught that circumcision was necessary so then being so anxious after the things of this life as to neglect or slight the things of the other are the hurtful things here spoken of and no doubt if we become newcreatures as the epistle advises we shall possess those things which are profitable to our salvation  the gospel show that no man can serve two masters which speaks the impossibility of those mentioned in the epistle pleasing both the christian and the jew god and the world it was their practice to preach to the jews the doctrine of the circumcision that they might avoid persecution and enjoy in ease the things of the world and the doctrine of the cross to the christians imagining that that was sufficient to save them but this gospel thews the weakness and folly of such pretenses for it assures us we cannot serve god and mammon would we therefore avoid being the servants of sin we must take no thought what we shall eat or what we shall drink or wherewith all we shall be clothed lest with the too anxious people in the epistle we become gosp haters of god but if we would be gosp lovers of god as st paul strives to make his galations we must seek first of all the kingdom of god and his righteousness or first of all put on the newman and become a epist new creature  the sixteenth sunday after trinity the collect from the example of st paul in the epistle praying for the church of the ephesians and from our saviors pity to the widow or the church in the gospel prays god that he would cleanse and defend his church and preserve it evermore by his help and goodness  the epistle is an instance of st paul praying for the church of the ephesians that they might be strengthened with might by his spirit in the innerman that christ might dwell in their hearts by faith and that they might be filled with all the fullness of god thus the apostle in effect prays in the epistle that the church may obtain what our lord did for her in the gospel and as the epistle acknowledges that god is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we can ask or think so the gospel gives us an instance of this power and goodness in our lords raising up the widows son when she neither asked nor thought he would be raised  the gospel gives us an instance of our lords cleansing defending and helping his church in the story of his raising the widows son to life again as they were carrying him on the bier to the grave the widow weeping for her son bed in dom    post trin is an emblem of the church now a widow as it were in the corporal absence of her lord weeping for her sons who are dead in their sins and the lords having compassion on her and raising up her son again represents to us that the lord raises up those who are dead in sin to a life of righteousness to the comfort and epist glory of the church  boys e zeper about the fall of the leaf men ordinarily be more subject to sickness and mortality than at other times of the year wherefore the church has alloted fitly this scripture for this season as a sick mans salve to comfort us against diseases and death intimateting that christ is the only health of all the living and everlasting life of all such as die in him  the seventeenth sunday after trinity the collect prays that gods grace may always prevent and follow us and that he would make us after the example of our lord curing the dropsical person on the sabbath day to be continually given to all good works  the epistle makes mention of some of those good works the collect prays for and thereby answers to the parable of those who were bidden to the marriage and exhorts us to humility and meekness telling us as it were that when we are bidden to the wedding we should behave with all lowliness and meekness with longsuffering forbearing one another in love not aiming at a seat in the highest room as did the people in the gospel but endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace  the gospel in the parable shows the disesteem and discredit that attend pride and haughtiness and the advantage and profit of humility and meekness for whosoever exalts himself shall be abased and he that humbles himself shall be exalted  the eighteenth sunday after trinity the office of this day relates to the clergy and has been chosen very suitably by the church for as this sunday often happens to be the sunday of ordination after the embereast in september so nothing could be more suitable to the season than the present office  the collect prays for gods grace to withstand the world the flesh and the devil and forasmuch as the gospel tells us that we must love the lord our god with all our heart and all our mind it therefore prays god that with pure hearts and minds we may follow him the only god  the epistle tells us what qualifications are more especially required in those to be admitted to holy orders that they should have utterance and knowledge and come behind in no gift  the gospel tells us how our savior answered the question of the lawyer and how he put the pharisees to silence so that none of them was able to answer him a word which teaches us how the ministers of christ should be qualified that   pet iii    they should be able to give an answer to every one that asks them a reason of the hope that is in them and to confute the gainsayers  the nineteeth sunday after trinity the collect considering the epistle and gospel prays that the holy spirit of god whereby as the epistle tell us we are sealed to the day of redemption may in all things direct and rule our hearts that we may avoid that blindness of heart mentioned in the epistle and not think evil in our hearts as did the scribes in the gospel  the epistle is answerable to the gospel and shows that the gentiles before their conversion were like the sick of the palsy in the gospel lying in sin which the palsy is an emblem of but after they had learned christ they laid aside the old man and put on the new man which after god is created in righteousness and true holiness they were not still in their understandings darkened but were renewed in the spirit of their mind  the gospel is the history of our saviors curing the sick of the palsy who was brought to him on a bed to whom also he gave remission of sins bed in dom    post trinit this is a lively representation of a man living dissolutely and as the epistle says of the gentiles alienated from the life of god and given over unto lasciviousness and all uncleanness but our blessed lord cures him as he did the gentiles in the epistle epist by putting of the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts and renewing him in the spirit of his mind and when he gosp rises up and walks from his sins and has epist put on the new man which after god is created in righteousness and true holiness then he is able to perform the advice of the epistle and to let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor etc be put away from him  the twentieth sunday after trinity the collect considering the fate of them who would not come to the marriage prays that we being ready both in body and soul may cheerfully fulfill gods commands and be obedient to his will as the epistle advises  the epistle persuades as it were to make ready for the wedding that we walk circumspectly that we be not unwise as those were who were invited but understanding that it is the will of the lord we should come to the wedding that we should not be drunk with wine but be filled with the spirit the wedding garment required in the gospel  the gospel is the parable of the king who made a marriage for his son under which is signified that god sent his servants to invite the jews to the good things he had provided for them in heaven but when they behaved so ungratefully to his servants he came and destroyed those murderers and burnt up their city jerusalem then ordered he his servants the apostles who whilst the jews were invited and expected at the wedding were mat x   not to go into the way of the gentiles to go into the highways viz among the gentiles and call them to the marriage which they did and so the wedding was furnished with guests but though many were called yet but few were chosen those who came not in the wedding garment of an holy life but clothed only with a dull unactive faith were thrown into outer darkness  the twenty first sunday after trinity the collect from our lords compassion on the noblemans son in the gospel having acknowledged the lord to be merciful beseeches god from a view of the noblemans faith and the cure thereby wrought that he would grant to his faithful people pardon that they may be cleansed from all their sins and from a consideration of the disquietudes and troubles of the christian warfare mentioned in the epistle it prays for peace that we may serve god with a quiet mind  the epistle shows the enemies we have to combat in our spiritual warfare and puts us into the method of acquiring that peace and quiet the collect prays for notwithstanding we are surrounded with them in the most hostile manner for it advises us to be strong in the lord and in the power of his might  the gospel is an account of the nobleman who desired jesus to go down to capernaum to heal his son who was a dying to whom jesus said go thy way thy son lives by theophy in lo this is represented to us that when our dear and immortal souls are assaulted with evils and temptations almost to death and we come to our lord and beg him to relieve us he sends us the aid and assistance of his holy spirit so that psalm lx when god arises his enemies are scattered and they which hate him flee before him wherefore when we are surrounded with the fiery darts of the devil epist let us be strong in the lord and in the power of his might  the twentysecond sunday after trinity the collect imitating st paul praying for the church of the philipians in the epistle prays god the king in the gospel who took an account of his servants to keep his household the church in continual godliness that through his protection it may be free from all adversities and devoutly given to serve him in all good works to the glory of his holy name through jesus christ our lord viz such epist good works as the apostle tells us in the epistle god had begun in the philipians and such as at the end of this epistle are called the fruits of righteousness which are by jesus christ to the glory and praise of god  the epistle shows the love and charity of st paul to the church of the philipians for god says he is my record how greatly i long after you all in the bowels of jesus christ and then he prays with such a spirit of brotherly kindness as is required in the gospel that their love may abound yet more and more that they may be sincere and without offense till the day of christ or gosp or till the king come to take an account of his servants  the gospel is the parable of the unmerciful servant which is grounded upon a question of peter to our lord how often shall my brother sin against me and i forgive him till seven times jesus says unto him i say not unto thee until seven times but until seventy times seven therefore is the kingdom of heaven etc in which parable is shown the great mercy of god in forgiving us such infinite numbers of sins and our unmercifulness in not forgiving each other a petty trespass and it also shows the grievous consequence of such unbrotherly treatment viz that the cruel and unmerciful will the delivered to those everlasting tormentors the flames of hell where they can never pay the debt of their sins  the collect then prays that we may serve god in good works the epistle shows what these good works are viz such as god had begun in the philipians that their love might abound more and more to each other in knowledge and in all judgment that they might approve etc and the gospel gives us an example of good works in the king mentioned in it and threatens us with eternal misery if we do not follow it  the twentythird sunday after trinity the collect prays that god would be ready to hear the devout prayers of his church and that he would grant her the petitions jam xvi she asks in faith  the epistle takes notice of two sorts of people the one of which has their conversation in heaven the other minds earthly things the one pays the tribute of a holy life to god the other makes a god of their belly the one at the resurrection shall have a body fashioned like unto the body of their savior the other shall end in destruction  the gospel teaches us to render unto caesar the things that are caesars and unto god the things which are gods some of the ritualists observe that as we are commanded by our lord to render unto caesar the things which are caesars and are therefore to render him a tribute with his own image upon it so we are likewise to render unto god the things that are gods by rendering him as the epistle recommends the tribute of a pure and holy soul which is stamped with his own image and if we conform our selves here to the image of christ he shall hereafter transform our epist vile body that it may be like unto his glorious body  the twenty fourth sunday after trinity the collect having before its eyes in the gospel the story of our saviors raising up the dead maid to life again and healing the woman of her disease prays therefore that god would in like manner absolve his people from their offenses and of his same bountiful goodness deliver them from the bands of their sins  the epistle gives and account of the conversion of the gentiles at collosse and shows st paul praying for their continuance and growth in the faith and that they may be thankful to the father who made them meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light the epistle therefore as it mentions the conversion of the gentiles and what they owe to god for it is very suitable to the gospel  the gospel is the story of the woman that was cured of the issue of blood and of jairuss daughter who was raised from the dead the woman was a gentile the maid was a jew the woman had been ill twelve years the maid was twelve luke viii years old the woman was cured of her disease as jesus was going to cure the maid observe then the mystery in the jews and gentiles as the woman was taken ill when the maid was born so the gentiles degenerated into idolatry when the jews believed in the loins of abraham as jesus went down to heal the maid and in the going the woman was first healed so jesus came first to the jews but the gentiles first believed and were saved and as at last he went down to the rulers house and raised his daughter from the dead so in the end the jews also shall be converted  the twenty fifth sunday after trinity this sunday being the forerunner of advent the church has ordered the office of this day to have relation to our saviors coming into the world that we may be put in mind of the season and   the collect  may bring forth  coming of our lord   the portion  is very suitable to  prophecy of our  days come says the  david a righteous branc  name whereby he shall be  our righteousn   the gospel has been  the sake of these words in  this is of a truth that prophet  into the world which words make it very suitable to this sunday which is the immediate forerunner of advent there is also another reason of its being read now which see in the seventh sunday after trinity  finis
