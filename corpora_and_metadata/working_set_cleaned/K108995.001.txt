dibdins history of the stage  a complete history of the english stage  introduced by a comparative and comprehensive review of the asiatic the grecian the roman the spanish the italian the portugese the german the french and other theaters and involving biographical tracts and anecdotes instructive and amusing concerning a prodigious number of authors composers painters actors singers and patrons of dramatic productions in all countries  the whole written with the assistance of interesting documents collected in the course of five and thirty years by mr dibdin  vol i  london printed for the author and sold by him at his warehouse leicester place leicester square  advertisement in addition to the source of materials whence i derive this work which were before large complicate and redundant i have been and no doubt shall continue to be favored with much anonymous and other advice manifestly the result of either curiosity or malignity or else kindness  as i mean to do my duty faithfully firmly and honestly i do not of course set out with an expectation of pleasing every body a task which would reflect no great reputation on him who should accomplish it as i hold myself however responsible for the validity of those motives which may induce me to broach my opinions i shall after i have gone through the whole body of evidence sum up in the nature of a charge to a jury all those collateral points which may have governed my conduct throughout the whole of this undertaking  to an address of this kind which i shall place at the head of this history by way of preface i refer all those who have appeared in any respect to be solicitous about me or my work taking till then a privilege to myself to postpone any public notice of their favors  this declaration however has nothing to do with the warm and zealous exertions of those whose kindness and attention have so largely swelled my subscription i beg even at this early period they will accept my most sincere acknowledgements as an earnest of that notice of their friendship which i shall consider myself under an obligation to take when to the last number will be added the names of the subscribers the preface i have alluded to and a dedication by permission to that nobleman under whose generous auspices and unexampled liberality i have so often had the advantage and distinction of submitting my labors to the candor and indulgence of the public  the stage book i containing a review of the asiatic the grecian the roman the spanish the italian the portugese and the german theaters chap i introduction three questions suggest themselves on a consideration of this undertaking  whether the subject it treats be of sufficient moment the characters it celebrates of sufficient importance and the events it relates of sufficient authenticity to interest the public to which may be added by way of a fourth proposition  whether even should these points be incontrovertably made out it can create interest to such a degree as essentially to serve the purposes of truth and morality  of this field for enquiry over which i mean to go at large in my preface i shall at present content myself with taking a cursory review  if of all the arts of imitation the most seducing the most ingenious the most expanded and the most esteemed that depicts nature by presenting man to man and face to face that teaches us to be friends brothers husbands and fathers that accelerates the progress of our ideas perfects our reason and our sensibility and induces us to blush at vice and cherish virtue if the stage exhibits this art then is it of sufficient moment to interest the public  the stage to which denomination i shall beg to reduce all secular spectacles intended to inculcate morality has maintained a commanding situation at all times and in all countries of this religion has furnished us with many examples mythology with more indeed as mythology is no other than allegorical religion so are the doctrines promulgated from the stage allegorical morality to which priests have ever and wisely lent their countenance and protection altars have been more thronged through the winning medium of poetry music and dancing than through the attraction of religious or moral duty out of fiction springs truth it is in human nature to love entreaties rather than commands and that argument is the surest to prevail that awakens our pleasure while it conciliates our interest  the most delightful fountain is the same by night as by day its waters are as pure as clear and as delicious but though necessity may induce us to have recourse to it in the night it is in the day alone that the draft is sweetened through the medium of contemplation by an idea of that heaven which is so beautifully reflects so did man wander in a chaos of truth till the light of science taught him how to distinguish its beauty  to the second proposition i shall answer that if poets warriors philosophers and legislators if those who have united in themselves those various characters if all the promoters and protectors of the imitative arts whose exertions have so nobly contributed to civilize the world together with those men so peculiarly gifted by nature as to command the passions of their auditors to compel bursts of laughter force torrents of tears and so to transfuse the workings of their own sensibility into their hearers as to raise pity excite terror and inspire delight if the stage exhibits these characters then is it of sufficient importance to interest the public  it is little to say that the greatest men both as to power and talents that ever lived have countenanced the stage the greatest men in different countries and in different times have been not only authors and actors but even dancers those great writers aeschylus and sophocles were statesmen and warriors they wrote for their country and combated for it and the same hand that to serve the cause of morality held the pen in the cause of greece held the sword the seven chiefs before thebes of aeschylus was said to inspire his auditors with all the fury of battle and they complimented him with saying that though aeschylus wrote the piece it was dictated by mars  this work will adduce a multitude of proofs to make out these assertions in the mean time let us consider for a moment the real worth and value of a dramatic writer to be at all a writer of any eminence is a proud distinction men of letters the bent of whose genius is worthily conducted who form the public taste who expose the deformity of vice and inculcate the true principles of virtue merit from their fellow citizens the most honorable consideration but a dramatic writer he who puts speculative truth into action who commands our richest faculties who pervades the recesses of reason who opens the treasures of the heart excites its pity and its commiseration and teaches us to be men and to be virtuous to acquire this art is to attain the noblest privilege of human nature  the dramatic art is the most precious inheritance bequeathed us by the ancients a dramatic poet is an honor to his fellow creatures let us see why the profession of an actor should be involved in unmerited obloquy and why a man who delights and instructs us in his counterfeit character should be an object of indiscriminate reproach in his real character  it is extremely difficult to conceive upon what principle or from what circumstance this unworthy prejudice took its rise is it that actors are men of stronger intellectual power and intelligence than the common herd of mankind no individuals may be envious the public are always generous is it that because actors are paid to amuse and instruct the world they ought to be considered as purchased slaves of the will no barristers parsons and senators are treated with respect  what is the cause that an actor is the main spring of the dramatic art it is impossible to deny vainly shall the poet paint a faithful portrait of men and manners his labor shall remain a lifeless lump till it receive a promethean touch from the fire of the actor nay in this the public seem to acquiesce for the last instrument through the medium of which they immediately receive their pleasures will ever be more considered as the intimate and welcome object of their commendation than the author to whose person they are perfect strangers and to whose merits they would have remained so but for the actor  roscius is said to have given a most perfect idea of all the impassioned variety contained in the celebrated orations of cicero without uttering a word what perfect materials then must have composed the extraordinary mind of this wonderful man but how shall we have to admire the strength of his head and the goodness of his heart if we believe cicero himself who tells us that roscius not only knew how to disseminate virtue among his auditors better than any other man but was more correct in his practice of virtue in private life  i know it may be opposed to me that actresses in all ages have made terrible savages among the hearts of the spectators and that the economy of many families has been too often deranged by the influence of their charms women ornamented prosessedly with an intention to captivate will ever improperly attract the notice of the young and the irregular the graces of beauty and talents enhanced by the inticements of dress naturally beget admiration and pleasure and too many husbands and fathers have certainly sacrificed their wives and children at this shrine of voluptuousness nay i am afraid the scene has been in some instances reversed and that the actor while recommending constancy and honor from the stage has raised sensations throughout the boxes not perfectly consistent with virtue in the breasts of the matron and the vessal  but admitting this argument in its fullest extent why is this remarked in particular of actors and actresses i answer because of the publicity of their situation were the private conduct of individuals in all other stations as well known the world would be found to be a universal theater no less in its particular then in its general manners but there every irregularity is as much as possible hushed up or glossed over and but for the intervention now and then of westminster hall and doctors commons the great who look down on the stage would be considered as irreproachable and exemplary characters  as to the bar as there certainly have been instances in the private conduct of its members of rapacity and i am afraid dishonor it is not to be supposed that individuals for i contend for no more have been remarkable for a superior degree of propriety in their families and connections than their neighbors and of the pulpit i shall only say that churches are notoriously places of assignation and that threefourths of those unhappy wretches who have been driven to prostitution by the arts of some young rake or perhaps the overbearing landlord of their fathers always begin the wretched story of their misfortunes by telling you that they are clergymens daughters  i could go a great way into this but that it would be foreign to my present purpose and i shall have most powerful occasion to illustrate this point hereafter i shall therefore only observe that an object however perfect when placed upon a pinnacle will appear to the purblind view of general observation to have many deformities while the most rickety piece of real deformity shall halt through the crowd without attracting particular notice individuals of all professions deserve reprehension actors as well as others are all professions therefore to be stigmatized much less the profession of an actor exclusively the idea is revolting unworthy and unjust perfection is not the lot of human nature let not any part of the public therefore become obnoxious to censure by acting a perpetual solecism themselves in decrying those with their tongues whom it is their greatest pleasure to applaud with their hands  as to the third proposition i stand nearly upon the same ground with other historians and i can freely answer that if credit may be given to the various authors who have admitted the merit and pointed out the beauties of the ancient and modern dramatic poets who by relating the events of states and empires have necessarily involved in their narrations a history of those arts which have forwarded the great work of civilization if the fidelity with which men more correctly speak of what interests the imagination than what merely relates to their affairs which is remarkably apparent in whatever can be collected of the theaters if these can be relied on then are the events contained in this history of sufficient authority to interest the public  i am not to learn the prodigious difficulty of pronouncing any thing to be true or with what diffidence and caution men ought to explore the labrynth of events which cannot be known to him but through the clue of the historian often misled and generally partial vague tradition may be true apparent demonstration may be falible  a biographer of sir walter raleigh informs us that when he had nearly finished the second volume of his history of the world being then a prisoner in the tower his attention was attracted by a dispute between an officer and a private sentinel under his window it appeared to him that the officer had improperly treated the poor soldier and that the man had with equal firmness and modesty remonstrared against the oppression a mob crowded about the disputants and this was all he could collect of the affair  a friend soon afterward came to visit him to whom he related what he thought he had witnessed it turned out however that this friend had not only been present at the dispute but a mediator in it and had been therefore perfectly competent to ascertain exactly the fact which was that the soldier had behaved very ill and that the officer in consideration of a proper concession had with great manliness and forbearance forgiven him when he might consistently with his duty have punished him  having heard his friend patiently out sir walter with great coolness and determination is said to have seized the different papers which composed his work and thrown them behind the fire exclaiming how should i dare to avouch the authenticity of facts which are supposed to have passed at such distant times and in such remote parts of the world when those in a common occurrence that passes under my window are directly opposite to my comprehension of them  this circumstance is indeed doubted for we are told by another writer that sir walter burnt the second volume of his work because the first sold so slowly as to ruin his bookseller and we are told by himself that this second and a third volume were only in preparation but as it is admitted on all sides that the materials for such a work existed but were destroyed this chain of circumstances concur to render the above relation probable be it therefore literally or virtually fact it would be a lamentable thing that every author should be actuated by the same delicate scruples it would go to the anihilation of enquiry and facts themselves however supported would be supposed never to have existed i own that circumstances universally admitted have been differently attributed but are we to infer from this that these circumstances never occurred at all seven towns are said to comend for the birth of homer are we therefore to believe that there was no such person as homer indeed this last has been strongly insisted on the fables of aesop have been attributed to homer to socrates and even to solomon this does not prove they were not written for by some means or other we are in possession of them and a most wonderful work they are  in these situations what are we to do since the certainty is so difficult to come at we are to take the probability which in the business of aesop appears to be this fable was a poeticle vehicle at the time of homer and hesiod and no doubt was used by them but aesop having perfected what others began is considered as the father of fable just as aeschylus is called the father of tragedy  it is not therefore that because the leading features of facts are difficult to ascertain that facts themselves are actually to be rejected the germ of truth seems to be planted in the minds of all intellectual beings and though uncertain history and more uncertain tradition may have involved great events in doubt and contradiction yet that very doubt and that very contradiction have often gone to establish unanswerable confirmation that those events did exist  how very similar is the war of the giants with the gods to the war of the malignant angels with the good how remarkable is the resemblance of deucalion and pyrrha to noah and the flood so the universal admiration of a supreme being acknowledged throughout creation even to the most ignorant idolaters  but the theme is endless and in the investigation of great truths the wonder is not that falible human nature should err so much but that it should err so little  as to the auxiliary proposition its existence is made out by establishing the three others for if the stage be a vehicle to instruct and amuse if the primary and relative characters are of universal celebrity if the truth of the events are virtually confirmed by as indisputable authority as the events of other histories then the subject of this work is of sufficient moment its characters of sufficient importance and its facts of sufficient authenticity to interest the public and if through this subject these characters and these facts the sweetest emotions that penetrate the breast are excited if the dangerous passions of hate envy avarice and pride with all their inumerable train of attendant vices are detected and exposed if love friendship gratitude and all those active and generous virtues which warm and exalt the mind are held up as objects of emulation if ignorance is scouted genius encouraged and a true polish set on that mirror which the wises men of all ages have selected as the most unerring vehicle to reflect the manners of mankind then must this work create interest to such a degree as essentially to serve the purposes of truth and morality  chap ii asiatic theater china more than three thousand years ago cultivated that art which somewhat later contributed to the renown of greece the early principle of the ancient drama was to present living portraits of the times and manners to reprehend vice and inculcate morality and virtue through the medium of action and dialogue the drama for a considerable time was only held in honor throughout the vast country of china and the single town of athens rome did not adopt it till four hundred years afterward  the tragedies represented by the chinese were on moral subjects supported by the examples of their heroes and the maxims of their philosophers the scenes and habits were prodigiously magnificent their pieces however had neither regularity interest nor probability angels and devils were indiscriminately introduced and whatever could convey a mystic sense of moral duty was awkwardly enforced no matter by what means they had however performances of various kinds calculated merely to entertain and surprise the spectators an incredible number of extraordinary feats both of legerdemain and tumbling made up some of these which they performed in so wonderful a manner that if we credit the accounts we read all we have ever seen of this species of amusement in europe cannot boast the smallest comparison of the most trifling of their tours in this way these were performed however in still greater perfection by monkies and mice the subtilties of which animals it will easily be credited have often made them pass for devils and sorcerers what an admirable idea for a pantomime in the christmasholidays i hope it will be improved upon a lion according to aesop owed his preservation to a mouse why should the english theaters which bear as their protection the lion of england hesitate to promote their glory by the same means neither the learned pig the hare nor even general jacko could cope with the mice mice have been of consequence ever since homer i beg i may not be thought wickedly to allude to the mountain and the mouse we know the theaters are bringing forth such mice as these every day but they are not of the true chinese breed i would therefore advise to send for some of the right sort in the first ships and who knows if the mice should grow as sond of english corn as eunuchs are of english guineas but china may prove of as great advantage to the theater as italy has done to the operahouse   we are told by different travelers that though the persians and the indians are said to be the inventors of dramatic entertainments owing probably to their grotesque and fanciful dances for which they are so famous the chinese claim an indisputable right to be acknowledged as the original founders of this art which though the severity of their manners prevented them from authorizing was exhibited at the palaces of their richest mandarines where regular theaters were fitted up  on days of regaling it was the custom to invite friends and send for actors who brought with them lists of such pieces as they were prepared to perform i have before me a history of one of those days of performance which will show that though the chinese never arrived to the regularity of the greeks at the time of aeschylus yet the drama and all its best purposes were as warmly felt then at china as it was afterward at athens  the piece preceded by a prologue was taking from history an emperor appeared surrounded by an admiring multitude on whom he had heaped benefits his virtues became the subject of their eulogium and they sometimes recited and sometimes chanted orations to his praise  this piece was followed by a farce full of intrigue but void of drift or regularity and to their farce succeeded a pantomime in which women mounted on mens shoulders went through a kind of exercise with fans following exactly the measure and movement of the music which accompanied them next came juglers with cups and balls and then tumblers and posture masters these were followed by a man who thrust a tube into the wall and drew from it twenty different liquors at the word of command another threw three knives into the air which he managed so dexterously as repeatedly to catch one of them by the handle while the other two were suspended  they were after this entertained with conjurors who came in with birds snakes mice and monkies which as they were commanded danced upon the ground and upon ropes and formed themselves into all manner of figures relating to the sciences and particularly to the mathematics and to astronomy these were no doubt intended as improvements on dancing which in many countries were taken in a mystical sense the egyptians imitated in their mysterious dances the ordinary rotation of the stars the indian priests danced before the image of their god visnou who is said to have danced himself on the head of the serpent adissecken whose tail encompassed the world the biographer of mon gardalle goes farther and says which by the bye is not very far distant from the truth that all nations have introduced dancing into sacred worship the hebrews danced for joy after their passage through the red sea but says he the most innocent exercises sometimes degenerate into abuse for after they had danced before the ark of the covenant they forgot themselves and danced before the fatted calf he then goes on and quotes the count de gebelin who has demonstrated in a curious dissertation that the minuet was the original dance performed by the priest in the temple of apollo the diagonal line and the two parallels that pervade the minuet are the symbol of the zodiac the twelve steps of which it is composed explain the twelve signs and the twelve months of the year again the minuet begins with a proound obedience to the sun and thus he goes on explaining till he proves that there is not the smallest movement relative to the heavenly constellations but is exemplified in the minuet   at the palaces of the emperors the entertainments were of the same hetrogenious kind but much more grand after some magnificent spectacle founded as usual on history a pantomime commenced by a tartar who sung a warlike song to the sound of a carillon on which he performed with sticks of ivory this was improved by the entrance of others into a duet then into a trio and at length into a chorus accompanied at last by dancers tumblers wrestlers and gladiators with all which the theater was filled each performing his different part at the same time with great vociferation force and agility at length they were wrought into so violent a frenzy that what commenced in jest finished in earnest till it was with difficulty the prince himself could call off the performers among whom several were often severely wounded  actors though slaves were held by the chinese in a respectable light thyngh ti emperor of china became enamoured of an actress and repudiated his wife to make her an empress his mother however shrewdly remarking that the lady having been so used to act different parts would not probably content herself with that single one which he had now given her to perform the emperor with a quick sense of his own absurdity answered he had only placed the actress in that situation to see how well she could sustain her part and that having had enough of the comedy he should now reduce her to her primitive obscurity  the most celebrated men of study and science are said to have planned and assisted at these representations the gymnosophists who entirely gave themselves up to the study of reason among others encouraged as far as the severity of their manners would permit dramatic exhibitions in asia their principal called budda is ranked among the brachmans and the brachmans are known to have cultivated religious truth through the medium of scenic fiction  pilpay the celebrated fabulist is in particular supposed to have contributed toward the reputation of the dramatic art in asia and this conjecture is extremely probable he is well known to have governed a large kingdom in india under a powerful emperor and as it might not have been safe to have uttered his political opinions to his master in the plain terms of unadorned truth  for in that case he might not have come off so well as the old woman who wished dionysius a long life lest there should come a worse tyrant in his stead or the vizier who pretending to understand the language of birds informed his sultan that the crows were croaking his praises for having massacred his subjects to provide them with carrion  it is not unlikely that pilpay should endeavor to cheat his master into a love of virtue by painting on the stage the hateful figure of vice indeed it was only one step further than what we know him to have done for fables as far as they go are dramatic representations  in japan spectacles are followed with eager avidity and the religion of the country so far from condemning authorizes and consecrates them their amusements are performed to celebrate feasts in honor of the divinities they consist of singing and dancing to music if it may be so called performed by flutes drums cymbals and large bells as for the machinery and decorations we have not a conception how wonderful they are monstrous giants floating cascades moving mountains peopled cities and a variety of other objects as extraordinary make up their pageants and processions  their plays represent the adventures both heroic and amorous of their gods they are distributed like ours into scenes and acts the prologue announces the plan but never touches on the denouement which is always managed so as to surprise the interludes and the farces like those of the chinese are gross buffoonery but their tragedies and comedies have always a moral tendency which the stronger to enforce the priests upon particular occasions sit in the most conspicuous places and are the first to applaud  the persians also have a taste for these amusements there is scarcely a petty governor without his tumblers his declaimers his musicians and his dancers in this part of asia their pieces consist of indecent pictures of love and the most unbridled libertinism their dances are not a whit behind hand in laciviousness  for lightness however quickness and variety france is infinitely inferior and the best dancers that ever graced our opera can boast no more comparison with the persian girls than can the worst figurante swim slide and posture with parisot the young ladies alone are permitted to practice this harmless amusement and are on that account considered as infamous  it will evidently be seen that the drama flourishes best where morality is most inculcated among the softened and esseminate persians we have seen the stage imitating all the unprincipled audacity of a stew of this the jesuits who visited goa were aware and therefore began their mission with teaching the inhabitants a play which they called the establishment of the christian faith in india the spectacle itself though little short of blasphemy drew converts from all quarters indeed those who have been accustomed to roman catholic countries will not find any thing extraordinary in this species of sanctified knavery the farce performed on holythursday in spain and portugal is full as impious as the mummery of the most subtle monk who pretends to convert indian ignorance to a veneration of that faith of which he himself makes a jest  asia however even to this hour can boast nothing regular in the dramatic art which certainly under the influence of the priests and particularly the jesuits spread itself into many countries but no where with such enthusiasm as into siberia where among other blasphemous reprosentations for the purpose of desseminating religion they perform the redemption as a play the baptism as a farce and recite the commandments as an interlude  the empress elizabeth however corrected in great measure these barbarisms by erecting an opera house at moscow after this another was built at petersburgh where an opera was performed in the russian language the author the composer and the performers were all russians at length catherine the second invited to her capital the charming galluppi surnamed buranelli who was at that time master of music to the chapel of st mark at venice and one of the most celebrated composers of modern italy this great man was born to perfect the musical taste of all countries he had before this time brought simplicity and all the true and natural beauty of melody to its maturest perfection in italy he had carried the italian opera in england to that high pitch of excellence and reputation from which it has ever since been on a gradual decline and the bewitching and touching effects of his familiar melodies in conjunction with other composers principally his imitators who gave the venetian ballads to the world so totally altered the style of french music that what had ever before been harshness and dissonance became under habile masters but particularly philidor objects of imitation in all other countries though heaven knows it has lamentably degenerated since   this composer like another orpheus charmed the rugged russians by the power of his music it is astonishing with what avidity it was relished after the first representation of his didone abandonata the empress gave him with her own hand a magnificent box filled with gold and he was treated by all ranks with the most singular marks of favor and consideration  to galluppi succeed traetta the neapolitan a man certainly less celebrated but capable of keeping up what had been so well established by his predecessor performers were invited of the best celebrity till at length the opera at petersburgh became one of the most brilliant in europe certainly in my description of the opera at petersburgh i have rambled out of asia but i did so to show that  whatever may have been the improvement of the russian stage but more particularly the opera for certainly the theater even to this hour is in a very barbarous state notwithstanding all the encouragement and honors that have been heaped on the actors some of whom have been enobled  from assiatic russia came originally the dramatic art to moscow and afterward to petersburgh where in proportion as the people grew polished they called in auxiliary assistance from those nations in which the arts were in greater forwardness   chap iii grecian theater from its origin to the time of aeschylus though we find traces of the dramatic art in all nations back to the remotest antiquity even till its origin is lost in the night of time yet it seems to have attained no perfection till it became memorable in greece simplified there it grew interesting and important it celebrated among that people recent events of which their fathers had been witnesses all the subjects of their theater were comprised in the histories of a few families no foreign heroes presumed to usurp those tears that deplored the misfortunes of their proper citizens  in the theater as in the field and in the areopagus the greeks were possessed with the spirit of real patriotism they acknowledged the representative of no hero but in his true history and a great action had no charms for them unless it was legitimate and as it were naturalized liberty converted every town into an empire and the greatness of soul which inspired this fame inspired poets with the genius to celebrate it  a tragedy was not merely art amusement not an exhibition to beguile a moment of leisure it was an affair of state and the athenian spectators saw their duty as men through the transparent veil of allegory nor was there a grecian sailor who did not taste the beauties of sophocles and euripides  inclination to occupy time with a view to destroy that lassitude natural to man begat in him a taste for those studies which are called the arts and which are purely an imitation of nature the gymnastic and other exercises in greece were thus improvements of similar games to which all people have been accustomed ever since the primitive union of man into society  the isthmian games instituted in honor of neptune and revived with particular attention by theseus king of athens who reigned twelve hundred years before the christian era were the first of which poetry and music made apart in these games were introduced the sports of the chase where were seen rare and scarce animals purposely brought from all parts of the known world and these games in the end fixed the epoch of all the inhabitants of the isthmus of corinth  seven centuries after theseus themistocles instituted a new combat of poetry and music which made a part of the panathanean feasts in honor of minerva in these feasts dramatic pieces were introduced each poet was permitted to bring forward to the number of four and this assemblage was called tetralogy the prize of the victors was a crown of olive branches and a barrel of oil which was considered as a present from the goddess whose glory these sports celebrated we know not what these dramatic pieces were at that time there were none of any particular distinction the term tragedy confounded every thing and it was long after this period that the art had its divisions  tragedy according to an ancient tradition generally adopted owed its origin to an accident icarius the proprietor of a village in attica where it is said the vine was originally cultivated having one day found a hegoat feasting on his grapes killed it and divided it among his peasants who in their merriment decorated themselves with branches of trees and danced round the animal destined for their banquet this novelty attracted numbers of spectators who were so struck with it that at length it became a custom in several places during the wine harvest  as these peasants grew intoxicated at their feasts and the greatest part of them had reason to complain of such athenians as had large possessions in the country they abandoned themselves without reserve to their resentment braved their oppressors and called aloud at their doors for redress to the great entertainment of the multitude that surrounded them the chiefs of justice even authorized this annual remonstrance of an oppressed people taking care however that the fear of chastisement and the danger of reproach should operate so as to prevent violence this method became a remedy against public disorder and the feast of the goat was at length introduced at athens  the peasants were invited from all parts to appear at this spectacle which was performed in a field near a grove of poplars called oegyron and the branches of the trees interlaced served as a sort of scaffold from whence the performers amused the multitude the field being near the temple of bacchus this entertainment insensibly introduced itself as a part of the worship of the god of wine  during the sacrifice the priests and the people sung hymns to the deity in chorus which from the name of the victim were called tragedy or song of the goat these feasts became general not only in the temples but in the villages where a man in the character of silenus rode on an ass and was followed by a promiscuous troop of votaries who glass in hand sung verses in honor of bacchus  these monotonous hymns however grew very tiresome and disgusting till epigene a sicyonian conceived the idea of giving a new form to this species of spectacle he produced a tragedy less objectionable which he entitled bacchus but it was however so little to the honor of the god that the spectators at its first representation cried put what has this to do with bacchus this criticism proves that though they yet knew but little of the dramatic art its germ which afterward burst forth and grew to perfection existed at that time in the greeks  thespis who was born at icaria a town of attica fatigued like the rest with this barbarous nonsense that outraged the understanding of the people and dishonored the god it professed to idolize determined to write pieces and introduce recitation this novelty pleased he produced several entertainments of this description which he and others represented from village to village mounted on a cart from whence they declaimed in grotesque dresses and with faces frightfully painted  bacchus was very soon after this left out of the party for now both thespis and epigene employed themselves in exposing the vices and follies of their countrymen and to as good a purpose as icarius and his companions who as we have seen brought their oppressors of athens by the same method to reason and a sense of their duty as citizens  these laudable attempts however were not long attended with success for though the people when they became accustomed to them listened with great satisfaction solon opposed them as a dangerous innovation he forbad thespis not only to write but to teach the art of composing tragedies at athens probably because he had at that time so many jarring interests to reconcile at the time when solon was in the zenith of his reputation at athens thespis one day was performing a tragedy at which the people appeared wonderfully pleased when it was over solon asked the author whether he was not ashamed to tell so many lies in the face of the world not at all said thespis it is only jest in jest cried solon striking his stick vehemently against the ground so much the worse those who encourage falsehood in jest may at last approve of it in earned and i should not wonder if this were long permitted that by rejecting truth our government and our public affairs should in like manner become the jest of the people  this prohibition seems however to be but little regarded for thespis after this not only wrote tragedies but had for a scholar phrynichus an athenian he is spoken of as the first who made history the subject of tragedy who introduced the characters of women on the stage and who invented tetrametre verse  phrynichus was condemned to pay a thousand drachms for having produced a piece called miletus taken by darius he was considered by the athenians the more culpable because he had forced tears from the spectators at the moment he painted in lively colors the desolation of that town and thus he was at once the victim of their pride and the object of their pleasure notwithstanding however his countrymen persecuted him for pleasing them he afterward became a general in the army and to this was probably owing the vehemence which appeared to characterize his tragedies  alceus another grecian held a high rank among the tragic poets of that time there cannot be collected however more than the titles of two of his pieces  choerilus is said to have written a hundred and fifty tragedies and to have been thirteen times crowned victor the prize obtained upon these occasions still adverted to the feasts of bacchus for it consisted of a goat and a measure of wine nothing is known of these pieces of choerilus except one of them but he is memorable for being the first who decorated the scene and habited the actors like the persons they represented choerilus was considered by suidas and anthenaeus as the original author of masks there can be no doubt however but the pieces anterior to thespis are of that species horace attributes them to aechylus which by the bye is a conjecture ventured very much at hazard for they are in no respect in his style but aristotle with more good sense informs us that the real inventor of them and even the time when they were originally introduced is unknown the fact is this all the dramatic pieces both in asia and elsewhere before aechylus were an irregular jumble of recitation and singing and therefore masks the arabian word mascara signifies railery and buffoonery and pieces of this description as we have seen were represented in asia consequently the conjecture of aristotle ought to be credited   cephisodorus was among the number of the authors of the ancient tragedy they attribute to him five pieces which like the rest were nothing more than a sort of dithyrambic begun as we have seen by thespis and in some degree improved afterward but it remained for aeschylus to dispel this mist and eclipse these constellations which at his appearance receded like stars at sun rise  chap iv aeschylus sophocles and euripides and the progress of tragedy in greece aeschylus who was hailed the father of tragedy soon simplified and regulated dramatic representations he divided his pieces into acts or episodes that contained the exposition of the subject the conduct of the plot and the development of the catastrophe he reserved the primitive chorus no otherwise however than as an auxiliary for the purpose of rendering the subject more interesting tragedy was originally as we have seen no more than a single person who sung dithyrambics or hymns in praise of bacchus thespis added a single person to relieve the chorus aeschylus finding a single person uninteresting added a second and at the same time threw the chorus as much as possible into the back ground all that had been performed between the four songs of the chorus they called episode the songs of the chorus being the acts and the episode the act time but when tragedy came to be formed by aeschylus the matter was reversed and what had been the auxiliary became the principal then the interest of the piece was the primary object and the chorus which was now used merely as an interval between the acts still heightened the effect of the piece itself by sometimes reciting and sometimes singing such subjects as belonged to it immediately or as illustrated some point relative to it the recitation was performed by their chief called chorypheus who first recited and then led the song followed by the rest i should not wonder at seeing an assertion that this was the original idea of the fugue in music   the degree of perfection to which aeschylus brought the dramatic art in greece procured him great respect and consideration to which his public conduct as a citizen materially contributed born of one of the best families in attica he distinguished himself very early in the field he was the pupil of pythagoras and at twentyfive disputed the poetic prize he was the first who brought two characters forward on the stage at the same time he invented the robe and the buskin and considerably heightened the effect of his pieces by appropriate decorations of the personages his improvements were so rapid and so effectual that he was thought to have been inspired  pausanius says that while aeschylus was asleep under the shadow of a vine bacchus appeared to him in a dream and commanded him to write tragedies this fable arose probably from his fondness for wine for he wrote as he drank and upon all occasions invoked apollo less than bacchus if we believe callisthenes and plutarch whatever god inspired his verse it is certainly full of nature warmth and energy he is however reproached and with reason for introducing hardnesses and crudeties his images were gigantic and frightful and the whole drift of his pieces was calculated to inspire terror rather than pity or delight in the tragedy of eumenides written by aeschylus orestes in the first act appeared surrounded with furies lulled asleep by apollo their dresses were black with sanguinary ornaments in one hand they held a torch from which issued a faint and quivering flame and in the other a rod of serpents their heads were covered with furious adders and their faces were so frightfully horrible that the moment they awoke and begun to walk tumultuously on the stage women were said to have miscarried and children to have died with fear   it must not be forgotten however that tragedy at the time of aeschylus was in its infancy that it was his offspring and that he trusted it in the world that it might by the fostering care of others grow to maturity  it has been warmly insisted on and surely with good reason that aeschylus was less the perfecter of the works of thespis than the imitator of those of homer the epopoeia is a more natural assimulation to tragedy than those monstrous rhapsodies which were chanted in honor of bacchus and though the priests upon this as upon all other occasions were glad enough to beget an interest in favor of their deity in whose name they hoodwinked the people yet celebrating the achievements of kings and heroes among a nation of warriors was more likely to rouse their feelings as it brought them acquainted with conduct which it was both their inclination and their duty to emulate of this most probably aeschylus was aware and as he imitated the heroes of homer with his sword so did he homer himself with his pen  aeschylus served at the battle of marathon and at the sea fight of salamis where aminias his brother commanded a squadron of ships and signalized himself above all the athenians to this brother our poet upon a particular occasion was indebted for his life in one of his pieces he made thetis speaking of apollo utter some expressions which were considered as blasphemy and in another he introduced some equivocal pleasantries in allusion to the mysteries of ceres for these crimes he was chased from the theater and would have been stoned to death but for aminias who throwing aside his cloak and showing the slump of his arm reminded the people of his gallantry at the fight of salamis this moved the spectators to pity and they pardoned aeschylus who however could not stomach this indignity and was therefore determined to withdraw from a place where his life had been in danger  this determination was confirmed by the neglect of his pieces and the rising success of sophocles who obtained the prize from him though some say it was simonides in an elegy on the battle of marathon the fact was that simonides was victor in the elegy on the battle of marathon and sophocles as we shall see hereafter when cimon brought back the bones of theseus the battle of marathon was fought three years after sophocles was born and simonedes might certainly have on that occasion obtained a prize but it seems to have given aeschylus very little concern for he continued after that to write with unrivalled reputation for two and twenty years and being then old and his genius on the decline no wonder sophocles with the ardour of youth and the example of so great a master in his favor got the better in this contest which every thing considered appears to be no material deduction from the brilliant reputation of aeschylus  he therefore retired into sicily and was received into the court of hieron who was then building the city of aetna which our poet celebrated in a tragedy of the same name here he resided three years covered with honors when his death was occasioned by a singular accident  an eagle having soared a great height with a tortoise in his talons let it fall on the head of aeschylus of which blow he died and by his death seemed to be verified a pretended declaration of the oracle at delphos that a blow from heaven should accelerate the death of aeschylus  it has been said that the seats of the theater broke down during the representation of one of the tragedies of aeschylus and suidas tells us that it was the cause of his retiring into sicily but this is absurd for the large crowd necessary to break down the seats is a proof of the celebrity of aeschylus but he means to insinuate that with the seats the reputation of aeschylus which was eclipsed by sophocles fell to the ground  the operation of this accident however proclaims in very loud terms the fame of aeschylus for from these ruins sprung up those magnificent theaters which were afterward so nobly imitated by the romans they were built circular on one side and square on the other the semicircle contained the spectators who were ranged in seats one above another and in the quadrangle was exhibited the spectacle they had machines of every sort for the conveyance of gods and goddesses which they summoned at pleasure from the sea from hell or from heaven their scenes represented palaces and temples squares in perspective and towns in the distance they had transformations embellishments and every species of decoration and ornament to be seen on the modern stage but prepared at a much greater expense and of course represented with infinitely more grandeur sophicles gave additional magnificence to the construction of the theaters of athens the expense for the extension of these edifices and for the acquisition of what he thought necessary to ornament one of his tragedies brought a reproach on the athenians of having expended more riches on a single dramatic representation than in their wars against the barbarians   near that part of the building in which the spectators sat there were three porticos where they might retire in case of bad weather for it is remarkable that the ancient theaters were almost entirely uncovered on the other hand to prevent inconvenience from the heat of the sun they extended veils  some of which were very costly  by means of cords attached to the extremity of the building and that nothing might be omitted that could in the smallest degree contribute to their pleasure statues of excellent workmanship were placed in regular order supporting urns beautifully ornamented those urns receiving streams deliciously perfumed which issued from picturesque fountains the whole variously formed and judiciously arranged  the theater was so capacious that the actors were obliged to wear masks which were perfectly a machine calculated to extend the voice so that it might reach every ear in so vast a space to facilitate which there were also vases of brass placed in the intervals of the amphitheatre with such art in such a direction and composed of such tempered materials that they assisted the tones of the voice and instruments and by this consonance rendered the sound stronger more agreeable and more distinct  all these magnificent improvements sprung from the fall of aeschylus whose theater like anteus touched the earth only that it might rise with renovated strength there are authors who dispute this fact and tell us that the accident described above happened during the representation of a tragedy written by one pratinas the probability appears to lie between the two stories the word scene is originally from the greek and signifies a hut a booth a tent or other place where dramatic representations were anciently performed the oegyron was used as well to form a stage as to serve as a shelter for the populace thus these representations from the first were at times itinerant or stationary according to circumstances and there can be no doubt but that the scenic art in the progress of its improvement improved the scene itself thus sometimes fortuitously and sometimes by design it became more and more regular till at length it attained to that splendor which grew into magnificence under sophocles   aeschylus had two sons and five nephews all of whom wrote with various success for the theater bion his second son was ranked among the poets called railers and was probably one of those who wrote comedy they are said to have written among them a prodigious number of pieces some of which are yet to be seen but as aeschylus eclipsed his predecessors so his imitators served only to raise the superior fame of sophocles  sophocles was born at colonos a town of attica in the first year of the seventy first olympiad which place he rendered afterward celebrated by his tragedy of oedippus of colonos  sophocles operated a second revolution in tragedy he introduced a third actor and augmented the number of the chorus to fifteen instead of twelve at which number aeschylus had fixed it he also allowed the chorus to have an interest in the main action so that by this means every thing was of a piece and all the performers had such parts allotted them as contributed to one uniform and regular design  at the age of twentyfive he bore away the prize from his master aeschylus in tragedy an extraordinary occasion was the cause of this contention cimon the athenian general had found the bones of theseus and brought them in solemn pomp to the city on which a trial of skill between the tragedians was instantly appointed aeschylus and sopohcles strove nobly for preeminence but in spite of the acknowledged and admired merit of the master the superior fire and eloquence of the scholar bore away the palm  before sophocles the prize was disputed by four dramatic pieces comprised under the name of tetralogy the three first were tragedies and the fourth called satire being a species of comedy but this sophicles altered by opposing in all contentions tragedy to tragedy  sophocles did not always appear in his tragedies on account of the weakness of his voice his ame was not however diminished by this for if aeschylus merited the title of father of tragedy sophocles might with propriety be called the master of it the admiration and wonder with which all greece spoke of his wisdom induced an opinion that he was the immediate favorite and intimate of the gods we are told that aeschylus condescended to visit him at his house and tully would have you believe that hercules had an equal respect for him apollonius tyanensis in his oration before domitian tells the emperor that sophocles the athenian was able to check and restrain the impetuousity of the winds  certainly he was a genius of transcendant merit his tragedies served as a model for aristotles art of poetry platos advances in philosophy were compared with the improvements of sophocles in tragedy tully calls him the divine poet and virgil has given him a marking preference to all other writers of tragedy so charming was his poetry that he was called the be and to transmit this eulogium to posterity a hive was carved upon his tomb not less to impress the world with an idea of the sweetness of his verse than the diligence of his industry  sophocles like his predecessor aeschylus was ranked among the defenders of his country he commanded an army in conjunction with pericles to chastise the rebellious samians from which expedition he returned triumphant his same followed him in every thing he undertook even to old age at which time he is reported to have retained his faculties with all the fire and vigor of youth and of this there is a remarkable instance  sophocles had four sons who tired with so long a dependence on an old man represented him to the judges as a drivler and a person incapable of governing his family or taking charge of his affairs sophocles confounded them by a trait which they little expected he had just finished his oedipus of colonos and all his answer to this unjust accusation was a request that the judges would read his tragedy they did so and found in it such strength of mind such beauty such truth and such persuasion that they dismissed him with an acclamation of praise and his sons covered with confusion nay lucian who tells the story adds that the sons were voted madmen for having accused him  there are three different accounts of the death of sophocles pliny and valerius maximus say that he died of excess of joy in his ninetyfifth year at the success of one of his tragedies others say that in reciting his tragedy of antigonus he kept his breath so long that it stopped the action of his lungs but lucian tells us that he was choked by a grape stone it is not wonderful that a man of ninetyfive should die suddenly nor that his death should be accelerated by an extraordinary effort of both mind and body we may therefore believe that sophocles died immediately upon his great success in gaining a prize so late in life it is also probable that a grape stone might accidently hasten his end but the very same thing is told of anacreon and the assertion has ever i believe been considered more as poetic than true   plutarch says that one of the sons of sophocles was a cotemporary writer with his father and from other authors we learn that another of his sons and two nephews wrote pieces both tragic and lyric we know nothing however of these pieces or even of their titles  euripides according to some was born at phyla a town of attica and according to others at salamis about the first year of the seventyfifth olympiad he is said to have been the pupil of anaxagoras and intimately known to socrates he fortunately discovered the works of heraclitus which were hid in the temple of diana and from this commerce with these sages and the advantage he reaped from consulting them and reading their works sprung that luminous moral which pervaded his tragedies  suidas says that the mother of euripides was nobly descended though aristophanes calls her a cabbage seller and valerius maximus taking the assertion which was probably a jest for truth gravely records it it should seem however that his parents were persons of some consideration for they consulted the oracle of apollo concerning him before he was born and having received an ambiguous promise that the world should witness his fame and that he should gain a crown they bred up their son in a proper manner to qualify him for a wrestler under an idea that the oracle meant no more than that he should obtain the athletic crown which he actually did at the feasts in honor of ceres  the genius of euripides however soon impelled him to abandon the exercises of the body for the exercises of the mind and first he studied painting in which he is said to have made a considerable progress but morality and philosophy were the studies most congenial to his mind and as these philosophy particularly had not yet been so much the drift of dramatic representations as he wished he determined to add this perfection to the stage  this gift which he possessed in an eminent degree though he improved the stage in no other respect begat for him a most extraordinary portion of cotemporary fame his pieces are not spoken so highly of as to perfectness as those of sophocles but the verses they contained were in the mouths of all countries where the greeks were known if prisoners pleaded their cause in the language of euripides their reward was life and liberty  he was called the philosophic poet alexander is said to have admired him above all other writers socrates who never had been accustomed to visit the theater went there to hear the tragedies of euripides demosthenes learnt declamation from them and cicero was in the act of reading them when he was surrounded and assasinated  nevertheless it cannot be said that euripides did so much for the posthumous fame of the drama or its real interest as sophocles the chorus which sophocles had regulated euripides altered and made it entirely independent of the main business aristotle gives sophocles the preference in manners economy and style dionysius harlicarnassensis commends sophocles for choosing the most generous and most noble passions for his subjects whereas euripides chose dishonest abject and essiminate passions and again because sophocles never says any thing but what is exactly necessary while euripides amuses the reader with oratorical deductions  in short the general agreement between all those who have written of these admirable authors is that one amused the other convinced one appealed to the passions the other to reason one had the peculiar gift of imposing any thing for truth the other had no eloquence but what was derived from truth itself  euripides it is said wrote ninetytwo tragedies but the general belief is that he wrote no more than seventyfive nineteen of which are extant and the titles of fourteen others are recorded but the pieces themselves are not known like aeschylus and sophocles he met with an extraordinary death  about a year after the sicilians were defeated he left athens and went to reside at the court of macedon being invited by archilaus who was accustomed to confer acts of munificence on learned men and even to raise them to very high honors euripides if solinus speaks truth was made his prime minister  one evening in a wood whether he had wandered in deep contemplation he was surrounded by dogs and torn to pieces different causes are assigned for this unfortunate death some say that the dogs were let loose upon him by his rivals who had reason enough to be jealous of those high distinctions paid to him by archelaus others that the whole was purely an accident for that having strayed while he was lost in meditation near a part of the palace which was guarded by these dogs as a security against depredators he was there surprised and thus became their victim  exaggerated accounts go so far as to say that euripides was torn to pieces by women in revenge for his having exclaimed against them in his tragedies historians are so extremely fond of introducing similar circumstances into the deaths of their celebrated men that we should be wary as to the degree of credit we give them who does not see in this report of euripides that his biographer has borrowed for him the death of orpheus who met with a similar fate from the women of thrace exactly as sophocles has been given the death of anacreon but on what ground must the assertion stand if it be true and we are gravely informed it is so that there was no such person as orpheus that his adventures are a fable and that his works which are supposed to have been transmitted from the ancients and lately discovered are written by the ingenious and learned dr jorton but to go on a little further with euripides not only the novelty of his extraordinary death is given to him but his tomb is said to have been struck with lightning as a seal of divinity which the memory of no man ever was honored with before except lycurgus the lawgiver  but to this no credit has been given indeed the general belief is that either by accident or design he met with the death above related  with sophocles who lived before and died after euripides this assertion bears itself out as well as most of those which pretend to ascertain any thing concerning antiquity the majority of writers agree that sophocles was ninetyfive when he died if so he must have lived three years after euripides there is however a respectable chronological table which says that he died at ninetyone and that euripides lived a year after him  died also every hope of advancement in tragedy a great number of authors are said to have written tragedies and to have borne away many prizes but we know nothing of them of sufficient celebrity to render their names worthy of particular notice for they grew at last into such disrepute that their productions only served as food for the insatiate appetite of aristophanes by whom none of them were spared and nothing can be so strong a proof of degeneracy in tragedy as its falling successfully under the lash of the comic muse  dionysius the tyrant of sicily was ambitious to be ranked among the tragic poets lucian says that he procured some tablets on which aeschylus had set down memorandums that served as the ground work of his pieces and possessed of these he thought he had come at the whole mystery but he was miserably deceived no one gave him that credit which he flattered himself he merited to induce a general belief of his talents he endeavored to make the poet philoxenus philoxenus was the scholar of telestus a poet of some reputation they both wrote dithyrambics but neither of them regular tragedy  whose pliability as a courtier he had reason to count upon bolster up his fame by testifying a full approbation of his verses in this however he failed the poet flexible in all other things was obstinate when touched on the side of his professional judgment to requite his sincerity dionysius committed him to prison but after a time remanded him in hopes that his sufferings in confinement would make him something more accommodating being informed upon what condition he was released carry me back to prison said the poet this firmness moved dionysius who pardoned philoxenus and treated him ever afterward with consideration and respect of louis the fourteenth who was as fond of encouraging as of emulating the merit of poets they tell a story exactly the reverse of this he showed some verses to a courtier and asked his opinion of them who returned for answer that they were very bad i thought so said he for i wrote them myself upon this the courtier begged leave to reconsider them no no said the king i shall not suffer that its of more consequence that you should speak truth than that i should write good verses   he was not however cured of his poetic propensity for though we know nothing of the pieces he wrote it is allowed there were several of them and though no one has attempted to speak in favor of them pliny says that like sophocles he died for joy at obtaining a prize the merit of which plutacrh attributes to antiphon one of the sons of sophocles  greece rendered the most distinguished honors both to the works and the memory of her three tragic poets an edict was issued to erect their statues their works were preserved and the greatest part entered in the archives ptolemy king of egypt was very anxious to be in possession of them and above all of the works of euripides to embellish his alexandrian library but they were refused and he in his turn refused corn to the athenians during a dearth necessity at length obliged the athenians to comply with his request and he in return nobly permitted the athenian merchants to import as much corn as they pleased without paying the ordinary tribute  it was a custom at athens in the lyric spectacles to sing the great actions of their chiefs themistocles was one day asked which voice pleased him the best that replied he which sings my praises  sophocles and euripides were set against each other by false friends and their animosity became continual amusement for all the wouldbewits of greece  time however convinced these great men of their mutual error as may be seen in the following letter from euripides  inconstancy is not my character i have retained every friend except sophocles though i no longer see him i do not hate him injustice has alienated me from him justice reproaches me for it i hope time will cement our reunion what mortal ill is not caused at times by those wicked spirits who are never so happy as when they sow dissension among those who by nature and reason are meant to promote the felicity of each other  as an instance how chaste and moral the grecian poets were obliged to be euripides having in his tragedy of belephoron which is now lost made one of his characters say riches are the sovereign good of mankind and may well excite the admiration of men and gods the spectators rose and would have banished the poet from the town had they not found at the finish of the piece that the panegyrist in favor of riches by way of poetical justice met with a miserable and merited death  ten judges were chosen at athens to decide what pieces merited the preference they had places set apart for them they were men of wellknown merit and strict integrity they took an oath to decide equitably and without the smallest regard to solicitations from any quarter how different in england the only description of critics who pretend to decide on the theatrical productions here are the editors of newspapers these however are so little like the athenian judges that instead of paying no regard to private solicitations they never write but in conformity with the wishes of all the parties concerned free tickets the admission now and then of an execrable farce secret intelligence with actresses and female authors and other corrupt influence blunt the edge of their satire which indeed would be dull enough at any rate but it were charity to wish that this should continue for as they have not judgment to decide equitably were they to take an oath so to do it is not impossible but a critique might now and then turn out a perjury  their authority extended so far that they had a right not only to recompense men of merit but to punish even to whipping those who were destitute of it this i would not wish to have in england for in that case good heaven how many poets should we see at the carts tail  lucian tells us of one evangelus who was whipped and it is said that sophocles was adjudged upon a certain occasion the prefectorship of samos  but the incorporating national events with dramatic poetry seems to have been the happiest and most meritorious perfection which the three tragic poets of greece attained sentiments of greatness attributed to one hero often spoke the eulogium of another aeschylus in the chiefs before thebes says speaking of amphiarus to be and not to seem is this mans maxim his mind reposes on its proper wisdom and wants no other praise    when these lines were repeated on the stage the eyes of the whole assembly were involuntarily fixed on aristides to whom this great encomium appeared most applicable and who in his own conduct had modelled the man upon the sentiment of the poet  in short the grecian tragedies were a patriotic concern a public benefit a bond between men and morals and was therefore sanctioned by the legislature and maintained at the expense of the nation  chap v aristophanes and menander and the progress of comedy in greece the real pleasure resulting from comedy without doubt is founded on that spurious pride which delights the human heart when human nature is humiliated strange paradox yet clear as light  who does not feel himself proud when the frailties of his neighbor are held up to derision who that would choke with spleen at the exposition of his own folly does not rejoice with all his soul when the follies of others are laid open to public view yet this ever was and is still considered as the true drift of comedy falsely however for lash the manners how you may you cannot correct them on the contrary they will grow more callous at every stroke and what is worse every stroke will become more familiar and consequently more tolerable  the fault seems to be that comedy has been given a latitude by much too extensive and as human frailties up from the most pardonable folly to the most malicious vice are a field immeasurable all those dramatic productions which have traversed this prodigious space according as customs and manners have varied according as times and circumstances have inclined the public pleasure or policy to tolerate them and according to a number of other local and temporary circumstances have been denominated comedies  it will be no difficulty however even so early as when the theater came to be regulated in greece to show that the particular province of each dramatic production was known and clearly understood and though in speaking of the productions of aristophanes i shall be compelled to show that comedy fluctuated and became irregular it was only in conformity with those manners of which it was bound to be the faithful representative and without which no dramatic writer can be popular  although all dramatic representations were confounded for a time in the word tragedy which we have seen had not at all originally the signification which we now annex to it nothing can be clearer than that the species of performance which the french call a drame and we a play was what the greeks understood as the model and criterion of their theatrical productions the word is derived from the greek and signifies literally action the most honorable designation of a dramatic piece for without action it could have neither interest nor life  plays represent mankind in their common and natural pursuits tragedies and comedies call them into such actions as they are not accustomed to but upon extraordinary occasions a play has the pathetic of tragedy and the playfulness of comedy and is in a general acceptance infinitely more useful more true and more interesting the end of tragedy is to make you cry the end of comedy to make you laugh i have read of a poet who describing the nature of his employment to a clown tells him that among other things he writes tragedies and comedies what be they cries clodpole why works of genius said the poet one calculated to make you laugh and the other to make you cry i like well enough said the countryman any thing that is to make me laugh but i cannot see why a plague you should want to make me cry hold your tongue said the poet let me explain myself tragedies you see are full of great heroes who commit such glorious crimes who talk with gods play with lightning get drunk with vanity and at last kill themselves with an air so noble and magnificent here the countryman laughed with all his force why what the devil do you laugh at said the poet laugh why how can a body help it said the countryman one may really see it is comical if it be all like the sketch you geaved me of it pooh pooh be quiet said the poet you mistake the matter tragedies are to make you cry and then we have comedies where we represent all the follies and absurdities of mankind od said the countryman that be serous enough i would forgive the folk for crying at that why here is a strange fellow said the poet laughs when he should cry and cries when he should laugh and here is a strange poet said the countryman if you go to that writes things to make people cry when they should laugh and laugh when they should cry  but a play excites both sensations without violating either of them to start an involuntary tear as a tribute of sympathy to domestic woe is a greater luxury than to expand a torrent of tears at the death of a heroine and a single benevolent smile excited by a benificent action the result of nature and goodness gladdens the mind more than a convulsion of laughter at the peculiarities of a fellow creature who though deformed in his manners is perhaps perfect in his heart  plays then as i shall have better opportunity to prove hereafter are the parent stock of the drama from which on one side sprung tragedy which degenerated into bombast and on the other side comedy which degraded itself into buffoonery  comedy certainly was attempted in greece at the time of thespis and perhaps earlier phrynichus is sometimes called the comic poet and there are appearances which justify this appellation his pieces very likely were kind of masks and if he was the inventor of the tetralogy or if it was invented in his time he of course wrote satire as well as tragedy and in the original satires which were the foundation of those comedies written by aristophanes the names of persons were not spared when alcibiades was accused of having mutilated the statues of the gods and other sacriligious crimes the names of his accusers among whom were dioclides and teucer were made sport of from the stage and phrynichus has this passage in one of his pieces good hermes pray beware a fall nor break thy marble nose lest some false dioclides once more his shafts in fatal poison drench  merc i will nor ever again shall that informer teucer that faithless stranger boast from me rewards for perjury     the satire in particular levelled at pericles will show that they were not accustomed to use ceremony cratinas telecides eupolus and plato all comic poets were perpetually aiming their satirical shafts at this monarch and as personal defects were always unmercifully turned into jest so the head of pericles which was disproportionably long and which is therefore hid as much as possible in all the statues of him by an enormous helmet was the constant but of their ridicule cratinas in his play called chirones has this passage faction received old time to her embraces hence came a tyrantspawn on earth called pericles in heaven the headcompeller  alluding to jupiter who in homer and every where else is continually called the cloudcompeller  telecides has this passage now in a maze of thought he ruminates on strange expedients while his head depressed with its own weight sinks on his knees and now from the vast caverns of his brain burst forth storms and fierce thunders       comedy however though it was occasionally introduced boasted no great reputation till after tragedy had grown to perfection and it is not an unlikely conjecture that the fiat of sophocles which had broken the tetralogy and kept tragedy apart as a separate province having reduced comedy to shift for itself it from necessity resumed sufficient strength to go alone for we soon after this see that it began to be exercised systematically  comedy having always been considered as a vehicle to hold folly up to ridicule it took a different bent according to the spirit of the times when the supreme power was in the people the poets of course were at full liberty to say unsparingly what they pleased and of whom they pleased neither quality office age or sex were spared every one was reproached by name there are opinions that this gave rise to the institution of the ten judges to whom were given the power of whipping authors who had falsely represented the follies of their fellow citizens and therefore arrogated a right to scourge others but this does not appear to be fairly the fact it should seem that these judges were originally appointed at the time when sophocles bore away the prize from aeschylus and plutarch is very particular on this head the probability is this arbitrators who adjudged prizes to merit there were certainly of some description or other even as far back as theseus and perhaps earlier in proportion as merit became more perfect and more dicided the power of these judges increased and the judges themselves were chosen out of more respectable tribes till at length finding the comic poets so formidable it was necessary to oppose authority to licentiousness and therefore the judges were given a power to humiliate and degrade by corporal punishment all those who had unworthily endeavored to humiliate and degrade innocent and inoffensive characters a meritorious restriction for while it encouraged the comic muse to speak plain it prevented her from offering falsehood  and his species of comedy was called the ancient or the real because it convinced by speaking truth  when the people began to lose their power and their liberties were vested in fewer hands it was no longer safe to use so bold a license the poets therefore had recourse to a second distinction of comedy where the subject was real and the character were feigned and this was called the middle comedy because though it still contained truth it could only wound by companion the spirit however of the middle comedy did not want for boldness as the following anecdote of philippides will prove stratocles the servile and abject flatterer of demetrius and other persons of the same description inveighed against the dramatic writers on account of the liberties they took with their vices these satirists avenged their cause with great spirit stratocles and the rest procured demetrius when he visited athens to be received with the same honors as ceres and bacchus they even went so far as to change the term dionysia or feasts of bacchus to demetria the gods were said in have been offended at this the veil which held the figures of demetrius and antigonus together with jupiter and minerva was rent asunder by a sudden storm hemlock grew up near their altars and one day when the dionysia were to be celebrated the procession was stopped by an excessive and unseasonable cold which blasted the corn the vines and the fig trees the comic poets immediately attacked stratocles and the other flatterers who was the cause said philippides in one of his comedies that our vines were blasted by the frost and that our sacred veil was rent assunder he who transferred the honor of the gods to men it is he not comedy that is the ruin of the people   at length truth even by comparison suited ill with the luxury of the times and the poets were obliged to invent both names and circumstances so that if an application hit ever so hard no man was obliged to acknowledge the blow he had received and this sort of comedy the whole being fictitious was called the new this last however ill suited the temper of the greeks and it grew into no repute till it was received among the romans  aristophanes the boldness of whose writings spared neither friend nor foe gave to the middle comedy all the force of the ancient or real the place of his birth is contested his enemies of which he had deservedly a great number represent him as a stranger and his advocates who were more so out of fear than love insist that he was an athenian his pieces were chiefly written during the pelopennesian war so that he was a cotemporary of plato and socrates his reputation arose from his being an inveterate enemy to all those who wished to enslave their country though his style was by no means refined his imagination was warm and lively and his railery irresistably keen and cutting which he laid on unsparingly and with a spirit of unfeeling resolution  aristophanes was remarkable for exposing the vices of men in power which he did with uncommon wit and severity cleo was the first he attacked for which purpose he wrote the comedy of the equites none of the actors however would venture to personate a man who possessed so much power and therefore aristophanes determined to perform the part himself this he did with so much success that the athenians obliged cleo to give a fine of five talents to the poet madame dacier of whom aristophanes seems to have been a prodigious favorite says in her preface to the translation of his works that his ridicule of cleo was so favorably received by the athenians that they cast flowers upon the head of the author and carried him through the streets with the most unbounded applause they also she tells us and she seems to have taken a great deal of pains to be certain of the fact made a decree that he should be honored with a crown of the sacred olive tree in the citadel as a distinction of the highest nature that could be paid to a citizen   his comedy of the clouds seems to be the most celebrated of all his works both on account of its severity and the mischief it occasioned  it is by many believed that aristophanes in a great measure occasioned the death of socrates at any rate that poet was very culpable in publicly accusing the philosopher of impiety in his comedy of the clouds madame dacier translated this comedy and not contented with that is said to have read it over two hundred times and every time with fresh pleasure socrates was a man of inoffensive and irreproachable manners he disapproved of the licentiousness of the comic poets both in their writings and in their conduct  for this he was thought a proper object of satire for this aristophanes became the terror of virtue and the idle of athens and madame dacier  it was certainly his most celebrated piece and therefore it is supposed he had some strong inducement to take so much pains with it this is said to be the history of the transaction  anytus and his party left no method untried to compass the destruction of socrates but they feared the athenians who loved him would revolt at any ouverte measures they therefore had recourse to stratagem to execute which they employed aristophanes this artful and habile satirist who knew so well to apply his arguments that they never failed of their full force undertook the task he had long looked on the austere manners of socrates as a fit subject on which to employ the gall that distilled from his pen he accused him in the open theater of being an eloquent seducer who by the charms of his language and the witchery of his arguments was speciously capable of reconciling every possible contradiction that through the medium of this winning deceit he had deluded the people and broached the most dangerous doctrines that he despised the gods and inspired all those who listened to him with errors tending to produce the most serious and alarming consequences  aristophanes played upon the subject with the same glare of false reasoning of which he had accused socrates and while he labored to make it appear that another had imposed upon them his own imposition was but too successful the athenians had not the smallest expectation that any one would dare to broach such bold accusations and therefore at first felt some resentment but being naturally distrustful of all distinguished and extraordinary men this comedy began to gain ground and at length for prejudice knows not where to stop became more celebrated than any thing that had been exhibited in greece  it cannot however but be allowed that though all the ancients admired aristophanes for the true attic elegance of his style and though the moderns have in this as in other things very often they knew not why yielded a blind obedience to the ancients yet it were better that aristophanes had never lived or that he had employed his talents to worthier purposes for however he might have been admired by st chrysostom who always laid him under his pillow when he went to bed however scaliger may insist that no one ought to judge of the attic dialect who had not aristophanes at his fingers ends however frischlin may have entered the lists with plutarch in his defense however rymer may have been euchanted with his strange fetches his lucky starts his odd inventions his wild turns returns and counter turns finishing his rhapsody by the anticlimax of comparing him to the mad rabelais and to bring up the rear respectably however madame dacier might have affected to receive so much rapturous delight from that wit which had been the death of a man who was an honor to his country yet the more poignant his wit the more brilliant his genius and the more consummate his judgment his indiscriminate exercise of those talents his wickedly and wantonly confounding socrates with cleo and thereby preverting the principles of morality his parodying sophocles and euripides turning into ridicule the works of those admirable writers the study of whose lives had been to make their fellow citizens honest and honorable and thereby establishing stamped with the consequence of his authority to which the people were accustomed to look up to as a fiat a criterion for meaner writers to ridicule every thing noble and worthy these however they may establish his reputation as a writer must destroy it as a member of society and whatever opinion may be entertained of his wit a most despicable one must be formed of his morals  aristophanes is said to have written above fifty comedies eleven of which are extant and some of them are printed in different languages madame dacier with all her admiration of him seems to have thought only two worthy of selection which are plutus and the clouds these she published with critical notes and an examination of them according to the rules of the theater  we know nothing of when or where aristophanes died so that all his extraordinary fortune happened to him in his life time  after aristophanes the middle comedy gradually declined for as the wits that came after him had not the merit to imitate him in his bold and satirical style of writing their minor abilities naturally turned to the false and feeble parts of his works in which he dishonored his genius by pityful parodies of writings infinitely more valuable to the cause of truth and literature than his own  it was however the sat of greece that the stage should be once more rescued from barbarism menander who was born at athens in the third year of the hundred and ninth olympiad introduced the new comedy and thereby refined an art that had been exercised for fifty years with the most unbridled profligacy and licentiousness his incomparable merit quickly spread his name to the remotest nations pliny says that the kings of egypt and macedon gave a noble proof of their admiration of him by sending ambassadors and even fleets to bring him to their courts but menander was too much of a philosopher to be tempted by the promises of the great  the time continuing however corrupt his countrymen denied him that merit which he was allowed by strangers and therefore established in his favor the strongest possible proof of his superior genius this contumely he pitied and forgave and though through the ignorance and partiality of the judges he often saw the prize awarded to philemon a miserable cotemporary poet he bore it with perfect indifference the only notice he ever took of it being when he asked philemon whether he did not blush to wear the laurel  menander is said to have written above a hundred comedies which are all unfortunately lost we can only come at his works therefore through terence who borrowed four plays from him though some say six which are allowed to have lost much of their original spirit  we know therefore but little of menander but that little may serve to give an exalted idea of his reputation he seems to have been in comedy what euripides was in tragedy the old rhetoricians recommend his works as the true and perfect patterns of every thing beautiful and graceful in public speaking quintilian advises an orator to seek in menander for copiousness of invention for elegance of expression and all that universal genius which is able to accommodate itself to persons things and affections  menanders wonderful talent of portraying nature in every condition and under every accident of life occasioned that memorable question of aristophanes the grammarian oh menander oh nature which of you have copied the works of the other ovid and plutarch have paid the tribute of praise to his reputation but caesar in calling terence a half menander has seemed to give a critical idea of his exellence by allowing him double the merit of the roman poet whose extraordinary value as a writer he is recording at the minute he makes the remark  menander died in the third year of the hundred and twentysecond olympiad and after him there is nothing worthy to be related of the dramatic art in greece  chap vi actors and the conclusion of the grecian theater actors were held in honorable esteem in greece but this is only saying that the greeks honored all those whose pursuits were stimulated by any meritorious emulation  i shall however prmise that the arts which flourished in perfection at athens were little known or relished in sparta and it cannot but be considered as remarkable that the greeks who were in fact but one people should be divided into two kingdoms merely from manners habits and modes of thinking  this however taken one way may tell to the honor of the spartans their manners were so austere and their conduct so exact that they rejected every thing superfluous and though amusements poetry and music in particular were but little encouraged among them yet such as they had a taste for consisted of pure simplicity and dignified expression terpander who was both a poet and a musician pindar and other eminent men though not spartans were admired in sparta  any thing but the mere sentiment in music and poetry and its force and influence on the mind the lacedaemonians rejected even when lycurgus instituted the senate of thirty including the two kings they met in the open air under an idea that a hall or building of any kind prepared for the purpose might amuse the attention with such trifles as pictures or statutes and splendid ornaments instead of occupying it on subjects relative to the general welfare  theaters in like manner were discouraged agesilaus who reigned in sparta fortyone years held the theater in contempt one day callipedes a celebrated greek tragedian approached agesilaus and paid his respects to him and having waited a considerable time in expectation that some honorable notice would be taken of him said at last do you not know me sir the king looking at him with a contemptuous disdain said are you not callipedes the stage player another time agesilaus was asked to hear a mimic who imitated the nightingale to perfection no said he i have heard the nightingale herself  nay this dislike or rather severity of manners extended even to their slaves when the thebans invaded laconia they took prisoners a number of the helotes whom they ordered to sing the odes of terpander alemon or spendon the lacedemonian but they excused themselves saying that it was forbidden by their masters phyrnis the musician added two strings to the harp making them in all nine these two strings were afterward taken away but timothean the famous dithyrambic poet and musician extended the number of strings to twelve he was however severely punished by the rigid spartans under an idea that luxury of sound would esseminate the people   but if the dramatic art was slighted in sparta it was caressed with enthusiasm in athens and indeed in all the countries into which the grecians penetrated every general of any eminence had in his camp his poets his musicians and his declamers in the camp of alexander hephestian gave to evius the musician the quarters destined for eumenes who thus affronted complained to alexander and said that he saw plainly the best way to acquire promotion would be to throw away their arms and learn to play upon the flute or turn tragedian  indeed alexander proud as he was considered it no degradation to countenance actors and even to place a confidence in them having an opinion of the wit and readiness nay the discretion and honor of thessalus the actor he sent him on an embasy to pexodorus the persian governor in caria to break off a match between the eldest daughter of that chief and aridaeus  at alexanders return to phoenecia from egypt the people at the sacrifices were entertained with music and dancing and tragedies were also performed with the greatest magnificence besides the persons usually chosen by lot from the tribes to conduct those exhibitions nicocreon king of salamis and pasicrates king of soli particularly distinguished themselves upon this occasion pasicrates risked the victory upon athenodorus the actor and nicocreon upon thessalus alexander interested himself most anxiously in behalf of the latter he did not however lest the assembly should be biassed declare in his favor till athenodorus was proclaimed victor by all the suffrages when he exclaimed that he commended the judges for what they had done but that he would have given half his kingdom rather than have seen thessalus conquered  alexander had an opportunity afterward of showing how unprejudiced his mind was when the same athenodorus was fined by the athenians for not making his appearance on the stage at the feasts of bacchus he entreated alexander to intercede for him who though he did not chose to write in his favor paid the fine  another time lycon the actor a native of scarphia finding that his performance delighted alexander insinuated adroitly in his part that he was in necessity for ten talents alexander laughed at the conceit and ordered the actor what he so ingeniously demanded  but the instances of admiration in which the talents and conduct of the grecian actors were held are innumerable we have already seen that aeschylus sophocles and euripides were all actors and indeed so were most of the grecian dramatic writers had not aristophanes been an excellent actor the world would have lost the hateful character of cleo  thus declamation at athens was the criterion of oratory polus an actor had lost his only child whom he tenderly loved and he was on that day to perform a part which had an incident similar to his own situation to render his grief more lively and natural he took an urn containing the ashes of his son which so wrought upon his feelings that he drew tears from the whole assembly  in short declamation was esteemed a great requisite toward obtaining a rank in public life the first men of athens did not disdain to practice it nevertheless actors were not permitted to judge of the merit of public entertainments  when demosthenes complained that the worst orators were heard in the rostrum in preference to him satyrus the actor to show him how much grace dignity and action add to the celebrity of a public man repeated to him several passages from sophocles and euripides with which demosthenes was so captivated that he ever afterward modelled his eloquence from the example of the best actors we shall see more of this when we get among the romans   we have now seen that the dramatic art is traceable in greece to theseus theseus after he had deserted adriadne in return for her having given him the clue to the labyrinth of crete by which means he conquered the minotaur put in at delos where he sacrificed to apollo first having dedicated a statue of venus which he had received as a present from ariadne this ceremony or dance by various involutions and evolutions resembled the labyrinth and was therefore called the crane in imitation of that bird which in its flight always takes a circular direction theseus is said to have been so pleased with it that he instituted games at delos where began the custom of giving a palm to the victor  that it gradually came forward till it was perfected by aeschylus that the admirable talents of aeschylus sophocles and euripides were superior when the infancy of the drama is considered to any triumvirate since that time that this great compact once broken comedy particularly in the hands of aristophanes degenerated into licentiousness and that the incomparable talents of menander came too late to save the sinking interest of the stage  it remains now only to say that from the parodies of the tragic writers began by aristophanes and awkwardly imitated by his cotemporaries and successors sprung mimes farces and the grossest buffoonery when the athentan theater by the introduction of puerilities lost its honor it lost its consequence and degenerated in credit as it degenerated in virtue what then shall we say when we consider that the same abuses which procured the disgrace of the grecian stage should ensure the reputation of the english  and though the grecian theater still kept up an appearance of greatness and there was often some brilliancy beamed across the hetrogeneous mass which obscured that truth and nature to which the people were no longer sensible yet the grandeur and magnificence of public exhibitions visibly decreased till at length the fate of the stage too truly foretold the fate of the empire so certain it is that where the arts are redundant they introduce luxury and sap the foundation of a state  chap vii roman theater from its origin to the time of livius andronicus what nature was to the greeks the greeks were to the romans it is remarkable but by no means astonishing that the same may be said of all nations in proportion as civilization extended itself for we may go on and say that what the greeks were to the french the french were to us it does not however follow that the dramatic art has gradually declined since the time of the greeks for the french improved upon the romans and we have in great measure improved upon the french but it follows nevertheless that if aeschylus sophocles euripides and menander had never been born the theater might at this moment have retained its original barbarity  and the resemblance is remarkably perfect for as the greeks attained a splendid degree of perfection by a close imitation of nature the romans never arrived to any distinguished perfection because they imitated man but indeed in greatness of soul and strength of mind they were in every thing infinitely below the greeks a people whose luxury was to enjoy a spectacle of gladiators were little calculated to listen to lectures of truth and morality the ferocious romans were always rather terrible than great and the mind accommodates itself ill to a belief that the same men could attend with any degree of pleasure or interest to whatever inculcated the mild duties of clemency and beneficence who in cold blood could murder their defenseless sovereign at the foot of the capitol  all writers agree that the romans arrived to no degree of perfection in either literature or the arts and in particular the stage but as they copied the greeks and that even of the stage their copies are faint indeed the pompous and phlegmatic seneca falsely called the tragic poet with his fettered and dependant style lagged far behind the greek triumvirate the cold terence though full of nature and grace imprinted nothing on the mind congenial to the roman character the subjects were greek but they were enfeebled and spiritless and only served to excite regret in those who knew how to taste the muse of menander  the romans were nearly four hundred years without any scenic representations but it is not to be supposed that they were so long without any sort of poetry or that some selfborn amusement did not manifest itself with them as it did with the greeks on the contrary monsters of this description were born and nursed by feasts and debauches their first poetry which was called saturnine and fescinine was hard and crude resembling rather prose in cadence than measured verse in other respects it was full of gross raillery and sung by persons who accompanied it with gestures and postures the most indecent and lascivious  this barbarous stuff gave place to raillery more refined but which however became so severe and sarcastic that those at whom it was levelled not liking these sort of jests retorted the kindness manually till at length it caused so much mischief that a law was made which condemned to death any person who in their verses should wound the reputation of his neighbor this law was made in the three hundred and second year of rome a certain proof that this licentiousness had obtained and that they had grown sufficiently civilized at that time to suppress it  this reform lasted a hundred years at the end of which time a public calamity induced them to seize every opportunity to appease the anger of heaven and thus feasts in honor of the gods became after a time theatrical performances  these were however according to titus livy irregular sketches made up wholly of imitation baladines who came from tuscany danced to the sound of the flute and exhibited a number of rude gestures and attitudes in the manner of that country this amusement was received with the warmest applause and after repeated trials and improvements it became more endurable regular troops named histrions because in the tuscan language a baladine is called hister performed complete pieces entitled satires in which the actors and the spectators joined promiscuously  these kind of farces continued about a hundred and twenty years when the poet andronicus about the time aratus called in aticonous from macedonia which proved the ruin of greece about two hundred and forty years after the death of aeschylus and about a hundred and eighty years after the death of sophocles and euripides brought forward the first perfect dramatic piece in rome  chap viii livius andronicus pacuvius accius livius andronicus pacuvius and accius were the earliest poets in rome hopace gives to livius the reputation of invention to pacuvius the merit of regularity and to accius the advantage of sublimity  and seneca and the progress of tragedy in rome andronicus surnamed livius because he obtained his freedom through livius salinator to whose children he was preceptor was a native of greece it is said that despairing of any improvement in the roman theater he sung his pieces in the manner of his predecessors but one day as he was surrounded by the populace being extremely fatigued he called in the assistance of a slave who relieved him while he fetched breath the slave however not acquitting himself to the satisfaction of his master he expostulated with him upon this the spectators supposing their altercation to be a part of the piece were so entertained with it that from thence dialogue was adopted  it is much more probable that being himself a greek and having escaped from the wreck of the grecian theater livius bore away with him such part of its treasure as the storm had spared and as a fit opportunity for his purpose occurred at the end of the first punic war when the temple of janus was shut for the second time since the foundation of rome and when the romans were in friendship with all the world he took his measures and in pity to the wretched state of their drama ventured to innovate upon a more rational taste  this he did to so good a purpose that certainly for a time the romans rejected all their former rude and impure dramatic customs and under the tuition of andronicus determined to regulate their taste on the grecian model indeed it will be difficult to controvert that through andronicus and ennius whom suetonius tells us were half greeks the cause of literature at this favorable period became completely established  whatever the merit of andronicus might have been except giving to roman taste grecian refinement is very uncertain he is spoken of in general only collaterally and but for ennius with whom he is often coupled and who some tragedies translated from the greek excepted has no right to be considered as a dramatic poet we should know very little about his particular talents it is certain however that andronicus turned the tide of opinion for a time but the romans ever changeable at last grew tired of tragedy which having for some time undergone a suspension was at last restored by pacuvius  it is not exactly ascertained when pacuvius was born but he flourished as a tragic poet in rome about sixty years after andronicus first began to be known and if it be true what some contend tragedy had still a smack of its parent stock for he is said to have been the grandson of ennius  pacuvius however though he restored tragedy as far as the fluctuating manners of the romans would admit certainly did little more for we know of nothing he produced of any celebrity and though he successfuly kept the grecian taste afloat and thus regulated the wild and extravagant sallies which in spite of the best care pervaded the roman spectacles yet accius seems to have reaped that harvest of reputation which andronicus and pacuvius had so carefully sown pacuvius was properly by profession a painter and we are informed that his productions in this way had considerable merit pliny tells us in particular that he painted the entire decorations of a temple of hercules in a masterly manner it is still possible that he might being an active dramatic writer   accius was born in the five hundred and eightythird year of rome he became a sort of disciple of pacuvius who brought his last piece on the stage in the very year that accius produced his first by the advice of pacuvius he kept to those subjects which had been already brought forward on the athenian stage not that he confined himself entirely to these for he wrote one piece the story of which was roman and it related to the expulsion of the tarquins it was called brutus we are also informed that he wrote comedies but we know nothing of their titles  what however seems to have given accius more reputation and consequence than any thing else was the verses he wrote in praise of decimus brutus who was honored with a triumph for his victories in spain and who was so charmed upon this occasion with accius that he had the verses inscribed at the entrances of those temples which he caused to be erected out of the spoils of the vanquished and thus we have brutuss word so flattered that accius was an excellent poet  as accius passed through tarentum in his way to asia he paid a visit to pacuvius and read to him his tragedy of atreus which by the advice of his old master he had copied from the greek pacuvius told him that his style was elevated but that it was rude i dont blush at that said accius it will teach me to write better hereafter for it is with genius as it is with fruit apples that are at first four become sweet as they ripen while those which are unseasonably soft and discolored rot before they come to maturity  certainly accius has been censured for writing harsh and crude but in other respects he was allowed to have had considerable merit he was held in such respect that an actor was punished for only mentioning his name on the stage and valerius maximus tells us that when julius caesar entered the assembly of poets accius never paid him the homage of rising to receive him not that he meant to fail in respect but because he considered that the superiority lay on the side of literature and because in such an assembly the question was not whose title was the most illustrious but who was the best writer  accius was asked why he who knew so well how to enforce sentiment and eloquence in his tragedies did not plead because said he at the theater i make them say what i please at the bar my adversaries would say what i should dislike  i shall sum up pacuvius and accius in the words of quintilian who says that those illustrious authors united in their tragedies greatness of thought and energy of style and for the rest if they have not expanded more grace through their works and carried them to a higher degree of perfection the fault was in the time when they wrote and not in them  it is not at this moment decided whether the best roman tragedies which are attributed to an author of the name of seneca are written by seneca the philosopher or him who for distinction is called seneca the tragic poet justus lipsius and erasmus give it in favor of the philosopher ennius however insists that he wrote only the first four his brother the tragic poet three and that the other three are written by three different authors but this dispute has given rise to a hundred conjectures till at length gathering as it has gone father brumoy will have it that neither of the senecas had any hand in these pieces but that they were written by an anonymous author who concealed his own name to substitute one much more celebrated in literature  the probability is that they had both a concern in them all the biographers of seneca the philosopher agree that he wrote four tragedies these his brother might have fathered and he might also have been assisted in the composition of the rest but the other being occupied in studies of a more sublime nature he might have conceived it improper to enter the lists on a subject that would not only have enticed him from his other pursuits but have involved him in inconvenient controversies  leaving this point however as it ever will remain undecided let us examine the tragedies them selves which though they were in places heavy turgid and inflated have many true beauties proving that if taste was sacrificed in them it was as in others a sacrifice to the times  nero whose ridiculous pretensions to works of merit were as vain as his genius was contemptible gave a monstrous and fantastic air to all objects around him the poets took the same tone and seneca was obliged to conform again the extravagance and false dignity with which pieces were at that time represented to impose upon the people the subject was always taken from religion gods were brought on the stage and it was impossible to insert too much bombast in their expressions the eclat introduced into the music of the chorus the mavelous magnificence of the scenes all to be of a piece went prodigiously beyond nature  it was necessary in every way to strike the public with astonishment in proportion as the theaters were enlarged so they enlarged the figures of the actors they walked upon stilts they used a portevoice and covered their faces with masks which resembled those characters they represented all this was necessary to delude a nation who panted to turn now and then from the horrible pictures presented every day to their sight by that unnatural and insatiable monster their sovereign who not content with destroying an infinite number of the most illustrious citizens of rome conniving at poisoning his father attempting to drown his mother and assasinating his wife and his brother to heap up the measure of his abominable crimes sacrificed the very man whom he had compelled to throw this veil over the eyes of his subjects that they might be diverted from the just and equitable revenge which at length to save their sinking honor became the reward of his ignorant pride his despicable cowardice and his diabolical cruelty  nero incorporated the natural cruelty of his character with the artificial subjects on the stage if a poet would write a piece to please him it was impossible to shed too much blood this monstrous mixture of barbarity and love for theatrical representations carried him to the most extravagant lengths he instituted the feasts juvenalia which were celebrated in honor of his mother at the very moment that he meditated her destruction the pomp introduced in these is inconceivable nothing could go beyond the parade except the vanity with which he exposed his incorrigible folly among the rest he offered the produce of his chin when he was shaved for the first time to jupiter capitolinus he obliged persons of the first distinction to perform different parts he himself sung the fable of atis and the bacchantes while burrhus and seneca were commanded to excite the spectarors to applaud  suetonius informs us that when nero performed on the stage he filled his hair with golden powder to resemble apollo and while he sung and accompanied himself with the lyre the soldiers with the point of the sword extorted applause from the people  all this serves to induce a belief that however the stoical austerity and gravity of seneca might incline him to be silent as to the hand he had in those tragedies they were either written or connived at by him and that whatever there is amiss in them he was compelled to admit and whatever excellent sprung from his own genius  it must be allowed that they contained in places some most admirable morality in the choruses in particular there are brilliant sentences filled with superb images and expressed in beautiful verse upon the whole though taken altogether they cannot serve as patterns for dramatic writing though the admirers of the great stoic philosopher may feel there being attributed to him as degrading to the memory of their favorite yet with all their faults and with all his high reputation they contain clogged perhaps and fettered with unworthy and disgraceful passages impelled by the glare of a tyrants falchion sentiments which might legitimately emanate from the soul of seneca  there were other tragic poets among the romans but we know very little of them marcus attilius wrote tragedies but his style was barbarous for so cicero tells us and lucinius calls him the iron poet  publius pomponius who was the relation and intimate friend of pliny wrote tragedies at the time of the emperor claudius who very much admired them publius seems to have written with a more independent spirit than seneca for fabius says that being desired by the emperor to take certain passages out of his pieces he answered i shall appeal to the people he was not less distinguished in the army than on the theater for tacitus tells us that he was once rewarded with the honor of a triumph  sulpitius is spoken of as an author of merit cicero calls him the tragic orator strabo speaks of diodorus of alexandria who acquired considerable reputation in his tragedies athenaeus tells us of leontine ovid of turanius acron of aristius fuscus and propertius of ponthicus but indeed there was scarcely an eminent man among the romans but had something to do with the theater the ancient grammarians have given an account of the thyestus of gracchus the alcmeon of catullus the adrastus of caesar the ajax of augustus the octavio of maecenas and the medea of ovid but they say that these tragedies are all lost and that the loss is not worthy to be regretted  chap ix plautus and terence and the progress of comedy in rome to this moment perhaps comedy has not been critically defined it is not the ancient or the comedy of phrynichus and his followers because there is something shockingly revolting in holding up men by their names and proclaiming their vices and follies to the world and comedy ought not to revolt an audience it is not the middle or the comedy of aristophanes and his followers because though the man is not named if he be not so represented as to be known to all the world the audience cannot be satisfied if he be so known they must be shocked on the side of humanity and comedy ought not to excite either of these consequences it cannot be the new or the comedy of menander and his followers because though in this species of comedy both names and circumstances are feigned yet the license is so wide and diffusive that there is scarcely any province in the whole circle of the drama that it might not embrace and comedy should neither soar nor degenerate  comedy appears then to be the essence of menanders plan applied by an ingenious poet to manners time and place and so managed as to represent common life so exact so animated and so faithful that the author the actors and the spectators may go away satisfied with one another not a portrait but a picture not the likeness of an individual but a resemblance of the whole audience nay of the whole world of human nature every thing above this trenches upon tragedy every thing below it sinks into farce  merely to laugh and to cry is to indulge two emotions of the mind derived from the same origin and which have so very little to do with the heart that one is not always a sign of joy nor the other of grief when i see a character put into all situations but those which are natural to it i think of a groom exercising a managed horse and after becoming fatigued with his bounds his leaps and his caprioles i long to see him walk in short let no poet expect to produce a real comedy who cannot excite every emotion of the soul without unworthily surprising the heart or reproaching the understanding  if this be any thing like the true definition of comedy we must despair of finding it in any repute among the romans for terence came very far short of it in one respect and plautus went very far beyond it in the other and as to any comic writers but those what did they produce but pityful farce and contemptible buffoonery  comedy in rome did not establish itself systematically and by degrees as it did in greece for plautus wrote for the theater during the time of livius andronicus and terence who was nine years old when plautus died must of course have been cotemporary with pacuvius and accius so that every thing serious and comic good and bad came at once and so it was but grecian found a kind welcome among the romans on this account their theater adopted indiscriminately every species of dramatic amusement from the loftiest tragedy to the most miserable farce and that which was absurdest was the most admired  had the taste of the romans admitted of regularity plautus and terence might certainly have gone a great way toward establishing a criterion for comedy but plautus in compliance with the times prostituted that real wit which he certainly possessed and which properly and resolutely exercised might have shamed the people out of those monstrous satires and gross farces which disgraced the stage and terence determined upon a reform went to the other extreme and exhibited as an object of public admiration a muse correct indeed in perfect proportion measured and compassed to a nicety but which wanted warmth animation and spirit serious without interest good without a motive and virtuous without inducement  it was said that the impures of terence spoke more modestly than the honest women of plautus therefore both were out of place it must he allowed however that the praise of the candid and the sensible is eminently due to both these poets but the manners were too corrupt for any reasonable hope of reformation the task was herculean and if aristophanes who laid about him soundly sparing neither friend nor foe could work no reform in polished greece but on the contrary much mischief how should plautus without the same club or the strength to wield it expect a reform in barbarous rome and if menander with the grace of eloquence the purity of reason and the beauty of truth could make no impression on recreant minds once accustomed to love virtue how should terence hope that cions from these exotics which had drooped and died at home should flourish into strength and beauty in an uncongenial foil  plautus has been warmly praised and severely censured varro says that if the muses were to speak latin they would certainly speak in the language of plautus this is a trite idea and has been twenty times applied and in particular by socrates who said and i own the resemblance seems to be more perfect that if jupiter condescended to speak like man he would speak the language of plato but as to the muses varro speaking of plautus pays no great compliment to those ladies when we recollect what we were told just now of the language of his modest women  it is the opinion of cicero gellius macrobius lipsius and others that his genuine ridicule the truth of his characters the pleasantry and poignancy of his wit and the force of his satire have set him far beyond all the other roman comic writers on the contrary another troop of critics headed by horace censure his wit in the severest terms as unintelligible gross obscene and void of that beauty and truth so essential in the composition of comedy  plautus not being able to do what he wished did what he could it is a constant but lamentable excuse to say all this must be done to comply with the taste of the times in this case an author does not write for the instruction of the world the world instruct him what to write plautus thus tired out very soon by the bye of instructing others was willing enough to take these instructions himself preferring profit to fame for which poetic sin he is said to have been severely punished for being a covetous man after he had amassed a fortune by his works he became a bankrupt and worked as a journeyman miller to procure himself a subsistence  as to terence though plautus had certainly a stronger genius and a more fervid imagination he will long continue to live in the knowledge and estimation of all nations with a certain and decided reputation and yet it is a reputation that does not excite much envy it is in vain to deny that without menander there could have been no terence but yet menander having written plays on a plan which exposed vice without exposing individuals having attempted to simplify comedy in greece as aeschylus had simplified tragedy the good sense of terence in preserving this treasure which he had the fortune to find and the modesty to give to the world as free from alloy as possible cannot be enough commended and it is not because he has labored to transmit to posterity the reputation of menander that we must deny reputation to him  it is said that though homer ought most to be admired virgil ought most to be copied for though virgil is an imitator of homer yet the style of virgil will ever beget him a higher degree of literary reputation and yet who would not after all this rather be homer than virgil and so of terence his dialogue is full of beauty polish and regularity his characters are natural exact and finished and his conduct chaste proper and decorous but he has no variety his plots have a tiresome sameness and his scene and his characters have nothing to do with one another all which forces his very admirers to remark that he is only perfect as far as he goes the fact is that every thing in terence is greek except the language  on the other hand as terence was not original like menander and had not the genius the wit and the fire of menander though his style and the merit of having conveyed the resemblance of that admirable poet to posterity will be gratefully acknowledged by every admirer of diligent industry yet i would rather be menander with all his obligations to terence than terence with all his obligations to menander  the distinction between plautus and terence seems to be this plautus gave an unbridled license to his wit terence curbed his too tightly censurable this in either case caesar wishes that terence had possessed the vis comica of plautus and yet he acknowledges that it was indelicate and coarse quintilian patercullus and others of the ancients have wished plautus to have had the urbanity and purity of terence which erasmus says may be considered as a criterion of the latin language and yet this urbanity is allowed to be cold and tame  both english and french critics supporting their opinions by ancient authorities have written as oppositely on this subject as frost is to fire some maintaining that plautus is neglected for that he possessed every necessary requisite of a first rate dramatic genius others that he is a miserable farcewriter and beneath contempt or criticism and as to terence scarcely have you shut up one authority by which you learn that no true beauty or refined elegance can go beyond him but you open another where he is said to have been so dull that there are but two passages in his six plays that stand the smallest chance of provoking a smile  justice therefore i think will take a middle course and incline us to believe that though the reputation of plautus and terence as imitators of aristophanes and menander may admit of a considerable deduction yet had they not been fettered by the false taste of that country in which they wrote and which would admit of no innovation but what was greek they might from their own intrinsic merit have established a much more brilliant reputation  chap x farces pantomimes and observations of rome where the dramatic art did not come forward in its natural gradation but where a taste for tragedy comedy farce pantomime satire masque tragiccomedy and every thing regular and irregular prevailed just as whim or caprice governed the moment it is difficult to give a digested account of the stage  we have seen that gross satires and buffoonery originally prevailed and that these satires and this buffoonery were born from drunken feasts and therefore full of indecency and licentiousness and that after a time they assumed the form of invectives of a most vehement kind against the supposed vices of particular persons in this state we have seen them prohibited but their spirit however was never lost for in proportion as they were admitted by different legislators so they were at different times the leading favorites of the people it will be here material to notice that the satires of the greeks differed essentially from those of the romans though both may be denominated farce a species of dramatic entertainment no doubt antecedent to all others the satires or farces of the greeks were little pieces admitting of either tragic or comic subjects treated in the way of burlesque those of the romans were poems mingled with bitter invectives against vice the objection against both is that they were impure and indecent to a monstrous degree for while the grecians to relieve their tragedies than which nothing can be more chaste and pure introduced mobs of drunken satyrs whence the title of these pieces the romans exposed without mincing the matter by lascivious and obscene descriptions and attitudes those vices they affected to hold up to public scorn nay we are told by way of a very curious remedy against vice which to a degree horrid and complicate no people ever encouraged so much as the romans that actresses were exposed naked after the piece was over to do away any impression the roman youths might have received from those charms which had been veiled from their sight  to the rejection at intervals of the works of those poets who had as we have seen labored with so much industry and to so little purpose to amend a bad taste  pantomimes were also at times prodigiously followed these flourished in rome during the reign of augustus some say they originated at that time but this is not the truth for there can be no doubt but they were antecedent even to the grecian chorus it will be proved in its place that not only pantomime is more than three thousand years old indeed one instance has already been given in theseuss dance of the crane but that opera which is supposed to have had existence only two hundred years is an improvement of the ancient chorus  they were introduced at rome by pylades and bathyllus pylades was celebrated for serious subjects and bathyllus for comic  what we are told of these pantomimes is beyond measure astonishing seneca confesses he had a real taste and passion for them lucian tells us that though mute and unassisted by either poetry or music they were as affecting as the tragedies and comedies of their best writers but as pantomimes the only part of the drama in which the romans improved on the greeks were the last and most serious innovation and as they led to all those factions and dissentions struggling with which the theater received its death wound they shall rest till we have seen in what manner poor tragedy and comedy were tossed about in that agitated sea of swelling broken and jarring interests the roman theater  soon after regular pieces were introduced satires were neglected and continued to be so during the time the poets themselves performed in their own dramas but the youths of rome tired of tragedies at length took possession of the theater where they performed satires by way of interlude in the place of the chorus to conciliate also the suffrages of the romans for this innovation on dramatic regularity they produced pieces in imitation of the greek satires which were partly serious and partly comic  to such a pitch was this carried that the common people who relished nothing but grossness and buffoonery in the midst of the regular performances were continually calling for athletic feats tumbling and bear dancing one of the comedies of terence is said to have been thus interrupted several times during the two first representations and the performers were obliged to quit the theater to make place for ropedancers and gladiators for had this not been complied with a further representation of the comedy would never have been permitted voltaire says that in england every thing is mob that so we are entertained with bull baiting cock fighting or boxing we are content to put up with the most miserable outrages on good sense and probability in our theaters when he says this he is speaking of hamlet and ridiculing the jesting of the gravediggers in what he calls the church yard of the kings palace what must he have said had he spoken of the roman mob who preferred dancing bears to the elegant and regular terence   the tragicomedies however in a great measure reconciled this and as the performers were freed men the citizens considered them in as respectable a light as the poets thus an amnesty was at length agreed on the chorus was permitted in its place and they were contented to perform the satires by way of afterpieces  before the time of scipio the african  who some believe to have had a hand together with lelius his friend in the comedies of terence  the senators and the roman knights assisted at the spectacles promiscuously with the plebeians the only distinction paid to the patricians was the plebeians were obliged to find every thing in preparation for them afterward however there was a considerable difference made between them and it was from this time that the theaters grew into regularity which ended in the building of amphitheatres in a style prodigiously large and astonishingly magnificent in the amphitheatre built by julius caesar we are told that a hundred thousand persons could be commodiously seated in these buildings were placed orchestras where the senators sat and in a distinguished eminence the emperor and his family the patricians had also places set apart for them and the plebeians occupied the remaining space  augustus added a superb covering of purple to the theater for the convenience of the spectators he also built porticos and finding that julius caesar had lost some of his popularity by not paying that attention to their amusement expected by the public he himself made it his study to apply very closely to whatever could engage their interest through the medium of promoting their pleasures he was very exact in his attendance at the theater and when indisposition or affairs of state prevented his personal appearance he never failed to send some of his family to represent him and make his excuses to the people in this manner mingling policy with their enjoyments he insinuated himself with greater certainty into their affections and carried all his points so well by this ingenious and sensible conduct that he never found it difficult to broach measures which had they been introduced in a mode less enticing might have been considered as dangerous novelties being one day told of this augustus answered it is right to administer to the peoples folly that their attention may be diverted from things of consequence   the romans had in their entertainments the most superb machines in some of which chariots traversed the theater in others gods descended through the roof and a third sort were so constructed so as to support characters which appeared to be flying on these they ventured so much at hazard that many dreadful accidents befell them we are told in suetonius that an actor who was performing the part of icarus in the presence of nero so exerted himself that though he fabled the character he realised the catastrophe for falling from a prodigious height he was dashed to pieces and the emperor was covered with his blood to give at once an idea of the incredible magnificence of the roman stage the scene alone in the theater of marcus scaurus was ornamented with three hundred and sixty columns and three thousand statues   among the romans it was very frequently the custom for two actors to perform the same part in conjunction that is to say one spoke and another acted the following circumstance is said to have given rise to it  livius andronicus who has been already mentioned as the first regular poet and who performed in his own pieces gave the audience such satisfaction that they frequently obliged him to repeat the most pleasing passages one day he was encored so often that by mere dint of exertion he became extremely hoarse rather than fail of their entertainment the audience made another actor recite the words and entreated andronicus to supply the action this he did so much to their content that they immediately adopted this mode as an improvement on their former plan for having now nothing to attend to but the action they found that the performer was much more animated which it will be seen was extremely necessary when we consider how vast their theaters were that they performed in masks and that the movement of their mouths and muscles could not be so accurately distinguished as to ascertain whether they spoke or not  when this custom came to be more perfect a singer was chosen whose voice had the nearest resemblance to that of the actor this singer was placed in a convenient situation toward the back of the stage he always spoke in a certain measure regulated upon fixed musical principles which measure also regulated the gesticulation and deportment of the actor in addition to this when several performers sung together a man with iron shoes beat time with his feet which could not fail to be heard by all those who bore a part  this extravagant propensity for action introduced as we have seen pantomimes these were found however alarming and dangerous the extreme passion the people had for these sort of entertainments gave rise to cabals and cabals begat factions they even wore uniforms to distinguish the different species of pantomime each espoused in imitation of those who conducted the racechariots at the circus they called themselves the blues and the greens and at length these factions excited the most dangerous tumults  chap xi actors and the conclusion of the roman theater the manner in which the romans paid attention to any thing was of so rude a kind that the compliment was seldom either an honor or an advantage whereas the greeks knew how to render a distinction more welcome by the mode of conferring it it is on this account perhaps we have been told that the profession of an actor was disreputable at rome though honorable in greece a french author speaking of this circumstance says that in regard to actors france imitates both greece and rome for that the french consider actors after the manner of the romans and live among them after the manner of the greeks  for there is nothing else that seems to lend probability to this report  the actors in rome were freed men and enjoyed all the immunities of other citizens but there were two circumstances which seemed to place them differently in rank to the actors in greece in greece the best authors were the best actors and they were besides as we have seen very honorably employed whereas few of the roman authors were actors and except in one or two instances nothing can be said of their rank for plautus was a millers man and terence was a slave this is no deduction from their merit but rather an honorable tribute to it it is only mentioned here to show that men of genius in society are caressed from appearance only just as a book is estimated by the gaudiness of its binding the mind of the man and the contents of the book being considered as matters of no consequence  the other circumstance is that though men of high rank and considerable employment from ediles to emperors were actors yet they were not professionally so but in the nature of amateurs and on this account they could not have kept up their distinction off the stage had they not affected to look down on those without whose assistance they would have cut a despicable figure on it  thus acting in rome was a profession by itself and it is on this account probably it grew into such astonishing repute in greece it was no uncommon thing for authors to teach actors their manner to note measure and point the cadence that the actors might be tutored into reciting and singing as regularly as boys are in a cathedral in rome all this was unnecessary actors as to representation could teach authors  what astonishing things we are told of aesop and roscius who were preceptors in eloquence aesop in particular to cicero the action of this great man like that of demosthenes was defective till with unwearied attention he had studied under these actors from whom he imbibed such commanding powers of attracting and persuading his hearers by the force of his gesture the modulation of his voice and the grace of his action as to be acknowledged the greatest orator of antiquity there cannot be a doubt but aesop and roscius in their instructions to cicero laid the foundation of all those extraneous and sportive sallies of humor through which at this moment the lives and property of individuals are eloquently jested away for it must be allowed that there was much stage wit and many claptraps in the oratory of cicero   aesop performed tragedy and roscius comedy therefore just as we say tragedy and comedy or greece and rome giving the ancient title the first distinction so we say aesop and roscius but there can be no doubt but roscius had more universal merit than aesop of this his rendering ciceros oration not only perfectly intelligible but greatly interesting by gesture alone is a most astonishing proof his judgment is spoken of in terms of wonder he taught acting to all ranks by which he amassed prodigious riches and never failed at first sight to predict the degree of progress his scholar would make he had such strength of mind and such acute perception that he penetrated the very recesses of the heart no wonder such a man should command the passions of his audience roscius seems in his way to have been a lavater yet so good an actor that had he assumed in lavaters presence a character totally different from his own he would certainly have created a blemish in the infallibility of the phisiognomist   roscius certainly was immensely rich his salary was equal to three thousand pounds a year and as he performed very late in life as he made incredible sums by teaching and as he had led a pretty regular life a few freaks with sylla and others excepted by which he was rather likely to gain than to lose by the time he arrived to eightyone at which age he died he must have realized a monstrous sum  all the great men who were cotemporary with roscius and survived him pay the most enthusiastic tributes of love and esteem to his memory cicero regreted him most servently where said he in one of his most celebrated orations is the man among us who has so hardened a mind and so unfeeling a heart as not to be deeply affected at the death of roscius catullus compares his form with all its imperfections to the refulgent beauty of the rising sun indeed he might have gone on through the splendour of all the stages of that luminary for if we may credit the numerous eulogiums on his merit and virtues he was glorious even in his decline  the character of aesop was in every respect different as an actor he confined himself to tragedy which by this time had gone far beyond declamation almost the only distinction it attained in greece he seems to have perfected the acting of tragedy by infusing into his very soul the sentiments and feelings of the character he had to represent plutarch tells us that one day he performed atreus and in that part in which he considers how he may best kill thyestes he worked himself into such a pitch of ungovernable anger that a servant happening to pass by he struck at him with his scepter and laid him dead at his feet  aesop was one of the greatest voluptuaries of his time and this may serve to give an idea of the prodigious riches which were the reward of theatrical talents in rome if an actor could have emulated the extravagance of lucullus and others and refined upon gluttony till the value of a single dish should amount to five hundred pounds what must have been his emoluments aesop is said to have gone on in this profusion during a long life and at length so far from dying insolvent to have left his son enough to enable him to play the same game over again with additions and improvements for not content with costly dishes he added costly beverage presenting his guests with dissolved pearls cleopatra we are told regaled antony in the same manner to be sure these things are as incredible as they are contemptible a wag who chose by way of reconciling credulity with probability to put a ludicrous construction on this fact might reason in this manner any thing is said to be dissolved that is made away with and thus aesop and cleopatra to provide their friends with a dinner sent their jewels to the pawnbrokers to wash down stewed tongues of speaking and singing birds  aesop owing perhaps to his profligate way of living fell off greatly toward the latter part of his life this failure of his powers induced him to retire from the stage and when with the vanity of a veteran instead of listening to prudence and contenting himself with the well earned laurels he wore he rashly exposed himself many years after he had retired on the opening of pompeys theater the romans received his ineffectual efforts to please with a mixture of pity and contempt  what has injured the consequence of the roman actors and indeed most of their men of genius is their having so far let down their pride as to mix with great men who treated them merely as buffoons sylla could go no where without his herd of poets musicians actors and mimics in which frolics roscius is reproached with having joined in the mummery of sorex and matrobius  antony is said to have come reeling to the senate after sitting up all night at the wedding of hippias the actor sergius had such interest with him as to get rewards from him and make him confer favors and cytheris an actress had the address to manage his heart at her capricious will she attended him in his excursions her equipage was prodigiously expensive till at length she became the mimic representative in rome of what cleopatra was afterward the reality in egypt to keep up this resemblance fulvia the wife of antony was as jealous of this actress as was his other wife octavia afterward of cleopatra it is said that in revenge fulvia endeavored to captivate augustus and that having gone so far as unequivocally to manifest her wishes which declaration met with a cool return she grew outrageous at her disgrace and menaced augustus with a civil war this induced him to write the following epigram which i have imitated for i ever did and i hope i ever shall disdain the servility of mere translation epigram that antony prefers an actress charms must i per force take fulvia to my arms fulvia the wife of antony my friend it is vile besides the labors without end for did i comfort all who disagree among wedded friends some one need comfort me but it is worse yet  the peremptory fair  love me she cries or else for war prepare thus must i choose to finish the dispute bellonas trumpet or cythereas flute to be with laurel or with myrtle crowned she is devilish ugly  let the trumpet sound    after all though the merit of the roman actors must have been very great and extraordinary yet there is something extremely revolting in the strange and inconvenient mediums by which the pieces were represented to the audience one of the actors spoke while another accompanied him with proper gestures the voice of the reciter was conveyed through a tube of brass for otherwise how could it have been heard by so large an assembly in order to give a stronger idea than mere muscular gesticulation could do of the passion to be expressed monstrous masks were worn expressing joy on one side of the face and grief on the other so that if the gesticulator did not take good care he might have congratulated his friend with a sad countenance or murdered him with a merry one  much has been said by various authors concerning these masks more indeed than the subject seems worthy of it has been contended by some that the mask covered the head and shoulders under an idea i presume that the head thus enlarged would throw the whole frame into symetry when the body was raised upon stilts but this would have been a miserable shift because in proportion as the mask enlarged the head and the stilts lengthened the legs the arms unfortunately would have been ridiculously too short others are of opinion that the mask was hollow from the face and by taking a greater circumference appeared to enlarge it to which the helmit gave assistance but this expedient when we add the stilts will put the arms in the same awkward predicament they were in before the most probable account therefore we have is that the mask was like gold beaters skin so transparent and so artfully prepared and fixed that the play of the muscles was plainly seen through it and that the eyes the mouth and the ears were not concealed at all  on these masks they delineated carefully the features of the very character that was to be represented in other respects as by the mouth and the eyes are expressed the vivacity and disorder of the passions the movements of the mind were disernable through this thin veil and by this means the actor was never before the audience but the character  thus by the help of these masks age became youth and ugliness beauty pliny tells us of an actress who performed comedy to admiration at a hundred years old at which age one should suppose her whole form would need a mask  we are however far to seek in this business and the farther we seek the less we shall be satisfied it is probable that masks of each of these descriptions were used both in greece and in rome but it must have been entirely to enforce expression on account of the great distance of the actor from the remote part of the spectators an expedient however to remedy an inconvenience is not a perfection and in spite of numberless historians who unanimously agree that the effect of these masks was beyond conception astonishing in spite of our conviction as far as it relates to pantomimic characters the gestures of which were at the time of rich wonderfully expressive masks that covered the shoulders must have been frightful and gigantic masks which extended the size of the face fantastic and grotesque and transparent masks by the impossibility of leaving the apertures correct and of stretching them so as to play in unison with the muscles must have exhibited an effect paralytic and ludicrous and in spite of the painter who on these masks labored so ingeniously to portray the mind the more he came up to the truth and correctness of nature the more we should be induced to say draw the curtain and let us see the picture  but there are stronger objections than these the best acting of aesop and roscius was without masks and when they came to mere pantomimes of which we are told such wonderful things it is impossible to have conveyed a thousandth part of the expression they are reported to have contained except by an undisguised exertion of the features the testimony borne to the celebrity of these pantomimes is truly astonishing among other instances it is said that demetrius a cynic philosopher laughed at the folly of the romans for permitting so strange an entertainment but having been with much difficulty prevailed upon to be present at the representation of one of them he was consounded with wonder the story represented was the detection of mars and venus the whole performed by a single actor who described their interview phoebus discovering them to vulcan as they lay asleep vulcan forging the invisible net and afterward catching them in it the trouble and confusion of the lovers when they could not disentangle themselves the celestial surrounding them with shouts and bursts of laughter the shame of venus the humility of mars the triumph of vulcan and in short the whole table till at length the philosopher wrought up to the highest pitch of admiration exclaimed that the  had no occasion for a tongue he spoke so well with his hands   in short every exaggerated expedient invented by art and substituted by necessity must have been a departure from nature and the answer of a child might be anticipated who should be asked whether so gross a violation could be the perfection of that art which can derive no merit but from its fidelity as a representative of nature  the vagaries of nero would claim no right to he mentioned here being no more than the frantic acts of a magnificent madman by profession an emperor not an actor had they not degraded the dramatic taste and hastened the theater to its dissolution happy had it been however for his country and for humanity had he contented himself with a display of mimic greatness on the stage if for every murder in tragedy he had not perpetrated a hundred murders among his subjects if with a love of those arts that humanize and correct the heart he had not unnaturally blended every detestable and sanguinary passion that can debase and corrupt it  possessed as he was without the faintest shadow of either poetical musical or theatrical abilities he would be considered as the most consummate practitioner in all and woe to those who did not unequivocally acknowledge his claim it was enough that it was his fiat and that he had proclaimed himself the first artist till in this career of alternate folly and wickedness and growing satiated with extorted applause at home he determined not only to make a musical and theatrical tour of his own empire but to extend his visit to greece  applause extorted at the point of the sword attended him wherever he went no one was permitted to leave the theater during the time of his performance and to manifest the indignation that his performance naturally inspired would have been instant death it is said that the novelty of an emperor on the stage had at first such an effect that the audience did not perceive an earthquake which really happened while he was singing yet when the first movements of their curosity had subsided men leaped privately from the walls to escape from such an absurdity and women pretended to fall into fainting sits as an excuse to be carried out while the soldiers were so vigilant in enforcing applause that the looks and actions of men were not their own an old senator named vespasian who had fallen asleep during one of these performances narrowly escaped with his life  the arts he used to obtain the victory over the performers were truly contemptible he bribed the judges ordered his followers to prepare the public mind in his favor and decry the merit of his competitors one inconsiderate singer who had great vanity greater abilities and more indiscretion than either sung so much to the satisfaction of the people that nero ordered him instantly to be put to death  among the greeks however now effeminated profligate and artful so much precaution was unnecessary nero proclaimed himself an apollo wherever he went and though he was thrown out at the olympic games he not only obtained the crown but afterward at the isthmean pythian and the nemean games where he performed still worse in short he remained a whole year in greece where all was feigned extacy and hypocritical rapture at his different performances nay he bore off from thence eighteen hundred crowns earned by his extravagant folly and given by their political cunning and so far was this from softening his mind the remainder of his life was a studied climax of cruelty  dramatic representations became from this period more and more licentious the pantomimes which had long prevailed and which had caused so much tumult and mischief at length fell off and tragiccomedy gained ground this hetrogeneous representation admitting of every thing monstrous and ridiculous destroyed by degrees all regularity and order and as it grew ruder and ruder it partook of all the bitterness and malignity of personal and pointed satire these satires were even more bold and daring than those formerly spoken of and which even so early as five hundred and twenty years before it was thought expedient to suppress so fast was the romans degenerating to their original barbarity   at length the courage of romans was visible only in their dramas for in these they boldly ventured to introduce under the mask of fiction accusations which for their lives they dared not openly to broach not even the emperor was spared nero had connived at poisoning his father and attempted to drown his mother and datus the actor to revive the recollection of those horrid transactions introduced in one of those faragoes a song the burden of which was farewell father farewell mother the better to make known his meaning he accompanied the words of farewell father with the action of drinking and making wry faces and when he came to farewell mother he counterfeited a struggling in the water  strong genius however true wit and genuine humor having gradually withdrawn from the stage after a time it became deplorable and as it followed the example of greece in its rise so did it in its dissolution  chap xii spanish theater as the theater in spain even to this moment has never had to boast of any thing regularly dramatic it would be difficult if not impossible to give a methodical account of it the wit and humor that have so lavishly pervaded it manifest the most luxuriant fertility in the genius of their dramatic writers whose works crude and irregular as they are have served like a rich mine for the french and indeed the english at second hand to dig in their wit however like their hard dollars can never be considered as staple but a useless mass of no intrinsic value till manufactured into literary merchandise by the ingenuity and labor of other countries  the spaniards had some knowledge of dramatic entertainments even when the romans began first to be celebrated for good poetry the ruins of so many ancient theaters  the vestiges of which are yet to be seen in their principal towns  give incontestible proofs how much they were delighted with this species of amusement but the goths and other barbarians that overrun the kingdom drove out the muses and consequently among them thalia as for melpomene she never even to this hour resided in spain  the arabs however brought thalia back again and by introducing a rude sort of superstitious drama which was intermingled with grotesque provincial farce established the foundation of the first castilian plays the subjects were sometimes the loves of shepherds and sometimes different points of religion such as the birth of our savior the passion the temptation in the desert and the martyrdom of some of the saints these sacred pieces were played as intermezzos and the decorations consisted of views of paradise hell the trinity the sacrament and to make the resemblance more interesting it was no unusual thing in this strange jumble of sacred and profane to administer benedictions and sing te deum we have gone yet but a little way toward this on our stage in action we have to be sure now and then introduced noahs ark solomons temple heaven hell and some other similar objects and held up moses aaron and the man after gods own heart as freemasons but in our oratorios we come on pretty well the mssiah the redemption and such familiar titles  by way of companions to the tarantula and the cabinet of monkies  are sported against all the old walls in town and i remember in one of these sacred dramas as they are facetiously called which had for its title the ascension that in the moment our savior is supposed gradually to disappear to soft music the orchestra in a most rapturous style struck up  del take the wars that hurried willy from me this charming performance by way of digression was performed once and giardini was present after it was over that connoisseur was asked how he liked the music to which he answered oh sare de man who is discontent wid dis music most be very unreasonable  for it contain great many little bit of all de celebrated master dat ever have compose though however we have yet only gone these lengths i think we need not despair when the rage for handels music shall be a little higher  for our present inattention can only be considered as a paroxysm gone off  i should not think it extraordinary if we were to be entertained with seeing the mighty samson pull down the pasteboard temple of dagon the shepherds in the messiah piping to profile sheep or that noble coup de theater in joshua where mr handel so beautifully makes the sun stand still to music but such bold improvements one can only expect by degrees in the mean time we must content ourselves if we would wish according to the cant phrase to see such objects as natural as life with resorting to those itinerant theaters called puppetshews where mr punch introduces you to the whole court of solomon by way of first piece and afterward entertains you with jepthas rash vow or the virgin sacrificed for a farce   in one of these pieces entitled the creation adam enters on one side and the creator on the other chaos stands in the middle adam entreats god to destroy chaos and create man in another piece the devil tempts the chevalier st james  who is described to be of a good family  to reject our savior because he is only the son of a carpenter and cannot produce letters of nobility in short it is impossible to imagine a thousandth part of the insufferable ignorance and absurdity these strange farragoes contained which are not to this day entirely abolished  what astonishes one most is the ludicrous and blasphemous applications they continually make of the texts of scripture there is scarcely any passage in the prayers of the church or in holy writ but is employed in these burlesque scenes in the most indecent manner a valet asks a girl if she be a virgin yes indeed i am says the girl but dont you think so yourself the valet with great seriousness quotes st thomas and says  nisi videro non credam  these extraordinary jumbles however are now little performed except in the remote parts of the kingdom where prejudice still reigns in all its influence  whereas at cadiz barcelona valencia and madrid  which places are frequented by strangers and consequently more polished  the dramatic entertainments are better regulated  at the early period of the spanish drama while buffoons jugglers and histrions who found their way to spain as well as to rome amused the people with these heterogeneous representations men of good sense who noticed the regularity and nature which characterised the best works of antiquity beheld with displeasure how much these monstrous farces were beneath the wisdom and the taste of the ancients  a strong desire to remedy this induced them to compose dialogues which they called comedies yet these were too tedious and unconnected to admit of representation their tendency however was meritorious but they made little progress toward the cure of the licentious manners of the times at length these plays began to be mixed with that very libertinism they were originally written to explode  such is the famous comedy of calixtus and melibeus where the descriptions are so lively the characters so loose and the circumstances so lascivious that it was considered as dangerous to expose them to public representation in other respects these plays were much too long to be patiently heard to an end yet as they ardently wished for something on the stage less reproachable some translations in prose from the greek and latin drama effected in time a considerable reform in the spanish theater  lopes de rueda a native of seville was the first who gave reputation to the drama in spain he was both a poet and a player cervantes says that he excelled in pastoral poetry which he worked as episodes into his dramatic pieces  but the theater was yet a rude piece of building containing only four very long seats the actors were habited in skins fringed with gold and in a large piece of tapestry drawn aside by two cords consisted the whole of their scenery machinery and decoration but yet they were greatly followed and rueda acquired incredible reputation in parts of simplicity braggadocia and vulgarity  the famous author of don quixote started as a comic writer with a happy and fertile invention he wrote several admirable pieces which might have served as a model to his country lopes de vega on the contrary despised the rules of the ancients and banished probability regularity and decency from the stage his heroes came into the world grew up became old and died in the same representation they ran all over the earth they slept in the east dined in the north and when he found the world too small for their pranks he conducted them into the air to go to bed his valets spoke the language of courtiers his princes of coxcombs and his ladies of quality that of fish women his actors made their entrance in a mob and their exits in confusion in one piece probably you have sixty principal characters cervantes blamed lopes de vega for this licentious abuse of the ancient rules to which lopes answered  as the people pay us it is very proper we should please then which nothing but the grossest ignorance can do i therefore lock up aristotle and horace because they continually reproach me for departing from my duty as a dramatic writer and as for plautus and terence i never hold any conversation with them but they have the impudence to criticize every one of my productions   the rules of art were not much better observed in calderone a play is the history of a mans whole life which he sometimes contrives to spin out for sixty years without plan preparation or probability and to add to all this barbarous absence of taste the more affecting scenes are filled with the grossest buffoonery a prince in a situation of inexpressible wretchedness is interrupted by the senseless pleasantry of some impertinent servant and yet in spite of these defects calderone is the idol of the spanish theater and after all it must be confessed that you admire in his style a nobleness of diction an elegance without obscurity while his artful manner of keeping the spectators in a pleasing yet continual suspense has a truly ingenious and comic effect  solis moreto zamora candamo and canizarez merit praise for having approached nearer to regularity that however which we find most wonderful in the dramatic authors of this nation is the prodigious the immense quantity of their works it is impossible to hear without adonishment that lopes de vega composed two thousand different pieces for the stage yet when we consider the nature and the form of these works the phenomenon is more easy to be conceived the spaniards have a great number of rhapsodies under the titles of chronicles annals romances and legends in these they find some historical anecdote some entertaining adventure which they transcribe without choice or exception all the details they put into dialogue and to this compilation is given the distinction play thus one can easily imagine that a man in the habit of copying with facility could write forty of these plays in less time than an author of real genius and regulated habitude could put out of his hands a single act for the latter is obliged to design his characters to prepare graduate and develope his intrigue and to reconcile all this to the rules of decency taste probability and indeed custom  it is curious that the spanish plays which are no more than romances in dialogue have been frequently retransformed into romance the task cannot be difficult it is only to render the dialogue again into recital le sage has done this several times in gil blas and this is not the worst part of the work his history of aurora de guzman is translated from a play of moreto our thomson goes still further and gives us in his tancred and sigismunda a novel out of gil blas moore whose gamester is so full of tenderness and proves in spite of madame dacier and all de la mottes enemies that prose touches the heart more sensibly than verse has given the english stage another play which has its origin in the same work it is indeed a very advantageous thing for the theater that historical justice obliges me to record this for it points out a source of materials through which the stage may be supplied for ages which source in its primitive state though a kind of literary chaos is to the full as regular as most of the modern dramatic productions it is true this fountain has been frequently visited particularly by the ladies but it is a source difficult to exhaust and if after all authors are too dull or too lazy to carry their theatrical pitchers to the fountain or too fearful  for pitchers of all kinds too often come home cracked at last  they have nothing to do but steal the pitchers of their neighbors the french and appropriate in a retail way the contents to their own advantage  nor has le sage been the only one who has built a reputation on the plunder of spanish dramatists madam gomez scarron and others have done the same and it may be fairly averred that most of the novels which had such success in the last century in france and part of this century in england are nothing more than spanish dramas metamorphosed into french and english narrations  it must be allowed that no nation was ever so fertile in invention or so wide of regularity as spain the reason is evident spanish gallantry consists entirely of stratagem and fancy is perpetually upon the stretch to bring about natural events by extraordinary means their manners are derived originally from the moors and are tinged with a sort of african taste too wild and extravagant for the adoption of other nations and which cannot accommodate itself to rule or precision  impressed with an idea of that knight errantry which cervantes so successfully exposed spanish lovers seem as if they took a gloomy pleasure in disappointment they enter the lists of gallantry as if they were more pleased with the dangers of the tournament than the enjoyment of the reward and at length when they arrive at the possession of that object with which they were originally smitten with a glance from a lattice or a regard in a cloister through a thick veil disappointment succeeds to admiration and they grow jealous and outrageous to find that love is the very reverse of caprice and that happiness cannot be ensured but by a long and intimate acquaintance with the heart  on the other side the lady immured from the sight of men reads romances and heroically resolves to consider as her destined lover the first who has the address and the courage to rescue her from her giant father and her monster duenna reason prudence mutual intelligence purity of sentiment and affection these have nothing to do in the affair fate settles the whole business and her deliverer be he ugly or handsome clownish or accomplished is sure to carry her with a coup de main at the very first interview there is a story told of a spanish lady of quality who was reading a romance full of extraordinary adventures at the moment she languished under the most cruel apprehensions that her fathers austerity and vigilance would render abortive every attempt of her lover to obtain an interview with her after a number of dangers and difficulties the lovers in the romance contrive a meeting when instead of profiting by the opportunity they enter into a long conversation on the vissicitudes of love and accuse fortune for having kept them so long asunder was ever any thing so stupid cries the lady throwing her book away two lovers to meet by the most unexpected and most fortunate accident in the world and trifle away their time in talking   we have no account of even one spanish tragedy the authors chose their characters indiscriminately criminately and it is very common to hear kings princes ministers peasants valets bravoes and hangmen trying which shall be loudest at the same scene nay sometimes the latter class have all the interesting situations while kings and nobles are the buffoons of the piece it is not that the spaniards want genius to arrive to this species of dramatic writing on the contrary there is an elevation in their minds a grandeur in their ideas and a nobleness in their sentiments but they know little of judgment and taste nor can their redundant imaginations conform to the rules of art  except the spectacles of the court the spanish theaters are equally indecent on occount of their obscenity and their dirtiness there are two theaters at madrid which seem to vie with each other which shall be the worst their best acting is low comedy their declamation being insupportably tiresome and their speaking through the nose especially the women disgusting beyond expression between the acts they have grotesque intermezzos which they play extempore they are naturally performed but they exhibit a strange mixture of joy sentiment reflection and satire and sometimes finish with songs composed in the italian taste  the instrumental performers are passible but the singers detestable  although it is not intended to speak of opera as a branch of the dramatic art till it shall make a separate article in the french theater at which time its origin and progress will be particularly traced and followed up yet it is impossible to refrain from noticing here the prodigious avidity with which this species of amusement though by no means excellent was followed not sixty years ago under farinelli through what medium may a man hope for recompense and who shall worthily expect the gifts of fortune when it is a known fact that farinelli in england and in spain received more money than did the duke of marlborough for the recompense of all his services in the low countries  whose extraordinary and facinating talent of imposing upon credulity will hereafter be enlarged upon in the history of the english theater  fortunately for this strange adventurer after he had gulled the english to their eternal reproach and received such a reception from the french as convinced him they were as well versed in trick as himself the king of spain happened to languish under a complaint for which according to his physicians there could be no cure but music  this intimation farinelli took the advantage of to some tune for being sent for by the queen he so ingratiated himself at court that he presently had a pension settled on him of about three thousand two hundred pounds a year and a coach and equipage kept at the kings expense  presents were made him of immense value the king gave him his picture richly set with diamonds the queen presented him with a snuff box with two diamonds of high price in the lid the prince of asturias prevailed on him to accept of a diamond button and loop worth a prodigious sum and he condescended to permit persons of all ranks to follow in proportion to their situations these very noble and meritorious examples of their betters  the length of time that this folly existed is incredible ferdinand continued farinelli in his situation after the death of philip and still to go beyond his predecessor in liberality honored him with a cross of calatrava one of the most ancient orders of knighthood in spain when farinelli was inverted with the insignia of the order of calatrava according to the custom of the other knights he wore spurs which being perceived by a dry old spaniard well said he each country to its custom in england they arm cocks with spurs in spain capons  this was about the year    0 and we find that after this he continued to conduct the opera till the year      when he retired to italy with his pension from the court of spain settled on him for life  we have now seen all that is remarkable or worthy to be related of the spanish theater which though a strange hetrogeneous jumble of jarring atoms will be sound hereafter to have furnished some very rich materials which the french and english theatrical chemists have ingeniously extracted to ornament their own productions  they certainly prepared the french to receive a true taste for the dramatic art who without them would probably never have imitated sophocles and terence the very name of the cid shows whence corneille drew the original and moliere who is considered as the creator of the french comedy derived much of his excellence from the same source  this subject will be hereafter more fully discussed when many of the english dramatic writers with beaumont and fletcher at their head will be shown to have had obligations to the same quarter and will serve to prove that the dramatic is truly an imitative art in a larger latitude than its general acceptance warrants for though nothing more is meant by the naked expression than that poets should produce a faithful imitation of nature they have clothed it and very often disguised it by servilely imitating one another  chap xiii portuguese theater the most celebrated dramatic poet among the portuguese was balthazar of the island of madeira who wrote ancient dramas called auto of which the greatest part was made up of pious subjects  like the ancient mysteries in france  henry de gomez wrote twentytwo comedies and gil vincent whom they looked upon as the plautus of portugal served as a model for lopes de vega and quivedo it is said that erasmus learnt the portuguese language on purpose to read the comedies of gil vincent  spanish pieces however are those which are generally performed at lisbon but the theater being extremely discouraged has long languished there had it not been for the kings order no opera would ever have been established in that capital and perhaps it might as well have been let alone for when they had their theater they had nothing to perform in it whereas at that time in france they were full of good things without a theater this a few years ago was distinctly different from the situation of the opera in england for we had at that time neither operahouse nor pieces indeed our opera has not for a considerable while been an object of the smallest consequence the different acts of the performance are only considered as so many intervals to dress and rest the dancers alexander may warble his soul our and sing his own exploits with all the sweetness of a bulfinch to eternity and yet be unable to wrest the attention of a single englishman bu the moment you turn the hero into a whirligig the whole world surrounds him renters and proprietors shares are bought up at any price and the concerns of the theater get into such perplexity tha we are obliged to burn down our opera houses to liquidate their debts   the theater however which is said to have been very superb was overthrown by the famous earth quake which by some was considered as a public benefit for they performed in it so seldom and at such an expense that they estimated every representation at nearly four thousand dollars  chap xiv italian stage dramatic entertainments had birth in modern italy under leo the tenth  the sophonisba of the celebrated prelate trissino the popes nuncio was the first regular tragedy known in europe after those barbarous ages of which i have already given an account as was the calandra of cardinal bibiena the first comedy  the italians however seem to have had as indifferent a taste for theatrical representations as the ancient romans as may be gathered from the following account of radamistus and zenobia the piece begins with a combat between more than a hundred persons they fight on the stage besiege a place and carry it by assault and though the whole drift of the tragedy is intended to be as affecting as possible punchello is one of the warriors who frightens the combatants parodies the best speeches makes a jest of the hero and behaves with all the ridiculous buffoonery of a puppet and that the heroine may not want as striking a contrast as the hero zenobias nurse is represented by a man with a black beard and a wig made out of a lambs skin with the wool on this tender female talks of virtue and delicacy is frightened lest some one should offer violence to her charms and gives herself a thousand childish and coquettish airs  ariosto wrote for the stage it is said that his father one day was on some occasion extremely angry with him ariosto listened to him with the most steady patience and most profound attention he neither said a single word in contradiction of his father or justification of himself but on the contrary heard him to an end with an impatient curiosity and seemed to wish that the lecture had continued longer a friend who was present asked him after his father was gone why he had not said something in his own defense ariosto answered that he had been for some days working at a comedy and on that very morning had been at a loss how to write a scene of a father reprimanding his son that at the moment his father first opened his mouth it struck him as an admirable opportunity to examine his manner with attention that so he might paint his picture after nature and being thus employed he had noticed only the voice the face and the action of his father without in the least regarding the truth or falsehood of what he laid to his charge  in the time of ranuse farnese duke of parma a prince of uncommon understanding an old nobleman blindly gave himself up to the arts of an infamous woman the duke who had a great regard for his courtier was touched that he should be a victim to so shameful a passion and did every thing in his power to cure him of his folly without informing him of it in direct terms at length having made several attempts without success he caused a comedy to be written wherein the old noblemans absurdity was so strongly drawn that it could not be mistaken and yet so artfully that it might be known for personality only by him whom it was intended to reclaim the duke took the nobleman to the play who struck with the reproach not only turned off his mistress but privately thanked the duke for a lesson by which he benefitted as long as he lived  the italian tragedies are miserable indeed they are languid verbose and uninteresting unless the human mind can be interested by subjects of horror st evremond instances this speaking of the feast of the statue from which moliere took his singular but celebrated piece of don john the most patient man says he would die with langour at that stupidest of all dull things the feast of the statue and i never see it without wishing the abominable author thunderstruck with his abominable atheist  the italian opera had some resemblance of the theater in athens italian recitative like ancient declamation was noted and sustained ad libitum by mcal instruments the chorusses which were added after a time and which belonged to the body of the piece and made a part of the general subject were and indeed are yet expressed by a species of music different from the recitative in the same manner as the strophe the epode and the antistrophe of the greeks  sung in a manner totally different from the declamation this was yet more closely adhered to as these spectacles became more perfect for in many of the serious operas of the abbe metastasio the unity of time place and action are observed and to this we may add that these pieces are full of that poetic expression and finished elegance which embellish a natural subject without confusing it and which the french say addison only attained among the english and we that racine alone arrived to among the french  tasso guarini and others have also writwritten written comedies as they were called which in their way had great beauty and poetical me but they were merely pastoral and therefore  to do with what ought to be considered as comedy the very names of aminta and pastor do with which pieces every reader of taste is well acquainted will bear me out in this assertion it is however at least worth a reflection that notwithstanding the established criterion at this moment of tragedy and comedy is that species of writing which excites in one the more tender and touching sensations and in the other the more mirthful and exhilerating the italians in these pastorals stuck closely to the true ancient meaning of comedy which is composed of two greek words and signifies no more than song of the village tasso and guarini were writers of taste and learning and very likely to know decidedly being nearer to the time what the greeks originally meant by comedy   other writers however were not of opinion that pastorals were true comedy for they acknowledged nothing under that title that was not a jumble of every species and as it were goldoni machiavel tasso and guarini all beat up together thus you had in one piece in modern rome all those subjects united which in ancient rome it required so many quarrels to keep separate  haughty tyrants languishing lovers bears devils cupids and scaramouches were presented you all in the same piece and every thing was conducted in a manner so truly ridiculous that if their intention was that comedy from that time should be considered as nothing more than a dramatic exhibition to excite laughter they fairly succeeded for what with the stupidity the absurdity or the humor it was impossible to avoid laughing throughout the piece unfortunately however as much as they gained on the side of the senses they lost on the side of the heart for whatever these might be to create mirth there was nothing to create interest  i very much question however whether these very comedies did not go a great way toward perfecting that species of dramatic production for when they come to be incorporated into the french theater the history of which circumstance will be hereafter particularly related they diffused a lightness into the french taste which had long languished under the verbosity and dullness of their comedies as they were called consisting of some single uninteresting action drawled on through five acts of monotonous verse  this lightness infusing itself into general taste obliged dramatic writers to become conformists and as it approached nearer to nature than the old system as it became adopted by men of real merit who knew what to preserve and what to reject comedy by degrees became interesting as well as amusing  it is certain however it never attained perfection a distinction it certainly once knew in this country till we improved in that as we have done in every effort of genius on the french and i shall instance vanbrughs comedy of the confederacy which he translated from regnard to prove this assertion  in short though the italians continued to breathe the same air and enjoy the influence of the same sun which warmed the romans they were no longer distinguished by their talents nor animated with their virtues for there was nothing left in italy of rome but its vices greatness courage and manliness were gone and nothing but effeminacy voluptuousness and licentiousness remained and thus if the roman theatrical representations by reflecting themselves were a mixture of virtue and vice those of the italians through the same mirror were a mass of vice without the relief of any virtue at all  italy has been famous for the comedies of goldoni though they are the wildest rhapsodies that can be conceived those of machiaval have more merit  in short italy has to boast of no theatrical spectacles of consideration but its operas which upon some particular occasions have been most superb and magnificent all this may be in a great measure attributed to the french who brought the productions of the italians into greater perfection by incorporating them with their own of which i shall hereafter speak more at large when i shall also speak of what was called the italian canvasses planned by ricoboni and others which were imported into france and begat the original celebrity of their petit pieces  chap xv german theater the german theater is about as ancient as the french and till the times of corneille and moliere was as brilliant and abounded as much in good authors but as the french theater improved the german theater degenerated gottsched of the academy instituted at bologne and professor of the belles lettres at leipsic reestablished and entirely changed the scene about the year   00 he formed young actors and excited young poets to write pity but some gottsched would start up in england  cato of utica gave as one may say the signal for this revolution  finding however they were cultivating an ungrateful soil they soon saw nothing of consequence could be produced original they therefore set themselves down to translations and ever since corneille racine voltaire moliere and destouches have been the support of the german theater  the german opera so much esteemed in the last century particularly in hamburg brunowig weiffenfels and leipsic is no more the italian opera has taken its place  the theater at amsterdam owes its origin to two societies of rhetoricians dramatic productions have overrun holland as well as every part of grmany and have reached even to sweden where they were established by the famous baron de hogbera a very extraordinary character he was the son of a soldier who from the ranks became ennobled deprived of his parents very early in life and destitute of fortune he taught himself to read and going on step by step he acquired a considerable insight into several sciences with no master but his own genius and observation at seventeen years old without money or recommendation he determined to make the tour of europe on foot to perfect himself in his studies he traversed france germany and holland where he instructed the peasants in dsserent methods to improve husbandry and received lodging and nutriment for his pains after this he arrived in england enriched with all the knowledge of europe the public however knew little of his merit till he established himself at copenhagen where his excellent productions soon made him known and admired his comedies eighteen in number established the danish theater  composed of an infinite number of distinguished persons men of letters jurisconsults and magistrates bardezius burgomaster and counselor p c hooft the celebrated poet and the famous joost van vondel were at the head of the confederacy  these two societies began to dispute on different subjects about      their pieces at first were only dialogues in verse on the news of the time the events of the nation or mithological fictions and served very meritoriously as a school to regulate the manners and furnish the amusement of a laborious and industrious people  in time however they disagreed each society ridiculed the proceedings of the other and their former eloquence degenerated into severe invective and bitter satire till at length to obtain order the magistrates came to a determination to suppress them both the people were however unwilling to give up their favorite pleasure and after a variety of difficulties it was finally agreed that they should unite this gave satisfaction to all parties and about      a physician of the name of samuel koster built a theater where both the societies were incorporated into one body  koster however could not support the expense of this theater and it was bought of him by the guardians of the orphans and the aged to whose use the profits were charitably appropriated and thus by converting it into an institution so laudable the theater began to have considerable celebrity  the performances however with the exception of a very few were gross and beastly in one of them which is a representation of abraham offering up his son isaac abraham having tied isaac to a stake very leisurely takes out an old rusty horse pistol and measuring six paces with great deliberation presents his piece when all of a sudden finding some wet descend into the pan he looks up and sees an angel in a certain attitude who had occasioned what he had mistaken for rain abraham is in the greatest consternation when the angel cries out der taiple abraham will ta te younker slauken  these brutal representations made up for a considerable time the delight of the mynheers till at length they improved the stage by translations of spanish comedies and french tragedies originally introduced by a society of portuguese jews who established a theater to which the hollanders were invited gratis the better to keep up a good understanding between the portuguese and the dutch in commercial negociations  their first efforts however were clumsy enough if calderone was full of extravagance on the spanish theater his curvettes and his caprioles were of course imitated as awkwardly on the stage of amsterdam as a guinea pig imitates a squirrel and as for corneille i cannot refrain from giving one instance how adroitly he was rendered into dutch  there is a well known passage in the cid where the father of rodorigo stimulates his son to revenge and not satisfied with the assurance he had before given him stopping him short he says a tu un coeur rodrigue he replies pointedly tout autre che mon pere le trouvera sur lheure the dutchman determined to be as phlegmatic as the frenchman was brilliant has rendered it thus ap ye a heart rodrigue yaw papa cries rodrigue  chap xvi observations on all the preceding chapters preparatory to the french theater which will be the next article it may not be immaterial to gather up by way of gleanings all those minute particulars which will serve to confirm and perfect the crop of intelligence already housed and also leave a clear field for the harvest that is to succeed it  nor can a better figure be devised as an object to symbol theatrical productions which smack of the country where they are produced as faithfully as corn or wine not reflecting general truth but particular manners it has been extremely well said that though we ought to respect the ancients we shall seldom succeed in the sort of respect due or that would have been acceptable to them on account of the lapse of time between them and us by which we fail of exactly ascertaining their taste and this rule equally proves that we should not blindly follow the ancients aristotle himself has often considered as perfection what was thought so at athens rather than what is really so in nature not holding up the mirror to nature but to the times not appealing to the perfection of the human mind but to its caprice  it is on this account that the theater will have arisen to the truest perfection in that country where the principles of the people are an emanation of true virtue and real patriotism where the public mind is informed and enlightened and where taste knows every thing of reason and nothing of reproach but critically speaking where is this country to be found  we have seen then as far as we have gone that the theater has arisen to no real perfection for whether we take it from that reproach to greece the death of socrates or the combination of every thing worthy and vile just as caprice happened to dominate in rome confirmed by the accommodating disposition of plautus and the declaration of augustus or the mad frolics of the spaniards countenanced by the answer of lopes de vega to cervantes the theater has hitherto been little more than a pander to the times without the theater nevertheless those nations we have traversed and those manners we have witnessed would have lamented a mortifying and uncomfortable chasm in their time and a considerable deficiency in their civilization  what then would have been the theater had it nobly asserted its privilege had it resolutely assumed its legitimate right and possessed itself of its real province it would then have purified those manners which it too often corrupted it would have refined that bad taste it too frequently tolerated and have given to literature an active example of having planted reason in the human mind  but how was this to be accomplished poets did not write for reputation but for hire they did not choose to undertake the romantic task of teaching virtue such as it ought to be and starve they rather contented themselves with describing it such as the people wished it to be and live voluptuously  yet we have seen the theater in greece an object of real importance for it is difficult to conceive a truer picture of exalted greatness than that meritorious distinction which could at once correct dissipation and conciliate ferocity and this was exactly the operation of the theater in its influence over athens and sparta immediately before aristophanes  but the times were to be thanked for this and not the poets the famous saying in the theater of the old spartan that the athenians knew what virtue was but that the lacedaemonians practiced it gives a picture uncommonly beautiful of the effect of a theatrical production at greece the instance of aristides being admired for his virtues by implication in a play and that so delicately as not to wound his feelings although he was present is one fortunate proof among thousands that the theater worthily conducted is the true medium to promulgate honorable emulation  but as the manners grew corrupted the theater at the very time it was the post of honor at the moment it was its particular province to stem the torrent of licentiousness cowardly deserted its station and was hurried away with the stream it would have been a glorious thing that some menander had started up at the time of aristophanes if it had been only to show while yet the greeks retained a recollection of those virtues for which they will ever be quoted as a great example that the human heart is easier moved by conciliation than by menace whence aristophanes could conjure up such wonderful fame is astonishing there is an epigram attributed to plato though the title certainly does not imply that sort of poem calculated to convey a compliment not at the same time that it is incapable of it which says that the graces after having searched through the whole world for a place to build an eternal temple chose for this immortal structure the mind of aristophanes from whence they have never since removed if gall invective scandal malignity and every thing that can debase the honest drift of fair open generous general satire are the materials with which the graces choose to build their immortal temple may they ever reside in the mind of aristophanes   from the parodies of sophocles and euripides by aristophanes may fairly be dated the fall of the stage which improved upon from aeschylus under those wonderful authors wonderful surely considering the time in which they wrote had it gone on to the perfection it was capable of would certainly have given laws to literature instead of which it gradually degenerated and though we have witnessed many lucid intervals through which it has struggled it could not be considered in any thing like a state of convalescence till shakespeare it will be hereafter my willing duty to prove that shakespeare to a much greater extent than has been related or perhaps believed by the most faithful of his biographers or the warmest of his advocates diffused a glow of reputaton into dramatic literature which was felt by surrounding nations it must be remembered that he came long before corneille and moliere who great and celebrated as they deservedly were do not both together make up one shakespeare and it will not be difficult to show that though the theater in france commenced much earlier than that in england the latter arrived soonest to perfection gave to england a more brilliant fame than aeschylus had given to greece  as to the romans they were too turbulent a people to encourage a real and decided taste for theatrical productions besides there was always a policy among them mixed with every thing public just as it served to promote some innovation intrigue cabal insurrection or assassination and thus dramatic representations were a specious lure a tub to the whale to divert the minds of the people from some impending treachery and not an excitement to excellence in paths of true glory and unfullied honor  it was through this that their dramatic poets held a station below the level of their gladiators their mimics and their rope dancers which the great augustus professedly promoted rather than restrained instead of stimulating writers of acknowledged merit by means of the stage to admonish the people out of their irregularities  the spanish theater though more irregular than the roman was less mischievous for it corrupted nothing of the nation but its taste and i would rather see twenty farinellis tickle the ears of the spanish nobility till they were gulled out of their money than one nero inuring his mind to fictitious murder on the stage that it might render him more expert in the murder of his subjects besides the spaniards have left something behind worth imitating whereas from the roman authors we have nothing but a greek filtration tasteless and insipid from the flatulent seneca to the tame terence whose works a celebrated critic calls comedies for mathematicians  the portuguese theater is swallowed up in the spanish and the german in the french so that admitting which it is perfectly right to do the theaters in all countries are not only useful but materially essential the stage according to its meritorious establishment at the time of aeschylus and its improvement under sophocles and euripides degenerated both as to tragedy and comedy in rome and though the spanish comedies have supplied a large fund of admirable materials yet in proportion as the theater lost sight of greece is lost sight of regularity  there cannot be a properer time than this to enter into a fair examination of the true value of what is called dramatic regularity and to show how far rationally the unities ought to be preserved or may be occasionally broken  what are these rules but a recommendation of what was considered as perfection in greece aristotle has added nothing to this he has only repeated word for word the methods which regulated the writings of sophocles and euripides without adding a single idea to theirs but what has confounded the thesis on which he rests his argument  he recommends the unity of action certainly an important precept but already put in practice before he suggested it he excludes from the theater as a remark from himself characters purely virtuous which are precisely not only according to sophocles and euripides but according to reason the very characters that ought to be introduced into a dramatic piece  it was aristotle who consecrated that nonsensical opinion that to form an interesting action it is necessary to introduce some great and celebrated person this idea is little worthy a philosopher who should be the first to feel and to acknowledge that private life or even obscurity frequently furnishes instances of exalted virtue and genuine magnanimity unmixed with the remorse that attends the extermination of nations to add to the celebrity of a hero alexander himself seems to have been more candid than his preceptor for when a poet sung of his justice and moderation at the ack of sidon here is a fellow said he he celebrates me as an honest man at the moment i am robbing a whole city  but the preceptor of alexander was obliged to square his dramatic rules by those which were most likely to flatter his disciple he therefore in this instance deserts his original plan probably because he trembled under the hand that had strangled calisthenes and parmenio in whose plot against the life of alexander he was by the way suspected to have had a hand  the sublime genius of aristotle made the wonderful discovery that there are but four sorts of tragedy there are as many sorts as there are subjects just as there are as many faces as there are men nature is infinite and it is sterility alone that searches for excuses in the absence of invention  he insists that tragedy ought to be confined to a small number of families a reflection evidently that comes from ancient greece very proper for the observance at that time of that republic but which held out to other nations would restrain the art rather than extend it thus the inviolable rules of aristotle which it is ridiculous to apply generally to other nations are no more than an enumeration of the beauties he found in the greek poets and as to the faults which he has held up as proper to be exploded he might as well have been silent on the subject for as they are gross and palpable and such as no man of genius could possibly have stumbled on  thus aristotle has written nothing new on this subject he has only transcribed a notice and stuck it up one would think by way of a pasqinade by anticipation on his commentators the innumerable multitude says a french author of aristotles commentators who stun us even in these days and in full academy seem to me to be a troop of the most invincible idiots that ever profaned literature  who enveloped in ancient manners are lost in a circle out of which they have not even in imagination been able to extricate themselves till thus bewildered they have rendered him unintelligible to us whose beauties they fancy they have elucidated which beauties they falsely conceive were intended for the advantage of posterity  i shall be told however that there are many luminous traits in the poetics of aristotle and among the rest that admired precept will be quoted that the beauty of poetry consists in order and grandeur but good heaven what is this more than a self evident truth which was known long before aristotle was born and which will be as plain as day light for ages after every present inhabitant of the world shall have perished are men to have rules to know when the sun shines but it is not the fault of aristotle who little dreamt that while he was endeavoring to regulate the poetics of a small commonwealth long since anihilated his rules would beget so much controversy in so many countries to whose manners most of them were uncongenial and whose men of genius would have been better employed instead of adopting dogmatic opinions in following universal truth and erecting rules for themselves m labbe daubignac in his dedication of zenobia to one of the princes of the blood piqued himself on having given a perfect model of the ancient tragedy and critically followed the rules of aristotle the prince returned for answer that he was extremely pleased m labbe daubignac should so closely observe the rules of aristotle but he was very angry indeed with the rules of aristotle that they should oblige m labbe daubignac to write so bad a tragedy   but i shall leave aristotle at present with a declaration that since his rules hitherto known to us which have only extended to tragedy have set so many learned men together by the ears as a lover of harmony and good order i am not one of those who lament that his precepts for comedy did not descend to posterity one may illustrate this by an anecdote rather laughable to be sure but which will clearly prove that we are indebted to aristotle or rather to those who published his works two hundred and seventy years after his death or else to accident that these strictures on comedy never were given to posterity seven pilots went out in a yacht to examine the buoys and regulate the soundings on a part of the english coast for the purpose of making a new chart durng this trip four of them who had been severally hailed to pilot in ships which were making a neighboring port left their three companions to complee their survey who while they were providing for the safety of others by some miscalculation endangered their own for they ran the yacht aground and after great difficulty made a shift to get home in the stage coach they were relating the circumstance in the evening when a dry old tar noticed that they had been remarkably lucky to escape so well lucky said one of the pilots ay to be sure said the sailor for if it was necessary to have three pilots to run the vessel ashore if the whole seven had remained in  she must infallibly have been staved all to pieces   the poetics of horace appear to be still inferior to those of aristotle nay it is doubtful to me whether he ever intended them as that universal lesson for which they have been received but this with his advocates will be an argument in his favor for if what he considered merely as private instruction has been by the consent of mankind generally adopted it will argue a proof of its intrinsic merit and this i should willingly consider as a decision that ought to be final were it not that the premises will not bear out the fact but on the contrary the more we examine the less reason we shall have to allow horace that same which he really did not seek but which the world or rather public clamor as in the case of aristotle has been so ready to award him  when horace says that we ought not to couple serpents with birds or lambs with tigers or that comic subjects should never be mixed with tragic he clearly addresses himself to the elder of the pisons and not to poets where he seriously affirms that it is wrong to roast human entrails on the stage he cannot have had an idea that he held out universal instruction because no writer wants to be told that such monstrous circumstances are revolting and detestable but no such thing was in his mind he only in addressing the pisons took an opportunity by a side wind of rebrobating the licentiousness of the roman theater which we have seen was at that time both censured in private and encouraged in public by augustus and which is evidently the reason why horace was too politic to speak out perhaps this difficulty in speaking out was what made horace so shy of augustus who asked the poet whether he thought it would be a disgrace to his memory if it should appear to posterity that they had been intimate this flattery which quality is as acceptable to poets as to emperors had its effect for horace immediately dedicated his carmen seculare to augustus which was exactly what he had been fishing for   these puerilities added to the grave assertion that there is a great difference between a slave who speaks and a hero fairly fatigue us and show that however they may serve as instruction for youth they can never be considered as a literary treasure except by pedagogues who from their own imbecility will always be happy to find precepts for their pupils ready cut and dried to their hands  but the most curious part of horace is his notable discovery that art is as necessary as genius to form a poem this narrow maxim perhaps might have been advantageous to him who never gave the world any grand or solid work but merely ingenious elegant and finished trifles but it would be highly absurd in speaking of poetry in its extended sense the offspring of intuition the emanation of the soul where is the poetic art that can form a homer a sophocles a euripides these created those very rules which aristotle and horace fondly dreamt had been invented by them in which delusion horace wraps himself up and instead of examining poetic genius as a question of sublimity that soars above all art he yawns out a declaration that the union of nature and art produces a happy effect this precept becomes a fiat and every school boy acknowledges with astonishment the rare sagacity of horace  vida who is preferred by scaliger to horace scaliger says that horaces art of poetry is an art taught without art  has certainly method art and persuasion he loves poetry and speaks of it with transport yet his sentiments though enthusiastic are profound as well as lively he gives his precepts not with a biting and dogmatic air but in a tone easy and persuasive and with all that amiable gaiety which horace has every where but in his art of poetry and which after all is an argument both against vida and in favor of horace for it proves that vida was the best critic and horace the best poet and at last to show how difficult it is to find fetters for the mind vidas poem is but a repetition of what virgil had copied before and therefore a proof that poetic rules cannot be an invention to ensure future success but only an invitation to emulate what has succeeded already  as to those rules which more particularly relate to the construction of plays all countries at all times have occasionally violated them to advantage and the plain answer to those cavillers who have condemned this conduct in the lump is short and incontrovertible let the unities be regulated by the nature of the subject  this position had better rest till it be exemplified by the works of authors which will be hereafter spoken of in the mean time i shall detain the reader from the french theater no longer than just to say that it is easier to give your neighbor advice than to take it yourself i have met with a letter in some french author supposed to have been written from the island of madagascar which speaks of a diminutive race of savages the strength of whose intellects however makes up for the feebleness of their form they are described to have nothing sour nor rancourous in their dispositions notwithstanding the contumely they sustain from the more gigantic savages that surround them and though they feel this disadvantage they are moderate enough to resist the insults of their neighbors by teaching them decency propriety and decorum this they do by means of a species of drama which has obtained such reputation among them that the situation of an actor is considered as the highest in the state on this account they are very careful to prevent the prevalence of any thing licentious on the theater and it is therefore permitted that every spectator may come with a sort of catcall and testify by playing on it his disapprobation of any actor or any passage in the play woe be to him however if he should happen to whistle malapropos for when this is the case the whistler is obliged to mount the stage and give his reasons publicly for his conduct if his dislike is to the piece and he points out to the satisfaction of the audience any passage that has a tendency to immorality or that may be considered in any way dangerous or offensive to society he immediately receives public thanks if not he is what we call sent to coventry if his objection is to the actor he is obliged to perform the part better or else in case of failure to retire with disgrace from the assembly and never afterward be permitted to join it this curious history nearly as i have stated it for i quote from recollection is evidently an invention in revenge perhaps for some dramatic disappointment its author had sustained it is however a most wholesome lesson and would be wonderfully serviceable were it adopted in this country every thing that is public very properly and worthily attracts public curiosity but let not therefore the labors of the ingenious and the meritorious become the scoff of every ignorant vain and envious pretender let the public for the sake of their own consequence tax the merit of critics and in proportion as they possess upon proof superior or inferior abilities to those whose labors and whose livelihood they have the arrogance to reprobate and the cruelty to undermine let them be honored as the worthy protectors of the arts or branded as disturbers of the rational pursuits and inoffensive pleasures of their fellow creatures  for notwithstanding the peremptory mandates of these law givers to literature i dont find that aristotle horace vida boileau or any other of the critics ancient or modern who have measured and cut out plays have appeared able however they might have been willing to write any thing dramatic themselves  book ii the french theater from its origin to the death of corneille chap i early intelligence relative to the french stage the dramatic entertainments of france originally and for a length of time so rude so monstrous and so ferocious came in a direct line from the romans and were nothing more than a feeble copy of those brutal games which disgraced the amphitheatres of those conquerers of the world  if various authorities that corroborate each other may be depended upon histrions farcers dancers and cudgelers overrun france as early as the seventh century who imitated the pieces of the romans in the infancy of the art exactly as the romans in the same manner had imitated the greeks representing nature in its rudest and grossest state  it is plain that these performances whatever they were though intended to promote civilization had an effect exactly the reverse for they grew to such a licentious height that in the eighth century charlemagne was obliged to suppress them vainly however for the habitude had obtained and the people would not be diverted from their amusement and since they had lost their pleasure because it was considered as irreligious they were determined to make religion itself the means of restoring it to this the priests had no objection for in multiplying religious ceremonies they multiplied their own emoluments till as the priests of bacchus encouraged these early representations in greece so the priests of france willingly turned the churches into theaters where they permitted ridiculous farces indecent dances and sacriligious buffooneries the very vaults where the saints were deposited echoed with scandalous and impious songs  upon these occasions the priests often turned actors and sometimes actresses hiding their sanctity and their sacerdotal robes under grotesque habits and ridiculous masks in which disguises they very frequently got drunk quarrelled and sought  these disgraceful spectacles continued more or less according to circumstances till about the middle of the twelfth century when eudes de sulii bishop of paris thundered his anathemas against these sacred farces which however were but little suppressed till the crusades when the spirit of the nation leaning toward every thing religious the french checked whatever served to render religion ridiculous besides it now became meritorious to consorm to religion and yet act farces pilgrimages and wars with the cross as their ensign were good theatrical matter troops of these devout itinerants were constantly appearing in the squares and in the market places and no one was considered as a capital actor who had not noviciated at notredame du puy st james of compostella or jerusalem  these pilgrims mounted upon scaffolds sung spiritual canticles which they had composed on their journies and exhibited scenes in which they represented some mystery of religion or the life of some saint till at length they formed a society the particulars of which we shall see in its place  in the mean time we will return to the time when sulli began to anathematize holy bussoonery at which epoch it appears that the people beginning to be disappointed of their amusement through the medium of the church invited writers and performers to continue it through the medium of those savage feasts in which france was so fond of emulating the romans  the course plenieres the tournois and the carousels were an imitation of the sanguinary amusements of their ancient masters and offered to the eyes of the spectator a frightful image of war and all its horrors by degrees however still like the romans the french united in their exercises objects less shocking and offensive in which they introduced poetry which was sung at their repasts during the intervals of serving the different courses and therefore called entremets  the provincial poets that is to say those born in the southern provinces of france and who spoke a language derived from the romans and called roman provencale and the french poets born in the northern provinces whose language came from the same source but was pronounced differently and therefore called roman franscoise these two sorts of poets were the original authors and performers of all the spectacles which though barbarous enough in themselves relieved those savage seasts called the course plenieres  they chose such grand circumstances as the marriages of sovereigns or the celebration of certain days in the year either appointed to commemorate great national events or consecrated to religious purposes the provincial poets were called troubadours and the french trouverres which word in both dialects signifies discoverers finders inventors  their inventions were called jeux partis and were divided into what they called sirventes and tensons those called sirventes were satires levelled at all sorts of people something resembling the saturnines and fescenines of the romans before livius andronicus and the song of the goat among the greeks before thespis  in these performances called tensons the subject was love they were written in dialogue and executed by several interlocutors furnished with a number of these pieces which were lighter easier to perform and capable of affording more general amusement than the sirventes the troubadours and troverres of the eleventh century went about from town to town and villa to villa accompanied by their minstrels their juglers their posture masters and their ropedancers who uniting their different talents performed entremets or entertainments to amuse large companies  by degrees these spectacles were varied and extended farces and pantomimes were introduced representing subjects from history and in those pieces were brought forward terrestrial and aquatic animals and scenes machinery and decorations of most ingenious execution and upon an immense scale  it is difficult to say what were the dimensions of those buildings where these amusements were performed or to estimate the prodigious expense they incurred the mechanic art at that time must have arrived to great perfection and the resources of those who encouraged it have been immense to have executed such ingenious and extraordinary conceptions and have defrayed the consequent expense especially when we consider that they were performed but a few days in one place  the dramatic art however was yet unknown this itinerant poetry like those who cultivated it knew nothing of any fixed rule it consisted of irregular songs on the subjects of love and arms or personal praise or satire performed by troops of vagabonds who united poets composers actors singers and orchestra all perhaps in one family  fontenelle says pleasantly enough song begat poetry or at least was born with it the poetry of trouverres was made to be sung during the repast of a prince a trouverre would arrive with his minstrels and his juglers who began to sing to their harps and viols some curious verses that were comoposed for the occasion those who both sung and wrote were most esteemed among the ancient trouverres we find a great number who boasted such exalted names that there is scarcely at this time a nobleman that would not have been very happy to have descended from them every one who could claim a right to half or even a quarter of a family castle though the remainder were mortgaged ran about the world rhiming with a view to redeem his pawned patrimony nor did he want encouragement from some he received arms from others flags here clothes and there horses nay very often money and to render the recompense of persons of quality more worthy the acceptance of the nobleman disguised as a stroller the great ladies even to princesses joined their favors but if we are astonished that in a nation like france where letters have ever been despised and where we are not yet emancipated from this barbarity gentlemen and noblemen have formerly amused themselves with writing poetry i dont know what else to answer but that it was poetry written without genius without study without science and therefore such as will not dishonor nobility    notwithstanding this pleasantry of fontenelle and his kind concern lest the ancestors of the french nobility should have written good poetry and therefore dishonored their successors nothing can be more certain than that persons of the first rank in the twelfth thirteenth and fourteenth centuries made this amusement their principal occupation  we find among the number so early as the year   00 william the ninth count of poitou who knew not only how to write verses but to sing them afterward and who was so witty and so pleasant a companion as constantly to keep the table in a roar this talent was so natural to him that at his return from the first crusade in which he was far from being fortunate he sung the fatigues and dangers of that expedition in a poem so full of vivacity that it was considered both as a just ridicule of that strange war as far as he had witnessed it and a deprecation of its disgraceful catastrophe in   0  the famous father abelard who was of a noble family and whose talents and misfortunes have excited so much admiration and compassion is said to have written and exhibited as a trouverre this circumstance by the way ought to excite no astonishment for his strange adventures were tragedy comedy and farce all in one during his life time nay afterward for it is said that when the remains of heloise were deposited in his grave twenty years after his death at which time taking all the circumstances together one would think he ought to have been pretty cold he stretched out his arms and ardently embraced her   in      bertrand  who was attached to the count de ventadour and afterward to eleonore de guienne wife of louis the seventh of france who married and was divorced from the duke of normandy since king of england by the name of henry the second  this bertrand whose elogium has been given us by petrarch was one of the most celebrated poets of his time he encouraged the trouverres and wrote for them  from this period to the year twelve hundred we find a long list of noble personages who both countenanced these sort of performances and assisted them as authors and actors among these are the names of the emperor frederic the dauphin dauvergne the dominican missionary and inquisitor izarn the chevalier sordel who was overwhelmed with benefits by st boniface and married beatrice through which marriage he was connected with a string of italian nobility the count of ventadour the countess de dye and richard coeur de lion who all composed and cultivated poetry  during the next century the number of poets were still more numerous and not less respectable among these were fouquet bishop of marseilles and afterward archbishop of toulouse guillaume de cabestan who perished a victim to the jealousy of raymond cassel de roussillon de seilhans to whom he was page anselme faidit an author and composer of whose writings and emoluments beauchamp enlarges a good deal raimond berenger count of provence and of forcalquier son of alphonso king of arragon who married beatrice sister of thomas count of savoy by whom he had four daughters who were all married to kings margarite to louis the ninth king of france elenora to henry the third king of england sanche to richard king of the romans and beatrice declared by her father heiress to the county of provence to charles brother to st louis who was crowned king of naples and the two sicilies gasper de puycibot a great musician and who performed on many sorts of instruments in great perfection sordel mantouan in whose works was mixed much moral instruction pierre auvergne a musician and a poet albert marquis of malaspina and le seigneur bertrand dallamanon one of the most learned men of those times who dedicated his works to estephanette de romanin of the family of gantelme and aunt to the celebrated larua sado mistress of petrarch bertrand was greatly esteemed and patronized by robert king of naples and count of provence who was called the father of the provincial poets  in the   0  appeared pierre cardinal a man of great talents who wrote poetry in several languages the town of tarascan assigned him several considerable appointments for his trouble in instructing youths who under him made great progress in learning he was considered by the great as a man proper to be trusted with commissions of consequence and among the rest by bertrand to prevail upon the princess beatrice who had retired to the convent of nazareth at aix to quit her religious habits and appear like the daughter of a king in which undertaking he acquitted himself so well that he conducted her to naples where she married the marquis of est  during the next ten years many others made their appearance and in the year      philip the long count of poitou and afterward king of france became celebrated as a votary of the muses he was a prince of a most enlightened understanding his principal delight was to cultivate and protect literature and as a remarkable instance of it he gave considerable appointments in his household to ten of his dependants because they were poets  geofrey de luc who established an academy madame de marchebruc and her son anselme de moustier a great favorite of robert king of naples bernard roscas related to the popes clement and innocent the sixth and esteemed a greater man than either arnaud de coutignac who was esteemed for his rare prudence and remarkable for quelling a rebellion for the king of naples and many others made up the interval from    0 to      when le monge appeared who was called the scourge of the troubadours on account of his writings he fell most unmercifully on the poets of his time sparing neither friend nor foe nor persuasion nor condition till at length he exposed the tyranny of some of the rulers in the provinces and was assassinated for his pains  le monge however did service both to the cause of poetry and his country so much that taraudet who succeeded him and who wrote with equal severity but more policy completely effected that reform his predecessor had only meditated taraudet was born a gentleman and was bred a warrior as well as a poet being in treaty with foulques de pontenas for an estate foulques being a great admirer of poetry contented himself with giving him an easy bargain in consequence of his dedicating to him a work called a method to guard the heart against the treachery of love  taraudet being now rich and a nobleman assembled the neighboring nobility and purged provence of all those petty tyrants that had so long desolated it  after these boyer a mathematician and who as well as poetry wrote on natural history meteorology hydraulics and botany jean de meun a famous theologist philosopher astronomist chemist arithmetician and above all a poet and the illustrious louis de lascaris count de vintimille celebrated for his talents and his valor when the normands and the english ravaged provence were at the head of literature in france till about      when berenger de parasols gave a new turn to dramatic poetry having it is said composed five regular tragedies  of these tragedies there is so particular an account that it is difficult to suspect the truth of his having written them they have all appropriate names and the matter of which they are composed consts of satyric particulars relative to the marriages of princes and princesses of those times berenger according to these authorities dedicated his tragedies to pope clement the seventh who recompensed him with a prebendary of parasol where beauchamp tells us he ended his days but parfaict says he was poisoned on account of the truths contained in his tragedies which fontenelle seems to confirm by hinting that joan of naples hated parasols for having exposed in one of his pieces the circumstance of her strangling her husband that she might marry one she thought more amiable  there is reason to believe that though these pieces were called regular they approach very little toward that distinction in the sense we understand it now being no more than satires in dialogue and distinguished in nothing from those of daniel in      and faidit in    0 except in their style  these poets together with richard de barbezieux who joined to poetry rhetoric theology and mathematics and father boniface related to the most ancient nobility in provence and remarkable for his attachment to joan of naples and consequently an enemy of parasols were the principal among a very large number that made up the literati of the fourteenth century  in   0  lived another le monge from whose information through different channels are furnished the preceding particulars he was made librarian of the monastery of lerins of which society he was a member in the library under his care which it is said contained a prodigious number of books he carefully collected the lives and labors of the provincial poets these materials he was so particular in arranging and digesting that his authority has been constantly considered as authentic especially that edition of it corrected and improved by st cezari in       after this period to enumerate all those poets that pass in review upon enquiry would give this work the air of a catalogue rather than a history more than three hundred names might be set down that different authors have thought it worth while to celebrate  many of these lived in the court of tibald where they formed an assembly for the purpose of examining one another works after the manner of that school of poetry first instituted by geofrey de luc in    0 and carried into greater perfection by bertrand de pezars in      and which may be considered as the foundation of the french academy afterward so celebrated though not its origin for charlemagne established an academy for science and literature in general on his return from italy in      these names make but a part as we are told though one should suppose a considerable part of the principal inventors as they are called or poets in france and the surrounding nations and provinces where the french language was either correctly or imperfectly spoken the principal service these authors have rendered to the cause of literature is in leaving us an idea of the manner of those times in which they lived but these were so barbarous and unpolished that their labors serve more to point out what ought to be avoided than what ought to be imitated as far as it relates to their choice of subjects and if we should go further and fairly look into their works as an object of criticism though we should find anecdotes and short histories recounted with neatness and simplicity and remarkable for the truth of their images and the elegance of their style yet the gross indecency the barbarity and crudeness of the rest would render the task of selection scarcely worth the pains of so little value would be the gold after it were extracted from the filthy concrete in which it is enveloped  this chapter ought not to be finished without a notice that it is impossible from the contradictions of various authors to be correct to a year or perhaps to twenty years as to when these poets wrote the same circumstance is frequently related differently and sometimes one circumstance is mistaken for another for one instance among many others the four daughters of berenger count of provence it is agreed upon on all hands married four kings but one author will insist upon it that one of the husbands was richard coeur de lion who by the way was dead before the thirteenth century and another fixes the time of the birth of berenger at the year      which is impossible because henry the third married his daughter in the year      the first mistake originates perhaps from the name of berengaria the wife of richard and the other from making      the time of berengers birth instead of the time he was celebrated as a poet  as these circumstances concern literature itself but very little i shall always where i find no material contradiction set down events as they are related leaving it to the discretion and good sense of the reader to distinguish between what appears to be merely probable and what positively authentic  chap ii description of the entremets as the amusements called entremets because they relieved the different courses of feasts had something in them very extraordinary it would be highly improper to pass by this opportunity of describing them  though we have accounts of magnificent spectacles under this title which were performed so early as the year   00 and again from the chronicle of alberic of an astonishing one in      on the marriage of robert brother of st louis with mahaut countess of arto and daughter of the duke of brabant besides many others i should exceed the bounds i have prescribed for myself did i particularly notice more than two or three of the most remarkable  i shall therefore carry the attention of the reader to that magnificent and extraordinary spectacle performed in honor of isabella of bavaria queen to charles vi which was solemnized at paris with the utmost splendour in october      among the setes upon this occasion was a combat performed before the trinity illustrative of the holy war the french and english fought against and of course beat the saracens in presence of the queen all the streets were laid with carpets several fountains were placed in different situations which ran with wine and other delicious liquors and upon lofty stages erected for the purpose were placed choirs of musicians organs and youths who represented different parts of the ancient testament  machines were contrived by means of which infants dressed to represent angels descended and placed flowers and ornaments on the head of the queen but the most astonishing part of the spectacles was the intrepidity of a man who glided down by a cord from the spire of notre dame to the bridge where the queen was to pass and placed a crown upon her head which having effected he returned by the way he came as if ascending to heaven this extraordinary tour was the invention of a genoese who had been a long time contriving it and what contributed to render it the more remarkable even at a distance from paris being very late in the evening the man carried a flambeau in each hand that both the beauty and the temerity of the action might be the more striking  in      according to the accounts of mathieu de couci and oliver de la march adolphus count of cleves gave a spectacle of this kind at lisle in flanders in an immense hall filled with tables or rather with vast theaters in one of these was placed a bark with the sails furled in which was seen a chevalier armed cap a pie before the bark was placed a silver swan with a golden collar and chain with which it seemed to tow the vessel along and near at hand a castle appeared to rise out of the waves on which a falcon was perched  these different objects were emblematic of a trait of ancient history relative to the house of cleves in which it is reported that a swan traversing the rhine led miraculously to the castle of that family a chevalier celebrated by his exploits who became the husband of the princess of the country and gave an heir to that ancient and illustrious house whose title would otherwise have become extinct  the same year when mahomet the second menaced constantinople the emperor constantine the last christian prince that reigned in the east demanded succor from all the princes of his religion and among others from philip the good then duke of burgundy philip flattered with this attention replied ostentatiously to constantine that he should prepare a crusade himself and to effect this he instantly assembled his provincial generals and the commanders of his vessels to whom he gave a grand feast at which was performed a magnificent entremets  among the different objects introduced in this astonishing entertainment was a church filled with singers whose voices were accompanied by bells a vessel fitted with all sorts of merchandise a superb fountain with ornaments in glass and lead so wonderfully constructed as to represent trees flowers verdure stones of all colors and a figure of st andrew with his cross from which issued a fountain which fell at his feet and lost itself in a beautiful declivity covered with flowers and an enormous pie which represented a castle and concealed eight musicians on the battlements of the castle was seen a serpent and at the base were two fountains from which issued orange flower water which filled the fosses  after this was seen a windmill with a magpie perched on it two tuns from one of which flowed a sweet liquor and from the other a bitter one on each of these as placed a statue holding a label with these words take your choice  then came a view of a desert a tiger sighting with a serpent a savage upon a camel a peasant beating the bushes from which flew a thousand birds a chevalier entertaining his dulcinea under a hedge of roses a satyr mocking a shepherdess crossed in love a madman upon the back of a bear and a number of other strange and incongruous objects  in another place was a lake surrounded with villages and castles and further off an impervious forest embellished with oriental trees and filled with a crowd of animals of every kind so natural that they seemed alive in a niche were placed vases of gold enriched with precious stones where sat the figure of a woman made out of the same materials from whose nipples issued a delicious beverage a lion was placed by her side chained to a column on which was written touch not the lady  after this the company were entertained with the exploits of jason who drenched the bulls that guarded the golden fleece with the contents of medeas vial and employed her mavelous ring to cut off the head and draw the teeth of the serpent after which he sowed the teeth in the earth armed men instantly rose up cap a pie who massacred one another and all these scenes were accompanied sometimes by the singers in the church and sometimes by the instruments in the pie  but this was not all a giant now appeared dressed and armed like a sarcaren conducting an elephant who carried on his back a castle in which sat a lady dressed like a devotee and appearing most deplorable and wretched she thundered an anathema against the giant which obliged him to stop this lady represented religion she complained most bittterly of the ills she had sustained through the tyranny of the infidels and lamented the tardiness of those who ought to have flown to deliver her  this lamentation finished an armed chief preceeded by a long string of knights of the golden fleece and bearing upon his fist a pheasant ornamented with a collar of gold enriched with diamond and pearls advanced to the duke of burgundy and presented two ladies one of whom represented yolande his natural daughter and the other isabella of neufchatel daughter of the seigneur de montaign each of these ladies was accompanied by a knight and the armed chief offered the bird to the duke in the name of the ladies whom he recommended to the protection of their sovereign this ceremony says my author was used that the duke might conform to those ancient customs according to which princes and noblemen were presented at grand feasts and magnificent assembls with a peacock or some other noble bird to induce those vows which were made upon those occasions to redress the wrongs of such ladies as implored their assistance this last ceremony was called the vow of the peacock which bird was employed or when it could not be easily procured a pheasant because the grandeur the beauty and the variety of the plumage of these birds represented the majesty the beneficence and the power of kings as well as those superb dresses in which great men were decked at the cour pleniere   the duke of burgundy after listening attentively to the request of the armed chief held out to him a scroll which was immediately read aloud and contained a solemn vow to god to the virgin to the ladies and to the pheasant that he would carry war into the territory of the infidels in defense of the oppressed church the dukes vow became immediately a signal for his whole court every member of which to an infinite number instantly vowed the destruction of the turks all which acclamation was accompanied as before by the inhabitants of the steeple and the pie and when this ceremony was over a new groupe of characters presented themselves  a lady dressed in white in a religious habit and carrying on her shoulder a scroll on which was written thank god entered and paid her acknowledgements to the assembly which done she introduced twelve other ladies representing different virtues who were to accompany these knights of the cross to the holy war as their tutelary guardians their names which they bore on their shoulders were faith charity justice reason prudence temperance fortitude truth liberality diligence hope and vigilence  these passed in review and after they had been acknowledged by the knights as the companions of their voyage a most extravagant dance full of mummery and accompanied by musical instruments bells drums clashing of swords and other monstrous and deafening sounds finished the entertainment after which they grew intoxicated at the feast where many of the valorous knights who had sworn to massacre the saracens at the gates of jerusalem were either killed or wounded in this drunken frolic at paris  chap iii description of the mysteries in proportion as chivalry left france for the holy land so a taste for the entremets sell off and when the knights of the cross returned from jerusalem they were so full of adventures that the priests thought they could not do better than turn those adventures to the advantage of the church or rather of themselves  conscious however that a mere relation of that mad business would have but a disgracious effect they soon ceased to sing the exploits of kingly priests and sacerdotal generals and contented themselves with acting sacred history and personifying divine characters  for this purpose they formed themselves into a society but not being rich enough to buy ground much less to build a theater on it they first made proselytes of some of the most opulent tradesmen in paris and afterward had the condescension to accept of their money and property by which means they carried their scheme into execution  they chose for their scene of action the bourg of st maur desfosses near paris which had been rendered celebrated by the number of pulgrims who resorted there from motives of devotion the first mystery that was performed by this society was called the history of the death of our savior and from this circumstance they gave themselves the name of the confraternity of the passion  the followers of this species of amusement were as we are told in number beyond all belief business was so at a stand and every public concern neglected for the pleasure of running after this novelty to such a degree that in      the prevot of the capital issued an interdiction to suppress the pious farces of these holy actors the interest of the priests however was paramount to that of the prevot nay the interference of that magistrate was ultimately of service to them for upon petitioning the king to take off the interdiction they were invited to perform before him and he was so delighted with the poetry and the acting that in   0  he established them at paris by his own letters patent after which it was even fashionable to become members of this fraternity for we find that several of the kings household nay the king himself did not disdain to make a part of the company  the hospital of the trinity which had been founded in   00 for the reception of pilgrims was now converted into a theater for the representation of these mysteries the theater was wonderfully well constructed for the purpose of giving effect to the performances the front was much in the style of ours but the stage was upon a very different principal being intended to convey an idea of all objects as truly as it was possible to exhibit them heaven earth and hell were their three principal objects which they contrived to represent with great facility if the scene was to be heaven convolutions of clouds to an immense height and extent surrounded the stage on which angels appeared flying or walking as it best suited to carry on the amusement if earth the extremity of the theater seemed an immense expanse on which at proper distances objects appeared as in nature and if hell the whole stage was lifted up like the jaw of a monstrous dragon representing a tremendous abyss and out of the mouth which vomited fire came legions of devils  though the passion of our savior was the first piece performed by this fraternity which very possibly was originally written many hundred years before for no one has pretended to name the author of it three cotemporary poets of the thirteenth century whose writings were deposited among the manuscripts of charles the sixth seem to have furnished the materials for this brotherhood to work upon  those poets were called rutebeuf bodel and adam de la halle and among the most celebrated of their pieces which were all mysteries we find the prodigal son the miracle of theophilus the crusades and st nicholas and the children in the tub these three poets had their imitators to the number of fifty or sixty some vestiges of whose works we have imperfect accounts of they consist of subjects from scripture put into action and contain among a heap of rubbish some literary jewels of considerable value  it is impossible to deny that these writers were strongly possessed with a true knowledge of the dramatic art for where the subjects though scriptural are purely domestic and simple and have no reference to religion beyond fair and naked morality we find for such times many of the requisites that compose a regular piece calculated to convey amusement and instruction  one of these is the prodigal son written by rutebeuf so early as    0 a story which if we divest ourselves for a moment of having read it in the new testament as a parable has nothing to do with religion in any other respect than as it is a beautiful lesson of morality  rutebeuf chooses to throw into his piece all the nature and simplicity he possibly can and therefore feigning to forget or really forgetting that his business was to write a religious mystery he places his scene in a beautiful country and makes his characters opulent laborers a people of all others who are naturally strangers to artificial as well as real want  thus in the prodigal son has he given a most beautiful picture of the restlessness of human nature blessed with health and strength and assured of every rational blessing for only the trouble of earning it  and what bread is so sweet as that we earn  he makes it the business of his life to run counter to reason he torments his father in return for his unbounded indulgence and hates his brother because he is good and dutiful till at length he demands his patrimony and determines to seek his fortune  turned loose in that world of whose inhabitants and manners he has no knowledge the prodigal son is not more delighted and astonished than he is ashamed and confounded the compliments he receives on his wit his grace and his good sense though he knows them to be false he admits as if they were true nay he begins at last to fancy himself perfectly accomplished and under this idea is more angry with his father and his brother than ever who wanted him to consider himself as a clown and to linger out his life in obscurity but the delusion does not last long he goes to an inn where the landlord and waiters fly at his orders a lady enters he falls in love with her the dinner is served wine and music succeed in the midst of which another lady is introduced and he has the inexpressible pleasure of seeing himself an object of contention between the two ladies he appeases them and assures them he is in love with them both by this time they beginning to be tired with their farce or rather interested in bringing on the denouement make him drunk as fast as possible pick his pockets share the booty with the landlord and decamp leaving him asleep he afterward wakes discovers his loss and while he is raving about like one distracted the landlord brings the bill and finding his guest has no money kicks him out of the house  we next see the prodigal son a beggar on the highway his miseries have now made him contrite and he recals to his mind with tears the indulgence and the advice of his father he thinks of his brother who by industry and frugality is in abundance while he through his profligacy is starving for want in this wretched plight a peasant touched with his misfortunes takes him to his hovel and sets him to take care of his pigs in this situation he has time for reflection and at length his repentance is confirmed when he resolves to return to his father who receives him with tenderness and the reconciliation takes place exactly as in the parable  we have here a regular piece this is no mystery from scripture it is plain self evident morality it is a picture of human life such as it ever has been and ever will be and as to the poetical requisites it is full of them it consists of a single fable simple and grand it has beginning middle and end and there is not a circumstance throughout the whole but inculcates some moral instruction it is true rutebeuf does not seem to have read aristotle but he had read nature which answered his purpose better and if other authors had paid the scripture no worse a compliment than bringing it on the stage with so fair and so honest a motive  for what store can we so properly search to find moral instruction  the mysteries so far from profaning scripture would have honored it  as far as these mysteries were considered as a vehicle for poetry there is something in them awful and majestic to give an idea of this let us turn our thoughts to miltons paradise lost and then suppose this poem put into dialogue and acted on the stage which is the strongest case in point that can be imagined what would be the consequence the characters which while the readers fancy is fired with the glowing imagery of the poet are sacred and sublime would sink into the most miserable burlesque if attempted to be personified and this bathos would be still more complete in proportion to the beauty of the poetry  fortunately though to be sure it is a left handed advantage there was very little in the poetry of these mysteries to drive it into any such predicament it was miserable enough god knows but in return that the priests might be sure to incur their rightful portion of reprehension the matter was not only the most sacred that could be chosen but the most dangerous to expose to ridicule for when we consider that such subjects were performed on the stage as the conception of the virgin mary the passion of christ and the resurrection the mind is offended to a degree of outrage and we condemn that country where such an impiety was tolerated and those priests who connived at it  the mystery of the conception is composed in fifty three acts distributed historically and traced all the way from the prophecy of isaiah to the death of the innocents and without mentioning the chorusses has at least a hundred characters  to go over the plot would be to reiterate all we have read on the subject in the new testament which is on the stage tediously spun out in four feet verse with now and their a few awkward alexandrines perpetually fishing for the sublime and catching the bathos the joy of the human race on the coming of the messiah is truly poetical so is the discomfiture of the devils but if it had not been larded with the jokes of the landlord of the inn at bethelem who is very facecious with mary about the groaning and the devils putting new bolts and bars upon limbo for fear our savior should let out adam and eve it would not have been seasoned to the palates of the priests  the jests also of those who are employed by herod to murder the innocents with the leave of the holy fathers might as well have been spared nor can we forgive the devils after they have tempted herod with so many flattering promises of reward for instigating him to cut his throat and afterward kicking his soul about till they are tired and then enjoying the pleasure of seeing it bubble in a surnace of molten lead  there are a hundred other absurdities the mildest epithet that can be given them and yet this strange incongruous farago is excelled in point of impiety meant for sanctity in the passion which begins with a sermon by way of prologue and yet more in the resurrection which finishes with a figure dance between adam eve isaiah jeremiah john the baptist the good thief crucified with christ and an immense number of other souls whom the coming of the mesiah had liberated from limbo  these mysteries having obtained incredible reputation in the capital were very soon spread throughout the kingdom rouen angers le mans metz and almost every principal town had to boast a company of strollers deputed from the confraternity villon the poet who is said to have written several mysteries became very busy upon this occasion as an itinerant we are told by rabelais that having retired to his friend the abbe st maixent near poitou villon was very anxious to amuse the inhabitants of that place with the passion of our saviuor in the poitevin dialect rabelais relates a matter full of pleasantry and extravagance of this attempt of villon to establish religious mysteries through the medium of the theater i give it merely to show the singular and protesque manner of those times and the author who celebrated them he says that after villon had distributed the parts and the actors  rehearsed two or three times he prevailed on the mayor and the other magistrates to suffer the representation of the piece there was nothing now wanting but the dresses and though they tr their utmost they could not find any thing fine enough for the almighty who had always in these sort of pieces been introduced personally on the stage villon knew that at the convent of corders they had a magnificent cape which it was usual to wear upon h thursday and other religious occasions but the superior of the vent refused very abruptly to lend it for he said that the prov statutes forbad them to lend any thing to the theater which wa  house of satan villon maintained that the law reg only such peces as were profane and not those which con to the edification of the public  his arguments however w no use he was sent away without his errand having m known to the company his bad success they were one and all detmined to be revenged  to put their design into execution one day when the sacristan went on his mule to collect charity for the convent they hid themselves in a wood arrayed in the most horrible disguises and carrying in their hands cracked bells and flambeaux which they rendered more disonant and hideous by the addition of cows horns and large crackers in this trim they all on a sudden fell upon the poor sacristan crying oh the nasty villain of a monk who would not lend god the father a cape the poor superior half dead with fear confessed that it was very sinful but it was the practice of the convent to borrow every thing and lend nothing     the prodigious number of these entertainments it will be here impossible to give a correct account of it may not be amiss however to notice yet some few particulars concerning them  arnot greban canon of mans wrote the mystery of the acts of the apostles the title ran thus the triumphant mystery of catholic works in the acts of the apostles taken from st luke evangelist and historiographer another of these curious pieces was called the history of the old testament  this was the title the old testament in which is shown how the children of israel passed the red sea and reached the land of promise with several other histories such as job tobit daniel susannah and hester  a third has for its title the vengeance of christ in the destruction of jerusalem executed by vespasian and his son titus contained in several roman chronicles in the reign of nero and other fine histories in honor of our savior and the court of paradise a fourth is called the mystery of the patience of job and how he lost all his wealth by war and by fortune how he was reduced to the greatest poverty and how every thing was rendered back again by the grace of god  a fifth was entitled the sacrifice of abraham i take the literal words it is thus recommended this is a french tragedy necessary to all christians that they may find consolation in times of tribulation and adversity  this piece no more resembled a tragedy than any of the preceding ones but it appeared at a time when the mysteries began to tire therefore the author though he could no farther innovate than to change the description of the piece was determined to do what he could the mysteries which formerly took each of them four days in the performance began now to be considerably compressed and wherever any familiar circumstances occurred they were considered as properer for the stage than those more sacred subjects which were profaned enough by the ceremonies of the church nay it is not very clear that the authors who were now principally laical did not attempt as far as they safely could to burlesque these holy subjects by way of bringing them into contempt for we find about this time such titles as the joyous mystery of the three kings and the pleasant conceit of the apocalypse of st john of zebadee in which are contained the visions and revelations of the said st john in the island of patmos  thus much has been said to give an idea of the genius the manners the art and the language of french poetry in those times i shall now as briefly as possible go on to those amusements called moralities which succeeded the mysteries  chap iv description of the moralities and other entertainments the tragedy of abraham and another called the discomfiture of the giant goliath seem to have struck hard at the mysteries in france for encouraged by the first effort at innovation there shortly appeared a piece with the following title the mystery of the destruction of troy the great the rape of helen done by paris and composed in good french rhyme together with the prowess the virtues and the nobleness of the valiant hector the damnable treason committed by the greeks and many other histories containing all the transactions between the trojans and the grecians  this heathen mystery excited as much curiosity as had the religious tragedy curiosity begat controversy and the schism once sown especially as it had reason to nourish it the mysteries were quite at a stand at last the priests yielded with the best grace they could and the general title of pieces for the theater no longer assumed the term mystery but morality  it was difficult however to draw a line as a criterion for the regulation of so wide a field and therefore the subjects were sometimes holy and sometimes profane but as their general tendency was morality every thing was permitted  a pilot by name john parmentier supposed to be the first european who ever set foot in africa wrote a morality in honor of the assumption a cardinal wrote a choice morality called the reformation of taverns and alehouses and the destruction of gluttony and the valet de chamber of louis the twelfth wrote a morality which he called the just man and the man of this world by which he meant the personification of virtue and vice and he so completely wound up his plot that the just man was sent first to purgatory and afterward to heaven while the devils ran away with the soul of the man of this world  a physician of an honester cast than the physicians afterward ridiculed by moliere wrote three moralities entitled the road to health the government of the human frame and a prohibition of an indulgence of the passions  louisa labbe born at lions and called the french sappho at the age of fifteen followed her lover in mens clothes to the siege of pe pignan and afterward when she had returned and married the man of her heart wrote a morality called the folly of love she is said to have written poetry in four languages and her house was a sort of academy for the literati of her time  but the prodigal son of rutebeuf became now the great object of imitation it was performed with material alterations and it produced as many imitations of it as there were in england of the beggars opera scarcely an instance of filial piety or ingratitude could be invented but presently it was brought on the stage in the shape of a morality the subjects of one or two are worth attending to  the poor villager written in praise and honor of honest girls made its appearance the year after the prodigal son was revived the story is brief a seigneur of a village endeavors to corrupt his vassals daughter and finding all his arts useless is determined to have recourse to violence in this situation the poor girl promises to consent upon condition previously of speaking to her father the lord suspicious of every thing is determined to overhear the conversation and having effected his scheme without her knowledge he is witness to her imploring her father in the most earnest manner to cut off her head rather than let her chastity be violated struck with remorse the lord entreats her forgiveness gives her and her father their freedom and loads them with benefits  another has for its title the ungrateful son who is so completely the darling of his parents that they absolutely ruin themselves to make his fortune after a time they are overwhelmed with poverty and he is rolling in riches and when they have recourse to him as the only benefactor they know where to fly to he treats them most wantonly unnatural not even permitting them though they are starving to eat of a repast on which he is feasting the father seeing him treat the mother contemptuously can forbear no longer but lifting his hands and eyes to heaven curses him and implores the vengeance of god upon his head scarcely has he uttered this curse but a monstrous toad comes out of a pie and flies at his face which it completely covers attaching itself so closely that no human art can remove it the unnatural son begins now to relent and the parents too ready to forgive listen to his contrition he is however informed that prayer alone can expiate his guilt they therefore send him about from priest to priest afterward to the bishop and at last to the pope and by the time he has expended almost his whole fortune he is relieved by exorcism and exhortation from the frightful reptile and reconciled to his parents  this piece was followed by another called the morality of the child of perdition who killed his father hanged his mother and afterward went mad but these instances are enough to show the distinction between the mysteries and the moralities which were the only regular dramatic attractions of the times we are erroneously informed that the clerks of the bazoche established a theater where the beauty of virtue and the hideousness of vice were personified but the fact is that these clerks were no more than the laymen who gave the first blow to the mysteries and who afterward in conjunction or rather by the connivance of the priests performed the moralities at the established theater the priests being too cunning to shut out any opportunity of bolstering up their own reputation which at that time began to decline  we are told of a theatrical society called les ensans de sans souci but these cannot be regularly classed being no more than a number of young men of fortune and family who ran after pleasure and stuck at nothing to procure it in consequence of pursuing this career many of them were ruined and having talents they turned their thoughts to the stage for a livelihood they were many of them scholars and being out of humor with the world they walked in the footsteps of aristophanes and in their pieces lashed the manners of their time  this new species of amusement succeeded and the interest of the confraternity began again to be menaced these children of sans souci were therefore invited to join the regular theater in the same manner as the brotherhood had invited the moralists and thus this insatiate vortex from which perhaps originated the idea of the parsons barn swallowed up every thing that came in its way the stage however having gradually gone from mysteries to moralities from moralities to farces from farces to the grossest buffooneries and very frequently a mixture of them all the government took away the theater from the confraternity and in the year      the house of the trinity became an hospital according to its original institution  francis the first having accorded the brotherhood letters patent confirming all the privileges they enjoyed under charles the sixth they now sought for some new place of establishment and for that purpose hired the hotel de flandres where they performed four years but the king ordered the demolition of this hotel and several others near it and our holy actors were as far to seek as ever  tired with the considerable expenses they had incurred by transporting their theatrical trappings from place to place they resolved to build upon their own foundation they therefore bought some ground on which had stood the hotel of the duke of burgundy and there they erected their fourth theater which consisted of a hall and other edifices many of which are now to be seen  the parliament upon strong solicitation gave them permission to establish themselves there upon condition they performed none but profane subjects but nevertheless such as tended to promote the practice of morality  the confraternity of the passion who professed piety could not content themselves with performing subjects purely profane and therefore in the year      they let their theater to a troop of french comedians who had just then formed with a view of performing under the permission of the king the pieces now exhibited began to be a little more supportable than those of the confraternity of the passion by degrees the public taste became more extended and more pure printing being invented in the reign of louis the ninth and literature considerably more established under francis the first books of course became common different languages were generally learnt and these improvements introduced translations of the tragedies and comedies of the ancients  chap v from the commencement of tragedy to the time of hardy though jodelle is generally considered as the aeschylus and the livius andronicus of france yet the introduction of tragedy is certainly owing to lazare baif a gentleman of angevin who was educated by the celebrated bude baif traveled to form his heart and his understanding at rome he studied greek under the learned musurus and after he had accomplished every intelligence he thought necessary for his purpose he retired to his estate at anjou to lose himself in study  francis the first however unwilling that such talents should be lost to the world drew him from obscurity and sent him ambassador to venice where he fell in love with a young lady of condition by whom he had several children returned to paris he was promoted by the king to some honorable and lucrative situations and the first use he made of his learning was to translate such works as might be serviceable to the state  the task however in which he most delighted was translating sophocles and euripides the tragedy of electra containing according to its title the inhuman and truly piteous death of agamemnon by his wicked wise clytemnestra and his cruel adulterer egysthus was published at paris in the year       this tragedy that the french might clearly comprehend the nature of greek poetry baif translated verse for verse consequently the style is barbarous enough but he translated afterward the hecuba of euripides in a more liberal manner intending it for the edification of his children it was printed in    0 dedicated to henry the second and it is spoken of as an ingenious work  thomas sibilet about the same time published a translation of the iphigenia of euripides and other authors are spoken of who emulated bai the french nevertheless consider jodelle as the founder of tragedy for they say that these translations only serve to point out at a distance the road that dramatic writers ought to follow but this is only general opinion jodelle says the duke de valliere was the first who had the boldness to bring forward a tragedy of his own invention it was called cleopatra captive and published in      but it was a servile imitation of the cut and form of the greek theater and yet he has the glory to pass for the inventor of french tragedy but let us examine him  etienne jodelle lord of limodin was born at paris in      of a family illustrious both by birth and by talents the delight he took in studying the works of the greeks and the romans induced him to lament that the stage had remained so long in a barbarous state and that some superior genius had not introduced sophocles and menander seneca and terence into france but how to manage the confraternity were too intent upon deceiving the people to consent to such a dramatic revolution jodelle had influence and having constructed his cleopatra upon the greek model he procured a theater to be prepared in the courtyard of the hotel of rheims where his tragedy was performed before henry the second and a large concourse of spectators with the most extravagant applause  jodelle being then only twenty and remarkably handsome undertook to perform the part of cleopatra he also spoke the prologue which was a compliment to the king and in it he adroitly insinuated that the muses having flown from greece to france implored the protection of so great a monarch  this piece is opened by the ghost of antony who complains that the gods jealous of his valor and glory when living had connived with cupid to render him a slave to a passion that terminated his life and not contented with this they had made him become odious to the romans by provoking him to turn his wife and children out of doors since however matters are so this ghost seems determined to keep up the idea of all for love and therefore appears to cleopatra in a dream and advises her rather to kill herself than be led in triumph and chained to the chariot of caesar the ghost out of regard probably to the rules of aristotle enjoins her to meet him in the shades in less than twentyfour hours  the chorus at the end of the first act sing the instability of human wishes the fall of troy once so glorious the wretchedness of medea at the loss of jason and at length advert to the rose that lasts but a day and apply their remarks to the unhappy fate of antony and cleopatra  in the second act caesar enjoys the idea of cleopatras captivity in the third he has an interview with cleopatra who threatens to kick him and he runs away in the fourth she kills herself and in the fifth they deplore her death procullus exclaims never did the light of heaven discover so frightful a day for egypt i found her says he in her royal habit and her crown stretched dead and pale on a rich bed painted and gilt eras her woman lay dead at her feet charmion yet breathed but life was leaving her was this nobly done said i yes cried the faithful charmion it was nobly done and every succeeding king of egypt shall bear testimony of it this said she staggered sell and died  i considered it necessary to say so much of this tragedy as it was looked up to as the chef doeuvre of its time and a model for every thing that was to succeed it its reception encouraged jodelle to go on and he soon after produced the sacrifice of dido taken as closely as possible from the aeneid of virgil which had considerable success and after that a comedy called eugene or the rencounter which are supposed to make up the whole of his dramatic works for they are printed together with some miscellanies of his in one volume in       he appears however to have left behind him something more in manuscript for de la motte says i have the tragedies and comedies of jodelle in my possession some finished some hung upon the hooks these were commanded either by the queen or madame the kings sister but were deferred on account of the troublesome times de la motte also speaks of him as a man of universal knowledge and greatly esteemed by all ranks of people  a number of dramatic authors followed jodelle with various success but no single effort proved any thing equal to the model from which they copied till in garnier jodelle found a most powerful rival there is something so very extraordinary in the particulars of that mans life that i shall briefly relate them  robert garnier was born at ferte bernard in le maine he was intended for the law the study of which profession he very little regarded his inclination leading him wholly to elegant and classical literature it was not however till after jodelle had obtained considerable reputation that garnier was known as a poet but as soon as his name came fairly before the public he was considered as a french sophocles born to eclipse their aeschylus jodelle to make this similitude more perfect he began his career with gaining a prize at the feasts of flora established in provence for the encouragement of poetry   the report of his fame soon reached the court and charles the ninth was very anxious to attach him to his service but he preferred the comfort and tranquillity he enjoyed in the bosom of his family to the anxiety and uneasiness attendant on the followers of kings henry the second made another attempt to entice him to court alluring him with large offers to forward his fortune he had however the courage to resist this second temptation and pronounced upon this occasion as he had upon the other a harangue of thanks which proved him a good orator a true philosopher an excellent poet and a zealous citizen  he was nevertheless prevailed upon by his friends for the good of his country which stood in need at that time of every honest mans assistance to accept a charge in the grand council of the nation and for this purpose he established himself at paris he had not been long in the capital with his wife and his children whom he tenderly loved when the plague almost desolated that city by its ravages this was about    0 and in addition to the danger he had to apprehend to himself and his family a most horrible plot was devised against him by his servants who formed the monstrous and dreadful project for the purpose of plundering the house of poisoning him his wife and his children under an idea that their several deaths might be lain upon the plague  this shocking plot was detected and its perpetrators convicted and punished but it operated on poor garnier and his family only as a lingering death instead of an instant one for no sooner had the wife of garnier lifted the poison to her lips by which means the discovery was made but she felt its cruel effects and though every assistance was given her she fell into a weakness and a langour that at length terminated her life garnier survived her but a short time leaving his inconsolable children to the care of friends indeed but without a father or a mother  his tragedies eight in number are evidently imitations of the greek and latin poets he has chosen subjects suitable to the times in which he wrote and calculated to inspire horror at those civil wars with which france was convulsed during his life this he considered to be his duty as a poet and a patriot and while his zeal in the cause of his country added animation to his genius he at once wrote lessons for the conduct of his countrymen and examples for the enlargement of their understandings  no pieces says his biographer were at that time equal to those of garnier his subjects are noble his personages are great characters his style is harmonious and sometimes energetic the critics however have reproached him with preferring the manner of seneca to that of sophocles and euripides and to have given in dialogue which should be as near to nature as possible sometimes the familiarity of epistle sometimes the epic pomp of the epopoeia sometimes the pindaric flights of ode and sometimes the pastoral images of eclogue in a word to have forged new expressions chequered with greek and latin but in spite of these faults continues this writer garnier will always hold a considerable rank as a dramatic poet  chap vi from hardy to corneille from garnier to hardy comprehending almost the last half of the sixteenth century france produced many authors some of whom were men of original invention but far the greatest part were either translators or imitators of the ancients or else of their cotemporaries in other countries i shall not therefore speak particularly of any of these for they were remarkable for nothing but their strict conformity to the bad taste and puerility of many of those who had gone before them  to keep this matter therefore as interesting as possible it will be better altogether to pass by this dramatic chasm and come at once to hardy who by his astonishing secundity by the new character and particular conduct of his tragedies some of which are now to be procured certainly wrought a remarkable epoch in the history of the french drama  alexander hardy was born at paris but it is very uncertain in what year who were his parents or how he passed his youth all we certainly know is that about the year   00 he was celebrated for his dramatic talents and at that time we find him a retainer to a strolling company whom he in an astonishing manner perpetually supplied with novelty baif jodelle and garnier were men of family and consequently every particular concerning them is very easy to be traced hardy was very probably the son of an actor and actress and therefore his birth and his death are marked with obscurity   his reputation however soon attracted the attention of the comedians of paris who at their establishment when they came to a resolution of performing three times a week found they could not carry their scheme effectually into execution without the association of this poet who appeared to be so capable of furnishing continual novelty hardy undertook the task and performed it with such success that he continued their almost exclusive writer to his death which happened sometime between      and      for at the first of those dates he was certainly alive having at that time published himself the sixth volume of his works and at the latter he was dead for his widow was then obliged to commence a law suit against the managers for having shamefully rejected to fulfill their contract with him  hardy is said to have written eight hundred pieces this is extremely improbable and indeed it is very much doubted many authors of reputation however for though they seem very little to regard him are yet anxious about his works agree that he had an invention incredibly fertile and indeed if it be true that he almost wholly supplied the theater for nearly thirty years his productions must have been immense in point of number whatever they were in point of merit  scudery who insists that hardy wrote eight hundred dramatic pieces adds that he was a great man in spite of the envy that pursued him if scudery had instanced this as a proof of his being a great man nobody would have doubted him  that had he worked for his amusement instead of through necessity his productions would have been inimitable but as he unfortuaately struggled with poverty too often to the reproach of the world an attendant on poetry in neglecting hardy the age in which he lived has subscribed an indelible record of its own ignorance  perfaict says there are two perfaicts they were brothers and wrote in conjunction but all the french writers have a habit of mentioning them as if their works were written by one author i shall therefore conform to it  that if scudery for inimitable had substituted the word passable this eulogium on hardy would have been literally truth adding that one proof not only of his merit but his influence was that he established a regular price for dramatic pieces which no author had ever been able to accomplish before him for the rest continues perfaict it is very easy to see that his subjects are without choice or disernment that his versification is poor and low and that he has ill observed the rules of decency and decorum so essentially necessary in dramatic poetry but with all his faults it cannot be denied that he was born with distinguished talents which it is to be lamented his miserable situation and his unfortunate propensity to write verse so rapidly almost deprived him of the power to make an anvantageous use of it may be said further that he certainly understood effect on the stage more naturally and in a manner more perfect than any of the poets who preceded him and he gave so new a form to the theater at paris that those spectacles which began with him to be performed three times a week before his death were performed every day  gueret in a work entitled the war of the authors says that hardy wrote verse with such facility that he would often produce two thousand lines in twentyfour hours and that in three days he would write a comedy the comedians would get perfect in it and it would appear before the public we have no certain account that hardy wrote any comedy at all therefore that part of guerets remark is as ridiculous as the rest two thousand lines is equal to eighty pages the letter the current size of this history what writer will undertake in a day to copy half that quantity much less invent it besides gueret in his kindness outcalculates himself for he not only tries to prove that hardy was very lazy for at this rate he might instead of eight hundred have written more than three thousand pieces but he eclipses the poet in the superior merit of the actors unless as in the case of falstaff and the prince hardy had the talent of inspiring the actors with his instinct   fontenelle speaking of hardy writes more soberly his fecundity says he certainly is mavelous but then neither his verses nor the disposition of his pieces have cost him much pains nothing comes amiss to him every subject is good whether it is the death of achilles or a tradesmans wife that the husband catches in adultery it is all the same to hardy every thing is equally tragedy nor have manners or decorum any thing to do in the business now we see a prostitute in her bed who supports her character very naturally now we are entertained with a rape and now a married woman meets her lover at the place of assignation and they fairly tell the audience that they are going to bed together  fontenelle is also very angry with hardy for the immorality of his expressions which he says not only hurt his cause but his reputation to call a woman a saint is not only irreligious but unpoetic if he called her a goddess said fontenelle it would be perfect poetry and the very fiction that is permitted to lovers it is too serious to sport with truth there are saints but there are no goddesses here fontenelle has written a satire on doctor johnson and a panegyric on shakespeare johnson will not allow any thing mythological to be admitted into poetry shakespeare who knew without a prompter the whole province of poetry makes juliet say swear by thy gracious felf who art the god of my idolatry and i will believe thee   however continues fontenelle it must be confessed that the pieces of hardy have not that tiresome and unsupportable tameness of the greatest part of those that have gone before them but this is all the merit we can allow them for though the subjects give them sometimes greater strength and interest the poetry is not written with proportionable force  the reader will very readily from these remarks form a pretty correct judgment of hardy certainly the french stage has singular obligations to him but it is prudent however to observe that though he has general merit he has particular faults which to do him justice no one was more ready to point out than himself endeavoring at all times in very laudable self defense to throw the odium on his unfortunate situation which obliged him to write more than he had an opportunity to correct and this should seem really to prove that his genius and his talents were superior to what the world had a right to suppose them to give hardy as much fair play as possible let us instance dryden who though he has immortalized himself by a single poem would have left behind him by no means a brilliant fame had he written only for the stage not from his want of superior genius and talents but from his having been a dramatic drudge as hardy was i cannot however compliment hardy with placing him by the side of dryden whose worst play has probably more poetry than hardys best i only mean to instance the similarity of situation between the two men and by that to prove that if the extraordinary reputation of dryden was materially injured by his theatrical trammels the same inconvenience must certainly in a proportionable degree have lessened the reputation due to hardy   as to the number of pieces written by hardy we know by name but of fortyone scudery as we have seen insists that he wrote eight hundred and gueret has a much higher notion of the matter but scudery is a writer who was remarkable for exaggeration and gueret very probably as his battle of the authors like swifts battle of the books is a satire only meant to ridicule what he did not believe  hardy himself in his preface to his works speaks of six hundred and more which fontenelle pleasantly observes was no number at all when it is considered that his cotemporary lopes de vega had given to spain two thousand it should seem as he himself printed an edition of his works that over and above the fortyone pieces that edition contained his productions were perhaps irregular or unfinished or written to serve some local or temporary purpose or of some other description that rendered them unfit for publication and therefore whatever might have been their number he thought none of them worthy of selection  certainly hardy must have paved the way for that reputation the french stage so soon afterward experienced for we see in his life time not only so great an avidity in the public to frequent the theater that from three times a week plays were performed every day but soon after he got almost an exclusive possession of the drama on account of the prodigious concourse of spectators the comedians for the accommodation of the public separated into two companies one continuing in their old theater le hotel de burgogne and the other removing to a new one au marais this was about   00 when by an ordonnance of the police the doors of the theater were obliged to be opened at one oclock in the day and the performance to begin at two and finish at four at that time it was fashionable to dine at noon there were no lamps in paris few coaches it stunk with filth and swarmed with thieves   indeed the more we consider the circumstance the more we shall have to admire that hardy single handed could sustain the prodigious task of furnishing novelty to the theater with improved success for nearly thirty years when we shall see that it required not less than twenty celebrated men to keep it up to any pitch of excellence for the following fifty years during which period the stage flourished under the great corneille  on taking leave therefore of jodelle garnier and hardy it may be remarked that jodelle merited all the praise he received for emulating baif and thereby rescuing the french stage from barbarism by introducing the ancients for though he must have found insurmountable difficulties in attempting to suit the harmony of the greek language and the majesty of the roman to tierceness of the french yet those traits of nature and simplicity to which he was able to give force and effect were not only admirable in themselves but served as a model for his successors which foundation for fame ought not to be denied him for though it was only sowing a harvest for others to reap yet it must be allowed that his labors though not perfect were highly meritorious and that had he lived a century later he would certainly have been a celebrated writer  to garnier another species of praise is due which places his character as a great genius even above that of jodelle for though he took his subjects from the ancients his applications were all at home certainly the first and most perfect province of tragedy and which gives a writer opportunity to blend the patriot with the poet he inspired france with a just horror of domestic dissentions by representing the entrails of rome torn by her proper citizens he combatted pride envy and cruelty in the romans that they might be detested by the french a pen like this is the club of hercules and does more toward establishing domestic tranquillity than a thousand armies these destroy men the other destroys monsters  the praise of a bold and successful attempt at this reformation is due to garnier who had he been able to have accomplished that extreme difficult task of imitating without becoming a mannerist would to the force of his writings have added taste and style but the french language had not at that time been sufficiently filtered to be limpid it required that jodelle and garnier should be perfected by corneille and racine who admirable as they were experienced advantage in finding the source already explored to their hands  as to hardy we can add no more than that had he given himself time he must have greatly eclipsed his predecessors and taking in the idea that there was no competitorship nothing to excite emulation in him but on the contrary that his invention was constantly on the stretch and that his whole employment was to exhaust his fertile and productive mind and all this for no inducement but general applause for he was always poor it is impossible to deny that his genius was inexhaustible his industry meritorious and his patience exemplary  chap vii scudery tristan mairet du ryer rotrou and other harbingers of corneille we are now come to the time when the dramatic art in france began to look proudly forward toward perfection an era which in any country cannot be expected but from a grand association of talents this event nature seems at that time to have considered herself indebted to france for the fifty years during which corneille adorned literature produced a larger list of eminent dramatic writers than any other country in the same period ever had to boast  as this great luminary was surrounded with many satelites at his birth who shone with some brilliancy as they followed him through his career it will not be improper in a summary manner to speak of their merits the better hereafter to illustrate his  george scudery who we have already known as the panegryist of hardy seems to have been in need of a similar panegyrist himself for in endeavoring to outdo his favorite he fell into much more unpardonable errors himself he was not contented with writing very fast and consequently very imperfect but he thought proper to choose subjects that were uninteresting and plots that were inexplicable his scenes are therefore alternately wonderful and tiresome and his style beautiful and bombastic  his dramatic pieces eight in number were published at various times as well as a variety of other productions all which are said to have had a great sale this great sale of the works of scudery provoked the following impromtu ah happy scudery in thought so profuse that thy pen every month a new book can produce it is true thy productions never yet had pretense to genius or style erudition or sense yet scudery be happy though wise men never heed em still booksellers sell em that idiots may read em    scudery was born of a noble family in   0  at havre de grace and died at paris in      he served in the army obtained a high rank and was admitted of the french academy  francis tristan surnamed the hermit and supposed to have sprung from the famous pierre le hermit author of the first crusade was born in the chateau de souliers in the provence de la manche in   0  his character seems to have been something similar to our savage the poet for he possessed similar merit labored under similar misfortunes and endured similar poverty  tristan was placed near the person of the marquis de verneuil natural son of henry the fourth but having had the misfortune to kill an officer in a rencounter he fled to england where he first imbibed a taste for letters after a time he returned and marshal de humieres seeing him at bourdeaux presented him to louis the thirteenth who granted him a pardon and gaston dorleans took him for one of his gentlemen in ordinary  gaming wenching and poetry filled the time of poor tristan but not his pockets his poverty was extreme boileau tells us that he passed his summers without a shirt and his winters without a coat he died in      after having led a life agitated and full of events which he himself has given an account of in his romance called the disgraced page  tristan wrote a great variety of things but he is chiefly spoken of for his dramatic productions of which there are eight known to be his and two attributed to him his merit was of a superior stamp to scudery and others his tragedy of mariamne has certainly considerable merit indeed this piece as well as some others of his writings furnished matter for the imitation of more celebrated men and there can be no doubt had not his life been chequered with so much madness and folly had he not neglected his friends trifled with his reputation and disgraced his situation for he was noble by birth and had the distinction of a seat in the french academy tristan would have made a distinguished figure in literature it will be recollected that tristan formed his dramatic taste in england this was some time after the death of shakespeare whose works as well as those of jonson beaumont and fletcher and other writers of that time he must have read this will incontrovertibly prove that both tragedy and comedy were infinitely forwarder in england than in france but i shall reserve myself for a better opportunity of speaking to this particularly when i think i shall easily show that whatever may have been our obligations to the french theater since corneille and moliere it never would have arrived to the state of perfection in which they left it had not their cold inanimate productions received a promethean glow from the servid and celestial genius of shakespeare   of mairet there is very little to say he was born two years before corneille and died two years after him he seems as if he had kept his reputation by his connections for being attached to the admiral montmorency he was created a nobleman for his valor as to any pretentions to rank as a poet he had none but what were very slender indeed his pieces which amount to twelve are in general tragicomedies and clothed in very indecent language they are bold and broad but have neither conduct nor regularity his sophonisba however in which he has observed the rule of twenty four hours excited some curiosity nay it is even said that voltaire on that account attempted to repair it but he desisted saying that it was like an old house it might be pulled down and rebuilt with the assistance of better materials but that it was impossible to repair it  du ryer who was born in paris of a noble family in   0  was admitted into the academy in      he was secretary to the duke de vendome and obtained late in life the brevet of historiographer of france with a suitable pension a disproportionate marriage reduced him to work by the sheet as a poet this is enough to prove that whatever his merit might have been it had not fair play he left behind him nineteen dramatic pieces and five more are attributed to him alcionee saul and scevole are said to have considerable merit labbe daubignac says alcionee is full of beauty and grandeur menage considers it as a chef doeuvre and christian queen of sweden was so enamoured of it that she had it constantly read to her three times a day this is nothing to the style of madame daciers partiality for the clouds   du ryer is generally allowed a considerable share of reputation which if it was his due shackled and trammelled as it was must have been much greater had he written up to his feelings and not at the command of a task master  rotrou was born at dreux in   0  three years after corneille but as he died thirty years before that great poet it will be proper that he should be spoken of here rotrou would have been invited to become a member of the french academy had he been a resident in paris which regulation except to honorary members was indispensible as it was he was obliged to decline this distinction considering it his duty to write at dreux where he had several honorable employments to the duties of which he fell a sacrifice for conceiving his presence necessary for the better regulation of the inhabitants during a pestilential fever he was himself carried off by the disorder he had been so solicitous to avert  in nineteen years rotrou produced thirtysix pieces in which as his labors were entirely devoted to the valuable purpose of rendering tragedy natural and interesting and as there are a great number of poetic beauties to be found in his productions there can be no doubt but he may be fairly considered as the nearest at that time in point of intrinsic merit to corneille  rotrou nevertheless wrote too fast his soible was gaming and whenever he had a bad chance he repaired it by writing a play thus his pieces have not all the same force and beauty it cannot however be denied that in most of them there is an elevation in the designs the ideas are novel grand and bold and the conduct announces a judicious taste and a well informed mind  his errors are the errors of the times from which even corneille was not free his sources like the sources of other poets were as occasion served greek roman italian spanish and english tragicomedies were at that time the prevailing taste and these were taken from romances ill constructed stuffed with trisling characters frivolous episodes and every thing unnecessary and extraneous combats meetings partings disguises and other fantastic and extravagant circumstances outraged common sense and propriety destroyed sober and rational expectation and gave the piece more an air of knight errantry than nature  in this extravagance perhaps rotrou too much indulged himself but it was only going with the herd and it does not preclude him from the honest share of praise due to his real merit which was great and commanding and which had he lived to have curbed the mettle of his volatile muse might have confirmed him a reputation perhaps but little inferior to his great cotemporary  it will be proper to follow rotrou with some account of dasmarets colletet and boisrobert which sour together with corneille assisted cardinal richelieu in the fabrication of several miserable performances in which it is allowed he had a hand but which were most probably originally written by him and retouched by those five poets who fathered these plays that the reputation of the cardinal as a great statesman might not be scandalized  desmarets who was born in      seems to have had some wit but much more cunning he was called le belesprit of visionaries and the visionary of les beauxesprits he managed however his visions so well that they realized for him several lucrative situations under cardinal richelieu through whose solicitation he was also one of the first members of the french academy he published ten very indifferent dramatic pieces in many of which the cardinal is supposed to have had a hand particularly those under the titles of europe and mirame  colletet counselor and one of the forty members of the french academy was neither so fortunate nor so prudent as desmarets for though he was a great favorite of the cardinal and condescended to take his share of the odium which attached to him and his colleagues in consequence of the folly of richelieu who vainly fancied it was as easy to become a poet as a statesman he had not wherewithal to bury him when he died  boisrobert who being one of richelieus favorites was given a considerable place and also introduced among the members of the french academy seems to have had a fertile genius and less servility than desmarets and colletet he published twenty dramatic pieces some of which received no advantage from the assistance of the cardinal  there was also a man of very inconsiderable merit of the name of chapelain who seems to have been the servant of all work in his business he was compiler amanuensis prompter in short any thing but the most convenient among his accommodating qualities was his fathering all such miserable passages of the cardinal as the rest of the fraternity thought would disgrace them  richelieu no doubt had a hand in many of the writings of desmarets and boisrobert but the pieces supposed to have been first written by him and afterward fitted to the stage by the five poets as they were then called for distinction were europe mirame and the tuilleries some particulars relative to which pieces it may not be unentertaining to relate  after the cardinal had written europe he sent it by boisrobert to the french academy composed principally of his creatures and entreated their opinion without flattery begging also they would honestly correct any thing that militated against the rules of the theater or poetry in general the academy flattered by the unlimited conditions given them and perhaps pleased at an opportunity of vaunting their own consequence forgot the deference due to the cardinals patronage and disfigured the manuscript with so many alterations that it was all one blot like the picture of praxiteles  boisrobert having with extreme difficulty and caution made his report to his principal the poor cardinal who could stand unmoved when any disaster happened to the state fairly sunk under this disaster that had happened to his play and in the first paroxysm of his despair he tore the copy to pieces threw it into the chimney and in a state of the greatest despondency went to bed  happily being summer there was no fire on the hearth and this the wretched cardinal with the true tenderness of a father for his dear offspring recollected he got up sent for cherest his secretary ordered him to collect all the scraps that had been thrown into the chimney and asked him to get some paste or if there was none in the house to go to the laundry and fetch some starch cherest instantly obeyed his masters orders produced the starch and they passed the greatest part of the night together starching and patching the play till at length it wore a pretty legible form  next morning the play was copied in the cardinals presence who ordered the corrections made by the academy to be changed except some few of the most immaterial and in this state he sent it back by boisrobert with directions to inform the academy that they might see he had profited by their advice but as it was possible they might not be more infallible than him he had not altogether abided by their alterations  this proceeding had the desired effect for the academy perhaps at the instance of boisrobert desmarets and the rest having by this time considered that however scouting the cardinals play might as a set of literary characters add to their reputation yet applauding it would as politicians add more to their interest they thought proper to return it without any further correction together with a letter expresling their unanimous approbation  the cardinal however had a more impartial and certainly a more just ordeal to pass than the academy the public awed by no consideration of interest damned the piece and both the cardinal and the academy were so ashamed of themselves that not prevailing upon any of the five to acknowledge a concern in the play it was attributed by consent to a man of the name of st sourlin a creature of the cardinal  as for mirame the cardinal gave a sensible proof that he was its author for it cost him a hundred thousand crowns to bring it on the stage he assisted at the first representation and was in an agony of despair at finding it did not succeed when he went home he ordered desmarets to attend him poor desmarets fearing to face his patron alone took with him a friend whose name was petit and who had some humor and more presence of mind  the moment the cardinal saw them well said he will the french do you think ever have any taste do you know they were not delighted with mirame desmarets was consounded but petit knowing better how to humor the cardinal it was not i assure you monseigneur said he the fault of the play which is admirable it was the fault of the actors your eminence must have perceived that they were not only imperfect in their parts but they were all drunk i thought so said the cardinal well we shall see what is to be done on the next representation  desmarets and petit were so satisfied by this hint that they packed an audience who were not only admitted gratis this probably was the origin of orders a practice by no means improper under certain regulations and restrictions but which carried to such a shameful height as to form a positive opposition to the public opinion ought to be publicly scouted it was formerly the privilege of actors according to their respective situations to give their friends a gratuitous opportunity of seeing them perform who in return promoted their interest at their benefits it was also held politic both for the particular interest of the theater and the general interest of the public that men of genius should be permitted gratis to witness dramatic productions because the advice of enlightened men must necessarily assist the operations of the stage there are some few more cases also in which orders are not an insult but a compliment to the public but when it reaches to the scandalous length of procuring a suborned auditory who right or wrong are told to support a piece whatever may be the express sense of the public i know of nothing so shameful and so revolting every man who hazards a trial of his abilities before an english audience is as safe as on a trial for life before an english jury nay it is justice multiplied for should he succeed instead of twelve jurors he has hundreds indeed now thousands who sincerely rejoice at his acquittal and on the contrary should they from truth from candor and from the deference due to their own discernment be unwillingly obliged to pronounce a harsh sentence still be it author or actor has the object whose merits they have met to investigate an obligation to their decision which may either beget emulation that emulation may produce perfection or else induce a relinquishment of that pursuit for which there was no qualification but this is not all putting it out of the question that the public ought to be offended at the insolence of these gratuitous critics who cry bravo in concert and applaud at the word of command there is not common sense in the mode by which these maneuvers are conducted those who visit a theater through the medium of orders exclusive of such as i excepted before are a set the most vulgar the most ignorant and indeed the most impudent that can be imagined can a manager have an idea that they embellish his theater they sit in the boxes it is true but their appearance would disgrace the upper gallery can he rely upon them to criticize a dramatic performance they do not understand it does he think that they are the proper persons to rely on in case of a riot the very reverse they exist but in a row what an evil then must it become when it is considered for so is the fact that with all this meanness this ignorance and this vulgarity these orderly people in every possible way inconvenience all the rest of the audience they get the best places they are the loudest critics and they feel themselves so perfectly at home that they consider the play and its representation as an entertainment entirely provided for their accommodation it were pity but managers and authors for actors are now so abridged of this privilege that they are out of the question had sufficient manliness and independence to break through this disgraceful custom it would at once speak a consciousness of their own merits and an honest determination to court a decision from the real voice of the public the only one that can reflect any luster on their reputation  but paid for going and we are told by pelisson that the cardinal enjoyed this hired applause with the most enthusiastic rapture sometimes showing himself to the audience that they might be induced to applaud sometimes loudly applauding himself and sometimes commanding silence that his favorite passages in the play might be the better attended to poor boisrobert however with all his zeal suffered severely upon this occasion for not being able in so much hurry and bustle to discriminate as to the characters of those volunteers for whom he together with his colleagues had beat up under the banner of the cardinal he unfortunately introduced some ladies of equivocal character into the box where sat the duchess of aiguillon who was so outraged and offended at this conduct that richelieu most ungratefully banished him at her request the academy however who knew to their shame how little reason the cardinal had really to be displeased with boisrobert sent a deputation to demand his recall which however was not effected till richelieu being ill principally from chagrin asked his physician for a recipe who answered that his best recipe would be the presence of boisrobert  the comedy of the tuilleries was performed in the cardinals palace who arranged all the scenes himself corneille who perhaps felt himself a little awkward upon this occasion wanted to alter something in the third act but richelieu told him quil falloit avoir un esprit de suite meaning that the genius for him must be one subservient and accommodating  the prologue of this comedy which was written by the cardinal but fathered by chapelain praised all the authors who were seated upon this occasion very conspicuously among the audience colletet after the manupt of the comedy was finished read it to the al who having heard four lines was so end that he immediately laid him down fifty pies bidding him stop there for that the kings revenue could not furnish enough to pay for the rest in proportion the following are the lines which so enchanted the cardinal en meme temps jai vu sur le board dun ruisseau la can shumecter de la bourbe de leau dune voix enrouee et dun battement daile animer le canard qui languit aupres delle this is exactly bayess boar and sow and if these five poets had made it their study to hold the cardinal up as an object of ridicule they could not have more effectually succeeded that every reader may have an opportunity to judge of this great statesmans taste i have endeavored to render these four lines into english in such a way as to do justice to all the parties so have i seen inclining to be fond the humid duck explore the muddy pond ply her thick voice her wings in dalliance shake to animate to love the amorous drake   colletet laughed in his sleeve at this generosity of the cardinal and being asked by a friend if it was true answered  what a sum for four lines full of quibbles and quirks  ah would at this rate i could fell all my works       richelieu when he became more acquainted with these lines thought he could improve them and sent for colletet to talk to him upon the subject colletet wished to know what alter ation he thought proper to make and the cardinal said the second line la can shumecter de la bourbe de leau ought to run la can barboter dans la bourbe de leau barboter which means to muddle being a better phrase than humecter which means to moisten colletet affected to think the matter worthy mature consideration and promised to write to the cardinal upon the subject this promise he performed submitting to his patron whether the word muddle was not too low and unworthy an application for the chaste passion of a duck and a drake scrubs observation of two intriguing ducks in a millpond seems to have originated from the cardinals favorite passage how unconscious farquhar was that he made scrub ridicule the great richelieu   the cardinal who was extremely angry with this letter had scarcely read it when he was waited on by several courtiers who came to announce to him a brilliant victory the measures of which had been taken by his advice and the whole conducted under his direction they addressed him in a style full of flattery saying nothing could resist the authority of his eminence you are mistaken said the cardinal that scoundrel colletet resists me i did him the honor to alter a line in his verses and he has the impudence to write me a long letter in which he endeavors to prove i am in the wrong  it can be easily understood how such men as desmarets colletet and boisrobert came to be richelieus poetic drudges but it is extraordinary that corneille or even rotrou should notoriously join such a confederacy it appears however that they consented to it with extreme reluctance for they were by no means active in the business and withdrew themselves as soon as they could nay it should seem that richelieu felt this poignantly for he did every thing in his power to injure corneille and indeed meditated a revenge which he thought would accomplish his ruin  it however disgraced the cardinal most signally which the reader will easily allow when it is known that this meditated revenge was no less than venturing a second representation of europe which had been damned in opposition to corneilles popular tragedy of the cid europe was thus performed under the influence of the cardinal but when the actor came to give it out again he was hissed off and nothing further was suffered till the performers promised the cid for the next nights representation  richelieu is excused by his biographer for all this absurdity under an idea that he patronized these poets but the reverse happens to be the fact for according to what we have read they patronized him instead of allowing to them the influence of his name and protecting every valuable line they wrote he made them his tools that he might vaunt under their sanction every miserable line written by him is this patronage no give me that spontaneous disinterested patronage that without any selfish views or pretentions distinguishes merit fosters it brings it to light sanctions it recommends it and thereby confers an honorable pleasure on the patron and proves a mutual advantage to the poet and the public  but putting every other consideration out of the question there cannot be any thing so silly as the idea of several men writing in conjunction among many instances that may be cited to prove this pope gay and arbuthnot who separately one would think might have written a tolerable good play laid their heads together and produced a most wretched farce that was deservedly damned  here the application is particularly in point for though every one of these men except the cardinal produced single handed plays which had success yet when they worked together nothing could be more contemptible than the issue of their labors  chap viii dramatic events from the birth of corneille to the death of cardinal richelieu the great corneille an appelation that admirable writer very honorably merited was born at rouen the twentysixth day of june   0  he brought out his comedy of melite in      at the age of nineteen and he died the first of october in       he was intended for the bar but his genius was too elevated for that profession at the same time it was difficult to divine what bent his mind would take as he manifested no extraordinary gifts of nature the spark however only lay dormant it remained to be roused into action by love a young man took his friend with him to visit his mistress the lady chose the friend and rejected the lover the friend charmed with this preserence became a poet upon the spot hence the comedy of melite and hence the emancipation of the great corneille  there was treachery in the case certainly but the lady who was the subject of the comedy and who went a long time in rouen by the name of melite was principally to blame yet whatever anger the lover of this lady might harbor against his mistress the public were willing to acknowledge the highest obligations to her for they seemed from that moment to have a taste for dramatic entertainments unknown to them before  the particulars of this great mans life which for such a man are rather confined will gradually come in with the accounts of his dramatic success which for a time i shall now uninteruptedly follow his second piece was a tragicomedy called clitandre which he wrote to correct the too great simplicity that with all its merit the public complained of in melite this effort however had better have been let alone for if melite was too simple clitandre was too extravagant and rotrou having two years before brought out his first comedy the bague de loubli with success and soon after his comedy of the hypocondriaque the public had paused upon the merit of corneille which doubt clitandre unfortunately did not serve to clear up  his third piece called la veuve which was a comedy did not make its appearance till      and in the interval between clitandre and that rotrou had brought out doristee et cleagenor lhereuse constance les occasions perdues les menechmes which served afterward as a subject for regnard and celemene which was again retouched by tristan and at length written anew and brought out by rotrou with prodigious success under the title of vencestas in      when vencestas was in rehearsal rotrou was put into prison for a gaming debt he therefore sold his piece to the players for twenty pistoles which was just sufficient to release him but its success was so extraordinary that they gratuitously presented him with a considerable sum all which proves that as this was in the zenith of corneilles reputation rotrou must have been highly in favor with the public this piece which like the cid was originally spanish was afterward popular from a remarkable circumstance the famous baron quitted the theater for thirty years and he finished his second career as he had done his first by performing in this play he was then seventy years old and had such an asthma that he could scarcely speak he was however entreated to perform but had scarcely uttered twenty lines when he was obliged to quit the stage which he did with these remarkable words si proche du cereueil ou je me vois descendre   thus rotrou had by this time made a formidable stand against corneille which circumstance neither la veuve nor la galerie du palais a comedy performed the same year had power materially to affect nor even another comedy called la suivante the principal merit of which is if we believe a french author that the five acts are so exactly of a length that there is not a single line in any one more than any other  it is very possible that this extraordinary effort of bringing out three pieces in one year evidently excited by the success of his rival and after all meeting with but indifferent success himself induced corneille to join the cardinals confederacy for it was on the following year that the tuilleries was performed in which our author notoriously assisted as one of the five we must however do him the justice to believe that he very soon grew sick of the connection for europe did not appear till      i found it extremely difficult to get any authority that i might rely on in relation to the first appearance of this play the accounts generally say that it came out in      but this cannot be for the cardinal died in      it is most probable that it was produced as soon as possible after the cid and therefore i have placed it in      which some accounts seem to confirm  and for mirame it was not performed till      and as we know that the cardinal and corneille were at enmity when the cid was produced which was in      it is almost reduced to a certainty that this coalition as far as our poet was concerned in it did not last much more than a year and that he would never have joined it at all but under the expectation of meeting with a liberal patron in which expectation he was completely disappointed  in      appeared written by corneille a comedy called la place royale and his first tragedy called medee neither of which had by any means capital success and early in      came out a comedy called lillusion which corneille himself confesses he wrote by way of diverting his mind from the gloom of having written medee and therefore he declares it deserves but little notice in the interim rotrou always at work had surprised the public with lheureuse naufrage and four or five other pieces so that their success was hitherto upon the whole pretty nearly equal but it was very soon decreed that the genius of corneille should gain so complete a triumph as to leave all his competitors at an immense distance for in two months after the appearance of lillusion came out that admirable performance the cid  this piece which has many striking beauties and many glaring faults is nevertheless upon the whole a most extraordinary effort the cid was celebrated before corneille brought it out he himself acknowledges that he is much indebted upon this occasion to guillin de castro a spanish poet and fontenelie says that there was no nation however barbarous where the cid was unknown it must be confessed however the cid itself must have been as barbarous as those people who cherished it till it came polished from the hands of corneille who alone was intended as the lapidary to show the luster of this diamond  never had a tragedy more celebrated success it was repeated by heart taught to children and it was the custom to say beau comme le cid cardinal richelieu we are told had an ambition to be known as the author of it but corneille fonder of fame than fortune rejected the proposal with contempt that all powerful minister in other things defeated in this insisted that the academy should examine it who presently in their officious zeal to oblige their principal found out that all the rules of the drama were violated corneilles partizan agreed to this but drew from these premises a most powerful conclusion in its favor  all the poets however influenced by either the bribes or menaces of the cardinal joined in this hue and cry against the cid with the single exception of rotrou who with a generous disdain refused to join the league rotrou called corneille his father his instructor and never ceased to manifest the highest veneration for his character which gives no little luster to his own when we consider how long he had been his powerful rival and how nobly generous it was to place himself the palm upon the head of his competitor  it is hardly possible and if it were possible it is almost ridiculous to enumerate the nest of envious hornets which were roused by the extraordinary merit and success of this piece the academy through the influence of the cardinal sat as gravely and as solemnly to examine its merits as if the welfare of the nation had depended upon the issue of their deliberation but as if they feared the ill consequence of this officiousness they affected to proceed with all possible caution and delicacy  it is thought that the cardinals aversion to this piece proceeded from some sentiments it contained which exposed the undue influence of ministers and reprobated their injustice and rapacity it was impossible therefore for him to act too warily he first procured scudery to abuse the work and then represented through boisrobert to corneille that it would be a high advantage to permit his piece to pass through an examination by the academy by way of silencing every clamor to which corneille seeing the drift of the application answered that if the judgment of the academy would give the cardinal the smallest amusement he certainly should not oppose it  this was construed into a full consent on the part of corneille commissioners were immediately appointed to examine the cid and that every thing might wear an appearance of impartiality scuderys remarks were also to be examined after this the observations of the commissioners were reported and deliberated on in full assembly it was a long time however though they had several debates before they came to a conclusion but at length they agreed on reducing the cid to that form in which they thought it ought to have been represented it was in this state given to a printer and the first sheet was sent to the cardinal for his opinion who found they had gone from one extreme to the other for instead of pointing out the faults and amending them they had taken out the beauties and rendered the faults still more glaring than ever  richelieu finding he should only expose himself sent to stop the impression because what but blind malice could prompt a step at which the indignant public must naturally revolt being therefore a better politician than those he employed he contented himself with a few inconsiderable alterations which corneille had too much good sense to oppose and thus the matter was compounded and the piece has remained in that state to this hour  this play however though one of the most celebrated that has even to this moment appeared upon the french stage underwent a thousand comments the academy set the example and it became the mode to censure the cid shakespeare himself and that is a bold word never was more roughly handled some lines were said to be immoral others puerile others bombastic and others ridiculous even racine when he came forward as a poet did not fail to turn the cid into ridicule he parodied in his piece called les plaideurs the following line spoken in the cid by don diego ses rides sur son front ont grave ses exploits  racines line runs thus ses rides sur son front gravoient tous ses exploits  how is this said corneille is it permitted to a young man to ridicule peoples best verses but in this racine only took up the idea of the academy whose remark was that wrinkles do not mark exploits they only mark years  poor baron as i have already noticed like aesop quitted the stage and appeared on it thirty years afterward he was then very infirm but had been so great a favorite that the public suffered any thing from him one evening however when he repeated the following lines they burst into an involuntary laugh je suis jeune il est vrai mais aux ames bien nees la valeur nattend pas le nombre des annees baron disregarded the risible effect this had upon the audience and gravely repeated the passage when they laughed louder than before upon which he came forward and seriously addressed the paterre gentlemen said he i shall now begin for the third time but if i hear any one laugh i shall quit the theater immediately never to return this had its effect and they took particular care to offend him no more although the same evening when kneeling at the feet of his mistress she bid him rise he was obliged to entreat the assistance of two scene shifters before he could get on his legs  but the famous expression a tu du coeur has been more cavilled at than any thing in the piece it has which is saying a great deal been twisted and turned as many ways as shakespeares put out the light a wag had an idea at the time this line begat so much contention of insisting that shakespeares meaning was as follows when i have put out the light perhaps as it has been my custom at that time to indulge those fond ideas that till the warm imaginations of husbands who are going to bed to their wives i may forget my resentment in her embraces and thus her life may be spared an idea full of ingenuity as well as poetical justice for had desdemona lived only an hour every thing would have been discovered the guilty would have been punished and virtue would have been triumphant  this expression has been contended was altered by the academy from a tu un coeur and to confirm this some of the editions have it so and i myself heard it used to le kain the arguments in savor of this last reading are shrewd and sensible a tu du coeur is simply have thou courage which is a tame question indeed to be put to the valorous rodrigue from his father too a tu un coeur is have thou a heart which may be construed have thou nature affection family pride have thou in short resolution dear as the daughter is to thee to avenge the wrongs of thy father by destroying here is is thy affection to thy father proof against thy love for her to this degree and his answer beginning tout autre que mon pere is heightened by giving it this turn  but vainly were the tongues and pens of so many writers and critics at work to decry the merit of this piece it triumphed over all its enemies this despreaux notices in the following lines en vain contre le cid un ministre se ligue tout paris pour chimene a les yeux de rodrigue lacademie en corpse a beau le censurer le public revolte sobstine a ladmirer   the only hope that now remained with the cardinal of crushing corneille was that his following productions might be so inferior to the cid as to lower his reputation but he was completely baffled in these very charitable expectations for horace which was his next performance confirmed that fame the cid had acquired and in spite of the intrigues of the academy who again sat in judgment on him the public laughed their puny attempts to scorn and in proportion as their favorite was calumniated they strove to render him the justice his merit deserved corneille said upon this occasion that it was but fair his piece should meet the same fate of him who was the subject of it for added he horatius was condemned by the dvs but absolved by the people   horace appeared early in      and a few months afterward corneille brought out cinna a tragedy of considerable celebrity some say it is his best work others have declared for polieucte and he himself preferred rodogune  cinna wrought an effect on louis the fourteenth very honorable for its author and to the dramatic art the chevalier de rohan had conspired against the state and the king had constantly refused to grant his pardon to the most powerful and pressing solicitations the night before the execution of the chevalier louis was at the representation of cinna many passages of which piece struck him so forcibly particularly the speech of augustus in the fifth act where he congratulates himself on having obtained a conquest over his passions that though from pride or some political considerations he did not revoke the sentence of rohan yet he frequently afterward declared that if at that moment he had been solicited to save his life under any colorable pretext he certainly should have consented  this tragedy drew tears from the eyes of the great conde at the age of twenty of which louis augured so well that he considered it as a presage of his future greatness  polieucte which was the next production of corneille came out in    0 this piece had very nearly been consigned to oblivion or rather smothered in its birth corneille sent it to the theater for the approbation of the actors who refused to perform it one of the performers who was entrusted to return it to the author one day reperused a part of it as he walked about in his lodgings but being displeased with a passage he met in it he threw it carelessly from him and the copy fell upon the tester of the bed he gave himself no further trouble about it and nobody knew for a considerable while what was become of the play after it had been mislaid eighteen months an upholsterer took down the bed and rescued polieucte from oblivion  previous to the representation of polieucte on the stage corneille read that piece at the hotel de rambouillet which was then the sovereign tribunal in all literary matters the piece was applauded in the presence of corneille out of that respect which they thought due to the merit of so great a man but voiture was privately enjoined to inform corneille which he did in the most delicate manner that polieucte had not found that warm encouragement that might have been expected and that in particular those passages which concerned religion had most displeased corneille alarmed at this would have withdrawn his piece but was at length persuaded to leave it in the hands of the actors which however he would not do till one of them promised that it should not be performed this promise was broke which probably gave no displeasure to the author and polieucte made its public appearance  in the fourth act of polieucte there is a scene where severus struck with the unity of god discovers to fabian his doubts concerning the pagan religion which admits of many deities at once bellerose who performed severus in conveying these sentiments adopted a tone of such moderation and good sense that the public who had before seen nothing but extravagance and bombast were greatly struck with this new manner so much more like nature and as the subject was very awful on which bellerose exerted himself it was not only prodigiously admired but begat a respect and consideration for actors which had not before been attached to their characters  what severus says is no more than the vague doubt of a pagan to whom the extravagance of his religion rendered it an object of suspicion but who had not the smallest knowledge of those proofs which render the christian religion more respectable than paganism on this account corneille was very much blamed for printing it for it was said that notwithstanding his delicate and proper intentions they might be misinterpreted  polieucte however as i have already said began to open the eyes of the public as to the respectability of dramatic entertainments considered in a moral light  this circumstance joined to another altogether as extraordinary no less than that the actors from the moment they were considered as more respectable actually became so procured on the sixteenth of april      the following favorable arret  in case the said comedians regulate the action of their performances so as to be entirely exempt from impurity we will that their exhibitions  as by this means they will innocently amuse the public  be considered as void of blame and reproach and also that their occupation shall not be pleaded as an impediment to the exercise of any business or connection in public commerce  in      corneille produced pompee and in      in which year cardinal richelieu died appeared le monteur certainly corneilles best comedy so that the cardinal lived long enough to see the man against whom he had shown so much rancour merely because he was possessed of superior talents to himself which talents he disdained to prostitute for patronage secure in a firm and permanent reputation which all his infidious arts had not been able to deprive him of  as to other dramatic events from the birth of corneille to the death of richelieu they consist principally of contentions for fame between different poets among whom there were a great variety of pretenders indeed so many that the regular theaters could not entertain their productions in consequence of this several attempts were made to establish a third theater one of which in      partially succeeded  a party of these disappointed poets through various interests prevailed on the lieutenant civil to grant them permission to open a theater at the tenniscourt in the street micheldecomte for two years this theater being situated in a part of paris where the streets were very narrow and the surrounding inhabitants of the lowest order it became a nest for all manner of thieves and sharpers and also a market for the vent of the most execrable literary trash it was therefore represented to the parliament as a nuisance and in less than a twelvemonth from its establishment it was shut up by authority  of the confederacy who wrote in the pay of richelieu we have partly seen the success it may not however be improper to go over such particulars as may serve to show the complexion of the times as to the encouragement of the drama during that period  scudery between the birth of corneille and      brought out fifteen pieces with various success his first performance was a tragicomedy called ligdamon et lidias for which he thus apologizes i have passed says he more years among armies than hours in my closet and have used more matches to fire guns than to light lamps i can range soldiers better than words and know more adroitly to halt a battalion than to round a a period of these truths this piece gives abundant proof for it is certainly a most miserable performance and should not have been mentioned here but for the opportunity of noticing what dwarfish seconds richelieu had recourse to when he combatted the giant corneille  when scudery produced his lamour tyrannique a very indifferent performance the cardinal fought knee deep for it he declared that this piece spoke its own eulogium and sarrazin to curry savor printed a discourse at the head of it addressed to the french academy where he endeavored to point out the beauties of the play and the talents of the author in consequence of this all paris crowded to it and at their return home laughed at themselves for their credulous folly upon the whole his mort de caesar seems to have been his best play and voltaire was so much of that opinion that he certainly borrowed many passages from it  the pieces of du ryer during this period eight in number are of a better kind than those of scudery but they give proof in how very barbarous a state the stage still continued we have seen fontenelle incensed against hardy for the proflgacy of his muse and the indecent situations into which he has thrown his characters but the lucrece of du ryer will show that even the commanding genius of corneille had not been able to give the theater that polish without which it cannot be considered in a state of perfection  the plot of this piece is simply the roman story tarquin with a poignard in his hand demands of lucretia the sacrifice of her virtue she struggles and escapes behind the scenes the audience presently hear her cries and soon after she comes on in the utmost disorder and fairly tells the spectators that her honor is violated this circumstance is topped by the elegant terence in his comedy of the andria who makes a lady complain on the stage of a pain in her bowels and after she has retired for some time during which she is heard to groan and cry piteously the audience are informed that she is brought to bed indeed terence is so fond of ladies with child that he has introduced another of them in his adelphi and also a common prostitute both of whom are honestly married to these brothers with the consent of their father and of their uncle who had adopted one of them and really if these are the pieces of menander stolen from the greek by terence for the edification of the romans and we are to consider these productions as models for us the true drift and intention of the dramatic art is to reward vice and punish virtue but these are the ancients and who shall have the temerity for a single moment to doubt their infallibility   to mairet certainly very little praise can be due if we are to credit which is generally admitted that sophonisba which as we have seen voltaire thought it worth his while to retouch was written by theophilus viaut and the viosinaries by desmarets with the assistance of richelieu but this last may be a mistake owing to the similarity of the names  there is something in the story of viaut that it may be worth while to relate his manners were so licentious that he was banished france he had nevertheless some friends and after he had resided a few years in england where he imbibed an inclination for the dramatic art he was recalled he was always of the persuasion of the country where he happened to live in germany he was a calvinist in england a protestant and in france a roman catholic he was nevertheless in every place a libertine and as he wrote poetry with great facility he never failed to lash the roguery of priests with great asperity on his return to france he wrote a severe poem called parnasse satyrique which work was considered so very licentious that he was condemned to be burnt he escaped and was burnt in effigy as he was wandering however from one retreat to another he was arrested at catelet and shut up in the same dungeon with ravaillac the parliament commenced anew their process against him and he had such address that his trial was alternately put off and renewed until the expiration of two years when through the great interest made for him his sentence was meliorated to perpetual banishment  he retired to the estate of the duke of momorency where he lived in a more reasonable manner and declared to his last hour that he was innocent of the charge that had been brought against him  he was intimate with mairet who was also protected by momorency and if desbarreaux is to be credited who was the friend and intimate of them both theophile left behind him in the possession of mairet his tragedy of sophonisba which with the deduction of the visionaires sinks mairets fame materially  of the productions of rotrou i have spoken more at large that poets reputation having been the nearest to that of corneille in      he had brought out twentysix of his plays many of which had considerable merit and nothing can give stronger proof of this fact than that though he is at present very little known on the stage by his own proper writings yet the materials that composed them are so good the characters so natural and the subjects so dramatic that the most celebrated writers since his time have not disdained to take him for their model witness the thebaide of racine which is an imitation of his antigone the ines of de la motte taken from his laure persecutee and les soeurs rivales of quinault which is but little more than a copy of his deux pucelles  it would be prolix and tiresome to notice any thing further concerning the theater during the time it was patronized if i may so call it by richelieu a man as shakespeare says speaking of his brother cardinal of an unbounded stomach who not content with governing france almost absolutely with lowering the pride of austria and regulating the movements of europe at his own will added to all this desire of stirring up national commotions a perpetual wish of fomenting commotions in the theater when the cid came out he was as much alarmed as if the spaniards had been at the gates of paris what then must have been his miserable condition if fontenelle is to be believed who says that after the cid corneille became more elevated in horace still more in cinna and still more in polieucte beyond which no merit can reach  it cannot be denied that this struggle of richelieu to attain dramatic fame certainly ascertained what dramatic fame was the cardinals favor being naturally sought after all those who fancied they had literary talents put what little merit they had to the test all those who really had genius strained every nerve to excel one another this emulation in a short time did wonders it purified the taste mended the style and regulated the conduct of dramatic entertainments  the choruses which had been introduced by jodelle and scrupulously observed by the dramatic poets till      were afterward banished from the theater instrumental performers were substituted in their place who were first situated between the wings on the stage afterward in the upper boxes after that in the lower boxes till at length it was thought proper to situate them between the audience and the stage where they are now constantly seated  for these and other circumstances which contributed to perfect the theater and which could not in so short a space as twelve years have wrought such a reform without the assistance of some high and commanding influence the french nation are certainly indebted to richelieu who though he in himself found a wide difference in the talents necessary to form a great writer and a great statesman was certainly the cause of bringing forward to public notice that merit in others which he envied but could not imitate  all this fontenelle though his best apologist allows but he adds that he recompensed as a minister that merit of which he was jealous as a poet and that however his great mind might have had weaknesses he seldom failed to repair his faults by something noble surely when fontenelle made this remark he forgot that he was writing the life of corneille  chap ix from the death of richelieu to the death of rotrou though the great reputation of corneille at the death of richelieu could not have received much additional celebrity for nothing is so fair an object of public encouragement as that which is privately oppressed yet after that period by being more unrestrained it grew more commanding his pieces in the opinion of the public threw all others at a distance and those four tragedies which fontenelle declared nothing could exceed continually occupied the theater adding at each performance a new trophy to his well earned fame  the success of the menteur induced corneille to follow it up with a sequel which like the original was an imitation of lopes de vega this sequel seems to have shown its author that however he might be capable of writing comedy it was either not his forte so properly as tragedy or that comedy was not in france arrived at that perfection to which he and others had brought tragedy indeed this task remained to be performed by moliere  the suite du menteur though it received applause not however the applause to which corneille had been accustomed and though when it was better understood upon a revival it had still greater success determined corneille to return to tragedy he paused however probably that he might do nothing unworthy the fame he had so honorably acquired and did not venture to produce another play until      when the public testified the highest satisfaction at his tragedy of rodogune  i have noticed already that corneille rather inclined to think this his best work let us see what he says himself on the subject i have been often asked says he which of all my dramatic poems i esteem the most and i have generally found that those who have put the question to me were prejudiced either in favor of cinna or the cid i have therefore been cautious of declaring my real sentiments which are certainly in favor of rodogune this preference is perhaps in me the effect of that blind partiality which parents sometimes entertain for one child rather than another perhaps it may be tainted with a little self love because this tragedy is more properly my own than any thing that has preceded it on account of the incidents being new original invented and such as had never before been placed on a theater and if this reason should be just it establishes a fact which confirms the propriety of my partiality i shall have good opportunity to prove that corneille was not singular in this opinion  this preference for rodogune seemed a presentiment to corneille that his reputation was at its height for from the time that tragedy was produced till      when corneille left the theater in disgust the particulars of which we shall see hereafter though his general fame kept an honorable stand his productions were reviewed with less warmth than he had been accustomed to experience his tragedy of theodore produced the latter end of      had very indifferent success considering it was the production of the great corneille heraclius brought out in      though admired by the judicious the world affected not to understand and andromede was obliged for the astonishing reception it met with to scenery machinery and a living pegasus the best performer according to public opinion in the whole piece  the fact is that corneille was born to be the sport of cardinals richelieu endeavored to overwhelm him by turning the tide of prejudice one way and mazarine endeavored to leave him aground and the theater with him by diverting it another corneille when he brought out cinna probably under an idea that it would gall richelieu had determined to dedicate it to mazarin but receiving an intimation that it would be coldly received and above all that he would get no dedication see he changed his mind and addressed his tragedy to monsieur montauron a soi disant mecaenas from whom he received a thousand pistoles this was every way considered as a merited satire on the two cardinals and it was fashionable afterward to call epistles dedicatory epitres a la montauron   i have noticed that theodore was cooly received heraclius was of itself a singular production but by the inattention of the public who began to be tired of every thing regular and striking it was considered as a very heteroclite performance and incapable of affording pleasure equal to the pains it took to pay it proper attention  the fact is corneille had been so charmed with that originality on which he so warmly congratulates himself in rodogune that he was determined to be still more original in heraclius in consequence of this he has certainly in places obscured what he meant to elucidate the abbe pelegrin whimsically calls heraclius the despair of all the tragic authors and despreaux archly says it is not a tragedy but a logogryphe the best part of the story is that with all its originality corneille is accused of having stolen heraclius from calderone who beyond all question stole it from him calderone produced afterward in spain a play almost a translation of heraclius which he called in this life every thing is truth and every thing is falsehood the fact is calderone was in paris when heraclius first made its appearance he was introduced to corneille who informed him with the same frankness which accompanied all his conduct that he had formerly been accustomed as in the instance of the cid the menteur and other pieces to avail himself of what had been already done by the spanish poets but that in the present instance he had the good fortune to present the public with a happy original this calderone was very much pleased to take advantage of and though perhaps he would have been the first to have acknowledged his obligations to corneille the enemies of that great man propagated a report that he had stolen his play from calderone a calumny he so much despised that he did not think it worth his while to refute it   let us see what corneille himself says upon this subject this tragedy says he is more an effort of invention than rodogune and i may dare say that it is a happy original of which there will be many copies he then goes on explaining the nature of the incidents in what manner they are knit together how involved in difficulty and intricacy and at length says that they certainly cannot be comprehended but by reflection after the finish of the piece and perhaps they are not to be enjoyed with taste till the spectators have witnessed a second representation certainly this however it may recommend the piece to a perusal in the closet cannot be in its favor as a dramatic production where every thing should be comprehended at once but this piece has given his enemies a handle as well as some scenes in pompee to cavil at corneille under the idea of comparing his writings to the turgidness the flatulency and the obscurity of seneca rather than the nature the simplicity and the beauty of sophocles and euripides which opinion fontenelle does not altogether contradict  it was not however so much the fault of heraclius as the times that the public attention which had been so unremittingly paid to corneille began to waver mazarine who found that his predecessor had been indebted if not for his popularity at least for his notoriety to poets and actors was determined to see what fame he could derive from composers and singers in short it was in      that mazarine established the opera in france the particulars of which however i shall defer till i have gone on with the french theater to the death of rotrou  it was necessary however to introduce the opera here because it immediately became the rage to such a degree that no dramatic spectacle from that time stood the smallest chance of success that was not recommended to the public by splendid scenery machinery and decorations by which tide of folly we see corneille borne away as well as the rest for in    0 came out andromede ushered to the public by all the foppery of the venetian opera  it would be pityful and unworthy to describe all the particulars of that puppet show through which the public were now to admire the brilliant talents of the great corneille one principal object of admiration was a living pegasus slung in a way so peculiar that he sprung into the air and seemed lost in the clouds the poor horse it seems was kept without food till he was almost starved and in that condition fastened in the flies to a cord with pullies so constructed that by a counterpoise his own weight could carry him to the other side of the stage when it was the proper time for this pegasus to exhibit a man on the other side so concealed as not to be seen by the audience held in sight of the famished animal a sieve of oats the creature instantly began neighing and pawing and when he had been sufficiently irritated the rope that had restrained him was loosened and the effort threw him into the air till he arrived at his stable in the clouds where he was recompensed by a good supper for his dexterity  it is true says the author of this article we have seen living horses in the italian opera but none of them had to boast the warlike ardour of the pegasus in corneilles tragedy of andromede his movements were admirable and certainly contributed very materially to the success of the piece having settled corneille so comfortably upon his pegasus or rather upon the hobby horse of cardinal mazarine i shall now go over such circumstances as passed from      to    0 and particularly numerate the various success of rotrou  tristan during this interval produced four plays which had tolerable success but not equal to his mariamne which i have already mentioned as a celebrated piece scudery brought forward only one which was his last it was a tragicomedy called axiane and written in prose scudery whose emoluments and preferment came through the channel of richelieus bounty did of course in that statesmans life time what he was bid and therefore could not indulge his own vein as to writting in which instance the cardinal for once was certainly in the right for finding that scudery had nothing for it but an inflated style borrowed from the school of seneca he advised him never to write a play in prose as soon however as the cardinal died and he had the liberty of writing without a dictator he indulged the bent of his own inclinations and wrote axiane in prose when his muse being unaccustomed to walk without styles hobbled so wretchedly that the piece was not only consigned to oblivion but the author too for this failure added to the dislike the public conceived against him for meddling with the reputation of corneille induced him at the persuasion of his friends to lay down the employment of a dramatic writer  this piece was produced in      and though scudery lived till      we hear no more of him as a dramatic writer  scarron who was born in    0 and died in    0 brought out his first piece called jodelet or the maitre valet in      and four others before    0 the last of these lheritier ridicule pleased louis the fourteenth when he was young to such a degree that he had it performed three times in one day it will be necessary hereafter to speak of this extraordinary man and his productions  letoile a very labored writer brought out one piece in      and another in      he is said to have assisted richelieu and some authors will have it that he was one of the five who sat as the ostensible authors of les tuilleries by which it should appear that corneille did not sustain that disgrace but i am afraid that we must not flatter ourselves with any such hopes for voltaire and many other authors have taken so much pains to ascertain the fact that it is my unwilling duty as a historian to set it down for truth  la serre a curious author and a whimsical character brought out in      a tragedy called saint catherine and another the following year called thesee he wrote five other wretched plays some of which however through the influence of richelieu had great success in particular thomas morus first performed about six months before the cardinal died it was represented at the palais royal and seems to have been one of the cardinals last efforts to injure the reputation of corneille a public print of that time evidently under the influence of the cardinal gives the following account of thomas morus this play acquired a reputation which no other of its time ever had cardinal richelieu was melted into tears whenever he was at its representation he gave public testimony of his high esteem for it and persuaded all the court to follow his example le palais royal was too small for the concourse of people that crowded to it and four porters were killed in one evening endeavoring to keep away the multitude this is says the paragraph writer what i call a good piece monsieur corneille has never had such powerful proofs of the excellence of his productions and i never will permit him to rank before la serre till any one of his pieces shall have excited so much public curiosity as to be the death of five porters   la serre was librarian to mounsier brother of louis the thirteenth and had a superficial knack in consequence of his acquaintance with catalogues and the names of authors of writing a great deal without method or coherence nobody however felt or acknowledged this more readily than he did himself for being totally without disguise he allowed that his propensity was the cacoethes scribendi and nothing more which as it turned to such good account he indulged in order to catch the attention of so profitable a patron as the cardinal having attended one day to a very long and tiresome public discourse he embraced the orator as he descended from the rostrum my dear friend said he i did not think such a thing was possible what said the other what replied la serre why you have uttered more nonsense in an hour than i have been able to write in twenty years and yet i have tried hard too  la serre used to say that he boasted one advantage that no author had ever done before him for said he i get rich by writing wretched productions while men of merit are dying of hunger i know not what the inexperience of la serre might induce him to believe but i fancy though he conceived the application to have belonged only to himself it is a lamentable truth that it ever has been and ever will be but too general  when he was reproached with the promptitude with which he wrote he answered that his pegasus had golden wings and would not be restrained so i even said he throw the rein over his neck for i have so little relish for what is called fame that i would rather get a fortune and spend it merrily than be miserable in this world and save up money to build a monument for me after i die the fact is said la serre one day to a confidential friend i beg borrow and steal to such a degree in my productions and have so little ability of my own that this library of monsieur may very properly be compared to a seraglio the books to beautiful women and myself to the eunuch who guards them   this strange character who appears to be more knave than fool but who certainly was the indifferent writer he himself represents would never have examined books any further than to dust them if he had not been induced to try his hand at the instance of richelieu  la calprenede who enjoyed in some degree the favor of richelieu and who was as report goes much indebted to the great conde for some episodic parts of his pieces was a native of gascony and a dramatic poet he produced in all thirteen pieces four or five of which appeared between      and    0 to his patrons however he is indected for his reputation if it may be said that he had any he read his comedy of clariente one day to richelieu who told him that the piece was tolerably good upon the whole but that the expressions were lache a word signifying as to writings loose careless negligent and as to men cowardly  cadesis said the author in the true gasconade style i would have your eminence know that nothing lache ever belonged to the house of calprenede  gombault of whom there is nothing remarkable but that he was one of the members of beauxesprits formed under conrade which gave rise to the french academy brought out two pieces during the intermediate period at which we are arrived he was certainly a man of talents but he was rather a general poet than a dramatic writer  i come now to speak of thomas corneille who was born at rouen it has been said on the very day certainly in the same year that his brother brought out his comedy of melite  he followed the same career of his brother but with less success though some think he adhered more strictly to the rules of the theater a negative merit which upon proper occasions the great corneille knew how to despise despreaux says a french author did right to call him the norman younger brother but wrong to say he has written nothing reasonable this satirist had perhaps forgotten that many of his pieces keep the stage with reputation this observation was written about the year        as these brothers go on hand in hand i shall have plenty of opportunity to notice their different merits at present i shall only speak of such pieces as t corneille brought out before the year    0 his first piece a comedy called les engagements du hazard came out in      it was taken from two pieces of calderone one having the same title and the other the house that has two doors it is difficult to guard his next comedy produced in      called les feint astrologue is also taken from a play of calderone under the same title el astrologo fingido which two years before had however been brought forward at the theater by douville brother of boisrobert whom i shall presently have occasion to mention  these pieces and don bertrand de cigarral which came out early in    0 are all i shall speak of at present from t corneille which as the first and second were taken from calderone and the other from don francisco de roxas and after all was a mere farce though in the minority of louis the fourteenth it was certainly performed at court more than twenty times amount yet to nothing that promises for him a reputation likely to keep pace with his brother  douville was an author of inconsiderable merit and it well might be so if he was as he is represented to have been much inferior to his brother the pieces he brought out from      to    0 were jodelet astrologue almost copied as abovementioned by t corneille the coeffeuse a la mode and les soupcons sur les appearance in all which he is supposed to have been assisted by boisrobert  boisrobert in      brought out linconmic which was taken from calderone and almost in the same manner with t corneilles first piece les engagemens du hazard this did t corneille but little service but he excused himself by saying that he had long written it but had reasons for keeping it back boisrobert brought out before    0 also la jalouse delle meme translated from lopes de vega  benserade a writer of merit about this time produced two or three plays he was born of a noble family in normandy in      and intended for the church of which body he was expected to have made a very respectable member but his destiny decided otherwise for having seen mademoiselle bellerose a beautiful woman and a favorite actress he soon exchanged his breviary for a cast book and his saints for the muses it is astonishing with what avidity he cultivated his theatrical employments nothing came amiss as we shall see when we find him composing ballets in conjunction with quinault and lully by the liberality of the queen cardinal mazarine and several other persons of rank he acquired a large fortune which he enjoyed uninteruptedly till his death which happened at the age of eighty in an extraordinary manner  he had suffered some time the greatest agonies from the stone which notwithstanding his advanced age he was determined to get rid of by cutting his courage however was put to a proof still more extraordinary for a surgeon who by way of preparation had been instructed to bleed him wounded an artery and was so alarmed for fear of the consequences that he fled without binding up the arm benserade therefore bled to such a degree that assistance came too late and they had just time to call in a confessor when he expired with great firmness in the arms of his friends  when we have seen the success of rotrous remaining pieces we shall have before us every thing of any material consequence that was opposed to corneille from the death of richelieu till    0 paris at that time swarmed with authors and so indeed it has from that time to this but my limits will not permit me to give more than the leading features of dramatic productions and events  rotrou brought out ten pieces during the interval we are speaking of and all with a considerable degree of reputation particularly cosroes which has been often revived with success don lopes de cardonne which was proclaimed worthy the pen of corneille and vencestas which in addition to what has been said of it already was revived by marmontel and begat a literary dispute that i shall notice in its place highly honorable to the reputation of rotrou  in short taking in all the circumstances we must certainly place rotrou as a dramatic writer of eminence he possessed all the requisites of a poet of this description he knew character conduct and discrimination he had the good sense to reject as much as the times would permit him that barbarity which characterised the french stage and though his own talents were not of weight and consequence enough to attempt the herculean task of cleansing this augean stable yet when he found corneille had resolutely undertaken this labor he certainly lent him a respectable helping hand so that we may fairly say if corneille had never lived rotrou would have enjoyed the first rank in his time as a dramatic poet but corneille having lived rotrou moved only in a secondary sphere although his reputation derived more splendor from the reflection of this luminary than it ever could have boasted from its own proper power at the same time it must be acknowledged that the reputation of corneille derived no mean addition from the literary race in which he was very often hard run that with strenuous exertion he gained from rotrou  chap x the opera and corneilles first retirement from the stage as the opera very materially deranged the state of the theater about this period it is necessary it should be mentioned here but i shall defer the account i mean to give of its origin till i have brought the french stage forwarder lest it should prove too much a digression and so cool the interest that naturally rises from a progressive account of tragedies and comedies  i shall therefore content myself with introducing this species of entertainment which rendered the french stage a model for scenery to the neighboring nations which has been the source from whence our opera has been supplied with dancers and which first conquered sense in favor of sound and afterward sound in favor of agility by quoting the words of voltaire  it is to two cardinals says he that tragedy and opera owe their existence in france corneille served an apprenticeship under richelieu with other authors who worked as amanuensises at those dramatic plans which were invented by the cardinal and in which he introduced some very bad lines cardinal mazarine was the first who introduced operas which was a bungling business however a circumstance the more extraordinary as that minister did not write any part of them  in      arrived from italy a troop of italian singers decorators and an orchestra they performed in the louvre the tragicomedy of orpheus in italian verse set to music the performance set all paris asleep very few understood italian fewer had a taste for music and every body hated the cardinal  the piece was hissed the cardinal ridiculed and the french grew outrageous against a man who had presumed to use an endeavor to please them  in the beginning however of the sixteenth century they had ballets in france and in these ballets some vocal music relieved by choruses which indeed were little more than the plain gregorian chant nay there are accounts of sirens who sung at the wedding of the duc de joyeuse so early as the year      but i am afraid they were strange sirens  cardinal mazarine was so little discouraged at the bad success of his italian opera that as soon as he came into full power he sent again for a troop from his own country who performed le nozze de peleo et de thetide in three acts and to make all sure louis xiv danced at this wedding the french were charmed to see their king young graceful and of a figure both noble and amiable after he had been hunted from the capital dancing in it as if nothing had happened  notwithstanding the cardinal and his italians pleased as little on repetition as at first mazarine still persisted he sent for signor cavalli who brought out in the gallery of the louvre the opera of xerxes in five acts but unfortunately the french went faster asleep than ever and all their consolation was that they should be relieved from the opera by the death of the cardinal who indeed drew on himself a thousand ridiculous sarcasms and gave place to almost as much satire after his death as had been levelled at him during his life  the french had some taste for opera but they were determined it should be their own language and performed by their own countrymen the last however was pretty difficult for there was but one passable violin in paris however in      a certain abbe perrin who took it into his head he could write poetry and one cambert leader of the queens twelve fiddlers which were called the music of france produced a tiresome pastoral which however stole the palm from lhercole and le nozze de peleo in      the same perrin and the same cambert associated themselves with the marquis de sourdeac a great mechanist not absolutely mad but very little short of it for he ruined himself in this enterprise  their first opera was pomona in which they introduced a great deal about apples and artichokes after this they represented the pains and pleasures of love and at length lully who now became superintendant of the kings music repaired the tenniscourt which had ruined the marquis de sourdeac the abbe perrin who did not choose to be ruined consoled himself with writing elegies and sonnets and translating the eneid of virgil in what he called heroic verse as for cambert he quitted france in dudgeon and went to perform his detestable music among the english who thought it excellent as purcell in      says that it was then time the english should begin to loath the levity of their neighbors this observation of voltaire might perhaps partially apply that it did not genenerally however such names as blow gibbon and others will bear me witness   lully in conjunction with quinault brought out the fetes de lamour et de bacchus but neither the words nor the music was worthy the reputation the piece acquired connoisseurs greatly admired however a translation of that charming ode of horace donec gratus eram tibi etc this ode is to say the truth finely rendered into french but the music is extremely dull there were bussooneries in plenty in these operas and indeed they were full of harlequinades and quinault to his shame did not disdain as a man of his genius ought to lend assistance to these puerilities though in those very operas  part of which were a reproach to him were many choice and beautiful passages  as for lully he knew pretty well how to accommodate his music to the french language and as he was a pleasant companion very debauched and an excellent flatterer and in consequence admired by the great he found no difficulty in carrying away all the applause from quinault who was a very contrary character being naturally modest diffident and unassuming he made the world believe that quinault was his amanuensis for that all the ideas were his and that quinault clothed them in better french than he could in fact that but for him this admirable poet would only have been known by the satires of boileau and thus quinault with all his merit became a prey to an illnatured satirist and an impudent musician  thus the beauties whether simple delicate or noble which were spread through attis and his other pieces which ought to have established the reputation of quinault procured no credit to any person but lully who was considered as another apollo the instances of arrogance in lully in this way are incredible when quinault had written some scenes of the opera of phaeton he submitted them to the academy who passed their judgment and acquiesed in the propriety of the alterations which were afterward made lully however chose to correct the piece a little more from which critique he insisted there should be no appeal though he altered more than half of it  query then whether the harlequinades that mr voltaire complains of were not attributable to lully  when thomas corneille wrote bellerophon lully teized him to death he had twenty times an intention of giving up the work and at last did not accomplish it till he had written out of complaisance to this presuming musician more than two thousand lines unnecessarily     we have here from voltaire a pretty lively picture generally taken of the opera which i shall take leave of for the present to release corneille from the ungracious situation in which we left him and see what became of thalia and melpomene  the extraordinary success of andromede so little to the taste or the reputation of its author gave an entirely new complexion to tragedy and it seemed no longer to rely on its intrinsic merits simplicity beauty strength in the style art management and conduct in the situations and nature force and interest in the incidents had nothing to do with the matter the machines were the object and the play was only a vehicle to introduce them  what then must become of corneille who could neither paint flying dragons nor mount a pasteboard mermaid upon the back of a leathern dolphin he seemed so astonishing with his prance in the air that when he came upon the ground he forgot how it was to walk naturally  it is wonderful how men of the first abilities will conform to bad taste at that moment alone independent adored by the public and his reputation at its summit if corneille had met this innovation half way if he had acknowledged that scenery in france had been defective that it was a grand a sober a decorous appendage to tragedy giving assistance to the action of the piece and therefore proper to be encouraged but that nevertheless he should resist with all his influence the introduction of machines and other mechanical operations which though ingenious in themselves disgraced tragedy and lowered it to the level of pantomime he would not only have kept his own same up to its legitimate standard but all other writers who seeing corneille misled were glad enough to have recourse to this new vehicle to same to bolster up their own rickety reputation would have remained at their posts by this means tragedy would have kept within the pale of its own province  as it was did corneille do this no if the mountain had refused to go to mahomet mahomet would have been glad enough as formerly to have gone to the mountain but this was not the case corneille immovable had he chose to have remained so fluctuated trimmed and accommodated himself to the caprice of the times  andromede was followed up in      by a heroic comedy called don sanche darragon which by the usual assistance of machines had some eclat but was soon withdrawn and performed only in the provincial towns this piece was not in the style of corneille being taken from two spanish plays which had been first romances and it would have been better for his reputation if it had never been produced  corneille himself attributes the want of success in this piece to its having been prohibited why he does not tell us his excuses however are but lame for he confesses that by his taking his piece from the spanish stories he was entangled in the last act that he was obliged to bring a man from the clouds to make the necessary discovery for the catastrophe the fact is corneille giving into the new taste turned projector the piece is properly neither tragedy nor comedy and therefore heterogeneous and unworthy corneille  nicomede which came out in      was another experiment corneille seems at this time to have grown tired he owns that this piece is upon an extraordinary construction but says he it is my twentyfirst production after having written forty thousand verses it was not very easy to find any thing new without going out of the high road of nature to search for such ideas as are excited by extraordinary objects this declaration might have served boisrobert or richelieu but corneille should have disdained it  tenderness and the passions continues he which are the soul of every tragedy has nothing to do with this upon what then could he ground his success grandeur and courage only are to be found here such grandeur and such courage as have no other support than that love of virtue which is imprinted in the heart of nations without tenderness strange doctrine  this piece but for some applications to a popular event which parts of it contained would have had but indifferent success corneille however was at all times so idolized by the people that some time after when baron who was considered as the french roscius and almost permitted to do any thing attempted to alter some passages in a way as he thought more to the public taste the house as with one voice insisted that the diction of corneille should not be violated and obliged him to repeat his part exactly as it had been originally written  pertharite his next piece produced in      was literally damned and corneille immediately retired from the theater with a declaration that he would never return to it this resolution he kept six years which time i shall take to speak of moliere who brought out his first play in the very year when corneille had declared he had brought out his last  chap xi moliere and the stage to corneilles return jean baptiste poquelin so celebrated under the name of moliere was born at paris in    0 he brought out his first piece in      and died in      shakespeare and moliere died at the same age  birth which in no instance that ever was read of either conferred or precluded talents was not among the advantages moliere had to boast both his grandfather and his father were valets des chambres and tapestrymakers to louis the thirteenth and his fate would have been to cut up tapes and bindings and hang parlours and bedchambers had not his genius induced him to consider these only as secondary objects and such as might humbly serve to decorate those better representations of nature with which she had given him the talent of ornamenting his country  moliere for the first fourteen years followed the business of his father and a patent was even taken out for him as successor to his fathers charge but he would neither yield to this nor would those friends many of whom was celebrated characters about the court who witnessed the growing merit of this youth consent to his remaining uninstructed in those studies by means of which they were satisfied he would arrive to some extraordinary reputation in either literature or the sciences  he was in consequence sent to a college at clermont where he got intimate with chapelle bernier and cyrano cyrano born the same year with moliere was a most extraordinary character he was of a generous spirit and as courageous as a lion he was a cadet in the regiment of guards and became the terror of all the bravoes of his time there is a story of his attacking a large party of desperadoes who had waylaid one of his friends and either killing or wounding seven of them for his coolness and valor in the field he was called lintrepide he had been frequently wounded and at last he died at the age of thirtyfive of a wound in the head which he had received from a pistol ball fifteen months before he caught a taste for writing from moliere and his pedant joue which has been imitated on our theater is by no means destitute of merit  who were all pupils of the famous gassendi from whom the young poquelin imbibed with great avidity those precepts of philosophy which taught him afterward so well to reason and which served as the foundation of that reputation which guided him through the greatest part of his works  a taste for dramatic entertainments having pervaded all france in consequence of richelieus patronage of the stage many societies in the nature of our private theatricals a little upon the principal of the old title of les enfans sans souci united in domestic parties to perform plays poquelin made one in a society of this description which was called the illustrious theater  here he changed his real name for that of moliere which circumstance of changing names was extremely common in france among the poets and actors but in moliere is said actually to have arisen from a fear of contaminating the race of valets des chambres and tapestrymakers who thought it a greater honor to remain blockheads and receive christian burial than to amuse and enlighten mankind and be rewarded with a sentence of excommunication this distinction has been the parent of numberless pleasantries some of which i shall from time to time set down at present the only one that occurs to me is this a french actor having amassed a sum of money he bought an estate which they call jeigneuriale and we call a manor the first sunday he went to church it being the curates duty to offer up prayers for this new seigneur he was extremely embarrassed in what manner to pray for a person excommunicated by the church there was no help for it however and being driven into a corner my dear brethren said he let us pray for the conversion of such a one sinner comedian and lord of this parish   in this society moliere became acquainted with a woman of the name of le bejart who had been a country performer and as he found her sentiments of the same cast as his own he agreed that they should form a company and go to lions where letourdi was first performed this was in      and its success was so prodigious that it fairly ruined the other company of comedians established in that town many of whom begged leave to join moliere who with his company thus strengthened went to languedoc and offered his services to the prince of conti who then held his court at beziers the prince of conti who held moliere in real estimation entreated him to remain with him in quality of secretary but happily for the french theater though he had the highest sense of the honor offered him he preferred following the impulse of his own genius   this prince had known moliere at college and had not only been present when he performed at paris but had very often invited him to his palace letourdi with the protection of this prince experienced at beziers new success he brought out also some farces one of which was called le docteur amoreux and another les trois docteurs which being trifles he very properly afterward suppressed  having traveled with his company to grenoble he went first to rouen and afterward to paris where he determined if possible to fix by his connections he got access to monsieur who presented him to the king and the queen mother they saw him and his company perform and granted him permission to exhibit in the guards of the old louvre and afterward in the palais royal at length his company was retained in the service of the king in      and this was the commencement of a real taste for comedy in france  le depit amoureux which had been performed at beziers in an imperfect state was brought out at paris in      with great success but les precieuses ridicules was the first comedy that permanently fixed the reputation of moliere at the finish of the first nights representation of this piece a crony of his took our old acquaintance chapelain by the hand you and i said he approved all those subtle criticisms which abounded formerly in compliment to our old friend the cardinal but believe me we have been taught to night so much real taste that we ought to burn all we have admired and to admire all we have burnt  the success of this piece fairly showed moliere upon what ground he stood i will no longer be reproached said he with copying plautus and terence and studying menander in future i have nothing to do but study the world  the precieuses ridicules was performed at court though the royal family were at that time on a journey to the pyrenees on their return the price to molieres theater was doubled admission to the parterre before that time had been only six sols  i shall now speak of quinault who for a considerable time was not allowed that share of merit he certainly possessed nay to this moment such is the force of prejudice that his name in the general idea of french literature is seldom classed respectably though there can be no doubt but that upon the whole he was the best lyric poet france ever knew when i say this i mean a writer of poetry proper for music which i take to be the true unadulterated sense of the word lyric for taken to that extant which it often usurps it is capable of any thing but harmony and i could name lyric odes that if a composer were inspired with the genius of apollo he would yet be incapable of setting them to music  a specious of merit surely that stands very high in the gradation of literary fame  we have seen already that voltaire considered quinault as a man of abilities this opinion many other french writers have unequivocally confirmed but a better proof a perusal of his works will establish for him that reputation which has been so often denied him for in those works among a great deal of trash written to humor lully is to be found great and striking poetical beauties such as boileau with all his bitterness and invective against a man who had never offended him had neither the soul nor the capacity to write  quinault however in great measure deserved every syllable that has been said against him his permitting an arrogant impudent musician to appropriate to himself quietly and comfortably that genius and those talents which were legitimately in the poet and not in him was as unpardonable as it is inconceivable but it should seem that if lully laughed at quinault quinault laughed at lully for pardoning every advantage the musician took on the side of reputation the poet had his revenge on the side of profit or rather prudence for while lully dissipated his emoluments quinault took care of his affairs he married the widow of a merchant who had been his kind friend with a fortune of forty thousand crowns he bought a considerable charge in the auditory of accounts he was admitted into the french academy he was honored with the cordon de st michel and died in paris in      at the age of fifty three with a fortune of more than a hundred thousand crowns  as quinault employed his talents more for the opera than the theater we shall have but little to say of him at present his tragedies except lastrate and lagrippa have disappeared from the theater and even those are weakly written his heroes are no more than gallants and his subjects are no higher than pastoral and romance his comedies are superior to his tragedies and his mere coquette and one or two others give good expectation that if he had pursued this style of writing he would not have cut an inconsiderable figure even by the side of moliere  quinaults first piece for the regular theater was a tragicomedy called les rivales it came out in      and caused a considerable change in the mode of recompencing dramatic authors for their labors it had been the custom to buy performances of authors for such prices as should be agreed upon which was sometimes regulated according to the merit but oftener according to the reputation of the writer for the merit and the reputation are now and then distinct things in general however these productions were sold low enough the actors at that time having had the same hold of the authors in france as the booksellers have now in england  this comedy of les rivales which was little more than a copy from rotrou tristan of whom quinault was the eleve undertook to read to the acors under an idea that he could make a better bargain for his pupil than his pupil could have done for himself the actors charmed with the piece and upon a supposition that it was written by tristan offered a hundred crowns for it being undeceived however they told tristan that though quinault appeared to have talents yet as he had no established reputation they could not risk that sum for the piece but would at all adventures give fifty crowns tristan would not suffer quinault to accede to this and the matter was compounded by an agreement to give the author a ninth of every nights receipt during the run of the play provided that afterward it should belong exclusively to the actors  these terms were accepted and the proposal appeared so fair and judicious both on the part of authors and actors that it has been strictly observed ever since afterpieces by way of proportion bearing only the value those in two acts of a twelfth and those in one of an eighteenth  quinault after producing three plays with passable success brought out in      a piece called les coups de lamour and de fortune but scarron tells us that this play is not at all attributable to quinault for that tristan wrote the first four acts and that he himself wrote the fifth after tristan died  scarrons pieces from      to      were don japhet darmenie lecolier de salamanque and two others the first he introduced by the following burlesque dedication to the king to the king sire any other belesprit but myself would have began with telling your majesty that you are the greatest king upon earth that you were more knowing in the art of reigning at fourteen years old than the oldest greybeard that you are the best made among men much less among kings and in short that you have nothing to do but to stretch out your arms and touch the top of mount lebanon and as much farther as you please all this is very handsome and virtually true but i shall say nothing of it here i shall only say that since your power is so great i entreat you to use it to do me a little good for if you were to do me a little good i should be much merrier if i were much merrier i should write merrier comedies if i were to write merrier comedies you would be more diverted and if you were more diverted your bounty would not be thrown away all this seems so reasonable that i am persuaded i should think the conclusion fair even were i as great a king as your majesty instead of a poor miserable devil as i really am but nevertheless  your majestys very obedient and very faithful subject and servant scarron    lecolier de salamanque which came out in      gave rise to a most bitter quarrel between scarron and boisrobert scarron had a custom of reading his works to his acquaintance one of whom was boisrobert who was so struck with the circumstances of this play as he heard it piece meal that he did not scruple to build his genereux ennemis upon this foundation which indeed was not all for t corneille worked the genereuse ennemis into the illustres ennemis and both these copies of scarrons play came out before the play itself so that it had to encounter all the disadvantage of the first and second impression of it but it did not stop here for boisrobert did his utmost to decry the merit of lecolier de salamanque and abused scarron for stealing it from him whereas he knew the contrary to have been the fact  this treatment scarron never pardoned and being a much better writer than boisrobert he threw out his invectives against him in a strain of such severe and bitter satire that boisrobert felt their effects as long as he lived  t corneille during his brothers absence acquired some celebrity from my last accounts of him to      he produced eight pieces the first three had merely passable success and the fourth called les illustres ennemis was even less attended to on account of its being borrowed as i have already said from boisrobert who stole it from scarron his fame from thence however began to rise and indeed to wear so new an aspect that he no longer seemed to be the same writer this has been charitably accounted for under an idea that his brother having retired from the theater lent him assistance it is certainly very possible that upon occasion he might have consulted his brother and his brother him for it is remarkable that no two brothers ever lived in closer union nor had so many natural and fortuitous ties to bind this compact of affectionate alliance they lived under the same roof they married two sisters whose ages had the same disproportion as their own each had exactly the same number of children as the other and every thing relative to their fortunes was so in common between them that they lived in this style more than twenty years before they came to any settlement as to how their different affairs were situated which would not probably even then have taken place had not prudence dictated what proportion ought honorably to be assigned to each that their familes might know what they had to depend upon in case of death or any casual alteration in the establishment of their chldren all this is so remarkable that it is impossible but they must have consulted each other in their writings but yet it should seem that it was merely as to opinion and nothing else for never was there so marked a difference between two writers the great corneille had too splendid a genius servily to buckle to regularity and his brother had little more than that measured regularity which never yet boasted the splendor of genius   the tide of t corneilles reputation took a a most extraordinary turn in      when he produced au marais timocrate which piece though its merit is indisputable was so eagerly followed and so suddenly dropped that the circumstance will ever remain a monument of french capriciousness this tragedy was performed eighty times in regular succession without the intervention of a single performance for the last twelve or fourteen nights the actors attempted to announce other plays the audience would not hear a single syllable timocrate was called for and timocrate they were obiged to perform at last an actor came forward and said ladies and gentlemen if you are not tired of seeing timocate we are really tired of performing it we run the risque of forgetting all our other pieces and the stage will sustain the greatest injury permit us to represent something else this permission was granted and timocrate was never afterward performed at that theater the capriciousness of the actors was at least upon a par with that of the audience if timocrate filled the theater  was not only a present advantage but an advantage ultimately in favor of  pieces when they came to take eir turn i should lke to  timocrate upon the english stage for two reasons if an english audience permitted a piece to run eghty nights it would be a proof of its merit and they are too fond of fostering merit to consign it so suddenly to oblivion after having taken it so warmly under their protection   nay the circumstance is stronger yet when this piece was in this extraordinary manner laid by at the theater au marais the company of the hotel de bourgogne by infinite degrees the best performers took it up but there seems to have been facination in the stupid and impolic speech of the actor just mentioned for after two or three ineffectual attempts to attract the audience they totally withdrew it  nevertheless timocrate is well spoken of t corneilles friends advised him to stop there for that his reputation was ratified the king went to the theater on purpose to see it and spoke of it in the highest terms and people in general began to declare that the retirement of the great corneille was no longer a loss to the theater by what i can learn it was a cold regular piece and owed half its success to the idea that the great corneille was concerned in it for so little did his friends continue in opinion that it was his best production that it is not among his works now printed and i am told that it was lost to the world soon after it was lost to the theater  t corneilles next piece berenice a tragedy was brought out in      he brought out commode in      and darius in      commode was the greatest favorite of these three but they all received a reputable degree of applause the theater however seemed at this time to want a counter balance in tragedy to the strides that moliere was taking in comedy and every interest was made and at last effectually to prevail on the great corneille to resume his situation as supreme director in the empire of melpomene  chap xii from corneilles return to      after pertharite corneille as we have seen retired from the stage and as every material trait in the character of so great a man is of consequence to the public i hope it will not be considered as extraneous if we see how he employed his time  having been all his life a devout christian and particularly intimate with some jesuits which body were ever remarkable for profound erudition and classical taste he undertook at their particular instance to translate a celebrated work called the imitation of jesus christ which he is allowed to have rendered very finely it had prodigious success and made him ample amends in point of profit for the loss he had sustained by quitting the theater but the best judges agree that it was not a work properly in his style and the nature the simplicity and the truth of the original was lost in that pomp and grandeur that every where pervaded the great mind of corneille  fontenelle says in the true style of a writer properly skilled in literary beauty this book though for grandeur and force the finest that ever came from the hand of man has so little of the evangelist that it cannot like that penetrate immediately to the heart nor seize the mind with that force so natural and tender which sometimes is greatly assisted by a negligence of style that this is a truth every susceptible mind must bear me witness yet if it be a truth what becomes of virgil and so many others who have built reputations adamantine reputations upon almighty style may i be so fortunate before i quit this work to rescue a little the cause of genius from these barbarous fetters and to contribute a little assistance a very little i fear to the separation of nature and truth from plausibility and sophistry  i hardly know if fontenelle complimented most himself by the candor or corneille by the truth of this observation  it is not known whether it was by the persuasion of his friends or through the bent of his own propensities which after all must have inclined him toward the stage that corneille was induced once more to take up the pen as a theatrical writer both these considerations might probably have had some weight of which it is not impossible but molieres rapid progress toward dramatic fame in some degree accelerated the preponderance  it is certain however that fouquet superintendant of the finances applied very warmly to corneille upon this occasion and that his application was backed by others in power nay when the poet complained that he should find himself awkward in an employ to which he had been sometime unaccustomed and remarked that he had not even thought of a subject the financier fertile in expedients proposed three subjects the first of which he agreed to treat the second he recommended to his brother and we have no account of what the third was or whether it was adopted or not  oedipe which had prodigious success completely reconciled corneille to the theater and the public la toison dor was performed in    0 and here i am obliged already to remark that corneille could not with all his merit resist that furor for machinery and decoration which then raged in france for on the contrary he allied himself with the very marquis de sourdeac of whom we have heard voltaire speak with such contempt  the toison dor was performed originally at the chateau de neubourg in normandy at the seat of the marquis de sourdeac in honor of the marriage of louis the fourteenth and the peace with spain this nobleman besides the persons necessary to execute the different departments of this spectacle entertained five hundred gentlemen of that province for two months at his own expense during which time the toison dor was represented every day  in sertorius performed in      corneille appeared more himself it was greatly admired and deservedly it displays a magnificent portrait of roman grandeur in which the sentiments the manners the very minds of those ferocious heroes are depicted in a style peculiarly vernacular but indeed in treating roman subjects corneille is every where at home marshal turenne is said to have exclaimed at the representation of this piece where could corneille have learnt so perfectly the art of war  boileau however never contented will have it that the scene between pompey and sertorius which fontenelle who by the by was a better writer and a more sensible man thinks one of the finest in the french language did not deserve to have been so much applauded it is full of spirit says he i grant but it has neither reason nor nature to support it for who to sertorius an old and experienced captain would compare pompey who is hardly man enough to have a beard i should not have noticed this silly remark of desprfaux were it not that i am happy at all times to expose envious cavil and ignorant ill nature minds are of all ages and there are as innumerable instances of their being matured early in life as of sillyness and dotage in old men and if this be true these are the circumstances which ought to be introduced on the stage being in nature and yet peculiar if the remark of this snarling satirest be admitted what becomes of the glory of alexander charles the twelfth of sweden and all those heroes who achieved wonders and yet died before they attained the prime of life but this will ever be the way with those who cavil at what they cannot imitate it is difficult to admire real merit in an author while you are obliged to despise the man but in boileau and i dont despair of proving it you must despise both the man and the writer and nothing can more fully prove that he was neither born a poet nor a philanthropist than his art of poetry the servile echo of an echo where the only truth to be found is his pretended modest declaration which he would not have made had he expected it to have been believed that the poem has no other merit than being decked in the spoils of horace   sophonisba was the next tragedy produced by corneille it came out in      this subject had been treated frequently on the french theater and there can be no doubt but the original model was a tragedy under the same title written in italian by the prelate trissino so early as      afterward imitated by marmet monchretien de montreux and mairet or as has been already explained viaud theophile which last piece kept the stage with celebrity  on this account corneille has been blamed for bringing out a tragedy on the same subject and indeed envy at the success of mairet has been kindly considered as his motive but not only the known character of corneille contradicts this invidious report it is completely refuted by his own declaration in which he pays a compliment to his predecessor more flattering to his reputation than the play was capable of procuring him and which he ought to have been very proud of even vanquished as he was by his more able competitor  but let us look after moliere it should be known that moliere occupied with his company a third theater au petit bourbon with the permission of the king where he performed alternately with the italians of whom i shall at a proper time give the history this theater was afterward pulled down to build the grand entrance to the louvre and the king then took him into the palais royal first called his company la troop de monsieur and afterward la troop du roi  la cocu imaginaire came out in    0 this little piece is taken from an italian comedy callled it cornuto per opinione it was performed forty times in succession though in summer and during the absence of the court a tradesman in paris took it into his head that moliere meant in this piece a personal affront to him how dare the fellow said he one day to an actor ridicule a man like me on the stage come come said the actor you have no reason to complain he has painted a flattering likeness by only making you a cuckold in imagination i would not have you to make too much stir about it for fear he should make you a cuckold in reality   don garcia de navarre was produced in      moliere performed the part of don garcia and finding that serious acting was by no means his forte had the good sense to make a resolution not to perform any but comic parts from that time this piece which was a heroic comedy though chastely written did not succeed and the reputation of moliere through the industry of his enemies of whom he had at all times undeservedly a plentiful number suffered for a time from this disgrace a short time however for the success of his next piece amply consoled him for the mortification he had sustained by the fall of this  lecole des maris made its appearance in      it was the first piece that moliere brought out at the theater du palais royal and the first that he printed in quality of chief of the company of monsieur he therefore dedicated it to that prince  this comedy which served as a model for english and other authors is taken from a tale by bocace which every body knows the only difference in the two plots is that in bocace a woman in love with a young man makes her confessor the gobetween who carries letters and presents under an idea that he serves the purposes of devotion and in moliere an old man is substituted for the confessor who is duped in the same manner by a girl he is in love with and to whom he is the tutor  lecole des femmes molieres next comedy was performed for the first time in      so divided began to be the french at this time as to moliere that under the idea probably of his commencing aristophanes and issuing personalities from the stage whereas he in fact personated men only by personating manners he sustained all sorts of affronts the public were extremely divided as to the merit of this play it gained ground however and brought a great deal of money these cabals induced moliere in the following year to write a piece which he called lcritique de lecole des femmes  this piece was the first of the kind that ever appeared on the french theater it is rather a dialogue than a comedy moliere however is to be commended for having written it for he very happily while he points out the faults of his play turns its enemies into ridicule the mercure galant conducted by a man of the name of vise who was constantly sticking in molieres skirts has the kindness thus to criticize this piece by anticipation  we are to see in a short time a piece entitled la critique de lecole des femmes where the author soi disant is to enumerate all the faults in his piece and to excuse them at the same time curious that a man should take so much pains to defend a piece which is not his own but written by the abbe du buisson who is one of the most gallant men of the age but moliere has the audicity to deny this he says that the abbe certainly did write a piece on this subject and bring it to him and that he could not help allowing it considerable merit though he had his reasons for not performing it what does all this say that this cunning comedian whose best merit is to know how to take advantage discerned in the abbes piece something that could please the public and so palmed it upon them as his own  the abbe might have written a piece upon this subject but it was perfectly unnecessary that moliere should copy that piece for he had only to go to the same source where the abbe derived his materials which was a book entitled le nuits facetieuses du seigneur straparole which is a history of a man who communicates to his friend all that passes between him and his mistress not knowing that his friend is his rival  but it now became pitiable to see pieces on the theaters in the shape of disjointed critiques and really it is to be regretted that moliere in imitation of the sun when the flies wanted to put him out did not shine on instead of condescending to notice the swarm of tiny critics that surrounded him as it was the cabal against him though it did not injure him gave him great inconvenience and more than one critique which would have died away forgotten became noticeable to the public by his pointing it out  boursault a writer of real merit and who was now coming forward took occasion to render himself popular by bringing out at the hotel de bourgogne a piece called le portrait du peintre which was not only a critique of lecole des femmes but produced at the same time and contained as far as he could learn or imagine the same matter of molieres piece under that title this the reader sees was no difficult matter for nothing could be easier than to select the known and acknowledged faults of lecole des femmes and excuse them exactly the way that its author would do this was what struck boursault who succeeded so well in his design that at last it was sad in addition to molieres having stolen his ecole des femmes from labbe du buisson he stole his critique of lecole des femmes from boursault   moliere now began really to be piqued and he brought out in the same year his inpromptu de versailles levelled directly at boursault whom he treated with the greatest contempt and derision reserving to himself however a degree of nobleness for this contempt and this derision went no further than the genius and talents of boursault whereas boursault has descended in his strictures on moliere to attack his private character  this piece also is a most severe and successful satire on the performers at the hotel de bourgogne whom moliere considers as having instigated boursault to ridicule him and indeed though no one could commend this spirit of party between two bodies whose business was only to entertain the public yet moliere received and deserved great praise for the able manner in which he conducted this controversy for in answer to their pityful invectives which he scorned to imitate he contented himself with pointing out their faults as performers particularly the sleepy monotony of their declamation which he did with such judgment that the ridicule which followed this discovery drove them into a corner and they were obliged to correct their faults or be laughed at and thus moliere in resenting a private injury did a public benefit  boursault whom i shall now introduce was one of those extraordinary proofs that show us how infinitely genius ranks before education he was born at bourgogne in      and died in paris in   0  we find him at the age of twentythree bringing out successful comedies and two years afterward entering into a controversy with a man of molieres wonderful talents though he could speak nothing but a provincial jargan called patois no more like french than erse or irish is to english at thirteen and had then first to learn to write and afterward to choose what language he should write in  it was not long however after he came to paris which was in      before he taught himself to write and speak french elegantly and what may appear very extraordinary without knowing a word of greek or latin his style was fraught with the native purity of the ancients but i cannot find any thing irreconcilable in this nature taught them nature taught him neither they nor he had been tainted with the foppery of the schools  his conception was so strong his ideas were so true and his fancy was so pliant that he had nothing to do but to think and write his happy genius accommodated itself to every style his tragedies manifest a firm mind and a strength of conception equal to a description of the noblest passions his comedies contain lively pictures of men and manners suitable so all ranks all ages and all times he is serious comic moral and lively without violating the rules of taste  it must now be recollected that i am speaking of his best and latest productions in his early ones there is certainly and it would be wonderful if there were not a great deal of trash but there are traits of genius every where and he arrived at last to a taste so pure and a style so chaste that he was correct without affectation to use the words of various french writers and ought to be considered as the literary lawgiver to the language of that nation  there is something so peculiar in a character of this description that i cannot help dwelling on boursault a little longer his fame soon reached the court and having at the express desire of louis the fourteenth written a book called la veritable etude des soverains by the way a bold undertaking the king was so charmed with it that he appointed him preceptor of monseigneur but he could not ratify the appointment because boursault knew nothing of latin an indispensible qualification for that post  the duchess of angouleme made boursault her secretary and engaged him to write a weekly gazette in verse louis and his court were greatly entertained with this work but boursault having aimed some satiric tracts against the franciscans in general and the capucins in particular the queens confessor used such powerful interest that the gazette was suppressed and the authors pension of two thousand livres taken away and had not very high friends interfered this poetical newsmonger would have gone to the bastile  all the time boursault had this controversy with moliere in which there is certainly a great deal of the vivacity and folly of a young man he had besides his portrait du peintre brought out three pieces all which succeeded they had however glaring faults but gave wonderful promise of something better  chap xiii further success and death of moliere as molieres career for the next ten years at the end of which he died makes up a very brilliant interval in the french dramatics i shall follow it unmixed with any other circumstances but such as result from it in order to do every justice to a man of such uncommon merit  la princess delide was performed in      and made up a part of those superb entertainments which louis the fourteenth in compliment to his mother and his own queen gave under the title of des plaisirs lisle enchantee these fetes which continued seven days and were conducted with great magnificence and taste united all that could be got together of the true and the mavelous in short a kind of entremets regulated and disposed so as not to outrage the understanding the italian vigarani an ingenious mechanist furnished the decorations the celebrated lully composed the music the president de perigny wrote the complimentary odes benserade produced a variety of light and lively eulogiums and moliere introduced this comedy all which with the assistance of various appropriate devices and well timed applications contributed to render this fete very celebrated  the king gave moliere but a very short time to prepare his comedy he borrowed the fable from augustine moreta and was so pressed that he could only put the first act and part of the second into verse  le marriage force was performed in      this piece originally came out at the louvre accompanied by a ballet under the same title in which louis the fourteenth danced the famous count de grammont furnished moliere with the idea of the marriage force this nobleman while he resided in london fell in love with a young lady of the name of hamilton their amors even made some noise when on a sudden he set out for france without taking leave of the family the brother of the young lady who now began to look upon the affair as a little equivocal followed the count to dover with a determination to call him to account he encountered him before he had opportunity to embark and asked in a tone which sufficiently gave him to understand what he was at whether he had not forgot something at london the count who perhaps was ashamed of himself and glad of an opportunity to atone for his conduct answered with perfect good humor you are certainly in the right i really forgot to marry your sister but to convince you how glad i am that you put me in mind of it i will return with you and offer her my hand   le festin de pierre made its appearance as written by moliere in      this strange subject has been so often treated and in so many languages and shapes that it is unnecessary to say much about it it was first brought out on the italian stage afterward on the spanish then on the french by at least five authors moliere and t corneille two of them and at last the english whose good sense would have revolted at witnessing a representation of it in dialogue have contented themselves with seeing this abominable subject danced throughout the kingdom from the opera to all the puppet shows moliere has nevertheless thrown great strength and beauty into this horrid piece on purpose one should imagine to show that the worst subject may be treated well by a good master of his art  lamour medecin came out in      moliere all his life had been an enemy to all the tribe of galen his motives have been variously attributed but it is most probable that they originated from his inveterate hatred to every species of hypocricy he defines a physician to be a man who chatters nonsense in the bedchambers of the sick either till nature has cured or physic killed the patient to give this piece all the effect he could moliere had masks which were likenesses of all the court physicians and those he wore as he represented different medical characters  the names also pointed out who were meant desfonandres which signifies mankiller was meant for de fougerais who always prescribed violent medicines bahis which signifies to yelp was designed for m esprit who stuttered macraton was pointed at guenaut because he spoke remarkably slow and tomes which means a bleeder was levelled at daquin who upon all occasions ordered phlebotomy  le misanthrope in five acts and in verse was performed for the first time in      this piece failed at its first representation but moliere withdrew it and brought it forward again in a month preceded by the fagotier or medecin malgre lui which had such success that it was performed three months in succession but always with the misanthrope the farce saved the comedy  this play however soon made its way by its own proper merit it has not only been considered as the best of molieres productions but the best comedy ever written but enthusiastic praise is in general an injury to authors molieres enemies who could not bear this warmth in his adherents set themselves to work every way to lower his piece in the opinion of the public ridiculouy enough however and without success among other endeavors to injure moliere an effort was made to persuade the due de montause who was remarkable for the austerity of his manners that in the misanthrpe moliere had attempted to draw his character the duke your immediately and saw the piece and as he left the theater was heard to say that he should be happy indeed if it were true that he resembled the misanthrope of moliere   melicerte a heroic pastoral made its appearance in      moliere wrote only the first and second acts of this piece and in that unfinished state it was performed at st germain it was afterward enlarged by guerin son to the actor of that name but neither then nor before was it considered as a dramatic production of much consequence  le tartuffe a comedy in five acts and in verse came out in      nothing perhaps ever made more noise than this comedy nor was ever theatrical representation more severely persecuted fops physicians misers fools and other general characters were even seen to laugh at themselves and kiss the very hand from which they received their castigation but hypocrites are a species of men more vindictive and more numerous consequently more severe and more powerful  the hypocrites took this comedy as a declaration of war against human nature for where is there to be found said they a body of men among whom hypocricy is not practiced in short this exposition was a crime not to be pardoned and the piece was beset with an industry and severity incredible it was artfully insinuated that it attacked religion that the tartuffe was an impious insult against god himself that it was abominable and that it ought to be burnt by the hands of the hangman  the three first acts of the tartuffe having been privately represented before the king on the twelfth of may      his majesty defended moliere against his persecutors and that this might have the better color he ordered that the piece should be examined by the most celebrated writers of the time whose determination in its favor he bespoke by saying that he himself sound nothing in it but what was perfectly harmless and indeed meritorious  the hypocrites finding moliere so greatly supported were indefatigable to procure a cabal against the tartuffe for they insisted after all that neither kings nor learned men but the public alone were to judge of dramatic representations  devotees were consulted who being generally weak men joined sincerely in a cause which they thought did honor to religion and virtue a poor infatuated curate undertook at all hazards to pronounce that it was a work full of profaneness and impiety and that in quality of priest he had a right to anathematize the author  the king on the other hand permitted the piece to be performed but in order to qualify the matter  for though he disapproved of his peoples folly he wished to conciliate their affection  he advised that it should be called limposteur and that the principal character should appear as one of the laiety it is certain that moliere who was always a spectator at the farce of the world took many traits of his tartuffe from real life the very name which signifies hypocrite or more properly false devout owed its rise to an accident moliere being in the palace of the popes nuncio during the time he worked at his piece which was then intended to be called the impostor he was walking in the cloisier with two ecclesiastics who were holding forth on the piety the forbearance and the abstemiousness of the nuncio during the intervals of conversations however some few hints concerning the bill of fare for the day gave moliere a strong idea that the representative of his holiness had some little regard for the good things of this world as well as the next at length he understood that one very high and expensive dish that was generally served up to dinner would that day lose much of its poignancy for want of some truffles of which they were disappointed just at this time came by a man with truffles to fell at this the commode ecclesiastics whose business was more to subscribe to the pleasures of the nuncio than to pray to heaven cried out tartufoli signor nuncio tartufoli from this moliere is said to have changed his title of limposteur to le tartuffe another circumstance was as fellows louis the fourteenth as he marched toward lorraine accepted an invitation of a certain bishop to his house the bishop represented that being fast day he could give his majesty but a very indifferent dinner one of the courtiers smiled at this the reason of which after the prelate had retired the king insisted upon his explaining the courtier said he could not avoid smiling to think that the prelate should call such a dinner as they were going to receive an indifferent one though indeed it was not so good as the good bishop often sat down to even when alone on this he rehearsed the particulars of the bill of fare at the mention of every luxury the king cried out each time in a different tone the poor man moliere who attended in quality as valet de chamber overheard this scene and so availed himself of the circumstance as to introduce the effect of it into the piece at which the king when he was informed of it at versailles laughed heartily   moliere read the tartuffe before its representation to madam ninon de lenclos who tasted its drift in a very sensible and competent manner she said that this species of hypocricy had been her particular study that nothing could be so meritorious as to detect it and enlarged upon the subject with so much judgment and experience that moliere declared she was more capable of treating it than he was one of the instances which ninon gave moliere of hypocricy is related by voltaire in her life he says  when m de gourville who was considered for twentyfour hours as the successor of the great colbert in      fled from france lest he should be hanged in person as he had been in effigy he left behind him two cassettes full of money one of these he confided to m ninon de lenclos the other to a devotee on his return he found the money left with ninon in good condition nay it had considerably increased by her management grateful to find he had been so well dealt by he insisted that ninon should accept at least the overplus as a gratuity for the trouble she had taken she told him very coolly that she had considered herself as a friend and not a usurer and pleasantly said if she heard any thing more about it she would throw both cassette and money out of the window the devotee chose another style of conduct he said that he had employed all the money in pious uses for that he had more regard for the soul of mr gourville than to suffer him to enjoy riches that had been acquired by means for which without repentance he must expect to be damned   though moliere founded his character of the tartuffe upon hypocrisy and bigotry in general yet it is universally allowed that the abbe roquotte bishop of autun sat for the portrait and that those particulars in his character of which moliere was ignorant were furnished by despreaux not immediately in communication to moliere but through a letter written however expressly for his information and addressed to monsieur guilleragnes  on the second representation of the tartuffe there came an order of parliament for its suppression the court for probably political reasons did not immediately interfere but however two years afterward the king gave a peremptory order that it should be performed which order was never after disputed  moliere was now flattered by his enemies the opposers of the tartuffe either pretended to espouse its interest or retired discomfited and in disgrace  while however the public clamor ran high it is inconceivable how loudly this comedy was reprobated the famous father bourdaloue preached against it and as such a circumstance has something uncommon in it i shall extract a passage from his sermon it was archly enough said to moliere  you would never have been censured by the priests if you had not taken it into your head to introduce sermons on the stage to which moliere answered for my part i see no more harm in sermons on the stage than in farces in the pulpit   as says he true and false devotion have great similitude in their outward appearance as the same raillery that attacks the one prima facie attacks the other as it is impossible to know the true from the counterfeit without an examination of the hearts of men as hypocricy cannot be censured without raising unjust suspicions against true piety all virtuous men ought to decry such a work what has this author done he has represented on the stage an imaginary hypocrite who by his actions turns the most holy things into ridicule who appears scrupulous on matters of no consequence but in affairs of importance is guilty of the most enormous crimes outwardly a penitent he is inwardly a profligate and under an appearance of the most austere piety he practices the most consummate villainy  who will point out in the world this particular man it is impossible and it cannot be applied but by an unworthy suspicion of religion in general and the principles of its possessors in particular this is cruel and immoral and no government ought to tolerate it    to the confusion however of those priests who wrote against the tartuffe many others countenanced it as a most valuable work which placed virtue in its right light and censured none but those who felt themselves pointed at as hypocrites and bigots  but nothing can prove so strongly the absurdity of this conduct as the toleration given at this time to other dramatic pieces which were really full of impiety in a piece called scaramouche hermit an anchoret dressed like a monk pays a visit to a married womans bedchamber by a ladder of ropes and like rangers up i go as he ascends repeats very ludicriously questo per mortificar le carne  during the suspension of the tartuffe this piece was one night performed in the presence of the king who on quitting his box said to the great conde i should be glad to know why those who think themselves so scandalized by molieres tartuffe should so quietly suffer nay even loudly applaud scaramouche hermit for the best reason in the world sire answered the prince scaramouch only laughs at religion which these holy gentlemen do not care a farthing about but the tartuffe laughs at themselves which they can never forgive  le sicilien was performed in      and written by moliere to retrieve that reputation which he fancied he had lost by joining with benserade and others as we have seen in the productions of such pieces as were merely written to assist machinery and decoration the sicilien is a charming trifle and was greatly received  amphitrion appeared in      this subject which had been frequently treated since plautus and by rotrou in particular with great judgment proved even in the hands of moliere of an unfavourable nature we have seen it on our stage and every body knows its indelicate tendency even in france it revolted the audience though every body admired the poetry madame dacier wrote a disertation to prove that the amphitrion of plautus was greatly superior to that of moliere but upon hearing that moliere intended to produce his femmes scavantes she thought proper to suppress it  george dandin was brought out in      first before the king at versailles with airs and music and afterward at paris merely as a comedy this piece which was irresistably laughable had considerable success moliere is said to have derived the principal part of his success on the production of this piece from ingratiating himself with the person ridiculed and making him the patron of his own exposition it is even said that thus managed the real george dandin made parties to support this comedy and thus got laughed at off the stage as much as his representative on it   lavare in five acts made its appearance also in      this celebrated comedy had very nearly been damned because it was written in prose the very reason which ought to have ensured its success for as no man wrote more naturally than moliere so his verse though admirable for french poetry took off all the spirit and warmth of the dialogue a fault attributable without exception to all the french writers of comedy in verse lavare however after a time became a great favorite and was variously translated for the purpose of exhibition in other countries  pourceaugnac in three acts was performed in      it was interspersed with dances and songs the music by lully i enumerate these pieces with all possible brevity except when some striking circumstances attended them because they have most of them been treated on the english stage and will therefore necessarily become objects of future animadversion   les amans magnifique in five acts in prose made its first appearance in    0 with singing and dancing the music by lully  benserade had attacked moliere on account of the jealousy that had taken place at the time of the fete at versailles in      this begat a quarrel which at different times broke out and subsided till at length moliere determined to take a pleasant revenge benserade was protected by a nobleman of the highest rank who had often scornfully insisted that moliere could not write such verses as benserade when therefore moliere brought out his amans magnifique he wrote one entire scene so much in the manner of benserade that his patron believing it absolutely to be his declared that moliere did well to court the assistance of a writer so superior to himself in the interim benserade conscious that he had no hand in it did not know how to act at last he brazened it out and received the compliments of all his patrons friends with as much satisfaction as if he had really been the author of the scene till moliere who watched for this opportunity declared publicly that benserade had neither written nor been concerned any way in the piece and thus held up both the poet and his patron to public ridicule  psyche a kind of tragicomedy in five acts interspersed with songs and dances was performed in    0  moliere wrote only the first act part of the second and part of the third of this piece the rest was written by the great corneille quinault and other friends the music was composed by lully it was written for the king and there was so little time allowed that moliere was obliged to call in the assistance of these allies  le bourgeois gentilhomme first appeared in    0 it had prodigious success and has always been considered as one of the most celebrated plays on the french theater at the first representation of this piece the king refused to give his opinion of it and all the courtiers taking his silence for an unwillingness to condemn the production of a man whom he protected and admired shrugged up their shoulders and among one another did not hesitate to speak of it with the most sovereign contempt this mortified moliere severely and when he found that baron to whom alone he discovered his chagrin had learned that the courtiers had so spread their illnatured sentiments that all paris were infected with them he gave his piece up for lost the king however signified a wish to be at the second representation of it and after it was over he told moliere that he had not ventured to declare his opinion on the first performance for fear he might have been seduced and have mistaken those passages which were so provokingly laughable for wit when they were only bombast but that he had attended that evening with great care and had found the piece so full of rich and warm traits of nature that he was prepared to pronounce it a most admirable comedy the courtiers hearing this came round moliere in crowds and for every injurious invective they had levelled at him before loaded him with a hundred compliments   les fourberies de scapin in three acts and in prose was brought out in      this piece is nothing more than one of those farces improved which moliere wrote in province under the title of gorgibus dans le sac the wits were very severe against moliere when this piece came out boileau who seems never to have been pleased in his life inserted in his art of poetry these lines dans se sac ridicule ou scapin senveloppe je ne reconnois plus lauteur du misanthrope this piece was taken partly from the phormio of terence and partly from one of the pieces of a farce writer called tabarin with which circumstance in another place boileau reproaches moliere in these words davoir a terence allie tabarin  he was also accused of having stolen two scenes from the pedant joue of cyrano but he answered to this that he originally lent these scenes to cyrano and that it was lawful for a man to take his own goods wherever he might find them the fact is by introducing prose he endeavored to introduce nature and therefore displeased a people who delighted in every thing artificial  les femmes scavantes a comedy in five acts and in verse was produced in      and very shortly became celebrated a combination of circumstances induced moliere to write this play he had been pestered with so many ignorant and vain strictures which were levelled at him entirely from malignant and envious motives that he resolved to revenge himself a propensity by the by that he oftener indulged than was either wise or prudent in this instance so complete an opportunity offered that he could not resist it at the hotel de rambouillet which was the rendezvous of all the beauxesprits moliere had a general invitation but finding about this time that the would be wits who found admittance there determined as much as possible to ridicule him he very sensibly withdrew himself this drew on him a thousand squibs particularly from menage labbe cotin and madame de rambouillet about this time cotin had a dispute with despreaux whom he loaded with the most injurious language and among other things said that he acknowledged neither god nor faith nor law unfortunately for him he lugged moliere into the dispute who resolved to give him no quarter he therefore put the finishing stroke to the femmes scavantes where he drew on cotin a ridicule and a contempt that stuck by him as long as he lived one circumstance in particular rendered him completely ridiculous moliere was determined to make cotin under his title in the piece of trissotin or three times sool produce a sonnet as ignorant and ludicrous as possible boileau hearing of this produced for moliere a sonnet actually written by cotin as a compliment to madame de nemours which was in every respect as contemptible as they could wish this being introduced and afterward made known as the real production of cotin it may very easily be conceived how it operated with the public   le comtesse descarbagnas a piece in one act was brought out in      and intended as a pleasant ridicule of provincial manners it revolted those who like cotin affected to have taste but the public in general admitted it as a fair and merited laugh against peculiarity and absurdity  le malade imaginaire the last production from the pen of moliere and generally allowed to be the most perfect appeared in february      its success which had been warm and universal was interrupted on hits third representation by a most fatal accident indeed nothing less than the death of the author moliere had been long afflicted with an asthmatic complaint which he increased by intense application to the duties of his situation about two months before the death of moliere among other friends who had repeatedly advised him to retire from the stage at least as an actor boileau was one day very pressing he represented to him that the continual exercise and agitation of his lungs in those exertions so violent which were necessary for the performance of arduous characters must naturally by increasing his complaint at length endanger his life moliere replied that he considered it as his duty to render vice hideous and that it redounded to his honor to castigate the manners the satyrist probably piqued that he had not succeeded cried out a pleasant duty to render vice hideous by blacking ones face with indian ink and to castigate the manners by turning ones back every now and then to receive twenty bastonadoes  he was more than usually incommoded on the day he died and his friends entreated him his wife and his friend baron in particular to take repose what said he with that philanthrophy which was the peculiar mark of his private character is to become of so many poor wretches who scarcely get bread by my means i should reproach myself were i to neglect them for a single day  he grew better about noon and prepared for the performance and by the time he appeared on the theater the concern of his friends was a good deal dissipated his efforts however to give effect to his part visibly augmented his complaint and when in the divertissement in the third act he pronounced the word juro he fell into a strong convulsion he was immediately carried home where in spite of every assistance and attention he grew worse till having fallen into a violent fit of coughing he irrupted a vessel and was instantly suffocated with blood  moliere being dead the actors were determined to bury him with unexampled magnificence harlai archbishop of paris would not however consent to his having christian burial the wife of moliere as soon as she heard this went to versailles and threw herself at the feet of the king and complained in the bitterest terms of the injury done to the memory of her husband who she said deserved an altar raised to him for that he had served the cause of morality more than a hundred bishops the king gently reproved her and told her that the matter depended entirely on the archbishop but promised to see what could be done which promise he so well kept that harlai the next day revoked his decree upon condition that the ceremony should be performed privately and without eclat  two priests were appointed to conduct the funeral but forbid to sing lest the matter should be made too public this injunction however had no effect for a prodigious concourse of friends with flambeaux attended moliere to the grave his wife at their head exclaiming as she went no wonder hypocrites should refuse the rights of sepulture to a man who was all his life a scourge to hypocrites immediately after molieres death paris was inundated with epitaphs among the rest a poet presented one to the great conde who always had loved and admired moliere having read a line or two of it take it away said he you write molieres epitaph i wish to god he was alive to write yours   exclusive of the pieces enumerated here moliere wrote at the time his company performed at provence several farces the matter of which however or at least a great part of it he took into his different comedies  the rank moliere held in literature has been long estimated and decided we have nothing to do but to compare his works with whatever we know of perfect and admirable in the ancients and we shall find him in every point of view rising greatly superior to them all he has all the pointed severity of aristophanes without his wickedness and his malignity he has to the beauty the fidelity the portraiture of menander added higher and more finished graces of his own he has the nerve and strength of plautus without his grossness and his obscenity and he has a thousand times more elegance from nature and genius assisted by philosophic observation than terence  nature and the absurdities of the age in which he lived supplied him with an inexhaustible source of materials comedy took a new form in his hands and became a scourge for the vices and follies of all ranks to the truth of which all were implicitly obliged to subscribe and there can be but little doubt if he could have written independantly and have been independantly attended but he would have carried comedy true comedy as correct as it can be defined to a higher degree of perfection than any author has done either before or since  moliere however was a reformer and reformers in any way dare not innovate all at once could he have done this he would have written no dialogue in verse he would have made his characters at once speak the language of nature but there are higher crimes to accuse him of pure morality would probably have been laughed at by a people full of intrigue and given up to every licentiousness on this account and i most sincerely believe on no other did moliere introduce his naive and natural humor his strong remarks and his sterling truths through mediums which neither his heart nor his understanding at all times approved  to make children ridicule their parents deride their observations laugh at their age and insult their infirmities are circumstances true comedy should reject with contempt to introduce adultery and endeavor by subtle devices and insinuating persuasion to imprint on young minds a love of vice is revolting to true comedy to recommend knavery by giving it a fashionable air and permitting it at last to triumph over simplicity and honesty has nothing to do with true comedy but says a french author moliere though truly honorable was an actor and a manager it was therefore necessary he should think of the receipt of the house and this receipt too often imposed silence on his veracity and of course diminished his real glory it was necessary to make the pit laugh oh that so great a genius should be sunk to so low a degree of humiliation  if however vice through moliere became at times winning and seducing he did not fail at other times to expose it to contempt and ridicule but whenever he did so it was sure to raise him up a host of enemies this in his dependent situation as we have seen gave him throughout his life a thousand vexations and induced him sometimes to conform to the age rather than revolt against it in short when he considered himself merely as a poet he fell into the errors of poets when as a philosopher he shone with all the truth of a moralist and the dignity of a man  for the rest as an actor he possessed a noble figure a marking and an expressive face and a clear and commanding voice through these he conveyed the utmost force of comic expression into his characters regulated by an understanding correct powerful and commanding as a manager he made it the study of his life to consider the interest of all those who were embarked with him in his undertaking according to their respective abilities he tempered authority with indulgence determination with affability and considered himself at the head of his company as the father of a family by whom he was beloved and revered  as a man he was an affectionate husband and a warm friend honest punctual and just he was admired by the great esteemed and valued by his equals and almost adored by his inferiors to whom as far as his abilities permitted he was a generous benefactor  chap xix racine and the stage to the death of corneille as racine ran the principal part of his career during the life of corneille it would be totally out of regularity to omit an account of that admirable poet and his works in this place especially as the new turn he gave to dramatic productions inclined in some measure his fluctuating countrymen to neglect his great competitor whose infinitely superior abilities had created what remained for racine to perfect  jean racine was born at fertemilon december      at what age he went to school historians are not agreed upon but one should suppose not very young for it is insisted that in less than a year he read sophocles and euripides with taste in their own language he is said to have manifested early in life an extraordinary genius for poetry and that his memory surpassed any thing that ever was heard of having met with the romance of theagenes and clariclea written by heliodorus his instructor claude lancelot threw it into the fire racine found means to get at a second copy which shared the same fate he then bought a third and having taken a short time to examine it took it to his master and told him that he might also burn that for he had now got it by heart   the poetic merit of racine appeared evidently in a variety of minor productions though his latin poetry injured his reputation thanks probably to those pedants who are the only judges of the beauty of a language no longer spoken at length in    0 the kings marriage set all the poets at work and upon this occasion racine produced a poem called la nymphe de la scine that bore away the palm from all its competitors racine from this time delivered himself up entirely to poetry except when out of complaisance to his uncle with whom he lived he dipped into theology neither that study however nor logic to which he had deeply attended could prevent him from giving way to his poetic propensity and becoming acquainted with moliere and afterward with boileau he determined to try his hand at the drama  thebaide racines first piece came out in      for which piece moliere is said to have furnished him with the materials this however cannot be true for when it appeared it was little more than a revision of lantigone of rotrou which racine had adjusted to the theater thinking he could not do better than rescue a good performance from obscurity afterward however he altered it considerably and with the assistance of his verse which was at all times correct and harmonious it became celebrated  alexandre appeared in      racine read this tragedy to corneille who told him very honestly for corneille was incapable of jealousy that he saw in it wonderful talents for poetry but not for tragedy racine brought out this piece at molieres theater it was damned he was afterward prevailed on to offer it to the hotel de bourgogne where with assistance of madmoiselle parc one of molieres best actresses who was enticed away from him upon this occasion it had good success this treachery begat a coldness between moliere and racine which lasted as long as they lived though it has always been allowed they upon all occasions did each other justice as authors  andromache came out in      this tragedy is remarkable for having occasioned two extraordinary circumstances mademoiselle champemele of whom racine had a very indifferent opinion so won him that he fell violently in love with her and montfleury in endeavoring to personate orestes in his madness which required the most strenuous exertions was taken so ill that he soon after died  les plaideurs a comedy in three acts and in verse made its appearance in      this is racines only attempt at comedy a domestic circumstance is said to have given rise to the story and the characters as we are told are all from real life this comedy had little success at first moliere however did it justice and said that those who railed at that comedy ought to be railed at themselves at length the king saw it and spoke favorably of it after which it did tolerably well  britannicus was performed in      this piece in spite of its merit failed on its eighth representation racine ushered it into the world with a preface in which he very imprudently treated corneille with severity he however became sensible of his error and afterward suppressed it  berenice came out in      the sister inlaw of louis the fourteenth induced racine to write a piece on the parting of titus and berenice that circumstance having a resemblance to the separation of her and her brother racine engaged too hastily to comply with this request and boileau told him that if he had been on the spot he should not have given his word the subject certainly was not a savourable one and though perhaps out of deserence to those whom it was intended to compliment it was pretty well followed yet it was parodied and quoted so ludicrously that racine always very irritable became truly sorry he had written it  bajazet was brought forward in      this tragedy had good success but there is scarcely an instance in all racine where character is not sacrificed to versification  mithridate made its appearance in      the pulcherie of corneille performed the year before which fell in spite of its authors great name lifted racine into considerable fame he brought out mithridate when this great man who had perfected every species of dramatic entertainment in france was ungratefully shunned and neglected he might have said with pompey do thou not see that all eyes are turned toward the rising sun  iphigene was performed in      racine and the new taste he had introduced here gained ground and so completely conquered corneille and nature that on the following year that great writer retired from the theater i shall therefore now take him up where i left him and employ the short remainder of this volume to speak of him and his works  othon appeared in      in which says fontenelle corneille has fairly placed tacitus on the french stage the marshal de grammont said that in othon corneille was the the breviary of kings boileau however who was at this time attached both to the writings and the person of racine was not contented with this tragedy because perhaps it had none of that tinsel with which he and others at that time corrupted the french taste  agesilas was performed in      this piece is said by some not to have been written by corneille but fontenelle contends that it was and points out a scene that he says could not have been written by any body else the controversies about it however prove that it came from no other pen despreaux the eternal puffer of racine attacked this piece as it was customary for him to do with every thing written by corneille he wrote this epigram to decry agesilas and attila apres lagesilas helas mais apres attila hola boileau expected that corneille would have been greatly mortified at this but he turned it to his advantage and the confusion of the satirist pretending it was meant as a compliment the literal words mean after agesilas alas after attila no more boileaus intention is self evident but corneille pretended to believe that it meant that agesilas had attained every end of tragedy by exciting pity helas being an interjection of commiseration and attila was the ne plus ultra of tragedy and that therefore the epigramatist had seemed to hope there would never be another   attila came out in      corneille piqued at the preference given to racine by the company of the hotel de bourgogne carried this tragedy to the palais royal where moliere received it with great satisfaction the celebrated thorilliere performed attila and madame moliere represented flavie it was well received at first but the gout for racine and declamation carried every thing before it and attila was soon neglected  tite et berenice represented in      yielded the victory to racines tragedy under the same title they were both written to please the vanity of a woman and racine being a perfect courtier and a young man succeeded best it was impossible any thing but nature could dictate to corneille racine perpetually suffered himself to be dictated to by the reigning taste and his friend despreaux  pulcherie brought out in      gave racine another triumph there is however a strength of character in it which racine never reached but the tide of prejudice was now so strong against corneille that he ventured but one more play and then retired  surene was that play it was performed in      and has some strokes of the master which perhaps has not been since equalled but it failed and corneille determined to retire from the busy world and make up his mind to die like a man and a christian besides his dramatic productions corneille produced a variety of things both in french and in latin all which bear the sterling stamp of an extraordinary and commanding genius a genius like the tripod of the sybil which it is impossible to approach without feeling a sudden enthusiasm   corneille was at the height of his glory when he retired in      the advantage taken of his absence to model the theaters to the rules of art so enervated the drama that what it gained on the side of taste and refinement it lost on the side of simplicity and nature the grandeur of tragedy in particular sunk after moliere had taught them how to admire true comedy and the softness and effiminacy introduced by racine which in proportion as it sunk to mere style and regularity lost sight of the sublime enchained the theater in the shackles of complaisance and servility till women the universal rulers of french fashions became the arbiters of dramatic excellence and the courtier bore away the victory from the philosopher who was now in derision called old corneille  he however proudly disdained to adopt this new taste not because he could not have excelled racine nor because his age had enfeebled his mind  both of which observations have been urged against him  for in those scenes of psyche which he wrote but did not acknowledge he has purposely abandoned himself to an excess of tenderness which racine would have found it difficult to imitate  corneille was of a portly stature he had an agreeable countenance a large nose a handsome mouth and eyes full of fire the whole effect lively and marking and proper to be transmitted to posterity either in a medal or a bust he knew as a perfect master les belles lettres history politics and every other elegant and erudite study but his great and favorite object was the theater for any thing else he had neither leisure nor curiosity nor much esteem he spoke even on subjects he well understood diffidently and to know the great corneille he must be read  he was grave but never sour his humor was plain but never rude he was a kind husband a fond parent and a faithful friend his temperament inclined him to love but never to libertism he had a firm and independent mind without suppleness but was little calculated to make a fortune at a french court it is very material to add here that though corneille by the cabals of richelieu was kept out of the french academy till after that ministers death yet the whole world have allowed him to have been a brilliant ornament of that society and he was at its head when he died it will be but justice hereafter to insert the elegant eulogium of racine on this great man when his brother t corneille was admitted into the academy as his successor  whose manners he despised he was sensible of praise but he detested flattery diffident of his own merit and forward to encourage the merit of others to great natural probity he joined a fervid but not a bigoted love of religion and indeed such was his public talents and his private virtues that it is difficult to say which was predominent in this truly great and justly celebrated character the man or the writer  the end of the first volume
