july      0 unto the right honorable the lords of council and session the petition of john and william cunningham and company brewers in glasgow james hotchkis and company brewers in edinburgh and james graham vintner in glasgow for themselves and as trustees of william mgregor late tenant in parkhall humbly shows in reclaiming against the lord auchinlecks interlocutor to be in the sequel more particularly stated the points proposed to be submitted to your lordships review are first whether certain tacks granted by mr hamilton of wishaw to william mgregor were adjudgeable at the instance of the now petitioners his creditors  dly the exceptions that are taken to the adjudication at wishaws own instance adjudging inter alia these very tacks and the facts upon which the question arises are these following  by tack of this date charles hamilton of wishaw aug         now deceased let to william mgregor and his heirs secluding subtenants and assignees except by the special consent of the proprietor the lands of easterpark and birkenhill for the space of fiftyseven years commencing at martinmas      for a rent or tackduty of l        sterling and a liberty was thereby granted to mgregor of subsetting part of said lands during the first nineteen years  by another tack mar         of this date the said charles hamilton let to the said william mgregor and his heirs secluding subtenants and assignees except they be of an unexceptionable good character the mill of newark milllands thirlage and sucken thereto pertaining for the space of thirtyseven years from and after martinmas      for a rent or tackduty of  00 merks scots  by a third tack jan        of this date the said charles hamilton let to the said william mgregor and his heirs and assignees of no higher degree than himself the lands of slaymuir for the space of fiftyseven years from and after martinmas      and for a rent or tackduty of l   sterling  by a fourth tack may    and         of this date the said charles hamilton let to david gardener and his heirs the lands of windiehall for a term of nineteen years commencing from martinmas      for a tackduty of l     s sterling to which tack last above mentioned the said william mgregor and john burns acquired right  and by an afteragreement aug         of this date passed betwixt the said william mgregor and john burns they agreed to take in lease from wishaw certain parcels of the lands of newark at a rent of l            during the currency of windiehall tack with a power of subsetting which proposals wishaw accepted of and in virtue thereof mgregor entered into possession and has since subset the same  your lordships have formerly had occasion to hear of the various schemes devised by wishaw and the said william mgregor for raising the estate of wishaw to an immense value and it was in prosecution of these aerial projects that mgregor seemingly in a flourishing way but in reality bankrupt and insolvent to a great degree if he is truly resting the large sums he is said to be due to wishaw found means to possess himself of the sums he owes to his other creditors  wishaw had obtained bonds of relief from mgregor for sundry large sums in which they were jointly bound and they were bound in others bonds for which no bond of relief appeared wishaw could not be ignorant of mgregors insolvent state with whom he was so nearly connected and bound along with him in such large sums unknown to the other creditors severals of whom under the apprehension that his affairs were not in the best situation were in cursu diligentiae  to frustrate the effect of these and to cover and protect mgregors effects from the diligence of his creditors wishaw thought proper whether by himself or by the moyen of his factor is immaterial to elicite from mgregor of this date oct         a disposition omnium bonorum of his whole subjects heritable and moveable including his householdfurniture and the very liquor in his cellars  that this was a fraudulent and collusive deed for the purpose above mentioned is apparent from this single circumstance that though conceived in the form of an immediate conveyance of all and singular the premises including the abovementioned tacks mgregor was allowed to continue in possession so far down as the  th and  th days of february      when two instruments of intimation and possession of the premises were taken in wishaws name  in the mean time mgregors insolvency came to be generally known whereupon the petitioners whose misfortune it is to be creditors to him in considerable sums were about to execute a poinding of his effects when wishaw compeared and produced a most extraordinary writing containing a variety of ideal schemes and proposals for retrieving mgregors circumstance and paying his debts  to these proposals were subjoined the following words i have confidered the above and agree thereto bearing no date and kept in wishaws pocket and as it was part of said proposals that mgregor upon the faith of future improvements should pay an immense additional rent from thenceforward wishaw was pleased to consider this as a new tack between him and mgregor and having preferred a complaint to his own baronbailie took decree for a large sum of arrears computing the rent as stated in the aforesaid proposals and thereupon execute one poinding in his own name and was conjoined with the petitioners in another poinding  wishaw thereafter took adjudication against mgregor for various large sums in which he was jointly bound with mgregor and for most of which he had bonds of relief but there was one of these bonds for no less than l  000 sterling granted by them jointly to josiah corthine for which he had no bond of relief other than what was contained in the aforesaid disposition omnium bonorum wherein mgregor was made to confess that the whole of that sum was his proper debt  mgregors other creditors and amongst these the petitioners did in like manner adjudge and were within year and day of wishaws adjudication  upon this title the petitioners brought a reduction of the aforesaid memorial which wishaw had been pleased to characterize a tack of the barondecreet and poinding following thereon and of the adjudication  it is unnecessary upon this occasion minutely to state the proceedings in that process it is sufficient to observe that wishaw anxious to avoid the appearances of collusion between him and his tenant with whom in other respects he was so deeply embarked now a confessed bankrupt did judicially disclaim the disposition omnium bonorum throwing the blame of it upon his factor as taken without his knowledge  a multiplepoinding was brought in name of the tenants calling the petitioners and wishaw to dispute their preferences when the several adjudications of mgregors subjects being produced it was objected on the part of wishaw that the tack of date   th august      which excluded assignees and subtenants was not adjudgeable and it was on the other hand contended that however effectual such clause might be to exclude a voluntary assignation it could not bar the diligence of lawful creditors upon which the lord ordinary pronounced the following interlocutor having considered the mutual memorials dec        finds that when a proprietor sets his lands in lease to a tenant and his heirs excluding assignees and subtenants this shows that he had in view which is known to be common and natural to favor a particular person and his family and not to expose himself to the hardship of having a tenant forced in upon him who upon many accounts might be disagreeable and therefore finds this seclusion is effectual not only against voluntary assignees but also against legal assignees by adjudication consequently that the creditors of mgregor the tenant by their adjudication of the tack of easterpark and birkenhill can take nothing and have no title to compete with mr hamilton the proprietor finds that so far as concerns the tack of breakenbrae and others let to mgregor and burns without any seclusion of assignees that mr hamilton in virtue of his adjudication has right to the same and that the other creditors have no right thereto in respect that tack is not adjudged by them and with respect to the tacks of the lands of slaemuir and the mill of newark with the pendicle therein mentioned which are adjudged by all the competitors and their adjudications within year and day of another finds them all pari passu preferable but that mr hamilton as the first effectual adjudger must draw in the first place the expense of his adjudication and that he must as proprietor be paid up the rent of these subjects for crop      and in time coming so far as resting owing  against which interlocutor both parties having represented and in the representation for wishaw a new objection being stated to the whole adjudications for the other creditors viz that they had recovered payment of part of their debts by a poinding and that notwithstanding thereof the adjudications had been taken for the whole sums the lord ordinary pronounced this other interlocutor jan      0 having again considered this representation with the answers and resumed the consideration of the representation for mr hamilton of wishaw to which no answers have been given in though the time fixed for giving in answers is long expired finds no sufficient cause shown for altering the interlocutor so far as thereby mr hamilton is found to have a preferable right to the tack of easterpark and birkenhill and that the same is not adjudgeable by the competing creditors but in respect of the pluris petitio in the adjudications of the creditors competing with him fully set forth in his representation to which no answers are made holds the other creditors as confessed on the truth of these averments and therefore finds these adjudications void and perfers mr hamilton of wishaw upon his adjudication upon the whole tacks and recals the pari passu preference given to the other creditors upon the tacks specified in the former interlocutor and finds no necessity now to determine the question whether mr hamilton is entitled to draw the whole or only a part of the expense of his adjudication in preference to the other creditors as the adjudications of these creditors being annulled puts an end thereto  against which interlocutor last above recited a representation being preferred for the now petitioners wherein the following points were insisted upon  st that the objection of a pluris petitio did not strike against one of the adjudications viz that at the instance of grahame and therefore that that adjudication behoved to be effectual not only against such of the tacks as did not exclude assignees and subtenants but also against the tack of easterpark and birkenhill quoad so much of the lands in said tack as mgregor was thereby at liberty to subset  dly that it was equally effectual to carry the sum of l  0 which wishaw was thereby bound to pay to mgregor in the event of his taking advantage of the breach of the tack thereby allowed  dly that wishaws adjudication was liable to certain objections therein stated which ought to be available to annul the same in totum or at least to restrict it to a security and  thly that supposing wishaws adjudication to be sustained as a first effectual adjudication it ought to be ascertained by what proportion these expenses ought to be paid out of the different subjects adjudged the lord ordinary upon advising the same with a counterrepresentation for wishaw june       0 pronounced this other interlocutor having again considered this representation with the counterrepresentation for the other creditors of mgregor and the mutual answers representation and replies for the other criditors and answers for mr hamilton of wishaw adheres to the former interlocutor with the following variations  st finds that only three of the adjudications are void and null on account of the pluris petitio viz those at the instance of mess cuninghams and hotchkis but finds the said nullity does not affect james grahames adjudication and further finds that james grahame in consequence of that adjudication is entitled to come in pari passu with mr hamilton for these tacks which mgregor had power to subset as also for the l  0 stipulated by the lease and refuses the several representations as to all other points  of these interlocutors in so far as it is thereby found that the tack of easterpark and birkenhill for a term of fiftyseven years excluding assignees and subtenants without the special consent of the proprietor is not adjudgeable and in so far as the objections to wishaws adjudications are repelled the petitioners are now humbly to pray your lordships review  and with respect to the first of these the petitioners will be allowed to assume this general proposition that it is adverse to the first principles of law and justice that any beneficial estate should be so established in the person of a debtor as to secure to him the enjoyment thereof and at the same time to exclude the diligence of his lawful creditors if the seclusion of assignees has the effect of barring the diligence of creditors by adjudication the consequence is plain that a tenant who cannot be removed by the heritor and whose voluntar assignment has no other effect but to void the assignation and does not annul the tack itself will keep possession of the lands reap the fruits and profits thereof and enjoy all the emoluments of the tack whilst his lawful creditors with whose money he purchased the tack pay a large grassun and improves the lands are disabled from affecting the same for their payment the master refuses his consent either to a voluntary or legal assignment of the tack and as the tenant cannot be removed till the issue of the tack he enjoys the benefit thereof in defiance of his creditors  the particular circumstances of this case state the hardships of this principle in a strong point of view mgregor purchases a tack from wishaw for a term of no less than fiftyseven years to him and his heirs secluding assignees and subtenants without the special consent of the proprietor he is in good credit at the time borrows at all hands makes expensive meliorations on the subjects set by buildings machinery and otherwise to the amount of about l   00 sterling he then becomes bankrupt and in collusion with his master to the the prejudice of his other lawful creditors grants to him a disposition omnium bonorum allows a decree to pass against him at his masters instance for large sums which were not justly due wishaw himself adjudges this very tack which was at the same time conveyed to him by the general disposition and when the other creditors have likewise adjudged the same tack they are told by wishaw that the tack was not adjudgeable  the apparent injustice of this proposition seems to have introduced a distinction in the construction of clauses of this nature between a voluntary assignation and an attachment of the right by legal diligence  thus in the case of bruce contra buckie as far back as the  d february      judgment was given finding that a reversion granted to any person and his heirs secluding assignees may be comprised  and again in the case of bruce contra vassals of lochleven  0th july    0 observed by lord fountainhall the reversion in a wadset being granted to the reverser and his heirs but not to assignees the lords in a pursuit at the instance of an assignee found this sufficient to exclude him so long as he insisted on his voluntary disposition but that this would not found against him when he produced a right from comprisers of the subject unless the reversion was so personal as to include both assignees and comprisers the plain import of which was that however the clause secluding assignees may be available to exclude voluntary assignees it ought not to be extended to exclude the legal diligence of creditors comprisers of the right where the same was not expressly secluded  in opposition to these reference was made to a later decision of this court  th december      in the case of william elliot contra the duke of buccleugh where it was found that a tack secluding assignees could not be adjudged what specialties may have occurred in that case your petitioners cannot take upon them to say it is very imperfectly stated in falconers collection and at any rate it is but a single decision repugnant to the former decisions of this court so that the point merits well to be considered before it is established to be law  the clause in this tack excluding assignees and subtenants is qualified with this exception except by the special consent of the proprietor and therefore it may justly be doubted whether any more was thereby intended but a reserved faculty to the master to refuse his consent to a voluntar assignment upon just and reasonable grounds and consequently not to comprehend the diligence of lawful creditors adjudging this valuable part of their bankrupt debtors estate  in short leases a dilectio personae may be presumed but where a tack is granted for such a long term of years to the leasee and his heirs in whom there can be no such dilectio being persons unknown at the time there is not equal reason to extend the exclusion to exclude the diligence of lawful creditors  and in the present case there occurs this remarkable specialty which demonstrates wishaws own sense of the matter viz that it was he who led the way by taking the first adjudication adjudging this very tack and that equality which the law maintains with respect to the whole creditors of a bankrupt by bringing in all adjudgers pari passu who are within year and day of the first effectual adjudication will never permit his dispensing with the clause secluding assignees so far as regards his own diligence and to lay hold of it to exclude the diligence of other creditors wishaws adjudication now that he has repudiated the disposition omnium bonorum is his only title to this tack he must therefore take that species of diligence as qualified by law and with all its legal effects one of which is that every adjudication led within year and day is entitled to come in pari passu along with it so that having dispensed with the seclusion of assignees in favors of one adjudication he must be understood to have dispensed with it in favors of all the other adjudications which the law brings in pari passu with it  and therefore to conclude upon this point the petitioners humbly submit to your lordships that the clause of seclusion qualified as above in a tack of such a long endurance does not exclude the diligence of lawful creditors by adjudication and that as wishaw himself in the character of creditor has taken adjudication of this very tack and which is his only title thereto he has thereby not only shown his own sense and understanding of that clause which meant only to exclude voluntary assignees but has thereby consented to the adjudications of other creditors within year and day of his the first effectual adjudication  the other point proposed for your lordships consideration respects the exceptions that have been taken to wishaws adjudication not only as to what respects the abovementioned tack of the lands of easterpark and birkenhill but mgregors whole other estate  and in so far as that adjudication proceeds upon wishaw and mgregors joint bond to collector corthine june        for l  000 sterling it is an agreed fact that no bond of relief was granted therefore till the   th october      when the disposition omnium bonorum was granted by mgregor in favors of wishaw wherein mgregor is made to confess that that was his proper debt in which wishaw was only cautioner for him  the granting such a disposition at the time when the other creditors were proceeding in diligence to operate their payment against mgregor and his effects was per se an act of nottour bankruptcy and was in other respects the act of fraud between persons so intimately connected with an intention to frustrate the diligence of the other creditors the bond granted to collector corthine proves this to have been their joint debt and consquently that mgregor had relief against wishaw for the one half this relief he gives away by the disposition omnium bonorum and takes the whole debt upon him by the acknowledgment therein contained of wishaws being but cautioner for him therein was this to be allowed to bring so great a debt upon the bankrupts estate there would be no security against fraudulent contrivances of this kind the other creditors were in cursu diligentiae mgregors claim of relief against wishaw for the half of this debt was part of the bankrupts estate this he gives away by the disposition omnium bonorum and submits to take the whole of that debt upon himself how far it would be proper or just to sustain a device of this kind is humbly submitted  and if your lordships shall be of opinion that this objection is well founded it must be effectual either totally to annul wishaws adjudication so far as it is taken for the whole sums principal annualrent and penalties in the bond to collector corthine or at least to restrict the same to a security for the one half of the principal sum and annualrents  but the objection does not rest here for your lordships have heard that wishaw has judicially disclaimed and renounced that disposition omnium bonorum as taken from mgregor by his factor without any authority from him and without his privity and knowledge  wishaw is indeed pleased to say that that disclamation ought to be extended no further than to repudiate the disposition omnium bonorum but by no means to comprehend the acknowledgement therein contained of wishaws being but cautioner for mgregor in said bond but this is a distinction which your lordships will never allow he has been obliged to confess that that deed was taken without his authority privity or knowledge he therefore disclaimed the same and that acknowledgement or disclamation cannot now be split so as to support it in one part and reject it in another the whole was a fraudulent contrivance and must stand or fall in whole  but the petitioners do further insist that wishaws adjudication is equally exceptionable so far as it proceeds upon the other grounds of debt wherein mgregor and he were jointly bound and for which wishaw had a bond of relief  the bond of relief of this date recites several debts in which wishaw was bound jointly with mgregor july         all which mgregor thereby acknowledges to have been his proper debts and therefore becomes bound and obliged to free relieve and skaithless keep wishaw and his heirs etc of said several sums principal annualrents and liquidate penalties and of all damages expenses etc and for that effect so soon as required by wishaw or his foresaids to make payment to the several creditors therein named of their respective principal sums and annualrents and to deliver up to wishaw the principal bonds or sufficient discharges of the same or otherwise to make payment to wishaw of the principal sums annualrents and penalties to the end he may apply the same toward operating his relief of said bonds  no such requisition was ever made but in lieu thereof wishaw of this date aug         took decree against mgregor for payment of the whole sums principal annualrent and penalties contained in the aforesaid bond  that wishaw might have adjudged for security and relief of these debts which were still outstanding unpaid by wishaw the petitioners shall readily admit but as wishaw had not paid these debts to the creditors and as the obligation upon mgregor in the aforesaid bond of relief to make payment of these sums to wishaw himself was so qualified as only to take effect in case mgregor when required so to do should fail or neglect to make payment of the sums to the proper creditor and either to retire and deliver up the bonds themselves or discharges of the same and as no such requisition was ever made the petitioners do humbly contend that the adjudication was improper and illegal which therefore ought to be annulled in totum and as wishaw has prevailed in reducing the whole adjudications of the whole other creditors one only excepted upon a mere omission of the creditors agent in the country neglecting to advise their townagent of the partial payment they had recovered on a poinding he can with no reason complain when the same measure is dealt to him thereby to bring him on a level with the other creditors at least equally onerous  may it therefore please your lordships to alter the lord ordinarys interlocutors in the abovementioned particulars and in the  st place to repel the objection to the other creditors adjudications so far as regards the tack of easterpark and birkenhill founded upon the clause secluding assignees  dly to sustain the objections to wishaws adjudication so far as it proceeds upon the debt due to collector corthine relevant to annul the same in totum or at least to restrict it to a security for the one half of said principal sum and annulrents  dly to sustain the other objection to wishaws adjudication as led for the whole of the aforesaid debts unpaid by wishaw at the time without any previous requisition to mgregor in terms of the bond of relief relevant to reduce that adjudication in totum according to justice etc alex lockhart
