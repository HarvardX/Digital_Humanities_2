naturally gives the hordes good health and a vigorous constitution and this confirmed by a hardy education coarse fare etc qualifies them for any difficulties they may have to encounter and makes them good soldiers but at the same time cramps their activity and renders them indolent and averse to study there are certainly among them learned able and great men but this seems not to be the general talent of this nation they being more apt to sit down with superficial acquisitions than to acquire scientific knowledge by study  the nobility and gentry mostly apply themselves to a military life in which they are more renowned for courage and enduring fatigue and hardships than for stratagem and intrigue they have a graceful deportment value much their own consequence make the best appearance they can and to gain the respect of others are more expensive in the number of attendants sumptuous houses costly apparel and wellfurnished tables than in other less noticed occasions they never descend to any employments in the church law physic or trade and though to gain experience in maritime affairs they will submit to the lowest offices abroad yet at home no gentleman will accept the command of a merchantship the burghers are not very intelligent in trade nor able to do their business without credit from abroad rather inclined to impose on those they can overreach than follow their calling in a fair way the peasants when sober for they are much addicted to drinking spirituous liquors are very obsequious and respectful but drink makes them mad and ungovernable most of them live in a very poor condition and are taught by necessity to practice several arts in a rude manner as making their shoes clothes etc the several instruments of husbandry and other necessaries which they cannot afford to buy and to keep them to this no more than one tailor or such other handicraftsman is permitted to dwell in the same parish be it ever so large and many of them are more than  0 miles in circuit  they are a people by no means dull of apprehension have no phlegm in their characters are cheerful but not like noisy and bustling people that laugh one moment and are dejected the next they have not quite the vivacity of the french but on the whole as much as the english  it may in general be said of the whole nation that they are a people very religious in their way and constant frequenters of the church that they are eminently loyal and affected to monarchy grave even to formality much more out of necessity than principles of temperance apt to entertain suspicions and to envy each other as well as strangers more inclined to pilfering and such secret frauds than open violences as breaking into houses or highwayrobberies crimes as rarely committed in this as in any country whatever  in matters of trade they more easily do the drudgery than dive into the mystery either of commerce or manufactures in which they usually set up for masters before they are halftaught so that in all things that require ingenuity neatness and dexterity they are forced to apply to strangers  the manners of all ranks of people in sweden are very engaging the superior classes have an easy natural politeness which prejudices you in their favor at first acquaintance they have not a swift or formal nor pert or foppish but a plain easy carriage and manner the result of good sense and humanity their conversation is agreeable paying great attention to foreigners without troubling them with national customs and ceremonies duels are not common yet the men have very just ideas of honor and are as unwilling to put up affronts as more tenacious and quarrelsome nations and with respect to the peasantry they are a quiet inoffensive happy and contented people there are few cottages in sweden that have not lands annexed to them from  0 to  0 acres and the produce of this land as their wives and daughters are employed in husbandry enables them to be better clothed and make a better appearance than the peasantry of england  mr coxe who has given us such inslated accounts of the politeness and hospitality of the polish and russian gentry tells us that the swedish nobility are equally so although with much less magnificence and expense in their houses retinue and entertainments which arises from a circumstance that must give pleasure to every friend of humanity the possession of land not being in this country as in poland and russia appropriated to any particular description of men property is more equally diffused and such vast accumulations of wealth or extent of domains do not center in the hands of a few grandees  the sports and exercises peculiar to the swedes and other northern nations are their running races on sledges and sailing in yachts upon the ice in which they will turn and alter their course sailing with incredible swiftness much beyond any vessel in the water and with much less danger of oversetting  music is esteemed one of the polite accomplishments among the ladies it is indeed almost a general science in this country many of their musicmasters are held in high repute and this vocation is thought so honorable as to introduce them to all assemblies with persons of the first distinction  among the highlanders the shepherdesses blow a kind of long trumpet made of birchbark and called in the swedish language lur this musical instrument is sometimes four yards in length has a strong and sharp sound and in calm weather can be heard at the distance of four or five miles it is generally used in the woods and mountains to frighten away wild beasts  the court at stockholm is not very brilliant owing probably to the circumscribed revenue of the crown both king and queen wear the national dress and at the drawing room his majesty according to etiquette salutes every senators lady after the king and queen have paid their compliments to the company they retire with part of it to an adjacent apartment and play with them at trente et quarente or ombre about nine they withdraw to a public supper opposite to their majestys at a small distance from the lower end of the table ranges of tabourets or stools are placed for senators and ambassadors wives no other ladies being permitted to sit so that none below those ranks can make their appearance at these entertainments a senator here is a privycounsellor of which their are    during supper the king and queen talk with the nobility and foreign ministers who stand near them  the way of dividing the residence of winter and summer as practiced in england takes place here but in part many of the nobility and richest of the gentry reside the whole year at stockholm scarce ever seeing their estates others live entirely in the country seldom if ever visiting the capital some however have houses at stockholm for the winter season having a very good house for their summerresidence in the country decorated with gardens and plantations  the ordinary salutation of the swedes is bowing to each other as in england but the inhabitants of the northern parts take hold of your right hand and lay it over their left making strange faces at the same time they are immoderately fond of spirituous liquors quaff their pipes after meals and push the bottle about pretty briskly  it is the etiquette of the country to salute the hand of every lady you are introduced to but never the cheek though the men frequently salute the cheek of each other mr wraxhall gives us an interesting account of an embarrassment he labored under from this etiquette he was unaccustomed to in england having been admitted frequently into the company of an enchanting young lady of  0 years of age with whom he was exceedingly smitten he longed much to salute her but knew not how to bring it about for though a lover or an acquaintance may here take the most unbounded familiarity with the hand of his mistress which he may kiss squeeze press or do with almost whatever he has a mind yet her lips nay her very cheek is a palladium which she guards with unremitting vigilance and to which neither eloquence or subtlety can usually procure him any access he was resolved however to try whether he could not surmount this vexatious obstacle and attain one conquest over this tyranny of prescription convinced that no address no contrivance could avail him without the additional face of authority and example to influence her he bethought himself of a stratagem and had already bound his brows with the myrtles he was certain he should gather when i bade says he the whole company adieu i began with the mistress of the mansion an old lady of  0 who was the aunt of this young lady and the widow of an english gentleman and returning her my warmest acknowledgements for her friendship and hospitality bowed most respectfully on her hand which she gave me to salute and now madam said i in english i shall take leave of you in the english style i am sure you have no objection so saying i put my arms about her neck and kissed her cheek she was pleased with my gallantry and said to me laughingly go and serve charlotte so i advanced elate with joy and throwing into my attitude and countenance the utmost humility and supplication asked if i might not aspire to such an honor i should not however have waited for an explicit consent and was just going to reap the fruit of my intrigue and labor when she stepping back hastily two paces laid her hand on her breast with an air which implied more than any words could have done and throwing a look at me of surprise and refusal monsieur said she il faut souv nir que je suis swedoise  she needed not to be more minute or firm in her determination i saw that i had undertaken an enterprise above my capacity and had only to endeavor to retire with honor i disdained all approach to violence and was resolved that what i could not receive from her own consent i would never attempt to seize by compulsion her hand she tendered me and making a virtue of necessity i imprinted on it a cold kiss and bade her farewell she attended me to the gate and followed me with her eyes whilst the carriage was in sight  marriages in sweden are totally governed by the will of the parents and founded so much upon interest that the inclination of the parties is little regarded nor is the nation much troubled with the extravagance of lovers a stolen match is scarce heard of in an age nor can the church give license to marry without publication of banns persons of condition of both sexes are seldom married till they are  0 years of age because perhaps their parents cannot afford to make them a settlement suitable to their rank and of course the young couple is not in a situation to maintain a family till the death of relations or advancement in life enables them so to do the women are in general more eminent for chastity before marriage than fidelity afterward they are very fruitful and seldom fail of a numerous issue among the common people the wife has much the worst of it being put to all the drudgery without doors as well as within and looks upon herself rather in the light of a servant than that of a wife  domestic quarrels of course rarely happen husbands being as apt to keep the authority in their own hands as the wives by nature custom or necessity are inclined to be obedient divorces and separations scarce ever occur but among the lower class of people where the innocent party is permitted to marry again cousingermans cannot marry without the kings dispensation which is more frequently granted than refused  in weddingentertainments they have even affected pomp and supersluity beyond their circumstances and often by the excess of this one day many have involved themselves for years  the same is observable in their funeralsolemnities which are usually accompanied with more jollity and feasting then becomes the occasion and that they may have more time to make preparations it is not uncustomary to convey the corpse to some vault in or near the church where it shall remain unburied for months and sometimes for years rather than disgrace the family by an ordinary funeral this was more however the practice of the last age than the present these and other unnecessary expenses beginning to be laid aside in conformity to the frugality of the court and in compliance with their fortunes which have been much reduced by taxes and the resumption of great part of their estates by the crown on one pretense or other  by the laws of sweden the fathers estate whether hereditary or acquired is divided among his children every son having an equal share in it and a daughter half as much as the son nor can the father give a greater share to one more than another unless he can obtain the concurrence of a court of law through the undutifulness of any of his children in which case he can only bequeth one tenth of his acquired property to such child as h shall think proper this also reduces the fortune of individuals  traveling in sweden is perfectly commodious to one acquainted with the usual method of procuring horses at the different towns and villages upon the high roads posthorses are not always regularly stationed but if the traveller sends forward to a peasant to appoint relays at a certain stipulated place and time his orders are punctually executed the usual practice of supplying posthorses is regulated in a manner very convenient and cheap to travelers yet extremely burdensome to the natives all persons possessing land of a certain tenure are bound to send one or more horses two or three times in the month to the neighboring post house if they are not wanted they return after waiting    hours without any compensation for their labor and loss of time and if employed receive a very inadequate recompense    stivers or  0 d english being only paid in the towns for each horse for a swedish mile equal to two leagues english and half the above sum for a mile in the villages which is not more than one penny or one penny halfpenny sterling for each horse per english mile mr coxe says that for the distance of  00 miles from stockholm to carlserone his whole expense including the prime cost of his cart which is the common traveling machine in this country with two armed chairs fixed on with springs the hire of posthorses gratuities to drivers and accommodations on the road did not amount to  0 l english though his swedish servant occasionally taxed him with want of economy the drivers being the peasants themselves who usually attend with their own horses are contented with a small acknowledgement of   d and   d for each post  one post says mr coxe i was driven by a peasants daughter and as the roads were in many parts exceedingly steep it required some strength and much dexterity to direct the horses and prevent the carriage from being overturned their harness consisting only of ropes tied together i proposed that my servant who was an expert driver should take the reins the girl being offended at my questioning her skill peremptorily rejected my proposal and placing herself in the postillions seat drove off at full speed governing the horses in such a skilful manner that she soon quieted my apprehensions and we arrived at the end of the post without the slightest alarm no was i in future in the least apprehensive of trusting myself to the guidance of a swedish country girl the horses here are small about   l english in value each but lively and active two were usually the compliment for my cart and they went generally at the rate of six or seven miles an hour the postillion never rode but sat upon a small bench at the extremity of the cart when more than two horses are harnessed to a carriage they are all abreast  to prevent persons from being detained from the wilful negligence of those who are obliged to furnish horses each traveller signs a book which is kept for that purpose noting in this book how long he had been retarded by their neglect this book is produced at every quarterly meeting of the magistrates when the offender is punished according to his deserts  considering the many rocks and rugged mountains in this country the highways are better than can be imagined they are plained and made easy by the peasants who receive their orders from the governors of the respective provinces from time to time and obey them punctually insomuch that motraye observes there are scarce better ways in any country in europe nor is there a place where a man travels with more security and less charge but out of the great roads there are very poor accommodations the high roads in sweden wind agreeably through the country are made with stone or gravel and are as good as our turnpikes in england and yet not a single toll is exacted from the traveller each landholder is obliged to keep a certain part of the road good in proportion to his property and for the purpose of ascertaining their respective portions small pieces of wood or stone numbered are fixed at different distances on each side of the way  though we have no great reason says conset to complain in england of our turnpike roads yet nothing with us is to be compared with these swamps morasses etc are all made equally good and their fine woods and gravelroads have so beautiful an effect that the traveller might frequently suppose himself entering the avenue or approach to some great mansion  when you leave these high roads the stages are long and though you meet with much civility the accommodations are but indifferent if your wine is carried with you and you have your own horses and attendants and can ride the whole journey every peasants house is open to you and with the utmost hospitality and they will for very trisling rewards do whatever is in their power to serve you they will get you fish wild fowl and venison excellent of the kind with which you may load a horse from place to place and as wine is easily carried this will remedy every inconvenience  in wintertime the most expeditious way of traveling is in their sledges especially in those parts of the country which abound in lakes and rivers for these being all frozen there are no obstacles in their way and a traveller may more readily carry provisions with him in a sledge than on horseback and the want of the sun is so well supplied by the brightness of the snow and the clearness of the sky at this time of year that traveling by night is as i have observed as usual as in the day  in passing from stockholm to finland the gulf of bothnia is to be crossed this passage in summertime is in vessels but about  0 miles from abo where the gulphs of bothnia and finland unite this branch of the sea being frozen in winter is crossed in sledges and the road on this frozen surface is marked out by two rows of small tes placed upright in the ice as a direction for travelers  chap iv of their trade manufactures and revenue sweden was a long time without any trade or commerce and formerly used to be supplied with foreign commodities by the hanstowns but by the state of commerce laid before the diet in      it appears that trade was making great advances the exports from sweden are iron in bars and wrought other wrought metals timber pitch tar potash saltpeter gunpowder cobalt cordage wooden ware furs morocco leather as it is called and dried fish the imports are grain flesh bacon cheese butter tallow salt wine brandy drugs hides hemp flax wool silk and several foreign manufactures they now study their commerce so much as to take pains to improve their agriculture and fisheries and employ none but swedish bottoms to carry on the trade of the kingdom  the general direction of their trade belongs to the college of commerce which consists of the president of the treasury and four counselors who hear causes of that nature and redress any disorder that happens and the bank of stockholm is a great benefit to it  in      an east india company was established but this is no more than a society of merchants who send annually two or three vessels to china and in    0 the herrings which till then had never approached the western shore of sweden flocking in shoals to that coast the inhabitants of gotheburg or gotenburg established a fishery which has been attended with considerable advantage an english consul and several merchants of our nation here reside and a chapel with a regular chaplain is appropriated to their service  among the manufactures which they have been eager to establish is the woollen they have made some progress in coarse cloths and begin to work some that are fine an improvement which has been much owing to their gaining a better breed of sheep from england and which with much assiduity has been dispersed over most parts of the kingdom  they have also some linen fabrics in which are wrought both hemp and flax but these are not nearly sufficient to supply their homeconsumption of glass and paper they import very little hardware is a considerable article among them not in the style of our birmingham manufacture but chiefly in the foundery way they cast great quantities of cannon and export them also balls in great number and many other articles they are unrivalled in their iron and coppermines which are far more considerable than those of any other country in europe so that they apply copper to most of the purposes that we do lead in england such as roofing of churches and other buildings holland and france are their best customers but no country pays them so much in money as england in iron and timber we pay them a balance of some hundred thousand pounds annually the peasants are chiefly employed in the manufacture of iron and copper and most forges of iron employ from four to   00 workmen each throughout the country there are many of these forges and no cyclops were ever more dexterous in working their materials i have seen them says wraxhall stand close to and hammer in their coarse frocks of linen a bar of ore as i have before observed the heat and refulgence of which were almost insupportable to me at ten feet distance and with the sparks of which they were covered from head to foot  building ships for foreigners is also a trade among them and encouraged by government and they go fair to underfell the english and dutch in shipbuilding by many per cent  the revenue of sweden is but small not above   00000 l a year nor has it been improved for many years it arises either out of the demesne lands of the crown from the customs the coin copper and silver mines tithes which the crown seized at the reformation and were before appropriated to bishoprics and monasteries polltax fines stamped paper and other duties of money they have some gold and silver pieces but these are very scarce they having many years since been called in and the holders of them obliged to exchange them for copper pieces on which the king stamped an imaginary value they have also banknotes so low as one shilling and sixpence each rising gradually from that sum to very large amounts it is often diverting to see them come loaded with coppercoin to give change for a  0 dollar note equal to    s   d english nor can they convert it into current cash by any other means it is said that corregio the painter caught the fever of which he died by wheeling home in a barrow in a very hot day the money he had received in payment for one of his pieces the price having been laid down in copper corregio however was not a swede but the swedes till the invention of bankpaper were accustomed to wheel about their money in barrows an abundance of coppercoin may be seen also in other countries in france among the lower class such large sums are often paid in copper that tradesmen will not be at the trouble of counting it but pay it away by weight  chap v of their language learning and religion the swedish language has such an affinity with the danish and norwegian dialects that the inhabitants of the three kingdoms readily understand each other but finland and lapland have dialects of their own that of the finlanders is quite different from most of the other northern dialects but like that of the laplanders with which its idiom perfectly agrees it has a great affinity with the hebrew  in pagan times the runic characters were in use here as appears from the runensteine or runic stones set up near the sepulchers of the dead which are still to be seen in most of the provinces persons of rank at present speak and write chiefly french and high dutch  the swedish language has so great a resemblance to the english that a quick english ear may readily comprehend many expressions in common conversation the following phrases for example come let us go  let us see  stand still  hold your tongue  go on  are thus written in the swedish tongue  kom let oss go  let oss se   stand still  hold din tunga  go an but they are generally pronounced more in the scotch than the english accent and mr coxe says it appeared to him as if the swedes were talking broad scotch nor is it any matter of wonder for it is probable that the scottish mode of speaking is the same as was formerly used in england and that whilst we have gradually softened our former pronunciation the scotch have retained it with respect to the similarity between the swedish and the english we may remark that they are both dialects of the teutonic or german and if in the pronunciation they resemble more each other than their original stock it is owing to this circumstance that we are certainly descended from the swedes and danes whose languages are only different dialects and the old saxon which gave rise to the english was probably first introduced into our island by settlers or invaders from these northern kingdoms there are obsolete english words very common in scotland and that the similarity of the english and swedish was greater formerly than at present appears from the following anecdote taking from the swedish history  everinus was the first bishop by birth an englishman he came in  0   into sweden at the request of king olaus scotkonung in order to assist in converting the natives of old upsala to christianity the similarity of the english and swedish languages is mentioned as the motive that first brought him and afterward several of his countrymen there as preachers of the gospel  in sweden the nobility and gentry seem to apply themselves more to the study of arms than of arts and to despise an academical education it is the meanest of the people who resort to their universities to qualify themselves for holy orders the law also is a contemptable profession only taken up by those who know not how otherwise to subsist but persons of rank have lately exhibited some noble proofs of their munificence for the improvement of literature they sent haselquist the natural philosopher into the east for discoveries and queen christina purchased his collection of curiosities puffendorf that able civilian statesman and historian was a native of sweden and so also was the late celebrated linnaeus who carried certain branches of natural philosophy to the highest pitch and in the midst of the late distractions the fine arts drawing sculpture and architecture were encouraged and protected and yet according to mr wraxhall who made great enquiries on this head the few artists on which they lavish encomiums are rather celebrated for their rarity than their greatness or luster the knowledge of agriculture both in theory and practice is here carried to a considerable height and we apprehend the general characters of the swedes being a dull and heavy people is more owing to the want of opportunity of exerting their talents than of not having talents to exert  the public revenue and wealth of sweden being intimately connected with the mines particularly those of iron mineralogy has been eminently encouraged and cultivated in that kingdom to this cause we may in a great measure attribute the acknowledged skill of the swedish chemists as superior to those of many other nations the swedes have no poets some have attempted poetry in latin but have made nothing of it  sweden contains three universities upsal lund and abo and    seminaries called gymnesia for the educacation of youth six of which are of royal foundation in every large town there is also a school maintained at the expense of the crown in which boys generally continue till they are    years old when they are removed to the gymnesia and thence at about    to the universities in the gymnesia and many of the greater schools the greek latin and hebrew languages are taught and the bishops in their respective dioceses where they are obliged to reside inspect these seminaries and schools  at the head of the university of upsal is a chancellor always a man of high rank and consequence chosen by the professors and confirmed by the king in his absence the archbishop of upsal acts for him it has a court of justice belonging to it and has about  0 professors whose salaries are from  0 l to  00 l a year  youth here do not inhabit any distinct colleges as in our universities but lodge in the town and attend the professors who have in common no regular dress any more than the students but on days of ceremony wear a black silk cloak doctors of divinity are distinguished by a black silk hat doctors of law by a white one and those of physic by one of green or sky blue the average number of students is about  00  this university is certainly the first seminary of the north for academical education and has produced from the time of its institution persons eminent in every branch of science the learned publications which have been given to the world by its members sufficiently prove the flourishing state of literature in this country there are very few instances says marshall of a young man understanding the dead languages and not being at the same time master of two or three very useful living ones which is more than can be said of our youth in england  the universitylibrary contains many valuable books and manuscripts and among the most valuable of the latter is a copy of the four gospels supposed to be one of the gothic translations made by ulphilas the apostle of the goths in the fourth century mr coxe examined it and says it is a quarto volume and the letters all in capitals painted in silver upon leaves whether of vellum parchment or papyrus he knows not stained violetcolour the initials of the words and some few passages are painted in gold in the same manner as in the finest missals most of the golden characters are become green by time but the silver letters are in good preservation this manuscript was first discovered in      in the library of the benedictine abbey of werden in westphalia hence it was transferred to prague and thence sent as a present in      by count koningsmark to queen christina of sweden by her it was given to isaac vossius the dutchman and on his death was purchased for about   0 l by count magnus gabriel de la gardie and by him presented to the university of upsal this copy undoubtedly a translation from the original greek is considered as a work of great authority and a literary treasure of high antiquity  the two other universities are on the same plan but not so numerous  the royal society at upsal is the oldest literary academy of that kind in the north and was instituted in    0 they have also a royal academy of sciences at stockholm and an academy for the polite arts at drotningholm  the established religion of this country is lutheranism the reformation as well as in denmark and norway beginning soon after the neighboring parts of germany had imbibed the tenets of luther all orders of men here agree in a constant attendance on divine service and a zeal for their own way without any nice enquiries into disputable points either of their own faith or that of other churches they are surprizingly uniform and unremitting in matters of religion and they will suffer the religious exercise of any dissenting protestants and it is said have such an aversion to popery that castration is the fate of every romancatholic priest there discovered nay they go such lengths says motraye that they will not admit any dissenter to reside among them nor would they give a chaplain of the english ambassador christian burial nor suffer the english to read their funeral service at the grave though at that time which was in    0 the english fleet was their only security against the ravages of the muscovites the archbishop of upsal was consulted on this point and went so far as to prohibit the swedish clergy assisting at the funeral or carry him to the grave as they do a departed brother  but notwithstanding their great aversion to popery we learn from conset who was there in      that with respect to outward splendour they adopt the popish mode of worship the priest in approaching the altar puts on a rich embroidered cope and officiates according to many romancatholic customs above the altartable in st nicholass church at stockholm is the ascension of our savior represented in solid gold inlaid with silver of most exquisite workmanship and many crucifixes of solid gold and silver about it after service rigid as they are in it they go to plays operas and all kinds of amusements they have music in their churches and such as inspires the mind with religious awe  the religion of finland and that of lapland is lutheran  the church is governed by an archbishop and    bishops who are not troubled with the administration of secular affairs but are obliged to reside in their dioceses except at the meeting of the diet their revenues are very moderate the archbishopric of upsal not being more than  000 l a year the bishoprics from  00 l to  00 l under the bishops are three superintendants with episcopal powers and authority these are the kings first chaplain the rector of st nicholas in stockholm and the first chaplain of the navy over each  0 churches is a rural dean the churches in sweden and finland are short in number of  000 and the clergy all together do not exceed  000 all the sons of peasants or mean burghers whose incomes are small arising from glebeland and one third of the tithes the king having the other two  the clergy of each diocese on the death of their bishop propose three persons to the king and he nominates one to succeed the same in the choice of the superintendants but on the election of the archbishop all the chapters have a vote the determination however is in the king his majesty has the patronage of most churches some few only being in the disposal of the nobility many of their churches are adorned with sculptures painting gilding etc all are kept neat and clean and furnished as well in country as city with rich altarcloths copes and other vestments  foreign ministers enjoy the free exercise of their religion in their own families but no one else the children of strangers must be baptized by lutheran ministers and educated in their religion or they have not the privileges of swedish subject  if any swedish subject changes his religion he is banished and loses his property if any one continues excommunicated above a year he is imprisoned a month fed on bread and water and then banished and if any one brings into the country teachers of another religion he is fined and banished  chap vi of their government forces and laws the form of the swedish government has been often changed before the year      says coxe it consisted of    articles all tending to abridge the power of the crown and render the swedish monarchy the most limited in europe but in the revolution of      the king threw off his shackles and by compulsion made himself absolute master of his empire the whole executive power is vested in him and though he has a senate or privy council consisting of    members with a salary of  00 l each he is perfect master of that senate can appoint and remove all the members of it and is not bound to follow their advice further than he likes he has the command both of army and navy nominates to all civil offices has the sole power of convening and dissolving the states is not obliged to assemble them but when he pleases has rendered the taxes perpetual enjoys a fixed revenue and has the entire disposal of the public money but though such are his perogatives yet he has no power to enact or alter laws raise money declare war or alter the coin without the consent of the states and if called upon by them when convened is obliged to account for the expenditure of the public money  the diet in which the supreme authority resides is composed of the king and four estates of the people convened in four houses   the nobles   the clergy   the citizens and   the peasants    the house of nobles is divided into three counts barons and untitled nobility a family once enobled continues so throughout all its branches and all have the same general privileges the king can create new nobility but in this he is limited in number they must not exceed in all    0 the head of each noble family in the direct line is by birth a member of this house and represents his whole family if he happens to be a senator it incapacitates him from a seat in the house of nobles but he can transfer his seat to another noble and can vote by proxy england is the only country in europe says mr charles sheridan where the distinction of noble and not noble is carried no further than the nature of the government requires because there the nobility do not as such form a distinct class from the rest of the nation it being only the head of each noble family who is there entitled to the honors and privileges of the peerage it is not the man who can count a long train of titled ancestors but the hereditary legislator who is himself noble the younger branches of noble families in england are soon lost in the general mass of people and thus become a link connecting the interests of the two classes and forming a chain no part of which can be touched without affecting as it were by an electrical communication all the rest in countries where a person ennobled can transmit his honors to all his posterity there is no such link of connection but on the contrary a line is drawn between them to perpetuity a line which cuts the chain of society in two the severed ends of which appear rather to repel than attract each other    the house of the clergy consists of the    bishops the archbishop at their head and a certain number of clergymen chosen by the clerical body in each archdeaconry the number is from  0 to  0    the house of the citizens consists of about  00 members chosen by certain staple towns of which there are in sweden  0     the house of peasants consists of about  00 members such as we should call yeomen men who hold small farms of their own or of the crown and who cultivate such farms themselves this description includes only those whose ancestors were also farmers and does not entitle either nobles citizens or even countrygentlemen though they may purchase the peasants estate either to vote or be returned a member and it is said the king has made a late regulation that none but such peasants shall hold any office under government  the constituents of each house allow their representatives a daily sum from    s english to   s a day during their attendance at the diet  by the above mode of representation we see that the countrygentlemen be their landed property ever so large are not represented in the diet have no vote for members and cannot be chosen themselves men universally allowed the most respectable and incorrupt part of the body politic whilst mechanics and farmers possess this important privilege  the states of the kingdom thus composed assemble at stockholm the business of the state and the enaction of laws is carried on much the same as in our parliament in england when the different houses have resolved on any law they attend the king in his palace and go in procession from the several places in the city where they assemble the townguard turns out under arms as they pass the first noble venerable in age and dressed in the courtfashion precedes the rest of the nobility walk in pairs then the archbishop of upsal with a gold chain about his neck the other bishops and clergy two and two next the chief magistrate of stockholm at the head of the burghers and lastly the poor peasants the singularity of whose apparel and lank hair form a remarkable contrast with those of the other houses but though appearances do not favor these people they are far from being deficient in the politics of their own country are firm in opinion not to be bribed or biassed but adhere strictly to the welfare and credit of their nation the swedes boast of having formed their diet on the model of the english parliament if they did they have improved it for it would be happy for this country if we could boast of the same integrity  the kings titles are king of the goths and vandals great prince of finland duke of schonem prince of rugen lord of ingermanland and wismar prince palatine the rhine duke of bavaria cleves bergen pomeran etc and in this country there are three orders of knighthood the north star consisting of    members the order of vasa and that of the sword created at the last revolution  sweden had a greater extent of territory than at present in the course of this century it has lost livonia ingermannland and a considerable part of finland and the russians are endeavoring to deprive it of the remainder of that country it has lost also the duchy of bremen and particularly of verden the city of stettin in pomerania and the districts lying between the oder and pene together with the islands of wollin and usedom and the duchy of deux ponts of its former conquests it still retains bohus lehn a tract of land in norway part of upper pomerania the island of rugen and the town of wismar  the swedish army is divided into national militia and regiments in garrison the latter are on the german footing are composed of natives and foreigners properly enlisted and paid in money the militia are furnished by the several districts of the kingdom each holder of a certain quantity of crownland called a hemman worth about  0 l a year provides a soldier assigns for his maintenance a small portion of ground a cottage and a barn and allows him  00 copperdollars a year that is   l   s   d   f english a susit of coarse clothes and two pair of shoes when this soldier is on duty the landholder cultivates his ground but when he is not on duty the landholder may call on him to work at the rate of a common labourer which is about   d english per day on the death of a soldier the ground and house goes to his successor of the cavalry a man and a horse is furnished by a certain number of hemmans and by them maintained each province being divided into a number of hemmans sufficient to support a regiment the smaller provinces furnish the regiments of infantry and the larger those of cavalry each regiment from  000 to   00 men of which    are officers the estate appropriated to the colonel by the king as his pay is in value about  00 l a year lies in the center of the province and of the ground assigned to his regiment that of a captain in the midst of those belonging to his company and in a similar gradation to the corporal whose allotment is        square yards in time of peace they are called out to exercise three weeks in every year at which time the landholder is obliged to transport the man and his baggage and defray his expenses during his stay they are also exercised in small parties every sunday after service if it be time of war when these troops are marched out of the kingdom the crown pays the men and receives the contribution from the landholders in      the army consisted of     00 regular troops and     00 militia in the whole     00 men the kings bodyguard consists of a troop of halbardiers and amounts to     men who all rank as cornets  marshal who was there in    0 says the army was welldisciplined and sufficient for the defense of the kingdom against any force that is likely to march against it for that sweden has nothing to fear but from russia but conset who saw an encampment of swedish soldiers in      says they made a very indifferent military appearance from the awkwardness and apparent want of discipline he took them for some newraised lapland militia he took a view also of the swedish ordnance which were then exercising for a review and says it would be too humiliating to draw a comparison between what he saw and the english artillery the soldiers in general looked old and inactive their regimentals are bad and unbecoming especially those of the officers which are both whimsical gaudy and ridiculously ornamented with ribbons dyed feathers etc  wraxball was present at a review in      and gives the following account of it it was at abo in finland in a large park about an english mile without the gates of the city a place from its irregularity of ground finely adapted for a martial entertainment the rising parts of it are covered with small woods of fir and it is divided by a branch of die lake meler over which is a floating bridge the king of sweden commanded about two regiments mostly infantry his younger brother had under him near  000 troops horse and foot they were entirely ignorant of each others motions his majesty only endeavoring to surround the inferior army and the prince exerting his endeavors to effect a secure retreat the king dressed in his uniform was mounted on a creamcoloured horse and appeared as much animated and interested in this essay of arms as he could have been on a day of battle it was about five in the evening on the   st of june when it began i cannot pretend to pursue the two generals says he through their different maneuvers which passed in too rapid a succession and were of two intricate and uncertain a nature to admit of a minute description the result was however favorable to the king his brother having neglected to seize on a post which might have commanded a retreat found his error too late and when he would have availed himself of this passage discovered that his rival troops were already in possession of it having crossed the river in boats for that purpose after having endeavored in vain to force them from this post he formed his infantry into a hollow square and maintained a brisk fire on all sides for a considerable time but finding himself surrounded by a much superior body of forces and no possibility of escape he delivered up his sword to the king and his soldiers became prisoners of war his cavalry had however seized on a small but most advantageous spot and unterrified by the fate of their companions refused to surrender and demanded permission to march off the ground with all military honors and their fate was not decided when mr wraxhall left die spot at    oclock at night it was he says a very elegant and gallant diversion finely adapted to cultivate and practice the operations of a campaign and keep alive the knowledge of war even in the midst of profound peace  their principal magazines of arms are at stockholm and the castle of jioncoping toward the confines of denmark there are no fortified places in the heart of sweden except the castle of jioncoping but there are some on the frontiers particulaily in finland  their rocks are a better defense then either walls or bastions it is but guarding their passes and no enemy can penetrate far into their country on the frontiers toward norway there are some little forts and the castle of bohus situated on a rock in the midst of a deep river a little above the city of gothenburg at the entrance of the sound with the town that lies upon the sea opposite denmark and in one place is not more than four miles across are places of strength carlscroon where the royal navy is laid up and calmer upon the eastern coast over against the island of oeland are fortified there are two small forts at the entrance of the harbor of stockholm and on the north they are sufficiently covered by the snowy mountains of lapland  the waroffice or college has the direction of the military forces etc an academy has been erected for instructing young gentleman in fortification etc a college of invalids is founded at wadstena for    fieldofficers    subalterns and    privates who are there provided with every necessary besides these above  00 fieldofficers as many subalterns and  000 privates have pensions  sweden abounds in all kinds of naval stores and has a navy distributed in three ports carlscroon gottenburg and stockholm the whole fleet in      consisted of about  0 ships of the line including those of  0 guns and    frigates besides galleys prames and xebecs but as several were out of repair they could only be reckoned at  0 ships of the line and  0 frigates  the seamen belonging to government are registered and amount to    000 some of these receive pay in money and others are supported as the national militia by small allotments of land in the islands and on the sea coasts of these    000 sailors only  000 are experienced seamen the rest are mere peasants but in emergencies the sailors of merchantmen are pressed in exchange for registered seamen  sweden is not only divided into counties and provinces but the whole kingdom is again divided into    governments over each of which is placed a landshofding or governor like our lord lieutenant and sheriff to him the execution of the judicial sentences is committed the collection of the revenue in his government and the care of the forests and crown lands  the supreme court of justice is a court of appeal from other civil courts where the matter in dispute amounts to  0 l and upwards there is a court under this and in every corporation and district there is a court of justice with a standing or continued jury of    men to decide all facts and in every diocese they have an ecclesiastical court  they have four superior national courts called hofraett one at stockholm for sweden proper one at lindoping for gothland one at abo for south finland and another at vasa for north finland and no sentence of death passed by an inferior court can be carried into execution unless ratified by these tribunals  the inferior tribunals are a kind of assizes held three times a year under the county judges and the    standing jurymen are    peasants appointed for life seven of whom form a court the judge in criminal cases asks their opinion but they are generally so ignorant as to give a verdict agreeable to the opinion of the judge and so little are they thought of that any man remarkable for his indolence and inattention is commonly said to be as sleepy as a juryman  lawsuits about property are soon decided for all sales and mortages of estates are registered nor is a lawsuit very expensive the greatest charge is their stamped paper on which the process is written from   d to   s a sheet according to the value of the matter in dispute every man may plead his own cause no counsel is admitted indeed so contemptible is the practice of the law that no gentleman will undertake it  the usual modes of execution are beheading and hanging every capital convict may petition the king and so mild are the penal laws that several offenses which in other countries are considered as capital are punished here by whipping never to exceed   0 stripes feeding on bread and water for    days imprisonment and hard labor here is no torture and all prosecutions for crimes are carried on at the public charge  duelling where one of the parties is killed is punished with the death of the survivor and if neither fall both suffer two years imprisonment pay a fine of  000 crowns and live the two years on bread and water the national courts act as courts of honor and when any one has received an affront usually order the offending party to beg pardon publicly  chap vii of swedish lapland i have already spoken of swedish lapland in the first volume of this work but shall take this opportunity of saying that since the plates were engraved for that volume i have been able to a procure more accurate description of the reindeer a drawing of which from life is given in the view of the entrance to the city of upsal  mr conset has also favored us with the translation of a lapland song which is presumed my readers will be pleased with there are two elegant odes in no     and  0  of the spectator but they do not disgrace the following the snows are dissolving on tornaos rude side and the ice of lulhea flows down the dark tide thy dark stream oh lulhea flows freely away and the snowdrop unfolds her pale beauties to day far off the keen terrors of winter retire and the norths dancing streamers relinquish their fire the suns genial beams swell the buds on the tree and enna chaunts forth her wild warblings with glee the reindeer unharnessd in freedom shall play and safely over odns steep precipice stray the wolf to the forests recesses shall sly and howl to the moon as she glides through the sky then haste my fair luah oh haste to the grove and pass the sweet season in rapture and love in youth let our bosoms in extacy glow for the winter of life never a transport can know   the accounts given by mr coxe and conset who were there lately confirm those we have already given of course shall refer my readers to them observing only with respect to the reindeer that they castrate them when young that they are weak in the back and cannot carry any great weight that they can rarely draw more than one person in a sledge that they will travel almost the whole day without food and that their common pace is about four miles an hour if pressed they will go from  0 to    english miles a day but such hard drawing generally destroys them  in the deserts between tornao and cape nord m maupertuis tells us that when he was there in july      he was much tormented with great flies with green heads that at this time of the year they are so insufferable as to drive the laplanders and their reindeer from their habitations to seek shelter on the seacoasts these flies fetch blood wherever they fix at the foot of the mountain horrilaeo they were still more merciless and were not to be driven off with smoke for the natives defend themselves from these flies by great fires these insects continues he poisoned our victuals also no sooner was a dish of meat served up but it was covered with them whilst another swarm with all the rapaciousness of birds of prey were fluttering about to carry off some pieces of mutton that were dressing for us  a word or two on their lapland magic and i have done motraye having seen a good deal of their tricks says if there is any such science as magic it must not be looked for among the laplanders who labor under the grossest ignorance the magic ascribed to these people has ever been looked upon as supernatural and diabolical though it appears to be nothing more than a feigned enthusiastic fit accompanied with some strokes on their drum and other trifling ceremonies motraye thinks it may be said of these enchanters as a famous physician said of a woman who pretended to be possessed much is owing to nature more to design but nothing at all to the devil when the laplanders were first seen at a distance clothed from head to foot in hairy skins it revived the antiquated fables of fawns and satyrs especially as they seemed to fly from those who approached them and might with some propriety be said to have wings upon their feet for with their wooden skidders they skid over the snows and ice swifter then the fleetest horse can run and to this day they fly from men they see in a strange dress how natural was it for persons then who first visited this country though but moderately tinctured with superstition to look upon the natives as creatures of another species and with the additions which their fancies might create as inhabitants of another world or at least conversant with those of the lower regions though at this day we find them to be men like ourselves differing from us only in their habits and some other circumstances occasioned by their situation as the difference of the climate and so on  though many princes and ecclesiastics have shown themselves very zealous for the extirpation of witchcraft and have upon incompetent evidence condemned some poor wretches to suffer for this pretended crime yet none could ever yet demonstrate that they entertained any commerce with the devil there have been those who would have given themselves to the devil in the most solemn manner in hopes of finding their account in it and have been convicted of the intention but none of them ever succeeded in their design for example baron l  s a danish officer who was in prison some years since at stockholm on a charge of having sold himself by contract to the devil on condition he would direct him how to procure a sum of money which he wanted and to that end had with his own blood signed a bond by which he and some others of his necessitous companions transferred their souls to satan after their death on condition that he would be propitious to them in this particular but neither the baron nor any of his friends finding any benefit by the conveyance they had made of themselves to the old gentleman though they went in the night to gibbets and buryingplaces to invoke and treat with him on this head one of them observing that no voice was heard or apparition approached to deliver them from their distress determined to do for himself what the devil would or could not do for him and accordingly soon after robbed and murdered a man for which he was apprehended and executed when he confessed the arts they had used as above to supply their necessities and the original bond was found torn to pieces in baron l  s chamber  a map of denmark map of denmark  a descriptive account of denmark from molesworth busching marshall coxe wraxhall and others chap i of the country etc if we consider the extent of the dominions of the king of denmark we may reckon him one of the greatest in europe but if we look to the importance and value of them the kingdom may be considered as even less than portugal  his titles are king of denmark and norway of the goths and vandals duke of sleswick and holstein stormar and ditmarsh earl in oldenburgh and delmenhurst all which countries he actually possesses either in whole or in part so that except the title of the goths and vandals equally enjoyed by the king of sweden and which the crown of denmark has retained ever since it was master of sweden as we in england do that of france all the rest are substantial titles  denmark is bounded on all sides by the sea except one small neck of land where it joins to holstein the german ocean washes it on the west and northwest the entrance into the baltic called the categate on the north and northeast the baltic on the east and river eyder on the south which is supposed to have been the boundary of the roman empire and which having its source very near the east sea takes its course westward and falls into the ocean at toningten a strong town of the duke of holstein gottorp so that if a canal was made about    english miles long from this river to kiel it would be a perfect island but in this account the duchy of holstein is not included one half of which belongs only to denmark and the other half to the duke of holstein gottorp  such a canal is now almost completed designed to form a junction between the baltic and german ocean from its beginning to the deep water in the river eyder into which it opens the distance is about  0 english miles the expense of this cut as it is undertaken by contract is about  00000 l the breadth of the canal at top is  00 feet at bottom    feet the lowest depth of water  0 feet and in the whole length there are six sluices common merchantmen of about   0 tuns burden will be here able to pass and save a long circuitous voyage round the extremity of jutland as may be seen by the map and in which vessels are liable to be detained by contrary winds indeed this roundabout navigation is so tedious that goods shipped at copenhagen for hamburgh are not unusually sent to lubec by sea and from thence by land to hamburgh but by this canal a vessel may pass immediately from the baltic into the german ocean and proceed without unloading to hamburgh or holland  all denmark as it is bounded lies in length between    degrees    minutes and    degrees    minutes north latitude its breadth is no where proportionable but at a large computation it may be reckoned twothirds the size of ireland  the kingdom of norway which belongs to the crown of denmark has been already treated of in the first volume of this work  holstein which includes ditmarsh and stormar is bounded by the duchy of sleswick on the north the duchy of saxe lawenburg on the southeast the river elbe on the southwest and the rest of it is washed by the german ocean and baltic sea it is between latitudes and       north  oldenburgh and delmenhurst are two counties in germany that lie together detached from all the territories of denmark the two rivers elbe and weser and the duchy of bremen interposing between them and holstein they are bounded on the northeast by the weser on the west by east friezland and the county of embden and on the south by part of the bishopric of munster they are a small territory of about    english miles in diameter the middle of which is in the latitude of    degrees  0 minutes  the rest of the king of denmarks territories not mentioned in the enumeration of his titles are the islands of faro iceland and greenland in the north sea the islands of st thomas st john and st croix with some of the cbbe islands in the west indies the town of tranquebar with its territories and the island of nicobar on the coast of coromandel in asia and the citadel of christianburg on the coast of guinea in africa the north sea islands have been described in vol i the colonies detached will be spoken of hereafter we shall now only speak of what is properly called denmark which consists of two large and several small islands with the peninsula of jutland  jutland is the largest and most fertile country but the islands are more considerable on account of their situation particularly zealand because copenhagen the capital of the empire is thee seated and the famous passage of the sound is bordered by its shore i will begin then with zealand  zealand is the largest of all the danish islands it is nearly of a circular form and is about  00 english miles round the soil is fertile producing no breadcorn except rye but yields plentiful crops of fine oats and barley there are but few meadows in it and yet there is no want of good hay most of their grass which is short and sure growing by the sides of their cornfieldsd or in scattered spots of marshy grounds it has no rivers nor above half a score brooks capable of turning a mill but to supply the deficiency of water there is a great number of fine lakes sufficiently stored with fish a gentleman remarkable for his wit speaking of this island replied in french to mr wraxhall who asked him if the country was pleasant and agreeable monsieur il ny a sur cette isle ni montagne ni riviere mais pour des lacs grace a dieu il y en assez it is very flat but well scattered with woods of oak and beech and cultivated with great industry by the great number of tumuli scattered on all sides says mr wraxhall i thought myself sometimes on some of the wiltshire or hampshire downs these tumuli resemble in size and appearance those in england and are probably ancient saxon sepulchers but this is only conjecture as none of them have been opened there are also and likewise in sleswick and holstein several collections of stones set up in a circular form some of which are very large and resemble those at stonehenge in wilts though on a smaller scale of the origin of which the danes are totally ignorant  mr coxe observed many such in the west gothland in sweden between lalange and lidkioping some in a rough state a few hewn flat and broad and others resembling pillars pointed at top in the rudest manner the peasants in sweden call them gothic stones and say they were erected by the goths whom they represent as a race of giants formerly inhabiting these countries  the whole island is divided into    distinct counties called ampts or prefectures and contains two cities copenhagen and roskild  the air in and about copenhagen is but indifferent owing to its low situation and the frequent fogs yet owing to the pureness of their firing which is beechwood colds of the lungs are very rare near a fourth part of zealand is forest lying open for the kings hunting and his game flags wildboars roebucks etc the face of the land is pleasant in many places abounding with little hills fine verdure woods and lakes with a very agreeable diversity for seaports that most excellent one of copenhagen must make amends for want of them not only in this but among other of the islands there being few others capable of harboring a vessel of  00 tons burden but this is not a sensible want as there are no commodities in this island to export  here and in all denmark are but two seasons of the year winter and summer spring and autumn are seldom known the spring never there is an immediate transition from heat to cold and from cold to heat during the three months of june july and august the heat is much more intense than in england and very sultry in the night but it is a gloomy heat an interposition of thick vapors being perceived before the sun in copenhagen for these three months they are plagued with flies which they endeavor to destroy by a poisoned water in the laying of which in their kitchens and chambers whole bushels of red flies may be swept together in one room  the next island to zealand in size is funen the diocese of funen includes the islands of langeland laaland falster and some others it has two governors funen and langeland are under the one laaland and falster under the other  the island of funen lies between the great and little belt is according to busching  0 geographical miles long and nine broad his geographical mile is about six miles english it is so fertile and pleasant that most of the noble families in the kingdom have resided here for many years the lands are as well cultivated as in most of the counties in england some enclosed with low neatly kept hedges and the open parts all under tillage  funen has no mountains or rocks but consists of gentle hills and declivities with fine spreading vales some of the higher grounds prettily topped with woods and there being many rivulets the whole country is beautiful and resembles many agreeable tracts in england there is plenty of good pastures and meadows and numerous herds of black cattle and hogs the capital city of this diocese is odense in funen  langeland is seven geographical miles long from north to south and one broad very fertile and is a county of itself containing seven parishes  laaland is seven and a half geographical miles long and three broad and is the most fertile spot in all denmark but as the country lies low the soil is damp and the air unwholesome the nobility here are numerous and have very fine seats and large estates  the island of falster in soil etc resembles the two described above it is six geographical miles long three wide in the north and only one toward the south and is two leagues distant from zealand it may be called the orchard of denmark for it yields abundance of fruit and all sorts of game this island is commonly the dowry of the queens of denmark it has a medicinal spring  amack is a small island joined to the city of copenhagen by two bridges one of these a drawbridge it is a geographical mile and a half in length or according to coxe four english miles long and two broad quite level without woods except a few thickets as the soil is so uncommonly rich and fertile it is considered as the kitchengarden and storehouse of the city it is laid out in gardens and pastures the inhabitants supplying copenhagen market twice a week with vegetables milk butter and cheese it is divided into two parishes and peopled with about  00 families the descendants of some north hollanders invited to settle here by christian ii in      at the request of his queen who was a native of the netherlands and who were brought here to make butter and cheese for the court the island contains nine villages  the amackers still retain the habit language and custom of their predecessors with all their cleanliness and industry nor will they intermarry with the danes their district is a medley of low dutch german and danish and the ministers speak in low dutch as well as danish part of the city of copenhagen called christian shafen stands on the isle of amack the inhabitants have their own inferior tribunal but in capital offenses are amenable to the kings court of justice at copenhagen the old national friezland habit is still in use amongst them it resembles the habit of the ancient quakers as represented in the pictures of the dutch and flemish painters the men wear broad trimmed hats black jackets fall glazed breeches of the same color loose at the knee and tied round about the waist the women are in black jacket and petticoats with a piece of blue glazed cloth bound on their heads  jutland part of the ancient cimbrica chersonesus is the largest part of the kingdom and may be computed at two thirds of the whole it is divided into two stifts  or principal governments this and the duchy of sleswick form a peninsula the north part of which is jutland it is    geographical miles long and from between    to  0 broad and of all the territories belonging to denmark yields the greatest revenue the middle part of it excepting a few spots of arable land is nothing but heath and moor which however afford good pasture for oxen sheep and goats but the other parts which are of greater extent are exceedingly fertile the inhabitants annually exporting large quantities of grain to sweden norway and holland and also lean oxen bacon and hogs so that jutland is called the land of bacon and ryebread it yields also great plenty of seafish and riverfish having many fresh water lakes the chief bgs and gulf are on the east side of the peninsula and of these the principal is the gulf of lym called lymsurt which runs from the categate  0 geographical miles into land widening as it goes and forming many small islands it is navigable and abounds with fish and as the west side of jutland is separated from the north sea only by a narrow tract of land there are other gulphs that form good harbors  jutland is every where interspersed with hills and eminencies and on the east with fine woods of oak beech fir birch etc but the west side not being so woody the inhabitants burn turf and heath for fuel here is also great plenty of game the air is rather keen and cold the jutlanders are of a robust vigorous constitution and resolute temper and seem to have raised themselves to a state of freedom superior to that of the other inhabitants of denmark many of the jutland peasants have freeholds for which they pay only a small acknowledgment to the lord of the manor and the public taxes but the danish language is spoken here with less purity and elegance than in the other provinces and the jutlanders have also a particular accent it has four chief cities aalborg wiborg aarhuus and ripen which are all bishops sees  the duchy of sleswick is called south jutland it is divided from the duchy of holstein and consequently from the german empire by the rivers eyder and lewens which are its south boundaries has the baltic on the east the north sea on the west extends from rensburgh to koldingen about    geographical miles in length and in breadth from eight to    it is a fiat country and plentifully supplied with corn cattle and fish  the inhabitants are a mixture of danes juts lower saxons and friesians besides these there are hollanders settled in frederickstadt and flemings in northstrand which occasions a variety of dialects in this country the german language is spoken in many places and divine service is performed in high dutch  lutheranism is the prevailing religion in this duchy except at frederickstadt where all sects are tolerated on the island of nordstrand the roman catholics have a parish church and a chapel  the island of nordstrand lies on the north sea and was formerly three danish miles long and a mile broad it was inhabited by savage friesians contained    parishes and abounded in cattle and corn it has been ever subject to inundations but on the   th of october      about  0 at night the whole island was overflowed and the impetuosity of the waves was so great that   0  persons      houses  0 windmills six steeples and  0000 head of cattle were washed away by the sea in eiderstedt besides     houses involved in the same ruin   0  persons   00 head of cattle and      sheep and hogs perished at the same time of all nordstrand nothing now remains but one small parish which owed its safety to the height of its situation  it must be remarked as a great natural defect of the kingdom of denmark that throughout the whole there is not one river navigable for vessels of any considerable burden unless we reckon the elbe which is rather the boundary of the kingdom than belonging to it  that part of the duchy of sleswick which runs from rensburgh through sleswick to hadersleve from whence we cross the little belt which is nine english miles over this part of the duchy is well cultivated is in general flat and open but occasionally exhibits variegated landscapes of heath arable land and pasture enclosed with quickset hedges and studded with beech and oak the farms have an appearance of great neatness and there are many ranges of new cottages lately erected at the expense of the crown for colonists these cottages are spacious and resemble those of westphalia containing under the same roof a large barn with divisions for cattle and two rooms at the further end for the family each family is supplied with ploughs carts and other necessary implements of husbandry two horses and a pension for three years  marshall traveled through the whole peninsula of jutland and found very little waste land the whole under cultivation and on enquiry was informed that the nobility reside in castles of their own and are all cultivators of their own land by means of peasants who are generally in a state of villainage at hodsedburgh he says he had the accident to break his chaise but count roncellen the owner of a neighboring castle being in sight and on horseback rode up to him and invited him after some enquiries to his chateau saying he would send his smith to repair it for smiths and wheelers in this country are scarce except in the larger villages  at this noblemans house he was very hospitably entertained and as it will give my readers some insight into the disposition of the people and though a digression relieve him from dry description i will relate what mr marshall saw and learned in his own words  when we arrived says he at the castle the count carried me through several large rooms to one where his breakfast equipage was spread and introduced me to his friends all the company spoke french breakfast was presently served and consisted only of coffee and milk and water gruel for the count which seemed to  regular diet in conversation he told me that the nobility and gentry of large fortunes cultivated their own estates though of great extent that he had let some farms in the english way but the chief of his estate was in his own hands i was with him some days and he took me round his domain in the course of our ramble we reached the confines of a little town on the side of a hill in a siul spot with a river at the bottom of the declivity of this town said the count i have built every house at my own expense and filled them with manufacturers we entered it he showed me the fabrics which he had established they were chiefly of wool a great number of spinners combers and weavers who made a coarse cloth worn by the poor of this country the manager of the works was an englishman whom the count had brought with him from england he informed me he had  00 hands employed in woollen goods alone that he wrought up all the sorts of clothing which found a ready market there he said the profits arising from this manufactory were small as to him but they were no object they paid all the expenses of the buildings he had erected and he was a clear gainer of the number of people whom he had thus settled on his estate and who consumed the produce of his land  he had also another manufactory of leather having erected several tanneries which prepared the hides for manufacturing into doublets breeches boots stockings and shoes of these artists he employed hear  00 and sound a quick sale for their manufacture and more profitable than his woollen manufacture he next showed me his fabric of turnery ware he had laid in large stocks of beechwood elm hornbeam holly etc and had established many artists in this way wooden dishes platters cups saucers bowls scoops etc things in common use amongst the villagers of these he had   0 employed he had also a small linenmanufactory which employs about  0 hands working up coarse linen for sheets shirts etc and which was when he was there in      and    0 very much on the increase  not one of this patriotic noblemans works so much pleased him as his manufactories of iron of these he worked all sorts of implements in common use whether for the furniture of houses or domestic utensils machines for artists such as wheelwrights carpenters blacksmiths as also all implements for husbandry and all these in great numbers for which he found a ready vent in this iron fabric he employed more than  00 men  in all these manufactories he employed more than  000 persons and the success of them has proved so great as to fix above  000 inhabitants in the town he built for them which consists of  00 houses the streets are laid out very regularly intersecting each other at right angles in the center is a large marketplace and in the midst of it a small but neat church the whole town is well paved the houses are but small but all built with brick and tiled which make a regular and good appearance  the bricks and tiles are burnt in adjoining kilns belonging to the count and the timber is cut in his own forests so that his expenses were very small to what they would have been in other circumstances but notwithstanding this in the course of    years since he began these works he had expended   000 ducats or near   000 l sterling this account includes the church the paving of the town and the erection of the works and buildings for the several manufactories abovementioned besides the houses and shares of houses for some persons advanced part of the money toward building their own exclusive of this expense he had been employed three years in erecting a handsome bridge over the river a wharf on the banks of it with warehouses for merchandise and dry and wet docks for buildings barges and decked sloops on the river the tide flows up to the town though at a considerable distance from the sea and the count among his noble plans has schemed the fixing a trade at it this town is situated between pallisberg and winguard the river falls into the gulf that ringshopping stands on but he has been employed in cutting a canal about two miles long to gain a better navigation into a bay to the northward near wosberg by this means he hopes to navigate brigs of  00 tons whereas at present    0 he had only five sloops each of  0 tons these he wholly employs himself in bringing materials for his manufactures from the baltic england and holland his bridge wharfs docks and warehouses he calculates will cost him   000 ducats and his navigation above  000  i do not remember continues our author ever receiving so much pleasure from viewing these great and noble exertions of princely magnificence infinitely exceeding all the costly ornaments which in some countries are given to the seats of the great they reflect immortal honor on the worthy count who has the spirit thus to prosecute the noblest works which europe can exhibit other noblemen in denmark have fortunes equal to this illustrious count in england we have fortunes double and treble to his but where are we to find an expenditure of a great estate that reflects equal luster on the owner mr marshall may well say this  in england a great fortune is dissipated in horseracing women and gaming without either benefit to the possessor or the country belonging to him  the beginning of all my undertakings said that illustrious nobleman i ever find the most difficult in establishing the woollen manufactury i had infinite trouble at first in opening a regular channel through which i could receive the wool for our own was so bad that i could scarce use any of it and next to get people used to the different branches from picking and sorting for the spinners quite to the weavers most of the people i procured from germany and flanders but a few who proved more useful to me than all the rest from scotland and two or three from england to all these people i have been obliged to give large salaries to build them good houses and put up with many irregularities but i was indefatigable in making my own people learn of them what they could perform and the best way of doing this i found was to give premiums to foreigners for every hand they made perfect in each branch of work several of these persons are dead and i have not taken any pains to recruit their number for my danes are now many of them as expert as their masters i have however very often straggling parties of germans who come to ask work which i never fail giving them and building houses for them if they continue in the mind of settling but as i still mean to attempt new manufactures i must have recourse to other countries for a few hands to instruct us  from the first outset of my undertaking i found it necessary to unite the character of merchant and manufacturer for had it not been for the possession of a little shipping which supplied me with the materials i wanted i should never have been able to have brought my works to the height at which they have now arrived my sloops are strong and well built and would run without danger or difficulty even to the mediterranean if i had occasion to send them with the advantage of coming up into the very heart of my town i once had a brig of  00 tons but finding this vessel inconvenient i parted with her and now confine myself to sloops i have a dutch shipcarpenter who builds them for me and he has six danes who work under him i have also two herring busses on the stocks with which i purpose attempting the herringfishery having engaged three dutch fishermen used to barrelling if i meet with success i shall increase my number of busses and when my canal is completed i will build some larger sloops and a brig or two of  00 tons to carry the product of my fishery up the streights and bring back salt in return  my great object is to make every part of my general plan unite to form one whole by rendering each division of it the support of another all these works have a wonderful efficacy in increasing the people on my estate though not a hut was standing in this place    years ago there are now above  000 inhabitants my buildings increase considerably every year i have a great number of brick and limeburners masons smiths and carpenters that do nothing else but build houses for newcomers this work regulates all the rest it is the first i provide cash for and what i can spare from this i expend on the other works i built    houses last year and the number this year will be near  0 and from the applications i have received i apprehend i shall next year build more than  0 i will next show the effect this population has had upon my husbandry  the extent of this noblemans estate is nine english miles one way and more than four another but somewhat indented it is a fine variegated country of hill and dale with some mountains well watered with rivers streams and lakes and part of it nobly spread with exceeding fine timber  on riding over the estate i found not only the valleys under high cultivation but the sides of the hills with great numbers of farmhouses and cottages the inhabitants of which seemed as easy cheerful and happy as if they had been resident in england they all appeared pleased with the presence of their lord and esteem him as their master and father when i came to this estate said the count i found it farmed by my fathers bailiffs and vassals but soon discovering these bailiffs to be rascals i turned them all out disposed of the land to such industrious and saving people as were then on the estate and to whom i let farms according to their ability of living and stocking i did not leave them totally to the customs of their own country but procured husbandmen and implements from flanders gave premiums to the best ploughmen and to those who produced the greatest crops and best adapted to wintering of cattle so that i have improved my lands and made these bring in a rent of    s english per acre that when i first became possessed of were waste tracks this is wholly owing to the market occasioned by my new colony which has not only enriched me but every tenant on my estate  the waste tracks i manage thus i allow the farmers the expense of enclosing whatever they like to take contiguous to their farms provided they take no more land than they keep well cultivated and i take no rent for such fields for five years after this they pay me for them about half the value which continues as long as the improver lives but on his death i raise it to the full value these terms they think so reasonable that there is not a peasant among them but what makes a small addition every year and others who get or save money have new farms on the same terms paying me in addition interest for the money i expend in buildings for them i am very attentive to these new tracts of cultivated land to see that they do not neglect them for i never suffer a piece of land once enclosed to remain untilled and as i see my town and people increase annually a ready market is found for the produce of these new enclosures  where i found land very stony or boggy lest the apparent sterility of such lands should discourage my tenants from taking them i was at half the expense of removing the stones or draining the bogs or advanced money for their doing it this has induced them to surmount all difficulties and i have the pleasure to contemplate that several tracts of rich meadow worth    s per acre were reclaimed from a bog worth nothing  my readers will naturally with me look upon this very patriotic nobleman rather as a being of romance a vision of perfection than a real instance of so many public and private virtues mr marshall is very minute and particular in his account of the manner in which this gentleman proceeded and if any man of large fortune and domain should catch fire from this abridged state of it and wish to imitate it i will refer him to the author from whom i took it marshalls travels through denmark  the land which the count kept in his own hands was originally the worst part of his whole estate finding no person inclined to farm it he undertook it himself it spreads every way for three or four miles round his town and is now the richest land of the whole  in all the improvements said the count to mr marshall which i have made on my estate by letting my lands to the peasants i have adhered strictly to the rule of proceeding on the very contrary conduct which is common among ninetenths of the nobility of the kingdom they keep their tenants as poor and humble as possible i on the contrary do every thing to enable them to enrich themselves and would rather inspire them with the manly boldness of the poor in your country than keep them in the slavery of ours my peasants grow daily into wealthy farmers and are all in easy and happy circumstances they marry and beget numerous posterities the population of my estate increases and with the people the general markets for products which i have all along aimed at and which is just so much clear gain in my pocket i have not a man on my estate that is not profitable to me in some way or other and it is incredible how quick they increase there is not such a thing as a marriageable man or woman on it that is unmarried every man and woman that applys to me for a house are sure of having one built for them if i know them to be of good character and industrious and they have all a small piece of land and are cheerful and contented in such a situation marriages must abound and the people increase in a manner which no part of europe has any idea of among all my people there is not one that is burdensome to the rest no old peasant or labourer but what has saved enough before he grew old to live happily in his latter days very few but what become little farmers before they are too advanced in life and in a state which their relations would think it shameful to let them want their assistance  the example of my own estate continued the count proves to me that nothing is wanting to make a country populous and consequently rich but giving the people an object for their industry to work upon the most idle will of themselves be converted to industry if their industry is beneficial to them and they have no dependence on any thing else no people are naturally more indolent then the common people of denmark but in the most populous part of holland they are not more active and industrious than all the people on my estate which change has been effected merely by throwing them into the pursuit of gain and leaving them quietly to enjoy it the natural increase of mankind is prodigious when marriages are no burden but children riches  but i mean to bound my progress convinced that where land is cultivated to the utmost the cultivators themselves could not consume the produce it is necessary for the welfare of states that there should be a balance kept up between commerce and agriculture and that manufactures should be established to produce a market to carry off the surplus which the cultivators cannot consume themselves under this consideration when every part of my estate is fully improved and a market provided for all its products at a good price not a high one for extremes are not permanent i will neither build another house or another ship i will sit down content with that degree of success not having a doubt but it will be lasting because the agriculture manufactures and commerce will be balanced and dependant on each other exactly to the respective amount of each and as there will be no fabrics wrought but what are of universal demand and no commerce pushed on but what the fabrics employ and as all the people in each of these branches will be dependant for their provisions and necessaries on the track of culture around them and on no other all dangerous excess will be guarded against and a regular industry will maintain itself without being hurt by the acquisition of great riches  it is to be here remarked that in denmark the king as the clergy have here has the tenth of all landproducts and this in many parts of the kingdom is gathered in kind and sold by his superintendants but landlords may compound though the composition is generally high count roncellen always paid the composition rather than his tenants should be discouraged by this tax nor would he suffer his estate to be overrun by hunters so common in denmark  were our young nobility and gentry in england to apply themselves to agriculture they would render better service to their country and find their life more agreeable than that of arms the pay of which is utterly incompetent to the expensive life they are thus thrown into unlookedfor promotions make on the whole very poor amends for such a regular life of poverty but in husbandry if they gave an active attention to it they would find far better revenues with much less expensive life than any service can confer and at the same time the profession has nothing dishonorable in it and every exertion made would tend to promote in the highest degree the interest of their country  i will close this account says mr marshall with observing that count roncellens fortune is as considerable as the greatest estates in england and yet his way of living in the castle is not superior to that of an english gentleman of two or three thousand pounds a year his table was always well spread with plenty of every thing that was in season but then his own estate produces every thing but sugar spices and wine he has river and seafish in great perfection his forest yields him venison and game and other parts of his land plenty of wild fowl all which with the cultivated products afford ample materials for a regular table in his wines he is by no means expensive and his dress comparatively speaking costs him nothing all his revenue therefore which increases much every year is expended as fast as it comes in in the noble undertakings of which i have given an account such an expenditure does as much benefit to the state as honor to himself and is a way of laying out a great income that can never be sufficiently praised  perhaps also it is as full of enjoyment as any other disposition of it can be let us suppose an english nobleman of thirty or forty thousand pounds a year living in the usual course of dissipation electioneering and gaming and you will ever see in them a species of remorse and distrust at the cramped situation which successive mortgages bring on and if the income is exceeded the expenditure of it gives but a momentary pleasure and never a lasting satisfaction but on the contrary let us picture to ourselves a nobleman spending such an income the year round upon the spot that yields it to him in building planting improving wastes making roads cutting canals establishing manufactories opening harbors attracting commerce in a word executing such noble works as count roncellen has been employed in and i think that such an employment of a great fortune must be infinitely superior in selfsatisfaction and enjoyment to the other disposition of it this alone insures an increase and adding every day to a mans wealth at the same time that every shiliing he makes is more beneficial to the community than to himself  chap ii of the cities etc the chief cities of denmark are copenhagen elsinore and roskild in zealand odensee in funen wiborg in north jutland and sleswick in south jutland but i will speak of each in their turn  copenhagen is the capital of the empire it lies in the baltic or east sea in    degrees  0 minutes north latitude about five geographical miles from the sound its situation is marshy and low but on the landside there are several beautiful lakes which furnish the inhabitants with plenty of fresh water the environs are very pleasant and directly opposite to the city lies the fertile isle of amack forming the harbor at a distance the city makes a magnificent appearance according to lord molesworth who wrote in the beginning of this century and is nearly equal in size to bristol as it plan of the city of copenhagen references a new palace b royal palace c warton hospital d st peters church e the university f st marys church g the royal college h rosenburg palace and garden i fredericks church k academy of royal cadets l fredericks hospital m botanic garden n octagon or fredericks palace o garrison church p charlottenburgh palace q kings new market r st nicholass church s bremerholm church t the exchange u the dock yard w fredericks church x st saviors church   map of copenhagen was then but was increasing annually as bristol has done it is the best built city says mr coxe in the north for although petersburgh excells it in superb edifices yet as it contains no wooden houses it does not display that striking contrast of meanness and magnificence it is surrounded on the land with regular ramparts and bastions a broad ditch full of water and a few outworks its circumference measures between four and five english miles the streets are well paved with a footway on each side but too narrow and inconvenient for general use the greatest part of the buildings are of brick and a few are of freestone brought from germany the houses of the nobility are in general splendid and constructed in the italian style of architecture the gother street which runs in a straight line across the whole city and divides the old from the new town is above   00 feet long the breadth of the kings market and the area about the new harbor included the city contains four royal castles ten parishes and nine other churches a considerable number of public and private palaces above  000 burghers houses several of which are inhabited by ten or more families eleven market and public places areas or squares     streets and  00000 inhabitants the metropolis is divided into three principal parts viz old copenhagen new copenhagen and christianhafen the last two are more modern then the first and are laid out in broad streets running in a straight line in the night the city is illuminated with lanthorns and the streets are kept clean at the yearly expense of  0 or   000 rix dollars  the most striking object is the harbor and naval arsenal it is capacious enough to hold  00 men of war and yet only one ship can enter at a time which entrance is defended by several batteries of great guns and there are several platforms near it with three forts there are no tides in the baltic but the depth of water in the harbor renders it perfectly secure for the greatest ships so that it is justy reckoned one of the best harbors in the world the kings fleet for this is the principal seaport in the kingdom lies regularly arranged between booms and over against them magazines with the name of each ship on the door of the storeroom belonging to it and every thing is kept in the completest order the admiralty is on the bank of the haven and the arsenal is well furnished with cannon and stores adjoining to these buildings is a citadel which commands the harbor  commerce according to coxe is here very busy the haven is always crowded with merchantships and the streets are intersected by broad canals which bring ships close up to the walls of the quays but mr wraxhall says though copenhagen is one of the finest ports in the world it can boast of little commerce and yet coxe and wraxhall are cotemporary writers wraxhall further says the public places are filled with officers either in the land or seaservice and they appear to constitute threefourths of the audience at the play and opera they have a danish comedy twice a week and an italian opera in the palace every saturday  the palace which was erected by christian vi and was finished in    0 is a large pile of building the front of stone and the wings of bricks stuccoed the suite of apartments is princely but the external appearance more grand than elegant  the round tower of trinity church says dr oliver who was there in the beginning of this century is a masterpiece of its kind and very singular it is round   0 feet high and  0 feet diameter being flat on the top and surrounded with an iron balustrade the ascent is spiral and without steps from the bottom to the top wide enough for two carriages and so easy that a coach and horses may go up and down again with ease this tower was originally designed for an observatory but it then served as a parade for the gentry when they had a mind to take the air in their coaches drove to the top round the ring and down again  the police of this city is well regulated and people may pass through any part of it at midnight with great safety the streets are as quiet at eleven oclock at night as in a country village or town and scarce a coach after this is heard to rattle through them  st saviors church is the most magnificent and elegant of all the churches in copenhagen it stands in christianhafen in the isle of amack and has a beautiful steeple with a spiral ascent to the top on the outside  between copenhagen and christianhafen is a high pillar erected in the middle of the water on which is a statue representing a naked female on her left side stands the figure of a swan which extends its long neck behind her back and bringing its head over the right shoulder of the statue sticks its bill in the mouth of it this pillar and statue are looked upon as a symbolical representation of the city of copenhagen  there is a noble foundation for the poor in this city called wartow hospital containing  00 beds for the sick and poor and every one besides his lodging has a rixdollar weekly a small commodious church stands close to the hospital and so contrived that the sick and bedridden may hear divine service and sermons in their beds  the royal palace called rosenburg in the west quarter of this city is a grand structure much too splendid and magnificent for a king of denmark and has some very extensive and ornamented gardens which in summer serve the inhabitants for a public walk the grand apartment of this palace is hung with tapestry representing the various actions by sea and land which diversified the ancient wars between the swedes and danes who seem always to have had the same national rivalship and animosity as between the french and english at one end of this apartment are three silver lions as large as life who by their fierceness and rudeness seem to characterise the age in which they were cast it is a kind of savage magnificence seldom seen in the banqueting rooms of the present effeminate and luxurious times in the museum of the palace which consists of eight rooms is a sword of charles xii of sweden the hilt and guard of brass and the blade four feet long and the chair in which tycho brahe the astronomer used to sit the collection of paintings is very large and contains some beautiful originals among a great variety of natural and artificial curiosities among the former are    a petrified child which was cut out of its mothers belly at sens in champagne in the year      where it was supposed to have lain    years it is evidently a human foetus says dr oliver who handled it its upper part is of a gypseus nature not so hard as the lower the thighs and buttocks being as hard and perfect stone as can be of a red color and of a grain and superficies exactly like those taken out of a bladder purchased from venice by frederick iii    two elephants teeth that weigh   0lb each    several heads of hares with diverse sorts of horns brought out of saxony    an egg said to be laid by a woman of the size of a pullets egg this ol wormius says was sent him by very good hands and confirmed by people of credit he tells us the woman brought forth two with the usual pains her neighbors being called in to her assistance the first they broke and found a yolk and a white as in that of a hen the second was kept and sent to him and is here preserved    several large pieces of silver ore dug in norway one of which weighed   0lb four feet six inches long and four feet round valued at  000 crowns the whole mass has not above a fourth part of any baser metal or earth mixed with it    the thigh bone of a human body three feet three inches long the head of it two feet   inches round and the middle    inches and a half about    two scollop shells weighing    lb each    a cherrystone on which some hundreds of heads are curiously engraved  besides the above there is in the gardens of the palace a throne made of unicorns horns on which all the kings of denmark are seated at their coronation  the royal library consists of a great variety of books in all languages well conditioned and well chosen the books of each country being placed by themselves the room is spacious and well built and has a large gallery supported by pillars on each side with the addition of gudiuss library from glucstadt it might be reckoned one of the first in europe  the annual list of births in copenhagen being on an average    0 and that of the deaths      we may compute that it contains near  0000 inhabitants  elsinoor lies about  0 miles from copenhagen is a seaport town directly opposite to helsingberg in sweden and separated from that by the sound or passage into the baltic which from town to town according to mr coxe is but three miles over and which he crossed though the wind was against him in an hour and a half from copenhagen across to malmoe in sweden is six or seven leagues  this town is remarkable for two things as being the scene of shakesperes hamlet and the place where queen matilda the sister of our king george iii of england was confined it is well built the houses are of brick similar to those in holland next to copenhagen it is the most commercial place in denmark it contains two churches and about  000 inhabitants amongst whom are a considerable number of foreign merchants and the consuls of the principal nations trading to the baltic to regulate the tolls paid by ships passing the sound of which i shall speak hereafter and to see that no injustice is done to their countrymen the passage of the sound is guarded by the fortress of cronberg situated on the edge of a peninsular promontory the nearest point of land from the opposite coast of sweden it is strongly fortified and every vessel that passes lowers her topsails and pays a toll the palace of cronberg which stands in the fortress is that in which the late unfortunate queen was imprisoned in january       adjoining to a royal hunting palace which stands half a mile from cronberg is a garden called hamlets garden and said to be the very spot where his father was murdered as this is a history that will from shakesperes play interest an english reader and as saxogrammaticus the danish historian who relates it is but in few hands and has never been translated some little account of this famous prince may not be unacceptable saxogrammaticus wrote in the   th century  hamlet was the son of gertrude a daughter of a king of denmark by a king of jutland who reigned before the introduction of christianity into that part of the world fengo murders his brother the king of jutland marries gertrude and ascends his throne hamlet his nephew and soninlaw struck with horror at this transaction to avoid his uncles jealousy feigns himself mad but fengo suspecting it tries by various means to get at the real state of his mind and among other attempts throws a young woman in his way in a retired place with directions if possible to extort from hamlet a confession of his madness but it did not succeed on this woman is grounded shakesperes ophelia another attempt of fengo was his quitting elsinoor and concerting hamlet in his mothers chamber a meeting between hamlet and his mother and ordering a courtier to conceal himself unknown to them behind the hangings of the room where they were to meet this man conceals himself in the queens apartment under a heap of straw which used formerly to be spread over floors as an article of luxury hamlet on entering the room suspecting the presence of some spy affects madness imitates the crowing of a cock beating his arms againsts his sides as a cock does his wings jumps on the heap of straw and feeling the man within concealed draws his sword and kills him then cut the body to pieces boiled it and gave it to the hogs after this he declared to his mother that he only affected to be foolish reproached her for her incestuous marriage with her husbands brother and murderer and thus recalls the queen to virtue fengo returns to elsinoor sends hamlet to england under the care of two courtiers and privately by a letter to the king of england requests him to put hamlet to death hamlet discovers this alters the letter by which means the two courtiers are put to death and hamlet is betrothed to the king of englands daughter the next year he returns to denmark where they understood he was dead and surprises his enemies he affects insanity again invites the principal nobles to an entertainment makes them drunk and in that state covers them with a large curtain which he pegged to the ground set fire to the palace and burnt them to ashes during this conflagration he flew to fengos apartment and put him to death the next morning when the populace assembled to view the ruins of the palace hamlet called together the remaining nobles harrangued them in a masterly speech proved his uncle to have been the murderer of his father and justified his own conduct his speech had the desired effect and he was proclaimed king with repeated acclamations  hamlet thus raised to the throne sails to england asks the king of englands daughter in marriage but is told she is dead and advised by the king to go to scotland and address the scotch queen hermetrude with a view that this lady who was of a cruel cast and abhorred all proposals of marriage might order him to be assassinated as she had done some others before but hamlet succeeds better marries her and returns with her to england and being there informed by the princess to whom he had been betrothed that her father meditated his death to avoid danger clothed himself in armor under his robe slew the king of england married the princess and sailed to denmark with his two wives but was soon after killed in a combat with his uncle by his mothers side  roskild was formerly the royal residence and metropolis of denmark and contained    churches and as many convents at present it is scarce half an english mile round and has not more than    0 inhabitants the houses are brick and look neat the only remains of its original grandeur are the ruins of the palace and the cathedral which is a brickbuilding with two spires and in which the kings of denmark are buried it was erected by harold vi king of england and denmark who died in   0 and is interred here indeed the church is full of monuments of succeeding kings  there is a spring of such fine wholesome water in this place that some is carried daily to copenhagen for the use of the court  odensee the capital of the isle of funen is a city of such high antiquity that danish antiquarians derive its foundation from oden the god of the gothic nations it contains about   00 inhabitants who carry on a trade in grain and leather is a bishopric and has four churches besides the cathedral the king has here a small palace  wiburg is the capital of north jutland is a bishops see and the residence of a generalgovernor this is one of the most ancient cities of the kingdom and had formerly    churches which are now reduced to three it has three marketplaces and    streets  sleswick is the capital of south jutland and is the residence of the governor and stateofficers it is situated in a most charming pleasant country and is built in the form of a crescent it is between two and three english miles in length and contains about    0 inhabitants the houses are of brick and in neatness and manner resemble a dutch town the inhabitants dress also like the dutch and many of them speak that language close to sleswick is the old palace of gottorp formerly the ducal residence but now inhabited by the governor prince charles of hesse cassel it is a large brickbuilding surrounded by a rampart and a moat the city had formerly seven parishchurches and six convents but now one can scarce trace out the places where many of them stood the cathedral is a grand structure both within and without but has neither steeple nor tower  there are many palaces in denmark fredericksburg is a magnificent structure situated on a hill a small distance from copenhagen it is spacious on all sides and has an exceeding fine prospect the garden which lies below the hill is very extensive and contains a great number of pleasant walks several groves a labyrinth a theater a great many statues fountains and summerhouses and a fine cascade from the palace the descent is by two flights of broad stonesteps to the garden in which is a menagery stocked with several uncommon animals lion tigers etc with an orangery and a yard with pheasants and falcons from this palace a pleasant avenue planted with a double row of trees extends half way to copenhagen to this account of busching we will add wraxhalls who describes it as a a large chateau moated round with a triple ditch it was founded by frederick the fourth it partakes of the greek and gothic styles but in the front of the grand quadrangle are tuscan and doric pillars and on the summit spires and turrets some of the rooms are splendid though furnished in the antique taste but it is little visited by the present family  jagersburg is a royal hunting seat where the hunting officers reside and where is a repository for all hunting implements the park is rather a wood or forest very extensive and full of game in the middle is an edifice called the hermitage  0 else long and  0 broad very elegantly decorated in the lowest story is a curious machine by which the dinner etc is conveyed up and down to and from the kings table in the second story  the palace of cronberg stands in the fortress of that place about  0 miles from copenhagen it is a square gothic building of freestone and was the prison of the late unfortunate queen matilda the sister of our present sovereign of england  chap iii of the people their customs and manners molesworth has been always considered as the most candid and accurate writer on the state of denmark at the time in which he wrote but this was near  00 years ago and marshall declares that almost every circumstance is so essentially changed since his time that little related by him can be depended upon as to the state of denmark at the present hour  by a numeration of the people in      the subjects of denmark norway holstein the islands in the baltic and the districts of oldenburgh and delmenhurst in westphalia amounted to     000 exclusive of the inhabitants of iceland greenland and the danish colonies  from all the opportunities says marshall which i have had of seeing and conversing with the danes and which i have done with all ranks they appear to be a brave courteous and humane people the upper class have a high spirit value themselves upon the titles and privileges they derive from the crown and are accordingly fond of show and magnificence they have as much vivacity as any people in europe except the french nobility and live in a mean between the english and the germans more sumptuous than the latter but not with such a general consistency as the former in their dress and even in their gallantry they endeavor to imitate the french though they are a complete contrast to that nation and the french language is universal among them in their houses they are not only expensive in the building them but also in furnishing them exceeding the germans but not equalling the english at their tables they resemble the germans in cookery but do not sit so long at their meals in germany four courses and a desert will take up four hours and a half which in england is dispatched in one hour but the danes seldom rise from table under two hours some of the nobility have french cooks and in their wines are expensive and curious their tables are well covered with fish of the best sorts abundance of wild fowl and fine venison but their butchersmeat is not equal to ours they have hothouses and hot walls fronted with glass and of course all the luxuries which these afford  in the second class of people there is a much greater difference between them and the same rank in england than between the danish and english nobility they are not so comfortable in their circumstances scarce any of the gentry are masters of such estates as to put them on a par with the nobles and of course they do not make a proportionable appearance  the lower class are still more inferior than the english and cannot be compared to the common people here either for ease or happiness yet they are by no means in that state of vassalage as they were in molesworths time several edicts having been published by the crown for restraining the ancient villenage and as to the common people in towns and cities they are as free as in other absolute dominions  in person the lower class is in general as well made and as stout as the germans they make good soldiers and with gentle usage are docile and tractable but in villages they are ignorant and clownish yet good husbandmen  the danish army finds employment for young men of small fortune the employments about court provide for others and many freely embark for the east and west indies are remarkable active and diligent and often return home with good fortunes the gentry seem extremely disposed to treat a stranger with every mark of urbanity and politeness but an englishman at court is at present received with great coldness  in their amusements the danes follow the fashions of the french and english cards lead the way and such ladies as can afford it have at copenhagen their assemblies almost as regularly as any in london the men are great chessplayers billiards and tenis are favorite diversions they have a french theater and a danish one where translations from the english and french are indifferently performed attempts have been made for an italian opera but with little success  copenhagen principally flourishes from the residence of the court which is much the most brilliant object in denmark there are many great officers of state which with the numerous inferior ones and the guards render the town very gay  molesworth gives us an account of the following customs and amusements which as they are not noticed or contradicted by later writers we may suppose still exist or with little alteration for we find in all countries provincial customs and festivities are preserved for ages and as they will enliven the scene i shall lay them before my reader  the ordinary diversions of the court are progresses which are made once a quarter at least to sleswick or holstein either to review the troops or inspect the fortifications at rendsburg these are no expense to the treasury as wagons and horses are found by the boors who also pay a personal attendance and are ready for all necessary services for five or six weeks every summer the court removes to jagersburg a small hunting seat situated on a small lake its foundation in the water not far from the sea and within four english miles of copenhagen and for five or six weeks more it resides at fredericksburg the chief countrypalace of the kings of denmark which has a fine park about it well filled with red deer embellished with fine ponds and lofty trees but yet it falls short of many of our noblemens countryseats in england at fredericksburg the court spends most of its time in staghunting when the king lays aside all formalities and eats and drinks freely with his domestics and after a hard days hunting they will often adjourn to the winecellar and there drink to excess about five or six in the afternoon the hunting assizes are solemnly held in the great court before the palace the stag is drawn into the midst of it by the huntsmen who are all clothed in red with great brass huntinghorns about their necks and is there broken up with great ceremony whilst the hounds attend with much noise and impatience one that is most likely to fee the huntsman best is invited to take essay and is presented with the deers foot then the proclamation is made if any one can inform the king who is both supreme judge and executioner of any transgression against the known laws of hunting that day committed let him stand forth and accuse the accused is generally found guilty and then two gentlemen lead him to the stag and make him kneel down between the horns turning down his head with his breech up and removing the danish hunting assizes skirts of his coat his majesty with a small long wand gives the offender some lashes on his posteriors whilst the huntsmen with their brass horns and the dogs with their loud openings proclaim the kings justice and the criminals punishment the queen ladies and others standing round in a circle as spectators this is as often repeated as there happens to be delinquents who as soon as the chastisement is over rise up and make their obeisance  proudly boasting of their magnificent ribroasting hudibras after all is over the hounds are permitted to fall to and devour the deer  at another season swanhunting is the royal pastime wild swans haunt a certain island not far from copenhagen and breed there about the time when the young ones are near as large as the old before their feathers are grown long enough to fly the king with the queen ladies and others of the court go to the killing of them the foreign ministers are usually invited to take part in this sport every person of condition has a pinnace allotted to him and when they come near the haunt they surround the place and enclose a great multitude of young swans which they destroy with guns till they have killed some thousands what is killed by the whole company is brought to the court which claims the feathers and down the flesh being good for nothing  on shrovetuesday the king queen royal family home and foreign ministers and stateofficers that compose the court clothe themseves in the habit of the north holland boors with great trunkhose short doublets and large blue thrumcaps the ladies in blue petticoats and odd headdresses etc and thus accoutred get up in their wagons a man before and a woman behind driving themselves and go to a countryvillage called amack about three miles from town where they dance to the sound of bagpipes and squeaking fiddles and have a countrydinner which they eat out of earthen and wooden platters with wooden spoons etc and having passed the day in these diversions where all are equal with little regard to majesty they return home at night in the same manner and are entertained at a comedy and magnificent supper and ball in the same dress as they wore the whole day  every winter as soon as the snow is firm enough to bear the danes take to their sledges for amusement the king and court first giving the example for so great a respect do they bear to majesty that they never cross a new bridge till the king has first crossed it nay all the clocks of copenhagen strike the hours after the court clock the court then first make their appearance in their sledges making several tours about town in great pomp with kettledrums and trumpets the horses which draw the sledges being richly adorned with trappings and harness full of small bells to give warning to such as stand in their way after the court has been thus abroad the burghers and others trot about the streets all night in their furgowns with each his female in the sledge with him and this they esteem a great and pleasant amusement  in traveling to fredericksburg jagersburg and many other places from copenhagen there are two high roads one for the people which is commonly bad and another for the king in good condition but others who can procure a key to the gates are indulged with passing on the latter  the vehicles says wraxhall for traveling are an indefinable somewhat begot by a coach upon a cart and partaking very much of both kinds are drawn by four little danish horses and what with whipping and spurring they make shift to travel about four english miles and a half an hour  it is a difficult matter says molesworth for strangers to find conveniences of lodging or eating in denmark even in copenhagen there are few if any lodgings to let in private houses and in the taverns a man must be contented to eat and drink in a public room with other company and at the same table  among all the hardships which are imposed on the peasantry of denmark says molesworth that of the obligation they lie under of furnishing the royal family and all their attendants with horses and traveling wagons is one of the greatest whenever the court travels the peasants that lie near the road or in that district are summoned to attend with their horses and wagons at certain stages where they are to relieve each other and this they often do always at their own expense for two or three days together no regard being had to the season which is generally harvesttime or to any other convenience of these poor wretches i have frequently seen them with hundreds of wagons in a company attending the arrival of the court bewailing their sad condition and as soon as their king comes up and his coaches with those of his attendants six or eight boors horses not much larger then calves are put to each coach and every lackey of the kings suite then seizes on a boor and wagon for his own use when unless the poor trembling peasant does every thing to please his employer by driving on and taking all patiently without a reply he is beaten and abused nor is this only the case when the king travels but when he pleases to grant his warrant to any officer or man of rank that has a journey to make  the tables of the better sort are generally well served but their meat is lean and excepting their beaf and veal illtasted wethermutton is very scarce and seldom good wild ducks scarcely eatable and plovers never here are no wild pheasants woodcocks rabbits or fallowdeer red deer are the kings game and not to be purchased hares however are good and their bacon is excellent seafish is scarce and not good but riverfish makes amends for all here being the best carp perch and crawfish that are to be found any where fine fruit so far north is not to be expected but the gentry who pride themselves in their gardens have such as is tolerable and have melons grapes peaches and all sorts of sallad very early their butter is good but their cheese indifferent and their cookery far from pleasing to an english palate  molesworth gives us the following account of the first green goose that was ever eaten in denmark he says that the common people are meanspirited and so inclined to cheating that they suspect others of doing the same so that if you offer them a great price for a thing which they have not been used to sell they will refuse to part with it suspecting that you see an advantage in the purchase as yet unknown to them and which they hope to find out seeing great flocks of green geese says his lordship in the fields near the town i sent to buy some but they not being used to sell or eat geese in that country till they are full grown could not be persuaded to part with one though double the price of a fullgrown goose was bid for it they inquired why we wished to buy them what we meant to do with them etc for they would not believe any one would be so foolish as to eat them whilst young and small however a week after an old woman to whom money had been offered for a dozen came and brought me four to sell saying that neither she nor her geese had thriven since she refused to sell them at a good price for a kite had the night before killed eight of her stock and that now the remaining four were at my service thus the superstition of this old woman occasioned the first green goose to be brought to market for after that they found the english fattened them and killed them for the table the market was never without them where they will ask the same price for stinking meat as for fresh for lean meat as for fat the sure way not to obtain is to seem eager to purchase and indeed among all classes of the people to ask a thing importunately is the certain method of not having it complied with though otherwise the person asked would be desirous of its being done  according to lord molesworth the king of denmarks court as to pomp and magnificence can scarcely be called a royal one the luxury and extravagance of southern courts had not in his time reached so far north in this court no ensigns of majesty appear let the occasion be ever so solemn except such as are military all those which a standing army can afford such as horse and footguards trabans which answer to our beefeaters kettledrums and trumpets etc are there in perfection and in use every day as much as in camp but badges of peace as swords of state heralds maces chancellors purse etc are not known  the king sits down to dinner with his family and general officers of the army till his table is full the courtmareschal invites whom he pleases to eat with the king till all have had the honor in turns a page in livery says grace before and after meat for no chaplain appears either here or in any of the protestant courts abroad but in the pulpit the attendants are one or two gentlemen and the rest liveryservants no ceremony of the knee is used to the king the kettledrums and trumpets which are ranged in a large place before the palace proclaim aloud the very minute when he sits down to table  the city of copenhagen is under very good regulations there are select companies appointed to watch and extinguish fires no persons daring to approach within a certain distance lest under a pretense of assisting they should plunder chimneysweepers are obliged to keep a register of all chimnies they sweep that in case of any accident those by whose neglect or covetousness it happens may be answerable for it no torches or flambeaus are allowed to be carried in the streets on account of the great quantities of fir timber and the constant high winds that are here instead of which all persons use large round lanthorns carried at the end of long sticks  among other good regulations that of the apothecaries is none of the least commendable for no one is permitted to exercise this trade unless appointed by the college of physicians and confirmed by the king himself there are but two allowed in the whole city of copenhagen and one to every other considerable town their shops and drugs are carefully inspected twice or thrice a year by the magistrates accompanied by the physicians and such drugs as are of no efficacy or spoilt by age are taken from them and flung away the prices of these drugs are also fixed so that a child may be sent to an apothecarys shop without being imposed on and nothing is sold that is not exceedingly good and at very moderate rates they sell all for ready money yet keep an account of what they sell to whom and by whose prescription so that the great mischief of accidental or wilful poisoning is either prevented or if practiced easily discovered and punished  they are much addicted says molesworth to drinking and the liquors most in fashion in his time were rhenishwine cherrybrandy and all sorts of french wines the men are fond of them and the women do not refuse them the poor who are able to indulge do it in bad beer and danish brandy distilled from barley  apoplexies and the falling sickness are the epidemical distempers here and one shall scarce pass through copenhagen without seeing one or two poor creatures in a fit in the streets with a circle of gazers and assistants about them it is very usual here to have them die of a slacht as they call it which is an apoplexy proceeding from trouble of mind but on the other hand few or none are afflicted with coughs catarrhs or consumptions so common in this country so that in denmark the preachers are never disturbed at church as in england  their marriages says molesworth are usually preceded by contracts which will last sometimes three or four or more years before they proceed to a public wedding by the ministers though often the young couple grow better acquainted before these formalities are dispatched the gentry give portions which their daughters but the burghers and peasants if able give clothes furniture and a great weddingdinner but nothing more till they die  sumptuous burials and monuments are general among the nobility and it is usual to keep the corpse of a person of quality in a vault or the chancel of some church for several years till a fit opportunity offers to to celebrate the funeral the poorer sort are buried in great thick chests and in the towns there are about a dozen of common mourners belonging to each parish whose business it is to carry and attend them to their graves  chap iv of their trade and manufactures having already spoken of the trade of norway i shall confine myself to the kingdom of denmark which is extremely well situated for commerce her harbors well adapted for ships of great burden and her seamen very expert in navigation but denmark possesses very few commodities for exportation it is however very rich in timber and other materials for shipbuilding with which it supplies other nations besides its own there is no comparison between the present trade of denmark and what it was  0 years ago scarcely any thing has been omitted by government that could promote and enlarge its commerce besides the registry of ships and the increase of the number and tonnage of them there have been numerous advantages given to trade which are shown in most of the branches of the nations dealing with other countries they have an east indiacompany whose trade is increasing and profits considerable and regular their west india colonies thrive more than ever and a rise in the crownrevenues and an increase of shipping and population is the best criterion of an improvement of their general commerce  in      an african company was established and in      a loanbank was erected where great or small sums not under  00 rixdollars are lent on pledges at four per cent  they export now fir and other timber black cattle stock fish tallow hides trainoil tar pitch iron and furs and import salt wine brandy and silk from france portugal and italy broadcloths clocks cabinetwork locks etc from england they possess the islands of st croix st thomas and the small island of st john in the west indies which are free ports renowned for smuggling and the fort of christianburg on the coast of guinea and carry on a considerable commerce with the mediterranean  of the baltic sea they have in a great measure the command being possessed of the passage of the sound which is a narrow straight between two and three miles over between sweden and denmark through which all ships pass and repass to and from the baltic this pass is guarded by the fortress of cronberg a toll is paid to the crown of denmark by all ships that pass this way this toll seems to have taken its rise and to have been first laid on by consent of the traders into the baltic for the maintenance of lighthouses at certain places on that coast and though there is another passage into this sea by a straight between the islands of funen and seeland called the greatbelt yet that was disused and ships by the same consent were obliged to pass the sound that they might all pay their quota toward the support of such lights but there being no fixed rule or treaty with respect to the sums to be paid by the many nations that passed this way the danes in process of time grew arbitrary and exacted more or less according to the strength or weakness of those they had to deal with or according to their friendship with those states to whom the several ships belonged many have been the treaties respecting this toll within these  00 years and the king of denmarks title to the right of exacting it is now so slightly grounded and his not having possession of the castle of helsingburg in sweden on the other side which once he had that it is continued only by favor and the public law of europe it has been generally asserted that the castle of cronberg guards the sound and that all ships must on account of the shoalwater and currents steer so near the batteries as to be exposed to their fire but this is not the case on account of the numerous and opposite currents the safest passage is near the fortress but the water in any part is of sufficient depth for vessels to keep at a distance from the batteries and the largest ships can even sail close to the coast of sweden but the several nations consent to pay a small toll from one to one and a half per cent on their cargoes and every ship lowers her topsails as she passes the danes however are obliged to take the master of the vessels word for the quality and quantity of the lading and find it prudent not to be too strict in their enquiries but if the english and dutch were to refuse payment other states would soon do the same and the chain would be broken to prevent vessels passing by the greater or lesser belt without paying equal toll men of war are there stationed so chat the profits of the sound amount to about  00000 l a year  in the last century there were scarce any manufactures carried on in denmark but now there are artists of great eminence at copenhagen and every branch of mechanic arts is well executed throughout the kingdom gold and silverlace silk stuffs and velvets cloths cotton and woollen stuffs stockings tapestry hats bastard and genuine porcelain and firearms are there manufactured there are also paper and coppermills different sorts of ironwares made silk and cotton printinghouses with manufactories of soap steel starch glue lacker tobacco sugar etc  in      a general warehouse or magazine was opened at the exchange in copenhagen to which manufacturers bring all the wares which they cannot dispose of in other towns and are paid ready money for them and from this warehouse the goods are delivered out on credit to retailers  the post office is on a very regular footing in all towns the couriers for letters go out and come in twice a week there are traveling postcarriages and at every town a person may hire one for himself at a reasonable fixed rate the roads are measured all over the kingdom and at every quarter of a danish mile the ground is a little raised and a stone erected on it  the danes are no proficients in the fine arts not having encouragement enough to make any progress the kingdom says marshall is too poor to yield a market even to first portraitpainters the only art that makes any decent figure at copenhagen is music where some very capital german and italian performers meet with pretty good encouragement  chap v of their languages learning and religion the danish language is merely a dialect of the swedish and norwegian and the inhabitants of these three northern kingdoms understand each other excepting in some few words and phrases with regard to the pronunciation it has a perfect affinity with the english is not unlike the whining unpleasing tone of the irish has many monosyllables the same with the english in which ours originated the court and many burghers speak dutch in common conversation and french to strangers and the nobility have made great advances in english which is now taught as a branch of polite and necessary education a company of english players occasionally visit copenhagen and find good encouragement  the number of learned men in denmark is as considerable as in any other country in europe of the same extent and where the sciences are in a flourishing state there is scarce any branch of literature in which men of genius have not acquitted themselves with honor this is the language of busching but marshall says learning of all kinds is but at a low ebb denmark certainly produced formerly very learned men for instance the famous mathematician tycho brahe of whom they are now so proud as to preserve amongst the most valuable of their curiosities the chair in which he used to sit when he made his astronomical observations at uranibourg and the wood which composes it is held in reverence they can boast also of the bartholines for physic and anatomy and borichius who bequeathed a considerable legacy to the university of copenhagen their icelandic authors i have spoken of when treating of that island but i must not omit christian oeder to whom we are indebted for the flora danica  the kings of denmark have occasionally deputed and still continue to send at their expense learned men through their own territories and into various parts of the world for the purpose of extending the bounds of knowledge  besides the university at copenhagen which consists of four spacious colleges that of kiel at soroe for noblemens children and the gymnasia or seminaries at odensee and altona there are several schools well endowed in countrytowns where the masters are not only liberally provided for but the scholars are also instructed and partly maintained gratis in this university the professors have liberal salaries and many of the students have apartments and instruction free  at copenhagen is also a royal academy of sciences established in      who have published    volumes of their transactions and a society for the improvement of northern history and languages here is likewise two schools for the children of the nobility and gentry whose fortunes are too circumscribed to bear the expense of a proper education one is for boys the other for girls at that for boys the day scholars pay only   l a year and the boarders  0 l they learn history geography and arithmetic are instructed in the articles of their religion and have masters for the german french and english languages  lutheranism is the established religion of the country but in copenhagen the calvinists have a church to themselves the papists frequent the chapels of foreign romancatholic ministers and the jews have a synagogue it is a blessing which denmark enjoys that the people in general have but one faith which prevents all factions and disputes about religion so that the prince is little inconvenienced for as long as the priests are dependent on the crown and the people in matters of conscience governed by the priests as is the case here the sovereign may be as arbitrary as he pleases and in consideration of this advantage the clergy are much favored and suffered to sink into bigotry the clergy however are not admitted into civil affairs nor have they any thing to do with government the pulpit only is left free to them and here they tyrannize not only taking vast liberties of reprehending vices but censuring and lashing particular persons of the highest rank which is passed unnoticed whilst they interfere not with statematters the common people admire them for this boldness and the best part of their income arising from the voluntary contributions of the people they take care to cultivate the good opinion of the mob whom they keep at the same time in awe by the practice of confession before they administer the sacrament which every one that receives is obliged to undergo they do not read their sermons as in england but get them by heart and pronounce them with a great deal of action holy days and feastdays are observed as solemnly as sundays and in copenhagen the citygates are shut during service so that no one can go in or out the common class of people are great frequenters of the churches which are kept much more decently and cleanly than with us indeed though they have thrown off the popes supremacy they still reserve the gaudiness of their churches their crucifixes and some of their ceremonies they are all great lovers of organs and have many very good ones and skilful organists who entertain the congregation with music for half an hour either before or after service  there are six bishops in denmark but no archbishops these are appointed by the king but according to molesworth have no temporalities keep no ecclesiastical courts have no cathedrals with deans prebends etc but are only primi inter pares having rank above the inferior clergy of their province and the inspection into their doctrine and manners busching says each bishopric has a small cathedral and four or five canons one of these bishops is a metropolitan viz the bishop of iceland whose income is  000 l english the rest from  00 l to  00 l they are allowed to have two or three parishes each but their habit is common with other ministers namely a plaited black gown with short sleeves a large stiff ruff about the neck and a cap with edges like our masters of arts except that theirs is round whereas ours is square  the other clergy are provosts or archdeacons priests and chaplains of provosts there are   0 who annually visit the preachers and schoolmasters within their archdeaconry decide disputes between the clergy and their people and appear at the provincial synod twice a year these provosts have a rixdollar about   s   d sterling yearly from every church in their jurisdiction next to these are the preachers or parish priests who receive their salaries as with us in glebe tithes and surplicefees and in some places from voluntary contributions these livings seldom exceed in value  00 l sterling for all short of  0 l except in jutland where there are a few scarce worth  0 l the assistants to these preachers are the chaplains for every large parish has besides the parish church one or more additional chapels of ease a preachers widow receives half the income of her husbands living from the successor the first year coxe says the whole and an eighth part for the remainder of her life in the principal town of every diocese there is also a widows box in which every preacher puts in a certain sum and his wife if she survives him enjoys an annuity in proportion to what he has contributed most of their clergy understand english and admit that they draw the best of their divinity from english books they hate a calvinist as much as a papist but have great respect for the church of england  say there is little difference between their doctrine and ours and wish for a union with us  chap vi of their government laws forces etc till the revolution in    0 the crown of denmark was elective and the government a kind of aristocracy but in that year it was changed to as absolutely a monarchy as any in the world the sovereign is now declared as independent upon earth acknowledge no higher power than god he has an unlimited authority to make alter repeal and dispense with laws can make peace and declare war form alliances and levy taxes in short he enjoys all the rights and prerogatives which an hereditary absolute and despotic king can enjoy  five persons compose the kings privy council four of them are constantly at court and the fifth at hamburgh by the weekly advices of whom the others generally regulate all their deliberations hamburgh is a kind of commonwealth of its own but the kings of denmark still lay claim to certain privileges within its walls  the danes are divided into nobles burghers and peasants and the noblesse is distinguished by the appellations of the higher and lower nobility in the rank of higher nobles are counts and barons for there are no dukes or princes counts have the right of primo geniture their younger sons and daughters are styled barons and baronesses in their counties they have the right of patronage and of appointing a judge and secretary from whose sentence there is no appeal but to the supreme court of judicature they pay no contributions or tithes for their estates in chief and are allowed  00 acres of land over and above free from all impositions barons have similar privileges only not so extensive lords of manors have besides their manors  00 acres of land within two miles of their manors free from contribution burghers are the freemen of towns and peasants answer to our freeholders and copyholders  there are here two orders of knighthood the principal is that of the elephant whose ensigns are a silver star on the left breast and a white enamelled elephant hung to a blue ribband worn over the left shoulder to the right side the second is the danebrog order whose badge is a gold cross enamelled and set with diamonds hanging to a watered white ribband with a red border worn over the right shoulder to the left side and a silverstar  the country is divided into general governments called stiftsamts and the stiftsamtmann or governor is always a person of distinction generally a knight of one of the orders and has authority over the revenues towns and country within his jurisdiction under the stiftsamtmann are the amtmanner or prefects who are also noblemen the civil government in the cities and posttowns is lodged in a burgomaster and council but in smaller towns in the byevogt or kings headborough  the salaries of the judges are but small but do not consist of fees every man may if he pleases plead his own cause in any of the courts but the poor and such as cannot speak for themselves have advocates appointed for them insomuch that the charges of the law are so easy that a complaint may go through all the courts for less than    l sterling the smallness of the expense however is no encouragement to those that love going to law for the laws themselves provide effectually against the mischief and take away the very root of litigiousness being so plain and clear that a troublesome person never finds his account in promoting vexatious suits but meets with all the disappointments one would wish him  advocates or counselors are not regularly bred as with us but any one may take up the profession that pleases the supreme court of judicature which i have mentioned is at copenhagen where the king sits sometimes in person and is always composed of the prime nobility of the kingdom  in criminal matters such great severity is practiced that high treason is never heard of there are no clippers or coiners no robbers on the highway nor housebreakers the most usual capital crimes are manslaughter and stealing on which occasion the criminal is beheaded with a sword very dexterously by a headsman at one stroke who is from a variety of offices which he undertakes generally very rich though no one will be seen in his company he empties the necessaryhouses and removes dead dogs and horses out of houses and stables no danish servant will do this but the headsman undertakes it and performs it by an underservant called a racker and has his own price for so doing all misdemeanors are punished by servitude in chains for a certain length of time  i must not omit to take notice on the authority of lord molesworth that in this country it is only the nobility with titles that have the liberty of making a will to dispose of any estate otherwise than as the law shall of course direct and that such must be approved and signed by the king during the life of the testator  there is no buying or selling of land in this country but should a person possessing an estate wish to leave the country altogether if he can find a purchaser for his land he is at liberty to sell but one third part of such purchasemoney is the property of the king  the revenue of the crown arises from taxes customs and crown lands the gross receipt of which amounted in      to         l and the expenditure was      0 l of which the army estimates come to   0000 l and those of the navy to   0000 l the national debt in      was     000 l the interest of which was discharged by an annual payment of        l which must be added to the yearly expenditure this revenue compared to that of england is very small but in denmark where every commodity is very cheap it is an immense sum the army if subsidies be reckoned as the king finds only arms to vast numbers costs little or nothing and the navy is maintained at a very easy rate the number on constant pay during peace is not large and the rest are retained by a months pay in the year to be ready at call so that the expense of the navy is little more than the building of ships and providing of stores  the army is composed of the troops of denmark and holstein and those of norway those of the two former amount to   000 horse and foot those of the latter to   000 in the whole   000  from their insular situation the danes have always excelled as a maritime people the greatest part of the danish navy is stationed in the harbor of copenhagen which lies within the fortifications but the depth of water being only  0 feet the ships do not take in their lower tier of guns till out of port the number of registered seamen are  0000 each receives   s a year as long as he sends a certificate of his being alive but is subject to a recall in case of war the marines are in number  00 and the ships as follows    of the line and about  0 frigates  the chief nursery for the officers of the navy is the academy of marine cadets where  0 are maintained and instructed at the expense of the crown every year they make a cruize on board a frigate other youths are admitted into this academy at the expense of their friends  a description of newfoundland canada and the more northern parts of america from ellis umfreville marquette charlevoix and others chap i of the country villages people houses employments etc america extends from the north pole to the   th degrees of south latitude and is upwards of  000 miles in length it sees both hemispheres it has two summers and a double winter enjoys all the variety of climates which the earth affords and is washed by the two greatest oceans by which it carries on a great and direct commerce with the other three parts of the world it is composed of two vast continents one on the north the other on the south joined by the great kingdom of mexico which forms a sort of isthmus   00 miles a map of part of north america from lat  0 to lat    map of north america long and at one part at darien so very narrow as to make the communication between the two oceans east and west by no means difficult  america in general is not a mountainous country yet has the greatest mountains in the world and is better watered in north america part of which we are now going to treat of the great river missisippi rising from unknown sources runs an immense course from north to south and receives the vast influx of the ohio and ouabache and other immense rivers scarcely inferior to the rhine or the danube navigable almost to their very sources and laying open the inmost recesses of this continent near the heads of these are five vast lakes or rather seas of fresh water running into each other and all communicating with the ocean by the river st laurence which passes through them the eastern side of north america besides the noble rivers hudson delaware susquehanna patowmack supplies several others of great depth length and commodious navigation many parts of the settlements are so intersected with navigable rivers and creeks that the planters may be said without exaggeration to have each a harbor at his own door  the labrador coast which is the country of the eskimaux indians and lies near the north pole we have treated of in the first volume of this work that which we are now going to describe belongs to the english having been originally settled by the french but by them ceded to us  the aborigines of america throughout the whole extent of the two vast continents which they inhabit and amongst the infinite number of nations and tribes into which they are divided differ very little from each other in their manners and customs and they all form a very striking picture of the most distant antiquity  when the europeans first came among them they found the people quite naked except those parts which is common for the most uncultivated people to conceal since that time they have generally a coarse blanket to cover them which they buy from us the whole fashion of their lives is of a piece hardy poor and squallid their only occupation is hunting agriculture is left to the women merchandise they contemn but as i shall have occasion to describe them more particularly i will not anticipate what i shall be obliged to repeat  the first land on the approach to canada in the great atlantic ocean is the island of newfoundland belonging to the english situated between    and    degrees north latitude this island is of a triangular form about   0 miles long from north to south and about  00 miles broad at the base or broadest part from east to west and is about   leagues distant from the continent  notwithstanding it lies more to the southward than england the winters are much colder and the earth is covered with snow every year for four or five months so that it is scarce habitable when the sun is in the southern signs this must be owing to its vicinity to a vast frozen continent over which the northwest wind blowing for many hundred miles makes the countries that lie on that side of the atlantic much colder than those on this side in the same latitudes at midsummer however it is much hotter there than with us the seasons however after all are very temperate neither are there any great extremities of heat and cold it is a healthy place and agrees very well with english constitutions the soil is exceedingly fruitful and without any art or cultivation produces plants fruits and grain fit for man and beast bilberries barberries raspberries cherries gooseberries strawberries white and red pears filberds etc grow in such plenty that a man may sooner tire himself with eating than searching for them wheat bailey rye pease and vetches were found in the country when it was first discovered in short there is scarce any fruit root pulse or plant that will flourish in england that will not thrive here the highlands are clothed with woods that preserve their verdure all the winter and the plains are watered with ponds brooks and rivers which refresh the meadows and make the grass high and rank  the animals of the island are buffaloes deer hares foxes squirrels wolves bears amphibious beavers and others of small birds and wild fowl they have the same as with us with the addition of the penguin and their harbors and rivers are well stocked with a variety of fish all the world knows the reputation of newfoundland for cod but the great rarity of all animals is the mermaid which if we believe the word of captain whitburn who wrote an account of this island in the last century is an inhabitant of these seas he affirms that as he was standing one day early in the morning at st johns harbor he saw a creature making very swiftly toward him which by the eyes nose chin ears neck forehead and in a word by all the upper parts which were very well proportioned appeared to be a woman the hair indeed was to be excepted for instead of that there were all round about upon the head as it were blue streaks which much resembled hair and hung down to the neck the captain says he looked at it steadfastly and so did another of his company that stood not far from him and staid till it came within the length of a long pike from him and then he retreated when the creature saw him withdrawing it turned about also and made away which gave him an opportunity of viewing the shoulders and back parts of it down to the waist from the middle to the lower part to use his own words it went pointing in proportion like a broadhooked arrow but how it was in the forepart of the body from the neck and shoulders downwards he could not discern because it did not advance toward him so much above the water as it appeared when it went away this siren had a mind to the captains company in some palace or other within the dominions of neptune but he though otherwise of good breeding refused the favor and slighted her knowing there was no good wine in that country but a guzzling of salt water which kind of drinkingbout would have cost him his life and deprived him of christian burial she had shown him the charms of her face but thought him unworthy of those of her voice which the poets of old have so wonderfully extolled but to be serious this same creature came swiftly to the side of a boat in which were some of the captains men and endeavored to get into it the fellows were scared at the sight and ready to leap out of the boat when they perceived it attempting to get in one of them however recovered spirit enough to manage his oar with which he struck the siren such a blow across the head as to make her let go her hold and drop into the water this did not kill her for she came up afterward to some boats in the harbor which being near the shore the men got out and ran away as a man could have no interest in forming this story it may be credited as well as many other wonderful accounts of strange monsters in the world  whether there were any original natives of this island we cannot take upon us to say when it was first discovered the english saw some people on shore painted with oker and clothed with stagskins formed into a sort of gowns that reached to half way the leg the sleeves coming down half way the arm and beaverskins about their neck they were barelegged and most of them barefooted their heads were uncovered they wore their hair pretty long a great lock behind plaited with feathers with a feather in it standing upright on the crown of the head and a small lock plaited before their hair was of different colors and their clothes as well as their bodies were painted red  whether these were natives of the island or wanderers from other parts is unknown but at present there do not seem to be any ancient inhabitants the island is overrun by the eskimaux indians of whom we have treated and as to europeans there do not remain in the winter above  000 families in the towns of placentia bonavista and st john  the small islands of st pierre and miquelon situated to the southward of newfoundland in the year      when the island was ceded to us were reserved to france on condition they should erect no fortifications there nor keep more than  0 soldiers to enforce the police by this treaty they are at liberty to fish in the gulf of st lawrence but not within three leagues of any of the coasts belonging to england and are permitted to dry their nets on the northern more of the island  the great bank of newfoundland so renowned for its codfishery is a shoal or properly a great mountain hid under water about  0 leagues from shore extending   0 leagues from north to south beginning in    degrees north latitude its great width from east to west is about  0 leagues the anchorage here is from    to  0 fathoms  great britain and north america at the lowest computation employ annually  000 sail of small vessels in this fishery on board of which and on shore to cure and pack the fish are upwards of  0000 people and it is an excellent nursery for seamen the cod we sell abroad from this fishery yields full to us  00000 l a year  every thing in the cod while fresh is good but the best parts of it viz the head the tongue the liver as it takes more salt to preserve these than they would be worth salted are thrown away the largest cod says charlevoix i ever saw on the bank was not three feet long it is a very voracious fish and we often found in their stomachs pieces of broken pots and bits of iron and glass the cod can turn itself inside out like a pocket and it is thus that it frees itself of any thing that troubles it this fishing season is from the beginning of may to the end of august  we have more than once continues this author had the diversion of seeing a fight between a whale and the swordfish and nothing is more entertaining the swordfish is as thick as a cow seven or eight feet long gradually lessening to the tail it takes its name from its weapon a kind of sword three feet long and four inches wide fixed above its nose and having a row of teeth on each side an inch long at an equal distance from each other this fish is good with any sauce and its head better eating than a calfs head it is bigger and squarer  the whale and the swordfish never meet without fighting and the latter they say is always the aggressor sometimes two swordfishes join against a whale and then it is not an equal match the whale has no weapon but its tail which to make use of it plunges its head under water and if it can strike its enemy with a blow of its tail it is sure to kill it but the swordfish is dexterous enough to shun it instantly falls on the whale and runs its weapon into its back but as it seldom reaches the fat it does not materially hurt the whale when the whale sees the swordfish dart it plunges but the swordfish pursues and obliges it to appear again then the fight begins again and continues till the swordfish loses sight of the whale which fights always retreating and swims best on the surface of the water  cape breton is an island about   0 miles long and  0 broad a barren desert land affording scarce any trees or herbage lying between newfoundland and nova scotia the chief town of which is louisburgh it has been taken and retaken by the french and english more than once is at present in possession of the english but the town of louisburgh which was once well fortified by the french is now dismantled  the island of st john in the gulf of st lawrence is also an english island  0 miles long and between  0 and  0 broad with many fine rivers on the reduction of cape breton in      the inhabitants in number about  000 submitted to the british arms it is a pleasant fertile place and settled by english families many tracks of land being given to the english officers at the peace of       the gulf of st lawrence is  0 leagues long in which about halfway up are two rocks rising about  0 feet perpendicular above the sea the largest of which is not above two or three hundred paces in circumference they stand close to each other and what is remarkable their surface and sides are so covered with the dung of birds that we cannot see their color they have been often visited and boats have been there loaded with birds eggs the stench of these rocks is almost insupportable and it is wonderful that in such a multitude of nests every bird immediately finds its own on firing a gun this flying commonwealth is alarmed and there is formed above the two islands a thick cloud of these birds two or three leagues round  the gulf or river at the entrance is  0 leagues wide and adjoining is the bay of gasp in which is a natural curiosity viz a steep rock  0 fathoms long  0 high and   broad called the pierced island which looks like an old wall and has in the midst of it an opening like an arch through which a boat with its sails up may pass and not far from the island of miscou is another curious production of nature in this gulf there rises out of the sea a spring of fresh water which makes a jet above the seawater pretty high like a fountain  in the gulf of st lawrence are some good harbors and some few islands one of which anticosto is  0 leagues long but very barren and without a harbor as soon as this island is passed the river st lawrence narrows so that land may be seen on both sides one hundred and ten leagues from the sea the water as at woolwich on the thames is a little brackish and at the entrance of the two canals that form the island of orleans a little below quebec which stands on this river and where it is about one mile across i say at the entrance of the two canals there is a phenomenon pretty difficult to explain especially if we consider its great rapidity notwithstanding its breadth the tide flows here regularly five hours and ebbs seven at tadoussac below this it ebbs and flows six hours and the higher we go up the river the more the flood diminishes and the ebb increases till we come  0 leagues above quebec when it flows three hours and ebbs nine when it is half flood in the port of tadoussac it is but just beginning to flow at checoutimi    leagues higher up the river saguenay at the mouth of which tadoussac stands and yet it is high water at the three places at the same time this happens no doubt because the rapidity of the river saguenay greater than that of st lawrence running against the tide makes an equilibrium for some time between checoutimi and the entrance of the saguenay into the great river st lawrence  the river up to the isle of orleans     leagues from the sea is never less than four or five leagues wide but above the island it grows narrower all at once so that at quebec it is only a mile broad quebec in the language of the country means shut up the first thing that appears on entering the road of quebec is a fine sheet of water  0 feet wide and  0 high called the fall of montmorenci it is directly at the entrance of the little channel of the isle of orleans every one would judge that such a large fall of water which runs continually was the discharge of some fine river but it is only derived from an inconsiderable current from a lake which in some places is not ancle deep  quebec is a league higher in the very place where the river is narrowest the moorings are over against the city where there is    fathom water and good anchorage when it was founded in   0  the tide rose to the foot of the rock but since that time the river has retired by degrees and left a great space dry where they have built the lower city but high enough above the shore to be secure from inundations the upper city stands upon a rock of marble and slate on landing we enter a pretty long street which takes up the whole breadth of the place and leads to the upper city and the way is so steep that we rise by steps and of course can only go on foot this street is bordered with stone house pretty well built with their backs close to the rock so that they have but little depth in the upper city is a place of arms before the fort which is a regular and beautiful citadel covering the whole town and where the governor resides it is not a large place though the capital of canada containing about seven or eight thousand inhabitants ships of the greatest burden load and unload here and many are here built  this city is a bishopric but the cathedral is mean serving as a parish church to all the place it has a small church besides in the lower city the bishops palace is a long square and makes a good appearance the gardens extend to the brow of the rock and command all the road here is a college of jesuits two convents two hospitals but the greatest beauty of the place is its society there seems to be every thing for all sorts of people to pass their time very agreeably and they do view of quebec so in reality every one endeavoring to contribute the utmost toward it they play they make parties of pleasure in summer in chariots or canoes in winter in sledges on the snow or skaiting on the ice the news current is but little because the country furnishes scarce any and the news from europe comes generally altogether there is nobody rich here for they spend their money as freely as they get it on their tables and their dress  twentyfive leagues higher up the river st lawrence is the town of three rivers where the river is half a league wide it is but a small place but prettily situated having some good iron mines in its neighborhood there is a convent of recollets a fine hospital and a nunnery of ursulines it is fortified and has a good garrison  from three rivers to montreal through the countries of the irroquois indians the river st lawrence is full of islands on the side of quebec the land is good but for a long winter universally covered with snow thirty leagues above three rivers is the isle of montreal in the same river st lawrence an island ten leagues long from east to west and near four broad there is a mountain in this island with two heads of unequal height almost in the middle but the town is built only half a league from the south coast it has a very cheerful aspect is well situated open and well built the agreeableness of its environs and its prospects inspire a certain gaiety of which every one feels the effect montreal is a long square situated on the bank of the river which rising insensibly divides the town in its length into high and low but the ascent from one to the other is scarcely perceivable the streets are regular and well cut it contains three convents with handsome churches and an hospital for the sick the fortifications are good and the inhabitants are said to be about  000 as the town rises from the river every house and all are handsome may be seen at one view from the harbor the river here is only navigable by canoes or small craft having several falls between this and quebec yet the indian fair and their trade the whole year make it no inconsiderable place the hotel dieu and the kings magazines are in the lower town and almost all the traders live there the convents and the parish church are situated in the upper town and the governor and the greatest part of the officers there reside the parish church has more the appearance of a cathedral than that at quebec and the service is performed with a modesty and dignity which inspires respect for the majesty of god who is here adored  between the island of montreal and the continent on the north side there is another island about eight leagues long and two leagues over the channel which separates the two islands runs through the midst of fine meadows but its course is impeded toward the middle by a torrent or waterfall the third arm of the river is strewed as it were with such a number of small islands that there is almost as much land as water  from quebec to montreal which is about   0 miles distance the country on both sides the river is very well settled and has an agreeable effect upon the eye the farms lie pretty close all the way several gentlemens houses neatly built show themselves at intervals and there is all the appearance of a flourishing colony but there are no towns or villages but that of three rivers which i have mentioned  with all the attention of the court of france to the trade and peopling of this colony they have not been able thoroughly to overcome the consequences of those difficulties which the climate whilst the place was unsettled threw in their way their losses in the wars with the brave and fierce irroquois indians and the bad navigation of the river st lawrence which is an incurable evil have kept back the colony therefore though it is the oldest of all the french establishments and prior to our settling of new england the inhabitants are not above  00000 in number  that which has been the security of montreal and its environs are two villages of irroquois christians and the fort of chambly the first is that of the fall of st louis situated on the continent on the south side of the river three leagues above montreal which is very populous and has always been esteemed one of the strongest barriers against the heathen irroquois and the people of new york it has a good church the situation is charming and the river st lawrence which is very wide here and full of islands has a fine effect the second village is that of the mountain over against the west end of the island of montreal these two villages have produced many brave men and their fervor in religion was wonderful before the avarice of traders had introduced brandy among them which has occasioned such disorders that in the squares and streets of montreal is often seen the most frightful spectacles the certain consequence of the drunkenness of these barbarians husbands and wives fathers mothers and their children brothers and sisters taking each other by the throat tearing each others ears and biting one another like furious wolves the air often resounds in the night with howlings more horrible than those which the wild beasts make in the woods  the great trade for skins is carried on at montreal by the savages of the north and west resorting here at certain seasons from all parts of canada to the distance of  000 miles little fleets of indians are seen on the river in the month of june when this sair begins and continues for three months on this occasion many solemnities are observed guards are placed and the governor assists to preserve order  fort chambly is situated about    leagues up the river richlieu which empties itself into the river st lawrence near the town of three rivers it is built with stone flanked with four bastions and has a pretty good garrison it is eight leagues from lake champlain at the extremity of which stands crownpoint  having now described the principal settlements on the river st lawrence i will speak of canada more generally  canada as ceded by france to england and now possessed by us was commonly called new france it had no bounds to the north but on the side of hudsons bay and no other on the east but the sea the english colonies now the united states of america on the south louisiana to the southeast and the spanish territories to the west in this great extent of country there are but three mothertongues from which all others are derived these are the sioux the algonguin and the huron we know but little of the people that speak the first of these languages and no one knows how far it extends the sioux were a peaceable people before the hurons and outaouais took refuge in the country from the fury of die irroquois  the sioux have a plurality of wives and severely punish those who fail in conjugal fidelity by cutting off the end of their noses and cutting a circle in a part of the skin on the top of their heads and pulling it off that is scalping them some of these people are said to have a chinese accent they dwell commonly in meadows under tents made of skins and well wrought living on wild oats which grow abundantly in their marshes and by hunting especially the buffaloes that are covered with wool and which are seen in herds of thousands each in their meadows they have no fixed abode but travel in great companies like the tartars and never stay longer in one place than the chase detains them  in canada there are five fresh water lakes the smallest of which is larger than any known lake in the world this is lake ontario which is not less than  00 leagues round oswego is longer but not so broad huron spreads greatly in width michegan is longer one way than the other but lake superior is  00 leagues round and contains several large islands they are all navigable by any sized vessels and all communicate with one another except that the passage between oswego and ontario is interrupted by a stupendous cataract called the falls of niagara forming the river of that name or rather the river of st lawrence which comes out of lake oswego or erie and passes through lake ontario after a straight of    leagues they call it the river of niagarra from the fall and this space is about six leagues at the entrance of this river is a fort where it is designed to erect a village  to reach the height from whence this river falls we must pass over three mountains one above another the country of niagara is frightful and savage on one side we see under our feet and as it were in the bottom of an abyss a great river indeed but which in this place resembles more a torrent by its rapidity by the whirlpools which a thousand rocks make in it through which it has much difficulty to find a passage and by the foam with which it is always covered on the other side the view is covered by the three mountains i have mentioned rising one above another the last of which loses itself in the clouds and where the poets might well have said the titans would have scaled heaven in short turn which way we will we discover scenes that inspire horror but travel a little further go beyond these wild and inhospitable mountains and we see a rich soil magnificent forests pleasant and fruitful hills and we breathe a pure air and enjoy a temperate climate between the two lakes oswego and ontario  this waterfall is about half a mile wide in the form of a horseshoe but it is divided exactly in the middle by a very narrow island about half a mile long which comes to a point here but these two parts of the river unite again before it reaches the rock that almost crosses it and near the precipice from which it tumbles perpendicularly in its whole breadth   0 feet no words can express the consternation of travelers at seeing so great a body of water falling or rather violently thrown from so great a height upon the rocks below from which it rebounds again to a very great height white as snow being by these violent agitations converted into foam the noise of this cataract is often heard at the distance of    miles and the vapor arising from it may sometimes be seen at a great distance in appearance like a cloud or pillar of smoke or in form of a rainbow when the sun shines on it many beasts and waterfowl in attempting to swim across the stream above the fall have been found dashed to pieces below and sometimes the indians through drunkenness or carelessness have shared the same fate  charlevoix who traveled round the lake erie or oswego in the month of june gives the following description of his tour if one traveled as i did then with a clear sky and a charming climate by a water as bright as the finest fountain meeting every where with a safe and pleasing place to encamp in where one might find all manner of game at little cost breathing at ones ease a pure air and enjoying the sight of the finest countries one would be tempted to travel all ones life it put me in mind of those ancient patriarchs who had no fixed abode dwelt under tents were in some manner masters of all the countries they traveled over without the trouble of attendants or the possession of a great domain how many oaks represented to me that of mamre how many fountains reminded me of that of jacob every day a new situation of my own choosing a neat and convenient house set up and furnished with necessaries in a quarter of an hour spread with flowers always fresh covered with a fine green carpet and on every side plain and natural beauties which art had not altered and which it cannot imitate if these pleasures suffer some interruption either by bad weather or some unforeseen accident they are the more relished when they reappear  they say this is the finest part of canada and indeed to judge of it by appearances nature has denied it nothing that can render a country beautiful hills meadows fields fine woods of timber trees brooks fountains and rivers and all these of such a good quality and so happily intermixed that one could scarce wish for any thing more the lands are not good for all sorts of grain but the greatest part are surprisingly fertile some will produce wheat eight years in succession without manure the isles here seem to have been placed on purpose to captivate the eye the rivers and the lakes are full of fish and the climate temperate and very healthy  but on the other hand if the weather is so delightful in summer it is the reverse in winter which begins in a manner that astonishes those who are not used to it the first frost fills the river st lawrence with ice in a few days and the earth is soon covered with snow which continues six months and always to the depth of six feet where the wind has little power  there is indeed no want of wood to provide against the cold which soon becomes excessive and lasts till the spring is pretty forward but it is very melancholy not to be able to stir out without being frozen or without being wrapped up in furs like a bear besides what a sight is the snow which dazzles the eyes and conceals all the beauties of nature there is no longer any difference between the rivers and the fields no more variety even the trees are covered with rhyme and all their branches hung with icicles under which it is not safe to pass what can one think when we see houses with beards of ice a foot long and how can one travel in a country where bears for six months dare not venture from their holes seldom is there a winter but persons are carried to the hospitals to have their legs and arms cut off that are frozen past recovery in short if the sky is clear there blows from the western parts a wind that cuts the face if indeed the wind changes to south or east the weather grows a little milder but there falls such a thick snow that we cannot see ten paces before us at noon day if a thawing air comes adieu to all the capons quarters of beef and mutton the fowls and fish that had been laid up frozen in the storerooms so that in spite of the rigor of the excessive cold the inhabitants are still obliged to wish for its continuance but as soon as the month of may arrives the scene is changed and the sweetness of the season is the more pleasing as it succeeds a rigorous one the heat of the summer in less than four months time shows both seedtime and harvest and the serenity of autumn gives a course of finer days than is seen in europe lands are here plowed in summer sown from the midst of april to the  0th of may and the corn is cut from the   th of august to the  0th of september  at york fort a settlement belonging to the hudsons bay company which lies in north latitude    degrees and    degrees west longitude from london the air though intensely cold is very salubrious and healthy especially in the wintermonths and in the summer though it is much hotter than in england yet europeans enjoy a good share of health the atmosphere is clearest and most serene in the coldest weather and the most piercing cold is felt at sunrising in january fahrenheits thermometer is frequently  0 degrees below 0 and in summer the mercury will often rise to  0 degrees above 0 making a difference of   0 degrees between the extremities of heat and cold from november to the vernal equinox rum and brandy will freeze to the consistence of honey and a cask of water in the open air has burst in the course of    hours the frost is never out of the ground even in summer it is not thawed lower than about four feet below the surface and two feet in the woods notwithstanding the natives take every precaution to guard against the consequences of the cold they frequently fall a prey to its severity after enduring great torment for a considerable time the cold at last seizes the vital parts and the unfortunate person soon expires women have been found frozen to death with a young infant likewise frozen clasping its arms round the mothers neck others have been found dead and the babe still alive  in the coldest weather the atmosphere is most serene throughout the day the air is generally filled with icy particles small beyond conception which being driven by the wind adhere to every thing in their way in the evening the stars begin to shine with refulgent luster and the contemplative mind is struck with reverence and awe and sees the aurora borealis darting with inconceivable velocity to all parts of the heavens mock suns often appear which is a sure indication of intense cold and mock moons when the vapors arising from open water become condensed by the frost  at churchill fort another settlement of the hudsons bay company and two degrees more to the northward the cold is intensely severe from the end of october to the middle of may this part of the world is buried in frost and snow but yet when the genial rays of the sun begin to extend to these parts of the globe vegetation is exceedingly quick and the produce of the garden may be gathered in the middle of june the sun rises in the shortest day at york fort at    minutes after eight the woods at churchill fort are considerably smaller than those at york fort these are junipers pines poplars and willows and indeed they are so insignificantly small as to make firing exceedingly scarce and the further north the traveller goes the barer he will find the earth of every vegetable till at last not the least herb is to be seen nor any trace of human steps observed in the frigid waste  in the interior parts of the country in north latitude    degrees and west longitude from london   0 where mr umfreville passed four years from      to      on the bank of a large river which empties itself by many branches into lake bourbon the climate is something milder than about quebec the fruits which grow spontaneously are here in greater variety than in the wildernesses of canada the natives collect a kind of wild cherries and sell them to the hudsons bay people who make a beverage of them raspberries strawberries currants and an infinity of other sorts are to be found so that were a person bewildered here and alone without communication he might in the summerseason procure a very comfortable subsistence every pond would furnish him with duck and other eggs and every thicket with a satiety of delicious fruits  in valleys and moist situations the grass grows to a great height in winter the snow is not half so deep as near the seacoast nor are the hottest days in summer near so sultry the heavens in cold winternights do not exhibit so luminous an appearance as near the sea nor are the aurora borealis mocksuns or mockmoons near so frequent in short the two countries will admit of no comparison the country here is temperate and healthy the land is dry pleasant and fertile and the animal creation is various and excellent for the support of man a person might here pass his days with ease content and felicity and if he did not enjoy an uninterrupted state of health it would not be the fault of the air he lived in  on the other hand the lower country approaching the sea is one endless bog where wild animals are constantly swamped the finest summers day will begin with a scorching heat and terminate with a cold easterly seafog that shall obscure the sun for several weeks the whole country furnishes but one species of quadrupeds the buffalo fit for the support of man and the europeans are accursed with an afflicting epidemical disorder which they very emphatically term the country distemper this is a violent pain in the breast supposed to proceed from the cold air being drawn into the lungs which impeding the vessels from spreading throughout that organ hinders the circulation and renders respiration extremely painful and difficult though no one dies of it the venereal disease is also common among them but the symptoms are much milder than in europe  this severity of cold in a more southern latitude than our own can be only attributed to its vicinage to the north seas that are covered with monstrous heaps of ice above eight months in the year and to the winds coming across vast countries and a great chain of mountains always covered with snow  there is another province belonging to us lying east of the river st lawrence and bounded by the atlantic ocean this is nova scotia called by the french arcadia it has new england and the ocean to the south and west of the river st lawrence and its gulf to the north and northeast and lies between the   th and  0th degrees of north latitude and though in a favorable part of the temperate zone has a very severe winter of seven months succeeded by a short summer violently scorching without any intervention of any thing that may be called spring for long after the summer season has commenced they are wrapped in the gloom of a perpetual fog the whole country is almost a continued forest the soil is in general thin and barren the corn it produces of a shrivelled kind like rye and the grass intermixed with a wild spungy moss however though it is uniformly bad there are tracts in nova scotia which do not yield to the best land in new england  unpromising as this country is the french seated themselves here before they made any establishment in canada and their colony increased largely whereas at present if the support of our government was withdrawn from our settlements there notwithstanding the immense sums that have been expended in them they would sink into nothing by the treaty of utrecht it became the property of the english and in       000 families were transported there at one time at the expense of this country and three regiments stationed to protect them from the indians  the chief town we had formerly in this province was called annapolis royal but though the capital it was a small place wretchedly fortified badly built and as badly inhabited though annapolis stood on the best harbor as it is said in all north america capable of containing  000 vessels at safe anchor it never flourished which induced the new settlers to build the town of halifax this is commodiously situated for the fishery and stands on a fine harbor it has a good timber entrenchment strengthened with forts sufficient to guard it against an indian enemy  halifax has a communication with most parts of the province either by landcarriage the sea or navigable rivers and in the harbor lies a small squadron of ships which puts to sea in summer under a commodore to protect the newfoundland fishery was it not for this fishery the inhabitants must often starve as all their provision comes from new england though the town all things considered has a tolerable appearance the adjacent country is not proportionably improved the ground is very hard to be cleared when cleared it is worth little and labor is very dear but it has suffered most from the incursions of the indians which have been so frequent and attended with such cruelties that the people can hardly extend themselves beyond the cannon of their fort of course do not raise a fifth part of what is sufficient to maintain them though all the fighting men the indians can raise in this province do not amount to  00 yet the soldiers inactive by their confinement in barracks diseased by scurvy and weakened by drinking are quite undermatched for the activity vigilance patience and address of the native americans  besides annapolis and halifax there is another settlement a little to the southwest of the latter called lunenburg colonized by a branch of germans from halifax in search of a better soil these seem to succeed well  but to return to the aborigines of canada we have spoken of the sioux the assiniboils inhabit about a lake which bears their name and which is but little known the common opinion is that this lake is  00 leagues in circumference and contains a number of islands and that it cannot be approached but by ways almost impassable that all the borders of it are charming that the air is very temperate and that it lies to the northwest of lake superior where the cold is extreme some of the savages call it michinipi that is the great water and it seems to be the source of the greatest rivers and all the great lakes of north america for by several evidences they make the river bourbon to rise from it which falls into hudsons bay the river st lawrence which carries its waters to the ocean the missisippi which discharges itself into the gulf of mexico the messouri which joins with the last and a fifth which empties itself into the south sea we cannot assert the truth of it but charlevoix says on the reports of some savages that there are about the lake of the assiniboils men like europeans and who are settled in a country where silver and gold is in such plenty that it serves for the most common uses  father marquette who discovered the missisippi in      says that some savages not only spoke to him of the river which taking its rise from this lake runs to the west but that they also added they had seen great ships in its mouth it appears in the old maps under the name of poualaks and some accounts say that their country is the boundary to that of the cristinaux these assiniboils are tall wellmade strong active men inured to cold and fatigue who prick their bodies all over with figures of serpents and other animals and undertake very long journeys they differ from the cristinaux their neighbors inasmuch as the latter have a great deal of vivacity speak with great volubility of tongue and are always singing and dancing whereas the assiniboils are of very grave cast  the algonquin and huron languages have between them almost all the savage nations of canada that we are acquainted with he who understands both might travel without an interpreter   00 leagues of country and make himself understood by a hundred different nations who have each their peculiar tongue  the algonquins or cannibas are neighbors to new england but in going up the river st lawrence we meet with no savage nation till we come to saguenay which is many leagues before we reach quebec between quebec and montreal toward three rivers are a few algonquins but they do not form a village fron montreal northwards are some few savage nations in the more interior parts there are many the greater part of the algonguin nations except those which are more advanced toward the south employ themselves but little in husbandry and live almost wholly upon hunting and fishing so that they are not fixed to any place some of them allow plurality of wives yet far from multiplying they decrease every day there is not any one of these nations that consists of  000 people some not of  000  the huron language is not by far so extensive as the algonquin when i say the huron language i speak in conformity to common opinion for some maintain that the irroquois is the mother tongue be this as it may all the savages to the south of the river st lawrence from the river sorel to the end of the lake erie and even pretty near virginia belong to this language and he who understands huron understands them all the cherokees are a pretty numerous people who inhabit the vast meadows between the lake erie and the missisippi to what language these belong is not yet known but from a continual connection among all the savages they can understand each other without an interpreter  the huron language has a copiousness an energy and a sublimity perhaps not to be found united in any of the finest we know and those whose native tongue it is though now but a handful of men have an elevation of soul that agrees better with the majesty of their language than with the sad state to which they are reduced some have fancied they found in it a similitude with the hebrew others and the greatest number have maintained it had they same origin as the greek but nothing is more trifling than the proofs they bring of it  the algonquin has not so much force as the huron but has more sweetness and elegance in the huron all is conjugated both have a richness of expression a variety of turns a propriety of terms a regularity which astonishes and what is more suprising among these barbarians who never study to speak well and who never had the use of writing there is not introduced a bad word an improper term or a vicious construction and even children preserve all the purity of their language in their common discourse on the other hand the manner in which they animate all they say leaves no doubt of their comprehending all the worth of their expressions and all the beauty of their language  excess of liquor frequently makes europeans cheerful and merry but with the indian it has a contrary effect at this time he brings his departed friends and relations to remembrance pathetically laments their death with tears and if near their graves will run and weep over them others will sing in chorus till they cannot hold up their heads but will roll about their tents as in a fit of phrensy and frequently into the fire on these occasions some quarrel is sure to ensue but they have sense enough to order the women to put all dangerous weapons out of the way yet as they cannot remove their teeth it is not uncommon to see some of them the next morning without a nose sometimes they come off with the loss only of an ear or the joint of a finger and in these affrays no regard is paid to relationship brothers and sisters often fighting with each other after one of these rencounters says umfreville an indian entered the fort one morning begging to see the surgeon and as soon as he was admitted into his apartment addressed him in broken english with look here man here my nose holding out his hand with half of his nose in it which he wanted the surgeon to put on again the mans nephew had bit it off and he declared he felt no pain nor was he sensible of his loss till the next morning when awaking he found the piece lying by his side  these indians however when sober are mild affable and goodnatured ready to relieve the wants of their distressed brethren but on the other hand are sly cunning and artful glorying in every species of theft and artifice especially when the deception has been so well executed as to escape detection  the care which mothers take of their children whilst in the cradle is beyond all expression tends to their perfect form and proves very clearly that we often spoil all when we exceed the tenets which nature has taught us they never leave them but carry them every where with them and when they seem ready to sink under the burdens they load themselves with the cradle of their child is reckoned as nothing their cradles are neat beyond measure the child lies very conveniently and very easy in them bound in them only as high as the waist so that when the cradle is upright these little creatures have their heads and half their bodies hanging forward and down in europe they would fancy a child so left would grow quite deformed but it happens to the contrary it renders their bodies supple and they are all of a stature and port which the best shaped amongst us would envy the shapes which mothers give to their childrens heads however cannot be justified there are in this continent some nations which they call flatheads whose foreheads are very flat and the top of their heads somewhat lengthened this shape is not the work of nature it is mothers that give it to their children as soon as born for this end they apply to their foreheads and to the back part of their heads two masses of clay or of some other heavy matter which they bind on tighter and tighter till the skull has taken the shape they wish this operation is very painful to the child and makes it shed at the nose a whitish matter pretty thick but neither this circumstance nor the cries of the infant alarm the mother jealous of giving it a handsome appearance on the other hand many of the algonquins are called roundheads their distinction and beauty consisting in having their heads perfectly round which shape mothers take care very early to give them  they are of a very swarthy complexion and many about florida of a dirty dark red but this is not natural the frequent paints and frictions they use give this red color and considering how much exposed they are to the sun in summer and the smoke in winter it is a wonder they are not still darker  the common idea of savages has been that they are a hairy people but the savages of north america are quite the reverse there is not a hair on their whole bodies except on the head eyebrows and eyelashes and yet their children are born with a thin hair and pretty long all over their bodies but it disappears after eight days old men have some hairs on their chin as some old women have with us the hair on their heads are very black that on their eyebrows and eyelashes they pull out by the roots they esteem this want of hair a great beauty and think europeans with beards frightful  from their plain manner of living they are very swift of foot one man charlevoix tells us assured him that before he had eaten any bread he could travel on foot forty leagues a day and commonly without fatigue but that since he had been used to bread he could not travel with the same ease  they are almost without exception great walkers will patiently endure cold hunger and fatigue and bear all misfortunes with such fortitude and resignation as to enable them bravely to encounter the prospect of ill and render the mind serene under the pressure of adversity  between hudsons bay and california there are many tribes of indians some of whom are known to europeans particularly the nehethawa indians the assinnepoetucs the fallindians the sussees the blackfeet indians the bloodindians and the paegans these are names they give themselves and it it is beyond a doubt that there are european traders settled among them from the other side of the continent i mean the spaniards making their inland excursions from california as we do from canada and hudsons bay  all these indians are much inclined to a lean habit of body and a corpulent indian is a much greater curiosity than a sober one this may be owing to their wandering life as their country abounds with innumerable herds of deer elks and buffaloes they frequently make great slaughter among them from a maxim that the more they kill the more they have to kill to which notion they are as much bigoted as the greatest enthusiast and though they sometimes find the folly of this maxim to their cost suffering occasionally such extreme hunger through it that parents have been reduced to the sad necessity of devouring their own offspring yet they have pursued it yet they have a philosophy that reconciles all this and a degree of composure superior to most men an indian after being out a whole day upon the hunt exposed to the bleakest winds and most penetrating cold without the least thing to satisfy the calls of nature comes home warms himself at the fire smokes a few pipes of tobacco and then retires to rest as calm as if in the midst of plenty but this does not proceed from insensibility for if he happens to have a family and this family is reduced to extremity of want his affection for them gets the better of his philosophy and he gives way to the most pungent sorrow he imputes his distress and want to supernatural causes and to the capricious will of some invisible agent whom he supposes to preside over all his undertakings  though i have said that these savages will take pride in overreaching an european in trade where trade is not concerned we shall find instances of honesty and fidelity among them that would do honor to a people governed by the wisest laws and restrained by religion from the commission of every enormity  if one of these savages commits murder or any other enormous crime his conscience may upbraid him but he is so far from fearing corporal danger from that society whose peace he has disturbed that he will range through the wilds of a pathless country and seek a living where he pleases without fear of retaliation for the country is so extensive that he will find out a spot to live in unmolested hurons where the offended party cannot or dare not go in search of him  this instance of savage liberty for i shall speak again of their laws is just mentioned to show that though the indian is guilty of taking away the life of a fellow creature though he glories in the commission of dextrous theft and will without remorse exercise every injustice on his neighbor with impunity yet as he is not restrained by divine or human laws from such acts of outrage nor does the idea of temporal or eternal punishment excite compunction in his mind surely these enormities are not of so deep a dye as if committed by one whose mind is enlightened and who is supposed to have a more just sense of the claims of society and the injunctions of religion  nations are not distinguished here by their dress the men when it is hot have often only something of an apron to cover their nakedness in winter they clothe themselves more or less according to the climate they wear on their feet a sort of sandals made of roebuck skins smoked their stockings are also skins or pieces of stuffs which they wrap round their legs a waistcoat made of skin covers them to the waist and they wear over that a rug or blanket when they can get one or else make themselves a robe of bearskin with the hair inwards the womens waistcoats reach just below their knees and when it is very cold or when they travel they cover their heads with their blanket or their robe some have little caps like scullcaps others a sort of capuchin fastened to their waistcoats and a piece of stuff that serves them for a petticoat and covers them from the waist to the middle of the leg  they are all ambitious of having shirts and shifts but never put them under their waistcoats till they are dirty and then they wear them till they drop to pieces for they never wash them their waistcoats like their sandals are generally smokedried to give them a black color and rubbed to supple them after this they are occasionally washed  the dress of the indians between hudsons bay and california consists of a pair of stockings made of leather dressed fine and pliable like shammy a sort of loose jacket with sleeves of the same kind and over all is thrown a dressed buffaloskin or a blanket young men dress their hair in different forms and paint their faces according to their fancies but men advanced in years seldom tie their hair or paint their faces the womens dress is like the mens caps are very seldom worn by either male or female but a dressed otterskin is frequently wound round the heads of the men the major part of which hangs down the back see the plate of the buffalopound  more to the southward many make various figures all over their bodies by pricking or puncturing themselves others only in some parts this is not done merely for ornament but they say it defends them from the cold renders them less sensible of the other injuries of the air and frees them from the persecutions of the gnats it is about virginia only that they prick themselves all over in canada the greatest part are satisfied with some figures of birds serpents or other animals and even of leaves and such like figures according to their fancy often in the face and sometimes even on the eyelids many women are marked on the parts of the face that answer to the jawbones to prevent the toothache  the operation is not painful in itself it is performed in this manner they begin by tracing on the skin the figure they intend to make then in these lines they prick little holes close together with the fins of a fish or with needles so as to draw blood this done they rub the part so pricked with charcoaldust and other colors well ground and powdered these powders sink into the skin and the figures are never effaced but soon after the skin swells and forms a kind of scab accompanied with inflammation and if the weather is too hot or the operation has been carried too far there is danger of life  the colors they use on these occasions are those with which they dye skins made from certain earths and the bark of some trees the men add to this ornament the down of swans or other birds which they strew upon their hair after it has been greased like powder they add to this feathers of all colors and bunches of the hair of diverse animals all placed in an odd manner the placing of their hair sometimes standing up like bristles on one side and flatted on the other or dressed in a variety of fashions pendants in their ears and sometimes in their nostrils a great shell of porcelain hanging about their neck or in their breast some crowns made of plumage of scarce birds the claws feet or heads of birds of prey little horns of roebucks all these things make up their finery  it is observable that the men take very little pains to adorn any part but their heads it is just the reverse with the women they wear scarcely any thing on the head are fond only of their hair and would think themselves disgraced if it was cut off when therefore at the death of a relation they cut off any part of it they mean by this to show the greatest grief for their loss to preserve their hair they grease it often and powder it with the dust of sprucebark and sometimes with vermillion they then wrap it up in the skin of an eel or serpent and suffer it thus to hang down in tails to their waist with respect to their faces they content themselves with tracing some lines on them with vermillion or other colors  their nostrils are never bored and it is only among some nations that they bore their ears when they do they wear in them as do the men pendants of china beads when dressed on galadays they have robes painted with all sorts of figures with little collars of porcelain set on them and a kind of border worked with porcupines hair which they paint also of various colors in the same manner they ornament their cradles which are made of light wood and have at the upper end hoops of cedar to keep off the covering from the childs face  childrens bodies not being confined in their infancy as with us they are very supple in their limbs and much stronger in proportion than we are mothers suckling them a long time for six or seven years adds not a little to their strength as does the hardy manner in which they are brought up as soon as they leave the cradle and can crawl on their hands and feet they are suffered to go where they will quite naked into the water into the woods into the dirt and into the snow this makes them subject to disorders in the stomach and lungs which destroy them early but inures them whilst they live to great hardships and fatigue in summer they run as soon as they are up to the river or into the lakes and continue there a part of the day playing about like fish in fine weather  their villages have generally no regular form they are a heap of cabins without order or being set in a line some like carthouses others like tunnels built of bark supported by some few posts sometimes plastered on the outside with mud in a coarse manner but built with less art neatness and solidity than the cabins of the beavers in this country they are generally from    to  0 feet broad and often a hundred in length containing several fires for as many families about  0 feet between each fireplace  when the floor is not sufficient for all the inhabitants to sleep on the young people lie on a wide bench or kind of broad shelf about five or six feet high that runs the whole length of the cabin the furniture and provisions are over this placed on pieces of wood put across the roof before the door is usually a kind of porch where the young people sleep in summer and which serves for a woodhouse in the winter the doors are made of bark fixed up like the umbrella of a window and never shut close these cabins have neither chimnies nor windows but an opening is left in the middle of the roof by which part of the smoke goes out which they are obliged to shut when it rains or snows and then if they would not be blinded and suffocated with smoke they must put out their fires  they fortify themselves better than they lodge some villages are pretty will pallisadoed with redoubts where they always take care to have a good provision of water and stones these pallisadoes are double and sometimes treble and have commonly battlements at the last enclosure the posts they are composed of are intervoven with branches of trees that leave no place open before they knew the use of firearms this was sufficient to maintain a long siege every village has a pretty large open place but seldom of a regular figure  the country they inhabit is very wild and uncultivated but not so much as that which they choose for hunting it is a long march to reach it and they carry on their backs all they want for five or six months through ways sometimes so frightful that one would suppose no wild beast could come there in the hunting season they encamp on the spot erecting a temporary cabin with poles fixed in the snow and covering it with bark in a conical form but the pieces of bark are so illjoined together that the wind blows through on all sides  the setting up of these cabins is the work only of half an hour branches of pines serve them for matts and they have no other bed the snow heaped round about them forms a sort of wall which the winds cannot penetrate and by the side and under the shelter of this wall they sleep as quietly on these branches covered with a poor skin as on the softest bed  there being no outlet in these cabins at top for the smoke there is constantly a cloud above but the savages accustomed to lie on the ground are always below this cloud  on such expeditions the savages are followed by a great number of dogs which are very much attached to them being never fondled they are not fawning but are bold and skilful hunters every man has a great many of these dogs for they are often killed by the teeth and horns of wild animals which they attack with a courage that nothing can daunt their masters taking little care to feed them and living by what they can catch they are always very lean having little or no hair on their backs they are very sensible of the cold and if they cannot get at the fire will lie down on the first savage they approach and if he awakes in the night he will find himself almost smothered with two or three dogs  their villages being always situated near woods or on the side of some water and often between both as soon as the air begins to grow warm they are very much persecuted with musquitoes and other small flies a much more grievous persecution then the smoke and which they are often obliged to increase to get rid of these insects  the nastiness alone of the cabins and the stench which naturally arises from it is a real punishment to any one but a savage it is easy to judge how far both must go among people who never change their linen or clothes but when they will hang on their backs no longer and who take no care to wash them in summer they bathe every day but rub themselves immediately after with oil or grease of a strong scent extracted from the seed or root of sunflowers  all they eat is not only without any seasoning and commonly very insipid but there reigns in their meals a slovenliness which exceeds all description there are few animals but what feed cleaner they live a good deal on maize which is wholesome grain nourishing and of light digestion it is preserved by boiling it in lie and when they use it it is again boiled in water or in broth and eat with a little salt it is not an unpleasant food but some think the frequent use of it injurious as the lie gives it a corrosive quality of this grain they make the sagamitty which is the most common food of the savages they broil it pound it take off the husk and make a kind of broth of it they love grease and a few pound of candles in a kettle of sagamitty is an excellent soup they even sometimes put things into it which cannot be mentioned and are surprised to see our stomachs turn at it  the nations of the south have only vessels of baked earth to dress their meat in canada and all the north they use wooden kettles and make the water boil by throwing in redhot flints since their connection with us they use iron and tinkettles among the western nations they substitute wild oats for maize  among the wandering savages who never cultivate the earth when the chase and fishery fails their only resource is a kind of moss which grows on certain rocks and which is called tripe of the rocks it is very insipid and has but little substance and is barely sufficient to keep them from starving i have heard it affirmed says charlevoix by persons of credit that some savages eat by way of dainty a sort of maize lest to rot as we do hemp in standing water and take it out black and stinking and those who have a liking to this strange mess will not lose any of the muddy settlement that drops from it the very smell of which makes the stomachs of others heave it was probably necessity that discovered this secret and if this does not give it all it is relish nothing proves more clearly that there is no disputing about tastes they have now adopted the use of the potatoes common to the west indian islands and find they thrive very well in louisiana  the little works of the women and which are their common employment in the cabins are to make thread of the inner membranes of the bark of a tree which they call white wood and they work it much as we do hemp they also dye every thing and make a variety of articles with bark and ornament them with figures in porcupines hair they make little cups and other wooden utensils paint and embroider buckskins and knit girdles and garters with the wool of the buffalo  for the most part they help one another in the work of the field and when it is time to gather in the harvest apply to the men for assistance with their maize they sow our running kidneybeans and the stalk of the maize supports them sunflowers watermelons and pumpkins they also raise in abundance but before they sow the seed make it shoot in smoke in light and black earth  as for the men they glory in their idleness and in reality pass above half their lives in doing nothing from a persuasion that daily labor disgraces a man and is only the duty of the women man they say is only made for war hunting and fishing but they make all the implements necessary for these great exercises such as arms nets canoes rigging their snowshoes calling only occasionally the women to assist them christian savages employ themselves in other things but only by way of penance  since america has been peopled they are in no want of convenient tools for all their work before this they were greatly embarrassed to cut down their trees and fit them for use they burnt them at the root and to split and cut them used hatchets made of flints which did not break but took up a great deal of time to sharpen them to fix them in a handle they cut off the head of a young tree made a notch in it as if they would have grafted it in which they thrust the head of the hatchet after some time the tree by growing together held the hatchet so tight that it would not come out they then cut the tree to such a length as they would have the handle  chap ii of their characters such savages as have been converted to christianity retain nothing of their birth and original but what is valuable that is to say the simplicity and freedom of the first age of the world with the addition of grace the faith of the patriarchs a sincere piety that rectitude and docility of heart which is the character of good men an incredible innocence of manners a pure christianity on which the world has never breathed its contagious air and often actions of the most heroic virtue  even in their natural character with a savage appearance and manners and customs entirely barbarous there is observable among them a social kindness free from almost all the imperfections which so often disturb the peace of society among us they appear to be without passion but they do that in cold blood and sometimes through principle which the most violent and unbridled passion produces in those who give no ear to reason they seem to lead the most wretched life in the world and they were perhaps the only happy people on earth before the knowledge of the objects which so much work upon and seduce us had excited in them desires which ignorance kept in supineness and which have not as yet made any great ravages among them we discover in them a mixture of the purest and most gentle manners the imperfections of wild beasts and virtues and qualities of the heart and mind which do the greatest honor to human nature one would think at first that they have no form of government that they acknowledge neither laws nor subordination and that living in an entire independance they suffer themselves to be solely guided by chance and the wildest caprice nevertheless they enjoy almost all the advantages that a well regulated authority can procure from the bestgoverned nations born free and independent they look with horror even on the shadow of a despotic power but seldom depart from certain principles and customs founded on good sense which are to them a substitute for laws and which in some measure supply the place of a lawful authority they will not bear the least restraint but reason alone keeps them in a kind of subordination which for being voluntary is not the less effectual to obtain the desired end  a man highly esteemed by them would find them docile enough and would make them do almost what he pleased but it is not easy to obtain their esteem to such a degree they never give it but to merit and superior merit of which they are as good judges as those amongst us who think they have the most discernment  they rely much on physiognomy and perhaps there are no men in the world who are better judges of it the reason is they have none of that respect for men which so readily seduces us and studying only pure nature they have a perfect knowledge of it not being slaves as we are to ambition and interest the equality of conditions is no way necessary to the support of their society of course we seldom meet with those haughty spirits who full of their own grandeur or merit fancy themselves of a different species disdaining the rest of mankind by whom of consequence they are never trusted or beloved here all men conceive themselves on an equality and in man what they most esteem is the man himself here is no distinction of birth no prerogative allowed to rank which hurts the rights of individuals no preeminence given to merit that inspires pride and makes other people feel too much their inferiority they have perhaps less delicacy of sentiment than among us but they have more justness religion alone can bring the good qualities of this people to perfection and cure their evil ones but devoid of it as they are we can in their most indifferent actions find some traces of the primitive religion which escapes the observation of those who do not consider them with attention because they are still more effaced through want of instruction than altered by a mixture of a superstitious worship or fabulous tradition  let us be more particular fathers and mothers neglect nothing to inspire their children with certain principles of honor which they preserve all their lives but of which they often make a bad application and in this their whole education consists when they give them instructions on this head it is always in an indirect way the most common is to relate to them the brave actions of their ancestors or of their countrymen the young people are fired at these stories and are never easy till they find an opportunity of imitating the examples they are taught to admire to correct them for their faults they use entreaties and tears but never menaces for menaces would make no impression on spirits prepossessed with an opinion that no person has a right to use compulsion  a mother who sees her daughter behave ill cries on the daughters asking the cause of her tears she is satisfied with saying you disgrace me it seldom happens that this way of reproving is not effectual but since their intercourse with europeans those and those only who are converted to christianity or are settled in the colonies chastise their children the greatest chastisement however is throwing a little water in the childs face girls have been known to hang themselves for having only received a slight reprimand from their mothers or a few drops of water in their faces and who have given notice of it by saying you shall lose your daughter the greatest misfortune is that it is not to virtue they exhort their children but to revenge  one would expect that a childhood so badly disciplined should be followed by a youth of turbulence and corruption no they are naturally calm and early masters of themselves reason guides them more than other men and in these northern climes their constitution does not incline them to excess or debauchery yet we find some customs among them in which chastity is entirely disregarded but more from superstition than depravity  the hurons till their intercourse with europeans were very lascivious and brutal in their pleasures young persons of both sexes abandoned themselves without shame to all manner of dissoluteness and it was esteemed no crime for a girl to prostitute herself their parents were the first to engage them in this way and many for interest did the same by their wives many never married but took young women to serve them as they said for companions and all the difference they made between these concubines and their lawful wives was that with the first an agreement was made indeed all their children were on the same footing which in a country where there are no estates to inherit can produce no inconvenience  in the southern countries they have but little restraint in the article of women who on their side are very lascivious and hence has arose that corruption of manners which has infected the northern nations the irroquois were chaste enough till they were conversant with the illinois and other neighboring people of louisiana effeminaces and lust were in these parts carried to the highess excess there are among them some men who are not ashamed to dress themselves as women submit to all female employment from whence ensued corruption that cannot be named these effeminate persons never marry but abandon themselves to the most infamous passions they are however treated with the greatest contempt  the greatest part of them have a nobleness and equality of soul to which with all the helps we can obtain from philosophy and religion we seldom arrive always masters of themselves in the most sudden calamities not the least alteration in their countenances is perceived a prisoner who knows in what his captivity will end or which is perhaps more surprising is still uncertain of his fate does not lose on this account a quarter of an hours sleep even the first emotions do not find them at a fault  a huron captain was one day insulted and struck by young man those who were present would have punished this audaciousness on the spot let him alone said the captain did not you feel the earth tremble  he is sufficiently informed of his folly  their constancy in suffering pain is beyond all expression a young woman shall be a whole day in labor without making one cry if she showed the least weakness she would be esteemed unworthy to be a mother because as they say she would bring forth cowards  nothing is more common than to see persons of all ages and of both sexes suffer for many hours and sometimes many days together the sharpest effects of fire and all that the most industrious fury can invent to make it most painful without letting a sigh escape they are employed for the most part during their sufferings in encouraging their tormentors by the most insulting reproaches  an outagama who was burnt by the illinois with the utmost cruelty perceiving a frenchman among the spectators begged of him to help his enemies to torment him and on being asked why he made this request replied because i should have the comfort of dying by the hands of a man my greatest grief adds he is that i never killed a man but said the illinois you have killed such and such a person as for the illinois replied the prisoner i have killed enough of them but they are no men  some men would call this conduct insensibility but to elevate the soul above the sense of pain to such a degree there must always be an effort which common souls are not capable of the savages exercise themselves in this all their lives and accustom their children to it from their tenderest years little boys and girls have been seen to tie themselves together by one arm and put a lighted coal between them to see which would shake it off first in short we must allow with cicero that a habit of labor makes us bear pain more easily but what proves most that this kind of insensibility in these barbarians is the effect of true courage is that it is not found in all of them  it is not surprising that with such greatness of soul and such elevated sentiments these savages should be intrepid in danger and of a courage proof against every thing it is true that in their way they expose themselves as little as possible it bring their chief glory not to buy their victory too dear and their nations not being numerous they are unwilling to weaken them but when they must fight they do it like lions and the sight of their blood does but increase their strength and their courage  but what surprises infinitely in men whose whole outward appearance proclaims nothing but barbarity is to see them behave to each other with such kindness and regard that is not to be found among the most civilized nations this doubtless proceeds from the words mine and thine being as yet unknown to these savages we are equally charmed with that natural and unaffected gravity which reigns in all their behavior in all their actions and the greatest part of their diversions as likewise with the civility and deference they show to their equals and the respect of young people to the aged and lastly never to see them quarrel among themselves with those indecent expressions and the oaths and curses so common amongst us all which are proofs of good sense and a great command of temper  one of their principles and that of which they are most jealous is that one man owes nothing to another but from this bad maxim they draw a good inference that is to say that we must never do an injury to any person from whom we have received no wrong there is nothing wanting to their happiness but to behave between nation and nation as they do between private persons and never to attack any people of whom they have no cause to complain  on the other hand it must be allowed that what we most admire in the savages is not always pure virtue that constitution and vanity have a great share in it and that their best qualities are tarnished by great vices these men who at first view appear to us so contemptible of all mankind have the greatest contempt for all others and the highest opinion of themselves they are distrustful and suspicious of europeans treacherous when their interest is concerned dissemblers and revengeful in the extreme time does not wear out their revenge it is the most precious inheritance which they leave to their children and which is transmitted from generation to generation till they find an opportunity to execute it  as to what we call more particularly the qualities of the heart these savages do not value themselves much on or consider them as virtues friendship compassion gratitude attachment are with them less the effect of a good disposition than of reflection and instinct the care they take of orphans widows and the infirm and the hospitality they exercise in such an admirable manner are to them only the consequence of their persuasion that all things ought to be common among men fathers and mothers have a fondness for their children which rises even to weakness but which does not incline them to make them virtuous and which appears to be truly animal children on their part have no natural gratitude for their parents and even treat their fathers sometimes with indignity the following is a public notoriety and will give the reader a good idea of their notions on this head  an irroquois who served a long time in the european troops against his own nation and even as an officer met his father in an engagement and was going to kill him when he discovered who he was he withheld his hand and said to him you have once given me life and now i give it to you let me meet with you no more for i have paid the debt i owed you nothing can better prove the necessity of education and that nature alone does not sufficiently instruct us in our most essential duties and what demonstrates more evidently the advantage of the christian religion is that it has produced in the hearts of those barbarians in all these respects a very wonderful change  but if the savages know not how to taste the sweets of friendship they have at least discovered its usefulness every one amongst them has a friend nearly of his own age between whom there is a mutual engagement which is indissoluble two men thus united for their common interest are obliged to do every thing and to run all hazards to assist and succor each other death itself as they believe separates them only for a time they rely on meeting again in the next world never to part more being persuaded that they shall there want each others assistance  we must acknowledge that at the first view the life they lead appears very hard but when it is considered that custom is second nature and that the liberty they enjoy sufficiently compensates the loss of those conveniences they are deprived of the hardship disappears what we see every day in some beggars by profession and in several persons in countrylife gives us a sensible proof that we may be happy in the midst of indigence but these savages are still more happy first because they think themselves so secondly because they are in the peaceable possession of the most precious of all the gifts of nature and lastly because they are entirely ignorant of and have not even a desire to know the false advantages which we so much esteem which we purchase at the expense of real good and of which we have so little true enjoyment  we cannot even say that they like their own way of living only because they are not acquainted with the sweetness of ours for many of the french have lived like them and have been so well pleased with it as not to be prevailed on to return though they might have been much at their case in the colony they left and on the other hand savage children have been taken from the cradle brought up amongst europeans with much care and nothing omitted to prevent their knowing what passed among their parents and yet the force of blood has prevailed over education and as soon as they found themselves at liberty they have torn their garments to pieces and run into the woods in search of their countrymen whose way of life seemed to them more pleasing than that they led before  the irroquois i have mentioned whose name was la plaque and who in saving his fathers life in an engagement thought he had fully satisfied all the debt he owed him was made a lieutenant in the french service to fix him because he was a very brave man but he would not continue in their way of living he returned to his nation only carrying with him the french vices without correcting any of those he brought with him he loved women to excess he was well shaped his valor and his brave actions gave him great reputation he had a great deal of wit and very amiable manners he had many intrigues with other mens wives and his disorders went so far that it was debated in the council of his canton whether they should not take him off it was however concluded by the majority of votes to spare his life because being extremely courageous he might people the country with good warriors  with all their defects it is certain as men they have great advantages over us the chief of which is a greater perfection of their senses both external and internal in spite of the snow that dazzles their eyes and the smoke which almost smothers them for six months in the year their sight never decays their hearing is extremely quick and their smelling is exquisite they smell fire a long time before they discover it on account of this perfection of smelling they cannot bear the scent of musk nor any strong smell  their apprehension is wonderful it is enough for them to have been once in a place to have an exact idea of it which is never effaced let a forest be ever so large and pathless when they have well considered certain marks by which they guide themselves they will cross it without wandering  the inhabitants of nova scotia and of the environs of the gulf of st lawrence in their canoes of bark to pass over to the labrador coast in search of the eskimaux with whom they were at war would go  0 or  0 leagues on the main sea without a compass and make the land exactly at the place they proposed the pole star is their guide by night and in the most cloudy weather they will follow the sun many days without making any mistake the best clock cannot give better information of the progress of the sun then they can by viewing the sky so that do what you can to put them out of their way it is very rare that they lose their route they are born with this talent it is not the fruit of observation nor of long custom youth who never before went out of their village travel as securely as those who have been most used to range the country  as to the stars and planets the causes of the celestial appearances meteors and the like they are not only perfectly ignorant of but indifferent about an eclipse they suppose to be a great combat in the heavens and they shoot many arrows into the air to drive away the pretended enemies of the sun and moon the hurons when the moon is eclipsed suppose she is sick and to recover her from this sickness make a great noise as the chinese do from a conception that the planet is attacked by a dragon the hurons accompany their noise with many ceremonies and prayers and never fail to fall upon the dogs with sticks and stones to set them a yelping because they believe the moon loves these animals  they are not better acquainted with the nature of thunder which some take for a voice of a particular species of men flying in the air others for the noise of certain birds unknown to them  their manner of dividing time is by months some reckoning twelve some thirteen they have not among them any distinction of weeks nor any names for particular days they have four fixed parts in the day sunrise and sunset noon and midnight they have no chronological computations and if they preserve the epochas of certain events they cannot comprehend the exact time since they happened they are satisfied with remembering the facts and have invented several ways of preserving the remembrance of them by keeping in their houses strings of beads on which are wrought figures that revive the memory of transactions in counting they reckon from one to ten the tens by  0 to a  00 and the hundreds by  0 to  000 beyond this they cannot go but the beauty of their imagination is equal to its vivacity and this appears in all their discourse they are quick at repartee and their speeches are full of shining passages that would have been applauded in the public assemblies of rome and athens their eloquence has something in it so strong so natural so pathetic that art cannot attain it and which the greeks so much admired in the barbarians and though it does not seem to be supported by action though they make no gestures and do not raise their voice we feel they are thoroughly affected with what they say and their eloquence is persuasive  it would be strange that with such a fine imagination they should not have an excellent memory though destitute of all the artificial helps we have invented to assist us or supply its defects it is scarcely credible of how many matters with what particular circumstances and with how much order they treat in their councils on some occasions however they use little sticks to recollect the articles they are to discuss and by this they form a local memory so certain that they will speak four or five hours together without forgetting any thing and without the least hesitation their narration is clear and exact and though they use many allegories and other figures it is animated and has all the pleasing turns which their language affords  an outaouais who was a bad christian and a great drunkard being asked what he thought brandy was made of which he loved so well said it was an extract of tongues and hearts for added he when i have drank it i fear nothing and i talk to admiration  chap iii of their amusements and dances their amusements are the game of the dish the game of the straws and that of the bat with sundry dances  the game of the dish or bones is what they are most fond of at which they will sometimes lose their rest and in some measure their reason they will hazard at it all they possess and many will not quit it till they are stripped and have lost all they have in their cabins some have been so rash as even to stake their liberty this game is played by two persons each has eight little bones the size of apricotstones with six unequal surfaces two of which are painted black they make them jump up by striking the ground or a table with a hollow dish in which they are contained when they have no dish they throw them up in the air with their hands if in falling they come up all one color the thrower wins five the game is  0 up and they substract the number gained by the opposite party five bones of the same color wins one for the first time but the second time they win the game a less number wins nothing he that wins the game continues playing and another takes the losers place a whole village is often concerned in this game one village will often play against another each party chooses a marker at every decisive throw they shout the players appear like people possessed and the spectators are not more calm they all make a thousand contorsions talk to the bones load the spirit or genius of the adverse party with imprecations and the whole village echoes with howlings if all this does not recover their luck by treating the company they may put off the party till next day  then they prepare to return to the engagement each invokes his genius and throws some tobacco into the fire to his honor above all things they consult him for lucky dreams at break of day they proceed again to play but if the losers fancy for they are very superstitious that the goods in their cabins made them unlucky the first thing they do is to change them all great parties commonly last five or six days and often continue all night in the mean time as all the persons present at least those who are concerned in the game are in agitation that deprives them of reason as they quarrel and fight which never happens among the savages but on these occasions and in drunkenness we may well say that when they have done playing they must want rest  it happens sometimes that these parties of play are made by order of the physician or at the request of a sick person in hopes of a cure there needs no more for this purpose than a dream of one or the other which is always conceived as the order of some spirit they then prepare themselves for play with a great deal of care assemble for several nights to try and see who has the luckiest hand consult their genii fast and the married persons observe continence and all to obtain a favorable dream every morning they relate their dreams and he whose dream is supposed most favorable is made to stand next him who holds the dish they will even go a great way to fetch him and if through age or infirmity he cannot walk they will carry him on their shoulders  the game at straws is thus played these straws are small reeds about the size of a wheat straw and about six inches long two hundred and one of these being shuffled together after a thousand contorsions and invokings of their genii they separate them with a kind of awl into nine parcels of  0 each and one of    every one then draws a parcel and he who gets that containing    wins the point agreed on the whole game is  0 or  0  the game of the bat is played with a ball and bent sticks ending in a kind of racket they set up two posts at a certain distance according to the number of players as bounds for instance if there are  0 the distance between the posts is half a league the players are divided into two bands each having his station and their business is to strike the ball to the post of the adverse party without letting it fall to the ground and without touching it with the hand for in either of these cases the game is lost and they are so dextrous at catching the ball with their bats that sometimes one game will last many days together  of their dances the first is merely for diversion as soon as it is night they set up in a large cabin several posts in a ring in the midst of which sit the music on each post is placed a packet of down of different colors the young people mingled together dance round these posts the young women have also a tuft of colored down in their bosoms from time to time a young man steps out of the ring takes from the posts a little of the down of which the girl he likes has some in her bosom of the same color puts it on his head dances round her and by a sign appoints her a place of rendezvous when the dance is over the feast begins and lasts all day at night every one retires and the young women manage matters so well that in spite of the vigilance of their mothers they steal to the place of assignation and soon after become mothers themselves  another dance among them in which five or six women dance is called the firedance by the sound of a drum and a chichikoue which is a kind of calibash full of pebbles and rattled they range themselves in a line side by side with their arms hanging down and without breaking the line sing and make some steps in cadence backwards and forwards this is at night in a cabin by firelight when the women have danced some time the fire is put out and a savage with a lighted coal in his mouth makes his appearance and dances and by the faint gloom of this coal he looks like a spectre the mixture of dances songs and instruments and the fire of the coal which continues for near halfanhour has something odd and savage in it the contrast of the voices of the men and women at a certain distance has a pretty effect and if they had a good manner of singing it would be a pleasure to hear them sing  their art of being able to keep a burning coal in their mouths is a secret they keep to themselves they rub the inside of their mouths with a particular plant some say it is the leaf of the canada anemony garlic and onions will produce this effect and secure the part from burning for a short time but the plant these savages use will secure them for more than halfanhour  there are dances prescribed by their physicians for the cure of the sick but they are generally very lascivious they are almost always in circles to the sound of the drum and the chichikoue the men apart from the women as their music has but two or three notes and is continually repeated they dance always in time  their other dances are military one is rather a military feat the warriors are the actors and it seems instituted merely to give them an opportunity of publishing their great achievements in war they decorate the calumet with feathers and set it up in the most conspicuous place among them calumet is a norman word and signifies reed the calumet of the savages is properly the tube of a pipe but they comprehend under this name the pipe also as well as its tube the tube of that for ceremonial uses is made of a light wood painted with different colors and adorned with the head tails and feathers of the finest birds the bowl is made of a reddish marble the custom is to smoke in the calumet when it is accepted and perhaps there is no instance where the agreement has been violated which was made by this acceptance the savages are at least persuaded that the great spirit would not leave such a breach of faith unpunished if in the midst of battle the enemy presents a calumet it is allowable to refuse it but if they receive it they must instantly lay down their arms and peace is the consequence there are calumets for every kind of treaty in making those smoke in the calumet with whom they would trade or treat they call the sun for witness and as a guarantee of their engagement for they never fail to blow the smoke toward the sun there are persons who have supposed this calumet to have originated in the caduceus of mercury and the more so because they engrave a serpent on the tube but as the caduceus has no relation to the sun and there is no tradition among the savages that gives any room to judge they ever had any knowledge of the greek mythology it is most rational to suppose that these people could not find any signs more natural to denote a strict union than to smoke in the same pipe especially if the smoke they draw is offered to a deity who puts the seal of religion to it to smoke in the same pipe therefore in token of alliance is the same thing as to drink out of the same cup as has been practiced at all times by many nations  now this calumet being set up in view the band of music and the dancers round it the spectators divided here and there in companies the women separate from the men all seated on the ground and dressed in their finest robes at some distance make a pretty show  before the music a post is erected on which at the end of every dance a warrior advances and gives a stroke with his hatchet this is the signal for silence and this man repeats with a loud voice some of his great feats and having received the applauses of the spectators goes takes his place again and the dance is continued which seems to have no meaning and consists wholly of contorsions  the dance of discovery is performed by one man and is a natural representation of all that passes in an expedition of war at first he advances slowly into the midst of the place where he remains for some time motionless after which he represents one after another the setting out of the warriors the march the encamping he goes on the discovery makes his approach stops to take breath then all on a sudden grows furious and one would imagine was going to kill every body then he appears more calm and takes one of the company as prisoner he makes a show of knocking another mans brains out levels his gun at a third and lastly sets up a running with all his might then stops and recovers himself this is to represent a retreat at first precipitate and afterward less so then he expresses by different cries the various affections of his mind during his last campaign and finishes by reciting all the brave actions he has performed in war  there are other dances less compounded designed merely to give the warriors an opportunity of relating their achievements he who gives the feast invites all the village by beat of drum and they meet in his cabin if it is large enough to contain them all the warriors dance one after another then striking on a post for silence they say what they please and stop from time to time to receive applause which is generally given in abundance but if he boasts of feats he never performed any person is allowed to rub the boasters head with dirt and ashes or play him any other trick he likes commonly they blacken his face saying what i do is to hide your shame for the first time you see the enemy you will turn pale this dance is always performed at night  in the western parts they have the dance of the bull in which the dancers form several circles and the music which is always the drum and the chichikoue is in the middle they never separate those of the same family the dancers do not join hands and every one carries in his hand his arms and his buckler all the circles do not turn the same way and though they caper much and very high they always keep time and measure  from time to time the chief of a family presents his shield which is covered with a bulls hide they all strike upon it and at every stroke he repeats some of his exploits then he goes and cuts a piece of tobacco at a post where some is hung and gives it to one of his friends if any one can prove that he has performed greater feats or had a share in those the other boasts of he has a right to take the piece of tobacco that was presented and give it to another this dance is followed by a feast  chap iv of the manner of hunting animals marriages births funerals etc as the canadian savages live chiefly by hunting it may not be unentertaining to give a description of their bearhunt which holds the first place in this part of their employ and which among those who are not converted to christianity is performed with the greatest superstition my readers may compare it with the mode the laplanders pursue and which is related in the first volume of this work  it is always a war chief who fixes the time and has the care of inviting the hunters this invitation is made with great ceremony and is followed with a fast of eight days during which they do not drink even a drop of water and their fasting is abstaining from all kinds of food in spite of the extreme weakness which such an abstinence occasions they never cease singing all the time it lasts this fast is to induce the genii or spirits to discover the places where they may find many bears some even do much more to deserve this favor several have been seen to cut their flesh in several parts of their bodies to render their genii or spirits more propitious but they do not ask their assistance to conquer these furious animals they wish only to be told where to find them as ajax did not ask jupiter to give him victory over his enemies but only daylight enough to make an end of his conquest  the savages supplicate also on the same account the manes of the beasts which they have killed in former huntings the fast being over and the place of the hunt being settled the chief who is chosen for the chase gives his party a great feast but no one dares be thereat till he has bathed that is till he has first plunged himself into the river if not frozen let the weather be ever so severe though they have fasted long at this feast they eat moderately the master of the feast eats nothing his whole business whilst his guests are eating being to relate his prowess at former huntings fresh invocations of the manes of dead beasts finish the repast then they begin their march equipped as for war their faces besmeared with black amid the acclamations of the whole village for the chase among these people is as noble as war the alliance of a good hunter is more sought after than that of a famous warrior but a man is not esteemed a good hunter till he has killed    great beasts in one day winter is the hunting season it does not require much running to catch them when the hunters think they have found the places where a great number are hid they form a circle of a quarter of a league in circumference more or less according to the number of hunters and thus draw nearer and nearer till they quite close in upon them and take them  when a bear is killed the hunter puts the end of his lighted pipe between his teeth blows into the bowl and thus filling the mouth and throat of the beast with smoke conjures its spirit to bear him no malice for what he has just done to the body and not to oppose him in his future huntings but as the spirit does not answer the hunter to know if his prayer is granted cuts the string under the bears tongue and keeps it till he returns to the village then they all throw with great ceremony and after many invocations these strings into the fire if they crackle and shrink up as they always do it is taken for a certain sign that the spirit of the bear is appeased  the hunters make good cheer as long as the chase lasts to see how they are received the praises bestowed upon them the pleased and selfsufficient airs they take upon themselves one would say they were returning from some grand expedition loaded with the spoils of a whole nation destroyed  i have already spoke largely of the bears in lapland but i cannot pass over what charlevoix says of the bears in canada he asserts that wherever the bears retreat in winter whether to a hollow tree or a cavern they make no provision there nor do they quit their retreat for six months that in fact a bear never eats for the space of such a winter they have been kept chained for six months together in the winterseason and without food and yet have been fat and clothed with a good fur whereas in july which is in rutting time they grow very lean the effect merely of jealousy but when this season is passed the bear grows fat again a bears whelp is as good eating as a lamb the dogs they hunt with are shaped like a wolf with upright ears and a long nose  i will now speak of the original  the original of this country is an animal which in germany poland and russia is called the elk or greatbeast it equals a horse in size the hindquarters are large the tail but one inch long the horns very high the legs and feet like those of a heart a long hair covers the withers the neck and upper part of the hams the head is about two feet long and he carries it out which gives him an illlook the muzzle is large and lessens in the upper part like that of a camel and its nostrils are so large that one may easily thrust in half ones arm its horns are not less long than those of a heart and much wider they are flat and forked like those of a deer and are renewed every year the hair of the original is a mixture of light gray and dark red it grows hollow as the beast grows old and never loses its elastic power beat it ever so long it springs up again matrasses are made of it and saddles its skin is strong soft and substantial and is made into shamois and excellent buff  the most northern nations of canada take this animal very easily and without danger the hunters divide themselves into two companies one embarks in canoes and these keeping at some distance from each other form a large semicircle the two ends of which touch the shore the other company on land perform much the same operation and enclose a large space then these hunters let go their dogs and rouse all the originals that are within that space and driving them forward oblige them to run into the water where they are fired on from all the canoes  this animal has another enemy namely the carcajou a sort of wild cat with a tail so long that it can twist it several times round its body when it comes up with an original it leaps upon him and fixing on his neck twists its long tail round it then tears out the jugular vein and thus destroys him  there being a great difference between the beavers of europe and those of canada i must not omit this opportunity of speaking of them the spoils of this animal has furnished this part of the world with the principal object of his trade it is of itself one of the wonders of nature and it may be to man a great example of foresight of industry skill and constancy in labor  the beaver or castor is the same creature it derived its latter name from an idea that when pursued by the hunters for its testicles rather than lose its life it will bite them off and cast them from him but this is an idle story the most valuable part of the beaver is its fur of which gloves and stockings are made being soft and warm  the beaver of canada is an amphibious quadruped which cannot remain long in water and yet can do without being in it provided it has the opportunity of washing itself occasionally the largest beaver is something under four feet long about    inches from one hip to another and weighs about  0 pounds its color varies according to the different climates where it is found in the most distant parts of the north they are commonly quite black though sometimes they are found there white in the more temperate countries they are brown and by degrees as they advance toward the south their color grows more and more light among the illinois they are almost of a sallow color and some have been found of a strawcolour it is further observed that the less black they are the less fur they have and of course their skins are less valuable  the castor or castoreum so much sought after by the druggists are four purses or bags in the lower belly of the beaver not its testicles they contain a soft resinous gluey matter mixed with small fibers of a strong smell and easily inflammable the beaverfur is too short to be spun and is fit only to mix with rabbitwool to make hats of if then there is any thing to admire in the beaver it is that its industry its foresight their unity and subordination among themselves their attention to procure conveniences the comfort of which brutes were formerly thought insensible of furnish man with more instruction than the ant to which the holy scriptures send the idle they are at least among the quadrupeds what the bees are amongst flying insects they have neither a king nor queen to govern them but by virtue of that instinct given to animals by him whose providence directs them every one knows what he has to do and every thing is done without confusion and with so much order as cannot be sufficiently admired perhaps after all we are so much astonished only for want of looking up to that supreme intelligence who makes use of those beings who want reason the better to display his wisdom and power and to teach us that our reason itself is frequently by our presumption the cause of our going astray  the first thing done by these creatures when they want to make a habitation is to assemble themselves three or four hundred together in order to build a little city of venice in the midst of water they first choose a place where they may find plenty of provisions and materials for building but above all they must have water if there is no lake or pond near they supply the defect by stopping the course of some brook by a dyke or causey for this purpose they cut some trees above the place where they intend to build three or four beavers set themselves about a great tree and will soon cut it down with their teeth this is not all they contrive it so well that it always falls on the side next the water that they may have less distance to carry it when they cut it to pieces sensible their materials are not so easily conveyed by land as by water they have nothing after to do but to roll these pieces into the water and guide them to the place where they are to be fixed these pieces are thicker or thinner longer or shorter as the nature and situation of the place require for one may say these architects conceive at once every thing that relates to their design sometimes they employ large trunks of trees which they lay flat sometimes the dam or causey as it is called here is made only of stakes some as thick as a mans thigh or less which they drive into the earth very near each other and interweave with small branches and every where fill up the hollow spaces with clay so well applied that not a drop of water can pass through and their tail which is four or five inches broad serves them not only for a trowel to build with but for a hod to carry their mortar to place and spread the clay they first use their paws then their tail the foundation of the dams are generally  0 or    feet thick but they decrease in thickness upwards so as to be not more than two feet thick at top all this is done in exact proportion for it is observed that the side toward the current of the water is always sloping so as to break the pressure of the water and the other side is perpendicular in short it would be difficult for our best workmen to make any thing more compact or regular the construction of their cabins is not less wonderful they are generally erected on piles in the midst of these little lakes which the dykes have made sometimes by the side of a river or at the extremity of a point that advances into the water their shape is round or oval and their roofs arched the walls are two feet thick formed like the causey and every where so well plastered with clay within that no air can enter twothirds of the building is out of the water and in this part every beaver has a separate place which he strews with leaves or small branches of fir it is always free from ordure and for this end besides the common door of the cabin and another outlet by which these creatures pass to bathe themselves there are several openings by which they can dung into the water the common cabins lodge eight or  0 beavers but some have been found which held thirty they are all near enough each other to have a communication  these animals are never surprised by the winter their buildings are completed by the end of september and then every one provides his stock for the winter whilst they go to and fro in the woods and fields they live on fruits and the bark and leaves of trees crayfish and other fish but when they are to provide for the winter they content themselves with soft woods such as the poplar and aspen they pile it up in such a manner that they can always take those pieces which are soaked in water and these piles are larger or smaller as the winter will prove longer or shorter which is as an almanac to the savages which never deceives them in regard to the cold when the melting of the snow causes floods and drowns their habitations they quit them till the month of july and then return to repair them and if they find they have been destroyed by hunters they make others there are a variety of stories respecting the sagacity of this animal but as i am not writing a natural history i must refer my readers to buffon and others who have written largely on this subject  but of all the numerous tribes of quadrupeds in this extensive country the buffalo merits a description not only on account of its being the most numerous but likewise for the utility every part of it is convertable to  the indians have various methods of killing the buffalo one of which is by cautiously approaching them when feeding the hunter upon this occasion lies upon his belly and will sometimes fire his gun  0 or  0 times without raising his head they also pursue them on horseback and shoot them with arrows and guns the general mode of taking them is by a pound constructed in the following manner  they are either of a circular or a square form and differ according to the manner of the nation by whom they are made the square ones about hudsonsbay are composed of trees laid one upon another to the height of about five feet each square side about  0 feet long on that side on which the animals are to enter a bank of earth is raised five feet high with an easy ascent to the top so as to be on a level with the top of the enclosure or the other side of the square this done a number of branches of trees are placed from each side of the front in a straight line from the raised hill to the distance of  00 feet the lines spreading continually from each other so as to be  00 feet apart at the distance of  00 feet from the pound these lines of trees are lengthened out by a number of poles    feet long erected at    feet distance from each other with a piece of buffalo dung on the top of each at the foot of each pole a man lies concealed in a buffaloskin to keep the animals in a straight direction to the pound these poles are also placed alike on each side always increasing a buffalo pound in breadth from side to side every preparation being now made three or four men set off on foot to find a herd of cows for bulls they consider of little value these they drive easily along till they arrive in the neighborhood of the pound when one man is dispatched to give notice to the other indians who immediately assemble on horseback on each side the herd keeping a proper distance so as not to frighten the animals thus are they conducted within the poles should they attempt to run out between them the men who are placed at the foot of each pole shake their skins which drives the herd to the opposite side where the other men do the same so that at last they are driven up the bank into the pound where falling in headlong one upon another some break their necks some their backs and some their legs and the confusion becomes so great within that though the height of the sides shall not exceed five feet none will make their escape  having mentioned horses it is necessary to say that those bred here are variously colored as our english horses are but as small as those found in the north of scotland they were originally imported by the spaniards on the eastern side of the continent and it is but lately that they have become common among the nehethawa indians who much esteem them and show more affection for them than they do for their wives many broils and animosities among the natives originate from a desire of being in possession of these animals one party generally commences hostilities by stealing the horses of their adversaries and they in return retaliate so that at length a mutual resentment takes place and war becomes absolutely necessary  the method of traveling and hunting in the snow in this country is not unlike the manner made use of in lapland and other northern countries a kind of snow shoes or scates they are here called racquets are about three feet long and in their greatest breadth    or    inches wide these are bound to the feet with thongs and they scud over the snow with them very fast their baggage they draw on sledges  in many nations of the algonquin language a plurality of wives is established and it is common enough for a man to marry all the sisters a custom founded on the notion they have that sisters will agree together better than strangers in this case all the wives are upon an equal footing but among the true algonquins they have two sorts of wives and the second are slaves to the first  the hurons and irroquois are very scrupulous with respect to marriage among them there must be no manner of relation between the parties to be married and even adoption is comprehended in this law but the husband if the wife dies first must marry her sister or in default of such the woman which his wifes family shall choose for him the reason they give for it is the same but it is mentioned deuteronomy    v   a husband who should forsake his wife without a lawful cause must expect many insults from her relations and a woman who should leave her husband without being forced to it by his illtreatment would pass her time still worse  among the miemis the husband has a right to cut off his wifes nose if she runs away from him but among the irroquois and the hurons they may part by consent this is done without noise and the parties thus separated may marry again  treaties of marriage are entirely carried on by the parents but the consent of the young couple is always asked in some places the women are in no haste to be married because they are allowed to make what trials of it they please and the ceremony of marriage only changes their condition for the worse in general there is great modesty in the young folks whilst their marriage is in negotiation but they say it was quite otherwise formerly but what is most incredible and yet wellattested is that in many places the newmarried couple are together a whole year living in perfect continence to show that they are married for friendship and not to gratify a sensual passion a young woman would be even pointed at that should happen to be with child the first year after her marriage after this it will be easier to believe what is said of the young peoples behavior during their courtship in the places where they are allowed to see one another in private for though custom admits them to have very private meetings yet in the greatest danger that chastity can be exposed to and even under the veil of night they say nothing passes against the rules of the utmost decorum and that not even a word is spoken that can give the least offense to modesty  during the preliminaries of marriage the young man is contented to go and sit by the side of the young woman in her cabin and if she suffers it and continues in her place it is taken for consent and the marriage is concluded but in the midst of all this deference and respect he gives some tokens that he will be soon master for among the presents he makes her there are some which ought less to be regarded as marks of friendship than as symbols and notices of the slavery to which she is going to be reduced such are the collar a long and broad band of leather which serves to draw loads the kettle and a billet this is to let her know that she is to carry burdens dress provisions and get wood for firing  the women in general are brought to bed without any pain and without any assistance but there are some who are a long time in labor and suffer much when this happens they give notice of it to the young people who all on a sudden and when the patient least expects it come and make great noises at the door of the cabin the surprise of which has such an effect upon her as instantly to procure her delivery the women never liein in their own cabins many are taken suddenly and bring forth their children whilst at work or on a journey for others when they find themselves near their time they make a little hut without the village where they remain  0 days after delivery the time being expired they extinguish all the fires of the cabin to which she is to return shake all the clothes and at her return light a new fire the same formalities are pretty nearly observed with respect to all the sex in the time of their terms and not only whilst these last but also whilst a woman is with child or gives suck and they commonly suckle their children three years the husband never approaches them nothing would be more praise worthy than this custom if both parties preserved the fidelity they owe to each other but there is often a failure on one side or the other and such is the corruption of the human heart that the wisest regulations often produce the greatest disorders it is even said that the use of certain simples which have a power to prevent the consequences of the womens infidelity is pretty common in this country  a mothers care to her child whilst in its cradle is as i have observed uncommon but the child is no sooner out of it than it is left to itself not through want of affection for that is never lost whilst they live but from a persuasion it is best to leave nature to herself and without any restraint the act which terminates the first stage of infancy is giving a name which among these people is an affair of importance  this ceremony is performed at a feast where no persons are present but of the same sex with the child that is to be named whilst they are eating the child is on its father or mothers knees who continually recommend it to its guardian genius new names are never invented each family has a certain number which they take by turns  when they talk to a man in common discourse they never call him by his proper name this would be impolite but give him the quality he has with respect to the person that speaks to him where there is no relation indeed or affinity between them they use the term of brother uncle nephew or cousin according to each others age or according to the value they have for the person they address  there are few men in the world that have less need of physic they are not only almost all of a healthy and strong constitution but they never knew the greatest part of european distempers till we came among them the gout gravel stone apoplexy and many other diseases so common in europe have not yet reached this part of the new world among the natural inhabitants of the country if they are at any time ill they apply to their jugglers whose chief employment is that of physic  they seldom consider a disease as merely natural or among the common remedies they use allow any to have in themselves the virtue of healing the great use they make of their simples is for wounds fractures dislocations and ruptures they blame the great incisions our surgeons make to cleanse wounds they squeeze out the juice of many plants and with this extract draw out all the corruption and even the splinters of broken bones stones iron and in general all foreign matter that remains in the wounded part these same juices are all the food the patient has till the wound is closed  whatever their knowledge may be it is certain they have very quick and sovereign remedies against the palsy dropsy and venereal disease in the last two a decoction of the shavings of guiacum wood and sassafras are their common specifics and they have a method of uniting a broken bone and making it solid in eight days  in acute diseases as in the pleurisy they apply cataplasms to the side opposite the pain which draw and prevent the humors from settling but their great remedy and preservative against all diseases is sweating on coming out of a sweatinghouse whilst the sweat runs down all parts of their bodies they will plunge themselves as do the russians into a river or if no water is near them they will get some person to throw the coldest water over them they frequently sweat themselves merely to recover the fatigue of a journey to calm their spirits and enable them to converse the better as soon as a stranger comes into a cabin they make a fire for him rub his feet with oil and then conduct him to a stove where his host keeps him company  when a sick man refuses all sorts of food they suppose him ill indeed in this case they advise with a juggler who at best is no better than a quack and these men have a singular method of not being answerable for events as soon as they perceive a patient has the symptoms of death they never fail to prescribe things too difficult to be put into execution so that they are awys sure of an excuse on account of their orders not having been punctually followed it is not to be conceived to what extravagancies they go on these occasions they will order some patients to counterfeit themselves mad in some diseases they order dances which are generally very lascivious one would think they aimed more to hasten the patients death than his cure but what shows the force of imagination is that these doctors with all their follies perform as many cures as ours do  in some savage nations of america when the distemper is desperate they kill the patient to put him out of his pain in the canton of onnontague they destroy young children that lose their mothers at their birth or bury them alive with them from a persuasion that another woman cannot nurse them and that they would pine to death but this barbarous custom has been lately laid aside some mothers forsake the diseased when the doctors give them over and let them die with hunger and thirst and there are some who to hinder the distortion of the features in dying persons close their eyes and mouth when they see them in the agony of death  in nova scotia the jugglers are called aulmoins and it is generally the chief of the village who is invested with this dignity of course though they have not much skill nor less imposture they have more authority when called to a patient the first thing they do is to view him attentively for some time and then to blow upon him if this has no effect the reason is that the devil is in him and must come out yet let every one be upon his guard for this evil spirit out of spite may fall upon one of the company then they enter in to a kind of phrenzy make strange postures cry out threaten the pretended devil speak to him as if they had seen him and make passes at him  when they enter the cabin they always have the precaution to thrust into the earth a piece of wood fastened to a string then offer the end of the string to all the company present desiring them to pull up this piece of wood and as none can scarce ever accomplish it they tell them it is the devil that holds it then feigning to stab this pretended devil they loosen the wood by little and little by digging the earth round it after which it is drawn up with ease and all present cry out victory to this piece of wood is fastened under it a little bone or some such thing which they show to the people present saying that was the cause of the disease it was necessary to kill the devil to get at it  this farce lasts generally four or five hours at the end of which the doctor wants rest and refreshment he goes away assuring the patient that he will recover if the distemper has not got the upper hand that is to say if the devil before his retreat has not already given him a mortal wound but how is the doctor to know this he pretends to know it by dreams but takes special care not to speak plainly till he sees what turn the distemper is likely to take when he judges it incurable he retires and after his example every one forsakes the sick person if after three days he is still alive the devil says the doctor is resolved he shall recover and will not let him die we must out of charity put an end to his sufferings immediately his dearest friends fetch cold water and pour it on his face till he expires the delusion is such that many thanks are given to the doctor with a considerable reward  some nations of the south have maxims quite the reverse they never pay the doctor till after the cure if the patient dies the doctors life is in danger according to the irroquois every distemper is a desire of the soul and death is the consequence of not accomplishing the desire  in general when they think themselves past recovery they meet their fate with a resolution truly stoical and they often see their days shortened by the persons that are most dear to them without showing the least chagrin the declaration of the doctors sentence is scarcely finished to a dying man before he makes an effort to harrangue those that are about him if it is the chief of a family he first makes his funeral oration which he finishes by giving very good counsel to his children after this he takes leave of every one gives orders for a feast in which they must use all the provisions that remain in the cabin and then he receives the presents of his family  during this time they cut the throats of all the dogs they can catch that the souls of these animals may go into the other world and give notice that such a person will arrive there soon the feast being over they begin to weep but their tears are interrupted to bid the dying person farewell and wish him a good journey to comfort him on his separation from his friends and relations and to assure him that his children will maintain all the glory which he has acquired  notwithstanding these people show so little judgment in their manner of treating the sick they behave toward the dead with a generosity and affection that cannot be too much admired some mothers have been known to have kept the dead bodies of their children whole years and would never go from them others draw milk from their breasts and pour it on the tombs of these little creatures if a village happens to take fire in which there are any dead bodies this is the first thing they take care to preserve they strip themselves of every thing that is most valuable to adorn the dead from time to time they open their coffins to change their dress and they deprive themselves of food to carry it to their sepulchers and to the places where they fancy their souls walk in a word they are at much greater expense for the dead than the living  as soon as the sick person expires the place is filled with mournful cries which last as long as the family is able to defray the expenses for they must keep open table all this time the dead body dressed in the finest robe with the face painted the arms and all that belongs to the deceased by his side is exposed at the cabin door in the posture it is to be laid in the tomb and this posture is the same in many places as that of the child in its mothers womb the custom of some nations is for the relations of the deceased to fast to the end of the funeral and all this interval is passed in tears and cries in treating their visitors in praising the dead and in mutual compliments in other places they hire women to weep they sing they dance they weep without ceasing always keeping time but these demonstrations of a borrowed sorrow do not prevent the effects of nature from the relations of the dead  they carry the body to its place of interment without much ceremony but take care to cover it in its grave so that the earth shall not touch it it lies as in a little cave lined with skin much richer and better adorned than their cabins a post is then set up on the grave and a number of things hung on it that may show the esteem they had for the deceased they sometimes put on it his portrait and every thing that may serve to show to passengers who he was and the finest actions of his life they carry fresh provisions to the grave every morning and as the dogs and other beasts do not fail to reap the benefit of it they are willing to persuade themselves that these things have been eaten by the souls of the deceased  when any one dies in hunting they expose his body on a very high scaffold and it remains there till the departure of the troop who carry it with them to the village the bodies of those who die in war are burnt and their ashes brought back to be laid in the burialplace of their fathers these burialplaces among the most settled nations are places like our churchyards near the village others bury their dead in the woods at the foot of a tree or dry them and keep them in chests till the festival of the dead which i shall presently describe but in some places they observe an odd ceremony for those that are drowned or are frozen to death  before i relate it it will be proper to say that they believe when these accidents happen that the spirits are incensed and that their anger is not appeased till the body is found then the preliminaries of tears dances songs and feasts being ended they carry the body to the usual place of interment or if it be too far off to the place where it is to remain till the festival of the dead there they dig a very large pit and make a fire in it then some young persons approach the corpse cut cut the flesh in parts marked out by a master of the ceremonies and throw them into the fire with the bowels the corpse thus mangled is put into the place destined for it during this operation the female relations of the deceased go continually round those that are at it exhorting them to acquit themselves well in what they have undertaken and put beads of porcelain in their mouth as we would give sugarplumbs to children to entice them to do what we desire  the interment is followed by presents which they make to the afflicted family and this they call covering of the dead allies also make some presents at the death of considerable persons but first the family of the deceased make a great feast in his name and this feast is accompanied with games for which they propose prizes which are performed in this manner a chief throws on the tomb three sticks about a foot long a young man a woman and a maiden take each of them one and those of their ages their sex and condition strive to wrest them out of their hands those with whom the sticks remain are conquerors there are also races and they sometimes shoot at a mark in short by a custom which we find established in all the times of pagan antiquity a ceremony entirely mournful is terminated by songs and shouts of victory  it is true that the family of the deceased bear no part in these rejoicings they observe even in his cabin after the obsequies a mourning the laws of which are very severe they must have their hair cut off and their faces blacked they must stand with their heads wrapped in a blanket they must not look at any person nor make any visit nor eat any thing hot they must deprive themselves of all pleasures wear scarce any thing on their bodies and never warm themselves at the fire even in the depth of winter  after this deep mourning which lasts two years they begin a second more moderate which continues two or three years longer and which may be softened by little and little but they dispense with nothing that is prescribed without the consent of the people of the cabin to which the widower or the widow belongs these permissions as well as the end of the mourning always costs the nearest relation a feast  on the death of a wife the husband does not weep because according to their ideas tears do not become men but this is not general among all the sioux nations women weep for their husbands a year they call him without ceasing and fill the village with cries and lamentations especially at sunrise noon and sunset and in some places when they go out to work and when they return mothers do much the same for their children  the first and often the only compliment they pay to a friend and even to a stranger they receive in their cabins is to weep for the nearest relations he has lost since they last saw him they put their hands on his head and give him to understand who it is they weep for without mentioning his name all this is founded on nature and has nothing savage in it but what i am going to relate does not appear to be any way excuseable that is the behavior of these people toward those who die a violent death even though it be in war and the service of their country  they have a notion that their souls in the other world have no communication with the souls of men who die a natural death and on this principle burn them directly sometimes even before they expire they never inter them in the common buryingplace and give them no part in the great ceremony which is renewed every eight years among some nations and every ten years among the hurons and the irroquois  they call it the festival of the dead or the feast of souls and is the most singular ceremony and the most celebrated of the religion of the savages a place being fixed for the assembly to meet in they elect a king of the feast whose duty it is to order every thing and to invite the neighboring villages the day appointed being come all the savages assemble and go in procession two and two to the buryingplace there every one labors to uncover the bodies which done they continue contemplating in silence on a spectacle so capable of exciting the most serious reflections the women first interrupt this religious silence by sending forth mournful cries which increase the horror with which every one is filled  the first act being ended they take up the carcases pick up the dry and separated bones and put them in parcels and those who are ordered to carry them take them on their shoulders if there are any bodies not entirely decayed they wash them clean away the corrupted flesh and all the filth and wrap them in new robes of beaverskins they then return in the same order they came and when the procession reaches the village every one lays in his cabin the burden he was charged with during the march the women continue their lamentations and the men show the same signs of grief they did on the day of the death of those whose remains they have been taking up and this second act is followed by a feast in each cabin in honor of the dead of each family  the following days they make public feasts accompanied as on the day of the funeral with dances games and combats for which there are certain prizes from time to time during these gambols they make loud outcries which they call the cries of the souls they make presents to strangers some of whom come   0 leagues to the ceremony they also take advantage of this general meeting to treat of common affairs or of the election of a chief every thing passes with a great deal of order decency and modesty and every one appears to entertain sentiments suitable to the principal action every thing even in the dances and songs carries an air of sadness and mourning and one can see in them all hearts pierced with the sharpest sorrow the most insensible would be affected at the sight of such a spectacle after some days are past they go again in procession to a great councilroom built for the purpose and all these marches and processions are made to the sound of their instruments accompanied with their best voices and all marching in time to the music when they reach the councilroom they hang up the bones and carcasses against the wall in the same condition they took them from the buryingplace and there lay forth the presents designed for the dead if among these sad remains there happens to be those of a chief his successor gives a great feast in his name and sings his song in many places the bones are carried from village to village are received every where with great demonstrations of grief and tenderness and every where they make them presents and lastly they carry them to the place where they are always to remain  this last and common burialplace is a great pit lined with their finest furs and the best things they have the presents designed for the dead are placed by themselves by degrees as the procession arrives each family ranges on a kind of scaffold set up round the pit and the moment the bones are laid in the women renew their lamentations then all present descend into the pit and every one takes a little of the earth which they carefully keep fancying it procures them luck at play the bodies and bones ranged in order are covered with entire new furs and over that with bark on which they throw stones wood and earth every one returns to his own cabin but the women come for several days after and pour broth made of maize called sagamitty on the place  chap v of their traditions and religion nothing is more certain than that the savages of this continent have an idea of a first being but at the same time nothing is more obscure they argue in general in making the first spirit the lord and creator of the world but when pressed to give an account of this first spirit betray many odd fancies fables so illconceived systems so illdigested and with so little uniformity that nothing regular can be said upon the subject  almost all the algonquin nations call this first spirit the great hare some call it michabou others atahocan the greater part say this hare being supported in the waters with all his court all composed of fourfooted creatures like himself formed the earth out of a grain of sand taken from the bottom of the ocean and created men of the dead bodies of animals there are some also that speak of a god of the waters who opposed the design of the great hare or at least refused to favor it this god according to some is the great tiger but it is to be observed there are no true tigers in canada of course this tradition might be derived from some other country they have also a third god named malcomek whom they invoke during winter  the areskoui of the hurons and the agreskoue of the irroquois are in the opinion of these people the supreme being and the god of war these nations do not give the same origin to men as the algonquins and do not go so far back as the creation of the world they say there were six men in the world at first but who placed them there they know not they add that one of these men went up into heaven to seek a woman there named atakentsie with whom he lived and who soon appeared to be with child that the lord of heaven perceiving it threw her down from the highest part of heaven and she was received on the back of a tortoise that she brought forth two children the eldest of which killed the other a faint account of cain and abel  they have no tradition after this of the other five men or even of atakentsies husband who according to some had but one daughter the gods of the savages have according to their notions bodies and live much in the same manner as we do but without any of the inconveniences we are subject to the term spirit signifies among them only a being of a more excellent nature than the rest they have no terms to express what exceeds the tenets of their understanding which is extremely confined in any thing that is not the object of their senses or in common use but yet they give to their pretended spirits a kind of immensity which renders them present in all places for wherever they happen to be they invoke them and speak to them  according to the irroquois the posterity of him who slew his brother went no farther than the third generation there came then a deluge from which no person escaped and to repeople the earth beasts were changed to men indeed the notion of a universal deluge is generally received among the aborogines of america but there seems to have been one of a much later date confined to this continent besides the first being or great spirit and the other gods confounded with him they have an infinite number of genii or subaltern spirits good and evil which have their particular worship  the irroquois place atakentsie at the head of the evil spirits and her son jouskeka he who killed his brother chief of the good they address the evil genii only to beg that they would do them no harm but they suppose the others to watch over them for their good and that every man has his own genius or guardian spirit this spirit in the huron language is called okkis in the algonquin manitou when they go out on any expedition they carry their okkis or manitou with them they would rather leave their arms behind them than their deities which are represented under certain symbols they put them into a sack painted of various colors and often to do honor to the chief place this sack in the forepart of his canoe if there are too many manitou to be contained in one sack they distribute them into several which are entrusted with the lieutenant and elders of each family in their marches by land the chief carries his sack himself and when he grows weary of the load all are desirous of easing him they have recourse to these manitou when in any danger and when they would obtain any extraordinary favor they think they may ask any thing of them however unreasonable or contrary to good behavior or honesty but children they suppose are not under their protection they must first know how to handle a bow and arrow to merit this favor and undergo the following preparation to receive it which is the most important of their life  they begin by blacking the childs face it must then fast eight days without the least nourishment and during this time his future guardian angel must appear to him in his dreams the empty brain of the child just entering en the first stage of youth cannot fail of furnishing him with dreams and every morning they take care to make him relate them however the fasting often ends before the time appointed as few children have strength to bear it so long but this creates no difficulty they are acquainted here as in other places with the convenient use of dispensations the thing which the child dreams of most frequently is supposed to be his genius but no doubt this thing was considered at first only as a symbol or shape under which the spirit manifests itself but the same has happened to these people as to all those who have erred in the romish religion they have attached themselves to the representation and lost sight of the reality  these symbols however signify nothing of themselves sometimes it is the head of a bird sometimes the foot of an animal or a piece of wood in short the most ordinary things and the least valued they preserve them however with as much care as the ancients did their penates they tell you there is nothing in nature that has not its tutelar spirit but they are of all degrees and have not the same power when they do not comprehend a thing they assign it to a superior genius and say in this case it is a spirit and men of singular talents are called spirits being supposed with them to have a guardian genius of a more exalted degree than men have in general  in spring      umfreville tells us some indians who were employed in the neighborhood of yorkfort in hudsonsbay were so influenced by these superstitious ideas that they believed the devil with hideous howlings frequented their tents every night they came to the factory quite dejected and told the governor a lamentable tale setting forth with pathetic energy the distresses they were exposed to from this visitation of the father of iniquity so overcome were they by their apprehensions that they kept large fires continually burning all night and sleeping only in the daytime one of them declared that he had fired his gun at him but unluckily missed him he described him to be of human shape going about in clothes and taking prodigious strides over the snow the indians believed that he came in quest of some of their families a part of which must be sacrificed to aswage his anger a little brandy however properly applied had a wonderful effect for after going through a course of inebriation for two days all the fears that the devil had occasioned were entirely dissipated it proved aftewards that this formidable enemy was nothing more than a nightowl which had frequented the place this bird by the dismal noise it makes in the night often causes such apprehensions in the minds of indians as to work on their imaginations and make them believe the devil is really and substantially present  the jugglers endeavor to persuade the multitude that they are sometimes in a trance which kind of madness has existed at all times and among all nations and has given birth to all the false religions the vanity which is so natural to mankind has never imagined a more effectual method to rule over the weak and the multitude at last draw after them those who pride themselves most in their wisdom the american impostors are not behindhand with any in this point and they know how to obtain all the advantages from it which they propose the jugglers never omit to publish that during their pretended extacies their genii give them great information of things done at the greatest distance and of future events and as by chance if we will not allow the devil any share in it they sometimes happen to divine or guess pretty right they acquire a great reputation and are reckoned genii of the first order  as soon as they have taught a child what he is to consider as his guardian genius for the time to come they instruct him carefully in the obligations he is under to honor him to follow the counsel he shall receive from him in his dreams to merit his favors to put all his trust in him and to dread the effects of his anger if he neglects his duty toward him the festival terminates in a feast and the custom is to prick on the body of the child the figure of his okki or his manitou one would suppose that such a solemn engagement the mark of which can never be effaced should be inviolable but a trifle will sometimes break it  they do not readily acknowledge themselves in the wrong even with their gods and make no difficulty to justify themselves at their expense therefore the first time they have occasion to condemn themselves or blame their guardian genius the fault always falls on the latter they seek another spirit without any ceremony and this is done with the same precautions as at first  different sorts of offerings or sacrifices are made to these spirits to render the god of the waters propitious they throw into the rivers and lakes petun or tobacco or birds that have had their throats cut in honor of the sun or inferior spirits they throw into the fire part of every thing they use and which they acknowledge to hold from them this is sometimes done from motives of gratitude but oftener from interest a dog is the most common victim which they sacrifice and sometimes they will hang one alive on a tree by the hindlegs and leave him there to die raving mad the warfeast which is always of dogs may very well pass also for a sacrifice in short they render much the same honor to the mischievous spirits as to these that are beneficent when they have any thing to fear from their malice  the belief best established among these people is that of the immortality of the soul yet they do not conceive it purely spiritual any more than they do their genii they define a soul to be as it were the shadow and the animated image of the body and it is in consequence of this principle that they believe every thing in the universe is animated and it is entirely by tradition that they hold our souls never die their doctrine is that the soul separated from the body has still the same inclinations it had before which is the reason why they bury with the dead every thing they used whilst living they are also persuaded that the soul remains near the corpse at the festival of the dead which i have described and that afterward it goes into the country of souls where according to some it is transformed into a dove  others think there are two souls in every man attributing to one l i have just mentioned and saying that the other never leaves one body but to go into some other which they are of opinion however seldom happens but to the souls of children who having enjoyed but little of life are allowed to begin a new one on this account they bury children by the highwayside that women as they pass by may gather their souls now say they these souls which so faithfully keep company with their bodies must be fed and it is to fulfill this duty that they carry provisions to the graves but this does not last long as they expect such souls in time to accustom themselves to fast  but one thing which these people never sail to perform in whatever extremity they find themselves is that as among us the spirits of the dead enrich the living among them they not only carry to the grave all that the deceased possessed but also presents from their friends and relations  the country say these savages to which souls go when separated from their bodies lies very far to the west and are several months traveling there they have also great difficulties to surmount and run through great danger before they arrive there they talk of a river they have to pass where many have been wrecked of a dog from which they find it hard to defend themselves of a place of torments where they expiate their saults and another where the souls of prisoners of war that have been burnt are tormented  this notion is the reason why after the death of these wretches for fear their souls should stay about the cabins to revenge their sufferings they very carefully visit all places striking continually with a stick and sending forth hideous cries to drive them away  among the fabulous stories which they tell of what passes in hell which so much resemble those of homer and virgil there is one that seems copied from orpheus and euridice there is scarce any thing in it to change but the names the happiness which they hope to enjoy in this fancied elysium they do not consider absolutely as the reward of virtue to have been a good hunter a gallant warrior and fortunate in all enterprises to have killed and burnt a great number of enemies are the only titles that give them a right to paradise all the happiness of which consists in finding places to hunt and fish in that never fail an eternal spring great plenty of all things without labor and all the pleasures of sense this is all they ask of their gods in this life all their songs wiiich are in fact their prayers run only on the present good they think themselves sure of being happy in the other world in proportion to what they have been in this  the souls of beasts have also with them a place in the country of souls they allow them likewise a sort of reason and not only each species but each animal if we believe them has also its guardian genius in a word they make no difference between us and brutes but that our souls are something of a better sort  but among all their superstition and extravagance there is nothing more idle than what regards their dreams sometimes they say it is the reasonable soul that wanders whilst the sensitive soul continues to animate the body sometimes it is the familiar genius that gives good advice about future events sometimes it is a visit they receive from the soul of the object they dream of but whatever conception they have of dreams they are always considered as sacred things and as the means which their gods most usually employ to declare their wills to men  now it is not the person alone who dreams that must satisfy the obligations that he imagines are imposed on by it but it would also be a crime in any person that he addresses himself to to refuse him any thing he desired in dreaming and this often has disagreeable consequences if the thing desired is of such a nature that it cannot be supplied by a private person the public take up the matter and will have it found if at the distance of  00 leagues if it is an inanimate thing they are more easy but if an animate its death causes surprising uneasiness nay if any one takes it into his head to dream that he knocks another mans brains out he will do it if he can and he must expect the same if another dreams that of him but a little presence of mind will remedy this fear it is only knowing how to oppose such a dream by another that contradicts it then says the first dreamer i see plainly that your spirit is stronger than mine therefore let us talk no more about it  they have a kind of bacchanal which they call the festival of dreams but which the irroquois and some others more properly call the turning of the brain it is celebrated about the end of winter and commonly lasts    days at this time they act all kinds of fooleries and every one runs from cabin to cabin disguised in a thousand ridiculous ways they break and overset every thing and no one dares to contradict it if they meet any one they desire him to guess their dream and if they guess it it is at their own expense for the guesser must give the thing they dreamt of when it ends they return every thing make a great feast and study only how to repair the sad effects of the masquerade for it is commonly no trifling business indeed they take the opportunity of this festival to give those a sound drubbing who have affronted or injured them but when the time is over every thing is forgotten  the savages in general acknowledge only the operations of the good genii it is the wizards alone and those who use enchantments who are reported to hold correspondence with the evil and it is women chiefly that follow this detestable profession the jugglers not only forbear it but profess openly their study is to prevent their pernicious effects it is certain that among those who practice the art of juggling the boldest are the most respected and with a little artifice they easily persuade people who are brought up in superstition though they have seen the birth of these importers if they choose to give themselves a supernatural birth they will find people to credit their assertion as much as if they had seen them come down from heaven and who believe their being born like other men was a mere illusion but in general their artifices are so gross and so common that there are none but fools and children that are imposed on by them except it is when they act as physicians for every one knows that in what concerns the recovery of health the greatest credulity is to be found in all countries as well among those who pride themselves on their wisdom as among the weaker class of people  the blackfoot paegan and blood indians have a custom peculiar to themselves that of cutting off the joints of their fingers beginning with the little finger and taking off a joint as often as superstition prompts them this is advanced on the credit of mr umfreville who says he could never learn the cause of this singular custom nor did he ever observe any but old men that had their fingers thus mutilated  chap vi of their government and wars the greatest part of the savage nations of the continent of america have a kind of aristocratic government which varies almost to infinity for although each village has its chief independent of all others of the same nation and in whom his subjects depend in a very few things yet no affair of importance is concluded without the advice of the elders  many nations have each three families or principal tribes as ancient in all probability as their origin yet nevertheless derived from the same stock and there is one who is looked upon as the first which has a sort of preeminence over the other two who style those of this tribe brothers whereas between themselves they call each other cousins these tribes are mixed without being confounded each having its distinct chief in every village and in the affairs which concern the whole nation these chiefs assemble to deliberate upon them each tribe bears the name of some animal and the whole nation has also one whose name they take and whose figure is their badge or coat of arms they sign treaties by tracing these figures on them unless particular reasons bid them to substitute others thus the huron nation is the nation of the porcupine and its first tribe bears the name of the bear the other two are the wolf and the tortoise the irroquois nations have the same animals as the huron and thus appear to be branches of the same colony  the conferring or giving these titles is always performed with great ceremony the new chief makes a feast and gives presents speaks the eulogium of his predecessor and sings his song in the north and in all places where the algonquin language prevails the dignity of chief is elective among the hurons where it is hereditary the succession is continued by the womans side so that at the death of the chief it is not his son that succeeds him but his sisters son or in case of failure of such the nearest relation by the female line if a whole branch is extinct the noblest matron of the tribe chooses the person she likes best and declares him chief  they must however be of an age fit to govern and if the successor is not of age a regent is chosen who has all the authority but who exercises it in the name of the minor in general these chiefs do not receive any great marks of respect and if they are always obeyed it is because they know how far their commands will have force they indeed rather entreat or propose than command and never exceed the bounds of the little authority they have thus it is reason that governs and the government is the more effectual as the obedience is more voluntary and there is no fear of its degenerating into tyranny  besides this every family chooses themselves a counselor or an assistant to the chief who is to watch over their interests and without whose advice the chief can undertake nothing these counselors are particularly obliged to take care of the public treasure and it belongs to them to direct how it is to be employed in the huron nations the women name the counselors and they often choose persons of their own sex  this body of counselors or assistants is the first assembly that of the elders or those who have attained the age of maturity is the second the last is that of the warriors or all those who are able to bear arms this last body has often the chief of the nation or village at its head but he must first have distinguished himself by some brave action otherwise he is obliged to serve as a subaltern or common soldier for in these savage armies there is no intermediate rank  a great party may indeed have several chiefs because they give this title to all those who ever had a command but these are not the less subject to the commander of the party the women have the mens whole authority among the people of the huron language if we except the irroquois canton of onneyouth where it is alternate between the sexes but though this is their law the women seldom interfere the chiefs transacting all the business in their name  in the general council of elders they proceed with such prudence maturity and ability and for the most part with such probity as would have done honor to the areopagus of athens and the senate of rome in the most flourishing times of these republics the reason is that they conclude nothing hastily and that the strong passions which have made such alterations in the systems of policy even among christians have not yet prevailed in these savages over the public good the parties concerned do not fail to employ secret springs and such intrigue to accomplish their designs that one would scarce believe could enter into the thoughts of such barbarians they possess in the highest degree the great art of concealing their proceedings and in general the glory of the nation and motives of honor are the chief springs of all their undertakings their great failing is revenge revenge without bounds and which their chief honor lies in the gratification of a fault which christianity only can thoroughly reform and which all our politeness and religion does not always correct  each tribe has its orator in every village and there are few but these orators who have a right to speak in the public councils and the general assemblies and these always speak and to the purpose one would suppose that people who have little or no possessions either public or private and who have no ambition to extend themselves should have very few things to adjust with each other but the spirit of man naturally restless cannot remain without action and is ingenious in finding itself employment this is certain that these savages negotiate continually and have always some affair on the carpet they have some treaties to conclude or renew offers of service to make mutual civilities to show alliances to court invitations to join in war or condolences on the death of a chief to convey all this is done with a dignity an attention nay with an ability worthy of the most important affairs  the irroquois nation has for the last two ages made the greatest figure in canada by their successes in war they have gained a superiority over the greatest part of the other nations as to what relates to private persons and the particular concerns of their villages they are reduced to a very small compass and are soon decided the greatest defect of this government is that they have no punishment for crimes but this defect has not the same consequences here as it would have with us so selinterest which governs us and is the source of almost all our crimes can scarce have any power over a people who never think of laying up riches and who take little thought for the morrow  to enter into all the police of such barbarous nations would be little entertainment or improvement to our readers unless their laws were better studied than they are as the government of each country is generally adapted to its situation and its wants a civilized nation can profit little by the laws and practice of barbarians i will therefore drop any further observations on the subject and proceed to their manner of making war  i have already noticed that the god of war by the hurons is called areskoui and by the irroquois agreskoue it is worth remarking that several of the terms which relate to war in the huron and irroquois languages seem to have been derived from the greek word ares who is the mars or god of war in all the countries where they have followed the theology of homer aregouen signifies to make war and is thus declined garigo i make war sarego thou make war arego he makes war and so on areskoui is not only the mars of these people but he is also their chief god or as they express it the great spirit and the creator and master of the world but it is chiefly for military expeditions that they invoke him as if the attribute that does him the most honor was that of the god of hosts his name is the warcry before battle and in the height of the engagement on their march also they often repeat it by way of encouraging each other and to implore his assistance  to take up the hatchet is to declare war every private person has a right to do it without any one having a power to hinder him unless it be among the hurons and irroquois where mothers of families can declare or forbid war when they please when war is declared formally against two nations the manner of expressing it is to hang the kettle on the fire which has its origin in the barbarous custom of eating the prisoners and those that were slain after they had boiled them they say also in direct words that they are going to eat a nation signifying that they will make a cruel war against it when they would engage an ally in their quarrel they send him a porcelain that is a great shell to invite him to drink the blood or according to their meaning the broth of the flesh of their enemies for the porcelain of these countries is the venus shell of canada which is there considered as a precious stone after all this custom may be very ancient but it does not follow from hence that these people were always maneaters it was perhaps in the primitive times only an allegorical way of speaking such as we find often in scripture the enemies of david did not as appears make it a custom to eat the flesh of their enemies when he said psalm xxvii v   when the wicked even mine enemies and my foes came upon me to eat up my flesh in after times certain nations that were become savage and barbarous substituted the fact in the room of the figure  it seldom happens that these barbarians refuse to engage in a war when they are invited to it by their allies indeed they have no need of invitation to take up arms the least trifle is a sufficient motive particularly revenge for some old or new injury for time never heals such wounds however slight they were  a war which concerns all the nation is well weighed before determined on and whilst they deliberate they are extremely careful to avoid every thing that would give the enemy the least cause to suspect they intend to break with them war being resolved on they directly consider of the provisions and the equipage of the women the dances songs feasts and some superstitious ceremonies he who is to command does not think of raising men till he has fasted several days during which he is smeared with black holds scarce any conversation with any one invokes his tutelar spirit day and night and above all is very careful to observe his dreams the fast being over he assembles his friends and with a collar of beads in his hand thus addresses them the great spirit brethren approves my sentiments inspires me with what i ought to do and authorizes my intentions the blood of such an one is not wiped away his body is not covered and i will acquit myself of the duty i owe him i am resolved therefore to go to such a place and eat such a nation if i perish in the enterprise or should any who accompany me lose their lives this collar shall serve to receive us that we may not continue to lie in the dit meaning by this that the collar which is a badge of honor shall belong to him who shall take care to bury the dead in pronouncing these last words he lays the collar on the ground and he who takes it up declares himself his lieutenant this done they heat water wash the face of the chief set his hair in order grease it and paint it they also paint his face with various colors and put on his finest robe thus adorned he sings the death song in a low tone of voice and his soldiers those that choose to follow him sing out their war song with a loud voice one after another for every man has his own song which no other is allowed to sing there are some also peculiar to each family  after this preliminary the chief communicates his project to the council who consult on it alone and as soon as it is accepted the chief is admitted he then makes a feast of which the principal dish is a dog all this lasts many days and though all the people seem employed in the feast each family puts in its claim to a share of the prisoners that shall be made in order to repair their losses or revenge their slain among the irroquois as soon as a military expedition is resolved on they set the kettle of war on the fire and give notice to their allies to bring something for it the party being formed the warchief prepares a new feast to which all the village is invited and before any thing is touched he or an orator in his name cries out young men take courage dress your hair paint your faces fill your quivers and make our forests resound with your songs of war for the bones of our friends cry out for revenge and we will relieve the cares of the dead  after this speech and the applauses that never fail to follow it the chief advances into the midst of the assembly with his fightingclub or headbreaker in his hand and sings all his soldiers answer him singing and swear to support him or die in the attempt none however drop any expression that denotes the least dependence they only promise to act with union and harmony their songs are followed by dances which are sometimes merely walking to time in a proud step at others jumping in lively motions representing the operations of a campaign but all to time the warchief is only a spectator with a pipe in his mouth  to try the warriors the irroquois never fail before an expedition to proceed in the following manner not conceiving that any man can have true courage if he is not master of his passions and cannot bear the highest provocations the oldest of the military troop affront the young people in the grossest manner they can think of especially those who have never seen an enemy they throw hot coals upon their heads reproach them sharply load them with the most injurious expressions and carry this game to the greatest extremity this must be borne with a perfect insensibility to show the least impatience would deem the person so insulted unworthy to bear arms for ever on setting out they take with them certain drugs that their jugglers have assured them they have given a power to heal the greatest wounds and which they are idle enough to believe  on the day of departure they take their leave of their friends with great demonstrations of real tenderness every one desires something that has been used by the warriors and in return give them some pledge of their friendship and assurance of a perpetual remembrance they scarce enter any cabin but they take away their robe to give them a better every soldier paints his face according to his own fancy but all in a frightful manner the chief leads the way sings his death song and the whole party follows him in a line keeping profound silence and this they do every morning when they renew their march the women go before with provisions and when the warriors come up with them they give their clothes into their custody remaining as naked as the season will admit  the arms of these people formerly were bows and arrows and a kind of javelin which as well as their arrows were pointed with bone besides this they had a little club of hard wood with a round head and a cutting edge called a headbreaker the western savages have bullshide bucklers light and proof against a musket ball they are now furnished with swords and guns our swords they use like spontoons with their arms they never forget to take their manitous or guardian spirits  when they embark upon an expedition the canoes first go a little way then range themselves close together in a line this done the chief rises up and holding a chichicoue in his hand thunders out his song of war and his soldiers answer him by a treble he drawn with all their strength from the bottom of their breasts the elders and chiefs of the council who remain on shore exhort the warriors to behave well and not suffer themselves to be surprised but this exhortation does not interrupt the chief who continues singing the warriors then conjure their relations and friends not to forget them send forth altogether a hideous howl and run off with such speed as soon to be out of sight  when out on an expedition they seldom make any short marches especially when their troop is numerous they take however presages of every thing and the jugglers who accompany them and whose business it is to explain these predictions hasten or retard the marches at their pleasure whilst they are not in a suspected country they take little precaution separate and each takes his own way to hunt but however they may stray from the route they all return punctually to the place and at the hour appointed for their rendezvous  they encamp a long time before sunset and commonly leave before their camp a large space surrounded with palisadoes or a sort of lattice on which they fix their manitous turned to the place they are going to they invoke them for an hour and do the same every morning before they decamp after this they have nothing to fear they conceive the manitous to be their sentinels and the whole army sleeps quietly under their supposed safeguard experience does not undeceive these barbarians nor bring them out of their presumptuous confidence it has its source in an indolence and laziness which nothing can conquer  every one is an enemy in the way of the warriors but should they meet on their march with any of their allies or any party equally numerous with themselves with whom they have no quarrel they make friendship with each other if the allies they meet are at war with the same enemy the chief of the strongest party or of that which took up arms first gives some scalp to the other which are the skins of the heads of prisoners taken or an enemy slain and which they are always provided with on these occasions and says to him you have done your business that is to say you have fullld your engagements your honor is safe you may return home but this is to be understood when the meeting is accidental and when they have no occasion for a reinforcement as soon as they enter on an enemys country they stop make a great feast at night and then lay down to sleep when they awake those who have had any dreams go from fire to fire singing their death song with which they intermix their dreams in an enigmatical manner every one racks his brain to guess them and if no one can do it the dreamer is at liberty to return home this gives a fine opportunity to cowards next they make new invocations to their spirits animate each other more than ever to do wonders swear to assist each other to the utmost and renew their march if they come there by water they now quit their canoes and hide them every evening they send out rangers who employ two or three hours looking round the country and if they have seen nothing they go to sleep quietly leaving the camp as before to the guard of their manitous  when they discover the enemy they send out a party to reconnoitre them and on their report hold a council the attack is generally made at daybreak they suppose the enemy is at this time in their deepest sleep and all night they lie on their bellies without stirring the approaches are made in the same posture crawling on their feet and hands till they come to the place then all rising up the chief gives the signal by a little cry to which all the troop answer by real howlings and at the same time make their first discharge then without giving the enemy any time to look about fall on them with their clubs in latter times these people have substituted tomahawks or little hatchets instead of headbreakers and since which their engagements are more bloody when the battle is over they take the scalps of the dead and dying and never think of making prisoners till the enemy makes no more resistance  should they find the enemy on their guard or too well entrenched they retreat if they have time for it if not they take the resolution to fight stoutly and there is sometimes much bloodshed on both sides the attack of a camp is the image of fury itself the barbarous fierceness of the conquerors and the despair of the vanquished who know their fate if they fall into the enemies hands produce on both sides such efforts as pass all description the appearance of the combatants all besmeared with black and red still increases the horror of the fight when the victory is no longer doubtful they directly dispatch all those whom it would be too troublesome to carry off and seek only to tire out the rest they intend to make prisoners of  they are naturally intrepid and notwithstanding their brutal fierceness preserve in the midst of action much coolness and never fight in the field but when they cannot avoid it from an opinion that victory marked with the blood of the conquerors is not properly a victory and that the glory of a chief consists principally in bringing back all his people safe and sound  the war of these barbarians is commonly made by surprise and generally succeeds for as they very frequently neglect the precautions necessary to shun a surprise so are they active and skilful in surprising they have a wonderful talent i may call it instinct of finding out whether any person has passed a place on the shortest grass on the hardest ground even upon stones they will discover footsteps and by the way they are turned by the shape of the foot and the manner they are separated from each other they will distinguish the footsteps of different nations and those of men from those of women  till the conquerors are in a country of safety they march forward expeditiously and lest the wounded should retard their retreat carry them by turns on litters or in winter draw them on sledges when they reenter their canoes they make their prisoners sing and do the same every time they meet their allies an honor which costs them a feast who receive it and the unfortunate captive something more than the trouble of singing for they invite their allies to caress them and to caress a prisoner is to do him all the mischief they can devise or maim him in such a manner as to lame him for ever but there are chiefs who will take care that their prisoners are not too much illtreated lest they should escape they are tied by the neck and arms to one of the oars of the canoe in the daytime when they go by land there is always one that holds them and at night they are stretched on the earth quite naked and some cords fastened to piquets fixed in the ground keep their legs arms and neck so confined and some long cords also confine their hands and feet in such a manner that they cannot make the least motion without waking the savages who lie upon these cords  if among the prisoners there are found any who by their wounds are not in a condition to be carried away they burn them directly and as this is done in the first heat and when they are often in haste to retreat they are generally quit at an easier rate than the rest who are reserved for a slower punishment  the custom among some nations is that the chief of the victorious party leaves on the field of battle his fighting club on which he traces the mark of his nation that of his family and the oval of his face with all the figures he had on his face traced on that oval others paint all these marks on the trunk of a tree others will add hieroglyphic characters by means of which all passersby are made acquainted with the chief and all the business of the campaign  when the warriors on their return are arrived at a certain distance from the village from whence they came they halt and the chief sends one forward to announce his approach this man when within hearing makes various cries and the young people and sometimes the whole village come out to meet him and learn the particulars as the messenger or herald relates a fact one of the party come out to meet him repeats it aloud to those that are with him and they all answer by acclamations or dismal cries according as the news is mournful or pleasing the herald is then conducted to a cabin where the elders inquire all the particulars after which a public crier invites all the young folks to go and meet the warriors and the women to carry them refreshments the moment the women join them is properly speaking the beginning of the punishment of the prisoners in some nations they will adopt a prisoner in the room of some relation they have lost in war in which case they escape punishment but such as are destined to death and those whose fate are not yet decided are abandoned to the fury of the women that go out to meet them and if any woman has lost either her son or her husband or any other person that was dear to her though this loss had happened thirty years before she is a fury she attacks the first prisoner who falls in her way has no regard either to humanity or decency flies at him with rage and every wound she gives him one would expect him to fall at her feet if we did not know the ingenuity of these barbarians in prolonging the most unheard of punishment all the night passes in this manner in the camp of the warriors  the next day is their triumph the irroquois and some others affect a great modesty and a still greater disinterestedness on these occasions the chiefs enter the village alone without any mark of victory keeping profound silence and retire to their cabins without showing the least pretension to the prisoners among other nations the chief marches at the head of his troop with the air of a conqueror his lieutenant follows him and a crier goes before renewing the deathcries the warriors follow two by two and the prisoners in the midst crowned with flowers their faces and hair painted holding a stick in one hand a chichikoue in the other their bodies almost naked their arms tied above the elbow by a cord which the warriors hold and the prisoners singing their deathsong to the sound of the chichikoue  this song has something mournful and yet haughty in it and the captive has nothing in him of the air of a man who suffers or is vanquished the sense of these songs is pretty nearly as follows i am brave and intrepid and fear not death nor any kind of torture those who do are cowards and less than warriors life is nothing to a brave man may my enemies be confounded with rage and despair oh that i could devour them and drink their blood to the last drop from time to time they stop them the people gather round and make the prisoners dance who seem to do it with a good will and whilst they dance relate the finest actions of their lives boast of those they have killed and burnt and particularly those if any for whom the persons present are most concerned thus rousing the resentment of the masters of their fate in fact these boastings make those who hear them quite furious and they of course pay dear for their vanity by the manner in which they receive the most cruel treatment one would be led to suppose they took a pleasure in being tormented  sometimes they oblige the prisoners to run through two ranks of savages armed with stones and sticks who fall on them as if they would knock them on the head at the first blow yet they never kill them taking care in all their fury not to touch a part that would endanger life in this march to the village every one has a right to torment them they are indeed allowed to defend themselves but were they to attempt it they would soon be overpowered when arrived at the village they lead them from cabin to cabin and every where make them pay their welcome in one place they tear off one of their nails at another bite off one of their fingers or cut it off with a bad knife that cuts like a saw an old man shall tear their flesh quite to the bone or child wound them where he can with an awl a woman shall whip them without mercy till she is so tired that she cannot lift her arms but the warriors themselves who are still their masters never lay a hand on them nor can any one mutilate a prisoner without their leave which they seldom grant but this excepted they have an entire liberty to make them suffer and if they lead them through several villages either of the same nation or their neighbors or allies who have requested it they are received every where in the same manner  after these preludes they set about distributing the captives and their fate depends on those to whom they are delivered at the rising of the council where their fate has been debated a crier comes forth and invites all the people to an open place where the distribution is made without noise or dispute those women who have lost their children or husbands in the war generally receive the first lot in the next place they fulfill their promises at first setting out if there are not captives enough they supply the want of them by scalps which the receivers wear on rejoicing days or hang up at their cabin doors on the contrary if the number of prisoners exceeds the claims they send the overplus to the villages of their allies a chief is not replaced but by a chief or by two or three common men who are always burnt though those whom they replace have died of disease the irroquois never fail to set apart some of their prisoners for the public and these the council dispose of as they please but mothers of families among them may still set aside their sentence and are the mistresses of life and death even of those who have been condemned or pardoned by the council  in general the greatest number of the prisoners of war are condemned to die or to very hard slavery in which their lives are never secure some are adopted as i have observed and from that time their condition differs nothing from that of the children of the nation they enter into all the rights of those whose places they supply and they often acquire so far the spirit of the nation of which they are become members that they make no difficulty afterward of going to war against their own countrymen the irroquois would scarce have supported themselves hitherto but by this policy having been at war many years against all the other nations they would at present have been reduced almost to nothing had they not taken great care to naturalize a good part of their prisoners  sometimes it happens that instead of sending the surplus of these captives into other villages they give them to private persons who had not asked for any and they serve these persons as slaves adopted prisoners are treated with great tenderness their wounds if they have any are dressed and healed they live well are clothed decently and nothing omitted to make them forget their sufferings they call these adopted prisoners men raised from the dead and give them the name of the person whom they replace  amongst the hurons and irroquois those prisoners whom they intend to burn are sometimes as well treated at first and even till the moment of their execution as those that have been adopted like victims fattened for a sacrifice to the god of war the only difference made between them is that they blacken the faces all over of those they design to burn after this they entertain them in the best manner speak kindly to them call them by the tender names of son brother or nephew according to the person whose manes they mean to appease by their death nay they will often give them young women to serve them as wives all the time they have to live but when they are informed of their fate they are close kept to prevent their escaping  when they are delivered to a woman the moment they inform her every thing is ready for execution she is no longer a mother but a fury who passes from the tenderest caresses to the greatest paroxysms of rage she begins by invoking the spirit of him she desires to revenge approach says she you are going to be appeased i prepare a feast for thee drink great draughts of this broth which is going to be poured out for thee receive the sacrifice i make this warrior shall be burnt and put into the kettle they shall apply red hot hatchets to his flesh they shall tear off his scalp they shall drink in his scull make therefore no more complaints thou shall be fully satisfied this form of speech which is properly the sentence of death varies as to terms but the meaning is always much the same a crier now makes the captive come from the cabin and declares aloud the intention of him or her to whom he belongs and finishes by exhorting the young people to behave well another crier succeeds and addressing him that is to suffer says brother take courage thou art going to be burnt and he answers coolly that is well i give thee thanks immediately there is a cry throughout the village and the prisoner is led to the stake where he is tied but so that he can run round it sometimes when the execution is made in a cabin from whence there is no danger of escaping he is suffered to run from one end to another before they begin to burn him he sings for the last time his deathsong reciting his achievements and almost always in a manner the most insulting to those about him he next exhorts them not to spare him but to remember that he is a man and a warrior  i will not relate all the particulars that pass in these horrible executions there are generally as many actors as spectators men women and children who study to increase his sufferings and prolong his existence and the sufferer instead of showing any fear or signs of pain glories in the torments he undergoes insults his persecutors to his last breath and dies as it were in a state of triumph there is a haughtiness in heart in these savages that elevates the spirits and transports the man in the midst of tortures which in some measure takes off the edge of pain by diverting the thoughts in short where there are no hopes of mercy despair gives resolution and inspires boldness  mr umfreville tells us that the hudsons bay company being informed that the indians frequently brought fine pieces of copper to their settlements in churchill river appointed a person with proper assistants to examine the river where this valuable acquisition was supposed to be concealed that person gives the following account of his expedition which will describe the indian method of going to war in this part of the country in latitude    degrees    minutes north and    degrees west longitude from churchill river says he we built our canoes in      where many northern indians joined us and finding we were intended for the coppermine river that summer between  0 and  0 stout fellows agreed to accompany us with no other intent then to kill the esquimaux i used my best endeavors to persuade them from this design but to no purpose for instead of my advice having the desired effect they imputed it to cowardice that being a character i always despised i was obliged to sum up my best endeavors to retrieve my then fading honor and told them i cared not if they made the name of an esquimaux extinct and though i was no enemy to them yet if i found it necessary for my own safety or for the safety of those who were with me i should not be afraid of an esquimaux this declaration caused great shouts of satisfaction they then began to prepare their targets or shields which are made of boards three feet long two broad and threefourths of an inch thick and so slung on the left arm as to be of no hindrance in loading and firing their guns  our war implements being all ready we set out on our expedition and by the   st of june were in latitude    degrees    minutes north and    degrees    minutes west from churchill here we agreed to leave all the women and every other encumbrance accordingly after staying a few days to kill as many deer and buffaloes as would serve them till our return we proceeded again and we arrived at the copperriver on the   th of july and as i found afterward about  0 miles from its entrance on our arrival the indians dispatched three men before as spies to see if any esquimaux were tenting about the river on the   th of the same month as i was continuing my survey toward the mouth of the river we met the three spies abovementioned who informed us of five tents of esquimaux being on the west side of the river and by their comparison of the distance i judged it to be about twelve miles off on their receiving this news they would pay no more attention to my survey but their whole thoughts were immediately engaged in planning the best method how to steal on them in the night and kill them while asleep after having all their apparatus ready for the ensuing slaughter they began to invoke their different patronizing agents by the following superstition all the men painted the front of their targets some with the image of the sun others with the moon others with different kinds of birds and beasts of prey and some with the images of imaginary furies which according to their silly imaginations inhabit the elements by strict enquiry into the cause of this superstition i found that each man had the image of that agent painted on his target which he relied on for success in the ensuing enterprise some were contented with a single representation while others doubtful of the quality of any single being would have their targets covered to the very margin with a group of hieroglyphics quite unintelligible this piece of superstition being completed we then began to advance toward the esquimaux the number of our company being so far superior to the five tents of esquimaux portended no less than a total massacre unless kind providence should work a miracle in their favor it was about ten oclock in the morning when they made their attack upon their unhappy enemies whom they found fast asleep in a few minutes the havoc was begun myself standing neuter in the rear presently a scene truly shocking presented itself to my view for as the esquimaux were surprised at a time when they thought themselves in the midst of security they had neither power nor time to make any resistance men women and children ran out of the tents starknaked but where could they fly for shelter they soon fell a sacrifice to indian fury the shrieks and groans of the expiring were truly horrible and it was much increased by the sight of a young girl about    years old whom they killed so near me that when the first spear was through her she fell down and twisted herself about my legs and it was some difficulty for me to disengage myself from her dying grasps as the indians pursued her i solicited for her life but this was so far from being granted that i was not fully assured of my own being entirely in safety for offering to speak in her behalf when i begged her life the fellows made no reply till they had both their spears through her and fixed into the ground they then looked sternly in my face and began to upbraid me asking me if i wanted an esquimaux wife at the same time paying no regard to the shrieks of the poor girl who was then turning about the spears like an eel indeed i was obliged at last to request them to be more expeditious in dispatching her out of her misery otherwise i should be obliged in pity to assist in that friendly office by putting an end to a life so mortally wounded when this horrid work was completed we observed seven more tents on the opposite side of the river the people belonging to them appeared to be in great confusion but did not offer to make their escape the indians fired many shots at them across the river but the poor esquimaux were so unacquainted with the nature of guns that when the bullets struck the rocks they ran in crowds to see what was sent them and seemed curious in examining the pieces of lead they found flattened on the rocks till at last one man was shot through the calf of the leg after which they immediately embarked in their canoes with their wives and children and paddled to a shoal in the river after the invaders had killed every soul they could get at they began breaking the stonekettles and copperwork which the esquimaux made use of instead of iron and when they had plundered their tents of every thing worth their notice they threw the tentpoles into the river where finding an old woman spearing of salmon every man thrusted his spear into her and barbarously butchered her  chap vii on the hudsonbay trade having frequently mentioned this company the reader will i trust not be displeased at having some little account of it and its trade with the indians of north america  though this company has been chartered since the year      and enjoy an exclusive right of trading throughout all the country round hudsonsbay indefinitely to the westward whether explored or unexplored the number of proprietors in      were only    and their stock amounted to no more than  0 000 l  they have six settlements in the bay between north latitude    and    and west longitude from london    to    in these six settlements they have but   0 people and employ but two ships and a sloop to take out sundry articles of merchandise and bring home peltries or skins the burden of these three vessels fall short of six hundred tons having on board about    men who with the   0 residing in the country make the whole number in their employ     besides skins they bring home a little ivory whaleoil and a small quantity of goosefeathers for beds and goosequills and take out british spirits and sundry trifling articles of little or no value a gallon of spirits which costs the company  0 d will purchase of the indians eight beaverskins worth   l sterling and a fourpenny comb will barter for a bears skin worth  0 s sterling it is a pity government should not put an end to this exclusive trade which at present is so trifling an object to them the annual returns not exceeding  0000 l and which might by being at large be productive of great advantages  the canadian merchants have formed themselves into an united company and carry on a very extensive business over an unlimited extent of country among indians who are declared enemies to each other this company alone without reckoning these adventurers who trade in the parts adjacent to the missisippi annually procure  000 packs of fine peltry weighing  0lb each worth    s a pound whereas the hudsonsbay company do not import into england onefourth of the quantity  i will close this account with mr umfrevilles description of the ravages which the smallpox made among the indians in the years      and      when an almost universal mortality spread itself throughout the country in the interior part of hudsonsbay extending its destructive effects through every tribe and nation sparing neither age nor sex  the distresses of the indians by this visitation demands pity from every humane person as the smallpox had never before been among them and they were utter strangers to its malignity they were not much alarmed at its first appearance numbers however began to die on every side the infection spread rapidly and hundreds lay expiring without assistance without courage or the least hopes of recovery for when an indian finds himself sick he resigns himself up to a state of insensible stupefaction and as the uncertainty of a savage life is such that one day he shall be exulting in the midst of plenty and the next pining under the misery of want they were now deprived of all manner of support  without the least medicinal help or that common aid which their case required a prey to hunger and disease these forlorn indians lay expiring in their tents under the accumulated weight of every scourge which human nature can experience wolves and other wild beasts infested and entered their habitations and dragged them out whilst life yet remained to devour their miserable morbid carcases even their faithful dogs worn out with hunger joined the ferocious wolves in their unnatural depredation heads legs and arms lay indiscriminately scattered about as food for the birds of the air and the beasts of the mountains and as none were buried the very air became infectious and tended to waft about the baneful contagion such has been the fate of many of the tribes inhabiting these parts and which has nearly terminated in their extinction  a description of california from the spanish of michael venegas a mexican jesuit published at madrid in      and others chap i of the country animals and productions the country we are going to describe is distinguished in maps by three different names california new albion and the islas carolinas it was called new albion by sir francis drake who in his second voyage round the world touched at this country in      but the most ancient name and that by which it is best known is california and such we shall call it  it is now known that this country is not an island but a peninsula joined to the continent of america in the most northern part discovered by the spaniards in the south sea or pacific ocean it is a large point of land issuing from the north coast of america and extending to the southeast washed on both sides by the pacific sea beyond the tropics so that the south point of it lies in the torrid zone and nearly opposite to the province of guadalaxara on which it depends the western coast of california runs to the southward extending    degrees to cape blanco de san sebastian and the eastern or inward coast on an accurate examination appears to reach ten degrees till it meets with the great river colorado between these two coasts is the peninsula of california and the arm of the sea between the eastern coast of the peninsula and the continent is called the gulf or bay of california and is in some places  0 some  0 and some  0 leagues broad into the upper end of this gulf the great river colorado discharges its waters this river lies between    and    degrees of north latitude ellis places cape blanco in     degrees west longitude from london which is equal to     degrees of the common longitude  of all the rivers in the vast extent of the viceroyalty of mexico colorado is the largest its mouth at its entrance into the gulf being near a league wide and lying in north latitude    degrees  0 minutes it runs directly north and south from the   th degree till it loses itself in the sea  till the beginning of this century no european had penetrated into the inland parts of california of course any accounts given of it cannot be relied on the limits already subdued by spain are about  00 leagues north from cape san lucas which is situated in the most southern point its breadth within these limits from sea to sea is in some places  0 leagues wide some  0 some  0 and in some only  0 leagues  the air is in general dry and hot to a great degree and the earth barren rugged and wild every where overrun with mountains rocks and sands with little water consequently unfit either for agriculture planting or grazing keno who crossed the river colorado between    and    degrees and took a very careful survey of the countries to the west of this river assures us that there are level and fruitful tracts interspersed with many delightful woods plenty of water fine pastures and as proper a country for making settlements as can be desired the idea therefore of barrenness is not to be extended beyond the   d degree north indeed though i have said generally that the peninsula is barren i would by no means infer that it is universally so it is not without plains here and there both for pasture and tillage and even in the center of california there are some valleys and rising grounds of a tolerable soil having springs for drinking and watering the grounds in these parts it is that the poor californians have their dwellings and here likewise are the cabeceras of the missions that is the principal towns where the missionary usually resides and the villages within their visitation but along the whole inward coast from cape san lucas to the river colorado there are only two streams and these but small on both sides the river santo thome which rises between    and    degrees of north latitude and after crossing the whole peninsula empties itself into the south sea at    degrees forming at its mouth a large harbor i say on both sides of this river are christian villiages  in california are now found all kinds of domestic animals commonly used in spain and mexico horses mules asses oxen sheep hogs goats dogs and cats they have been imported from new spain and thrive here very well but here are two species of wild animals not known in old or new spain the first is that which the californians call taye it is about the size of a calf a year and a half old and greatly resembles it in figure except in its head which is like that of a deer with very thick horns like a ram its hoof is large round and cloven like that of an ox its skin is spotted like a deer but the hair thinner and it has a short tail like a deer the flesh is very palatable and to some tastes delicious the other animal peculiar to this country is the cayote or wild dog very much resembling a fox here are also leopards such as they call lions in mexico goats cats and wild hogs are frequently found in the mountains and torquemada observes that about monterey are very large bears tigers an animal something like a buffalo and a creature which he thus describes it is about the size of a steer but shaped like a stag its hair resembles that of a pelican and is a quarter of a yard in length its neck long and on its head are horns like those of a stag the tail is a yard long and half a yard broad and its feet cloven like the feet of an ox  with respect to reptiles and insects besides the common ones here are also those which usually abound in hot countries as vipers efts scorpions lizards etc but no bugs and other mischievous insects so common to america  of birds there are an infinite variety among these for the table are turtledoves herons quails pheasants geese ducks and pigeons the birds of prey are vultures hawks falcons ossiphrages hornowls ravens and crows of nightbirds there are owls and many others of a smaller kind not seen in other parts nor mentioned by any naturalists nor have the narratives of the jesuits supplied us with a description or even with the names of them california has a great variety of singingbirds as larks nightingales and the like adorned with beautiful plumages torquemada says that about the harbor of monterey are bustards peacocks geese thrushes swallows sparrows goldfinches linnets quails partridges blackbirds waterwagtails cranes and other birds resembling turkeycocks so large as to be    palms from the extremity of one wing to that of the other and also a particular species of gulls that live on pilchards and other fish equal in size to a very large goose their bill a foot long with long legs resembling a stork their beak and feet like those of a goose they have a vast craw which in some hangs down like the leather bottles used in peru for carrying water in which craws they carry what they catch to their young ones the friendly disposition of these birds is something surprising for they assist one another when sick or wounded and bring that bird provision that is unable to search for it the indians profit by this for when they want a dish of fish they will wound and tie a gull to a particular spot conceal themselves and when they think all the provision is brought them which other gulls designed they advance and seize the contribution such are the mysterious ways of providence for the support of his creatures  there is very little timber in this country and the mountains all over this vast tract are totally bare of verdure or at most only covered with small shrubs briars and low trees but many of them have excellent fruit some common to europe and others peculiar to america  but among the plants and shrubs which most abound in california the principal is the pitahaga a kind of beech the fruit of which forms the great harvest of the poor inhabitants here this tree is not known in europe and differs from all other trees in the world its branches are fluted and rise vertically from the stem so as to form a very beautiful top they are without leaves the fruit growing to the boughs the fruit is like a horse chestnut and full of prickles but the pulp resembles that of a sig only more soft and luscious in some it is white in some red and in others yellow but always of an exquisite taste some again are wholly sweet others of a grateful acid but its most valuable quality is its being a specific against the distemper de loanda there is also a plumbtree here that instead of resin or gum throws out a very fine and fragrant incense in such quantities that they mix it with tallow for paying the bottoms of ships every kind of fruittree and all kinds of esculent roots and herbs growing in new spain have been brought here and have succeeded well  it is not absolutely ascertained what kind of minerals are produced in california but it is natural to suppose that there are many rich mines as the opposite coast in the provinces of lonora and pimeria are known to abound with them for in the year    0 a vein was discovered on an eminence not far from the garrison of pimeria the ore of which with a little labor yielded so large a quantity of silver as surprised the inhabitants of new spain and it remained some time a question whether it was a mine or treasures hid by the indians some have also been discovered which contain veins of other metals rocksalt is also found here of a whiteness equal to crystal and samples of it have been carried to mexico  but if the soil of california is in general barren the scarcity of provisions is supplied by the adjacent sea for both in the pacific ocean and in the gulf of california the multitude and variety of fishes are incredible  of the amphibious kind there are a species of beaver and some few sea lions that frequent the desert islands of both seas of the testaceous kind the most remarkable is the tortoise on the south sea coast are some small conches peculiar to it and perhaps the most beautiful in the world the luster exceeding that of the finest motherofpearl and appearing through a transparent varnish of a most vivid blue like the lapis lazuli it is thought that if these were imported into europe the aqua marina would no longer be valued these are univalves and consequently different from the shellfish in which the pearls are found the latter being bivalves like our oysters these last lie so thick along the whole coast that they may be counted by thousands they are called madras perlas and their abundance has rendered california so famous that great numbers of persons during the last two centuries have visited this place and searched every part of the gulf merely with a view of enriching themselves by these pearls the sea of california says torquemada affords very rich pearlfisheries where in three or four fathom water the hostias or beds of oysters may be seen as plain as if they were on the surface of the water this fishery is carried on by diverse but as the water in the gulf is not very deep it is attended with less labor and danger than those on the coast of malabar and other parts of the east indies great numbers resort to this fishery from new spain new galicia culiacan cinaloa and sonora  father piccolo observes that in the months of april may and june there falls with the dew a kind of manna which becomes inspisated on the leaves of the trees and which has all the sweetness of sugar though not so white this good father talks according to the common opinion as if this manna dropped from heaven but botanists are agreed that it is a juice exsudating from the plants themselves as gums incense balsams and resins do it is no wonder that the trees of california should exsudate manna since many parts of spain produce it in an astonishing plenty and for medical uses equal to that of calabria or sicily among the mountains of avila and the pederoches or seven towns of cordova situated among the mountains of andalusia and other parts there is as much manna produced about the dog days as is sufficient to supply the whole world which till the year      was not noticed but was used only by the bees in forming their combs but in the year just mentioned on the representation of the royal college of physicians at madrid the king gave orders that two of its members should examine into the qualities of this drug and its efficacy be experimentally proved by exhibiting it to the patients in the hospitals  chap ii of the people government etc of all the nations hitherto discovered the californians are at least equal to any in the make of their bodies their faces are also far from disagreeable though their daubing them with ointments painting them and boring holes through their nostrils and ears are very great disadvantages their complexion indeed is more tanned and swarthy than that of the other indians of new spain but they are in general robust vigorous and of a healthy countenance  there are three nations of indians in california who speak three different languages but the dress throughout the whole peninsula is uniform for males whether children or adults go at all times totally naked but amidst this naked similiarity there is some diversity in the ornaments used by every nation in the southern parts the people decorate their heads with strings of pearl braided with their hair with these they interweave small feathers the whole forming an ornament which at a distance resembles a periwig the nation of loretto generally wear round their waist a becoming girdle and on their forehead a curious fillet of network to these some add a neckcloth with some wellwrought figures of nacar and sometimes some small round fruits like beads which in some measure resemble a rosary hanging on their breast they also adorn their arms with bracelets of the same works the cochines of the north usually keep their hair short a few only excepted who suffer it to hang down upon their shoulders if they do not use pearls like those of the south they have a more splendid ornament a kind of diadem or crown formed of several bands of nacar to compose this they first detach the mother of pearl from the shell give it a fine polish on both sides and by means of a slint divide it into small pieces in which they bore holes to string them when one of these indians offered sir francis drake such a diadem or head dress he conceived they offered him the crown and scepter of california  though the women in some parts go naked as the men yet in general they show a great attention to that decency which is so necessary to the defense of their virtue and to such a degree that even infant girls are not without a proper covering toward cape san lucas is a certain species of palm trees different from those which produce dates and from these the indian women procure materials for their petticoats in order to which they beat it as we do flax till the threads or filaments are separated their garments consist of three pieces two of which form a petticoat reaching from the girdle to the feet and the third a short cloak or mantlet which covers the body from the shoulders these pieces are not woven and the threads are fastened at the top with one another as in fringes and hang down in very close and thick skains and tufts and though they make a sort of linen of these jutas or palmthreads they only use it for bags in which they keep their instruments the indian women of cape san lucas wear their hair long loose and spread on their shoulders but their headdress is the same with that generally worn by all the women of california it consists of a piece of network made with such ingenuity that the soldiers of the garrisons likewise use them  the women of the northern parts wear a different and a meaner garment being covered only from the waist to the knees before they wear a petticoat made of very thin pieces of sedge cut off at the knots and about the size of a straw these they fasten together with threads and barely serve to hide those parts which nature has taught them to conceal but does not defend them from the inclemencies of the weather in some few places it is the custom to cover their bodies with cloaks made with the skins of wild beasts  one of the highest festivals among the cochines is the day in which they annually distribute the skins to the women all the neighboring rancherias or villages meet at an appointed place and there with branches of trees and bushes erect a spacious arbor from which they clear a broad and level way for racers here they bring the skins of all the beasts they have killed that year and lay them as a carpet along the course none but the chiefs are admitted into the arbor and when the banquet which consists of game fish and fruit is over they intoxicate themselves with cimarron or wild tobacco at the entrance of the arbor a sorcerer takes his place dressed in the habit of ceremony and with wild vociferations proclaims the praises of the hunters in the mean time the other indians run to and fro in a frantic manner on the skins whilst the women who assist at this ceremony sing and dance with equal transport this continues till the orator is quite spent when the harangue concludes and with it the races the chiefs then come out of the arbor and distribute to the women the skins for their clothing that year and this distribution is celebrated with fresh rejoicings the foundation of all this festivity was that these poor women were acquainted with no greater ornament than the skin of a deer though it scarcely covered their nakedness with any tolerable degree of modesty  the men however were and are such strangers to that virtue that they consider those principles as ignominious and disgraceful which require their being clothed and accordingly when any of the missionaries or soldiers offer them clothes they either refuse them or throw them away indeed their ideas with regard to clothing is so different from the rest of the human species that father salva tierra tells us they were highly affronted when he first directed them to cover at least what modesty requires not being in the least sensible of any indecency from their being naked and it caused as much laughter to see one of their own countrymen clothed as a monkey dressed like an officer would among us of which he had a diverting instance  a missionary on his arrival at his mission clothed two little boys which he entertained in his house first to teach them the language and afterward to serve him as catechumens the father himself was at the pains of cutting out making and fitting the clothes for them when the lads first went abroad in their new dress it occasioned such indecent mirth that the boys ashamed at being thus the ridicule of their countrymen pulled off their clothes and hung them on a tree but being unwilling to show themselves ungrateful to the father and at the same time to avoid being reprimanded they determined to divide his kindness going in the daytime naked among their relations and at night dressing themselves to return to the father  the houses of the californians make no better appearance than their habits those of every rancheria or village are merely wretched huts situated near the few waters found in this country and as there is a necessity of removing to other places in quest of subsistence they easily shift their station wherever they stop they shelter themselves under the trees from the scorching heat of the sun by day and the coldness and inclemency of the weather by night in severe winters they live in caverns which they either dig themselves or find in the sides of mountains their houses are but a small space enclosed with stones laid one upon another half a yard high are square and without any covering but the heavens dwellings indeed so scanty and mean that an european tomb would be here reckoned a palace for within this small precinct not having room to lie at full length they sleep in a sitting posture the missionaries have erected houses for them with unburnt bricks covered with sedge but there seems no possibility of bringing them to live in them for they show the greatest uneasiness at being under any covering a proof that the greatest part of what are called the necessaries of life arise purely from fancy example and custom  it is true they stand in no need of large rooms for depositing their furniture and the various articles of a wardrobe with which the greatest part of our houses is taken up with so little furniture and so few utensils do the indians content themselves that in removing they carry all on their back for they consist only of a boat a dart a dish a bowl made in the shape of a highcrowned hat a bone which serves them for an awl in making it a little piece of touchwood for kindling a fire a pitahayanet in which they put their fruit and seeds another in the shape of a purse or bag fastened to a kind of prong across their shoulders in which they carry their children and lastly their bow and arrows to which some who affect elegance add a shell for drinking those who live near the coast have also nets for fishing this furniture the women carry the men burden themselves only with their bows and arrows and the materials to repair them these materials are flints and feathers for the arrows and nerves for bowstrings which not to incommode them in traveling they carry in a large case which they hang to their ears by boring a hole through them the men also carry a small bit of wood for procuring fire which is soon done by rubbing it between their hands they likewise carry their boats which are made of the bark of trees and which it is the province of the women to repair every part of their boats is so curiously made as to be admired by europeans they often fetch and and keep water in these boats it is the business of the men to make the nets and in this they show exquisite skill making them of so many different colors sizes and such a variety of workmanship that it is not easy to describe them no nets made in europe being in any respect equal to them either for beauty strength or finishing  the californians admit of a plurality of wives who provide for the family and are diligent in bringing their husband a sufficient quantity of fruits from the forest to keep them in good humor for if once they are discarded no other man will take them so that the more wives a man has the better he is provided for and this principally contributes to keep up the brutal custom the nation of loretto is indeed more moderate the chief men among them never having more than two wives whilst the generality are contented with one adultery is accounted a crime that calls for revenge except on two occasions one at their festivals and routs and the other at their wrestling matches among the rancherias as on these occasions it is the scandalous privilege of the victor among the cochines or cochinies of the north scarce any such excess is known and a missionary speaking of his district says that amidst the unbounded freedom of these indians debauchery or an illegal amor is seldom seen which he attributes to the uncomfortable life they lead among the mountains in hunger cold nakedness and the want of every thing desirable  the manner of negociating their marriages in the nation of loretto which inhabits the middle part of california is to present the bride by way of earnest with a batea or jug in their language called olo her acceptance of it denotes her consent and on her part she presents him in return with a net for his head this reciprocal exchange of presents confirms the marriage in the other nations the agreement is concluded at the end of a ball to which the lover invites the whole californian wedding rancheria but after all this solemnity of contract the slightest motive annuls it  the californians had adopted that absurdity which is so much laughed at in the accounts of brazil namely that of the women going immediately after delivery to some water to wash themselves and the child and in other particulars using no manner of caution but going to the forest for wood and food and performing every other service the husband wanted whilst he lay in his cave or stretched at full length under a tree affecting to be extremely ill and weak mothers were even known to destroy their children in any scarcity of food till father salva tierra put a stop to this unnatural practice by ordering that a double allowance should be given to women newly delivered it was also an established custom among them like that in the jewish law for a widow to marry the brother or nearest relation of the deceased  the time of gathering the pitahayas is their vintage and they celebrate it with particular mirth and rejoicings the three pitahaya months says salva tierra resemble the carnival in some parts of europe when the men are in a great measure stupefied or mad at this time the nation throw aside what little reason they have giving themselves up to feastings dancings entertainments of the neighboring rancherias and buffooneries and in these whole nights are spent to the high diversion of the audience the actors are chosen for their talent of imitation and they execute their parts admirably well  as practice naturally produces perfection their excellence in these dances is not to be wondered at it being their whole occupation in time of peace they dance at their weddings on any good success in fishing or hunting at the birth of their children at a plentiful harvest at a victory over their enemies and on any other occasion without weighing the importance of it to these festivities the rancherias usually invite one another and likewise often send challenges for wrestling leaping running shooting with their bow and trials of strength and in these and the like sports days and nights weeks and months are often spent in times of peace but these tranquil seasons are subject to frequent interruptions of wars factions and feuds of some nations and rancherias against others the end of these commotions is not the acquisition of same or the enlargement of territory but usually revenge for affronts or injuries among private persons or sometimes they arise from more substantial causes when a rancheria or nation has a right to fish hunt or gather fruits where another has a kind of right by prescription the manner of revenge is to commit some hostility or do some damage to the person chiefly offending or if he is beyond their power to do it to his kindred or rancheria after this all make the cause their own and if they do not think themselves able to give battle to their enemies they apply to other rancherias for succor with whom they are in amity the manner of declaring war is with a frightful noise ordering every one to provide great quantities of reeds and flints taking care that this declaration shall not reach their adversaries that by terrifying them they may obtain the easier victory when they come to action they set up a shout and engage without any regularity except in relieving the bodies in front when they give way either as quite spent or for want of arrows which are made of reeds with sharp flints for their points but not poisoned when the engagement becomes close they make use of a kind of wooden spears with the points sharpened and hardened in the fire which do equal execution with those pointed with steel the victory is gained not so much by address conduct strength and courage as by keeping up their spirits against their innate fear or inspiring the enemy with it  the characteristics of the californians as well as of all other indians are stupidity and insensibility want of knowledge and reflection inconstancy impetuosity and blindness of appetite an excessive sloth and abhorrence of all labor and fatigue an incessant love of pleasure and amusement of every kind however trifling or brutal pusillanimity and relaxness in short a most wretched want of every thing which constitutes the real man and renders him rational inventive tractable and useful to himself and society it is not easy for europeans who never were out of their own country to conceive an adequate idea of these people for even in the least frequented corners of the globe there is not a nation so stupid of such contracted ideas and so weak both in body and mind as the unhappy californians their understanding comprehends little more than what they see abstract ideas and much less a chain of reasoning being fa beyond their power so that they scarce can improve their first ideas and these are in general false and inadequate it is in vain to represent to them any future advantages which will result to them by doing or abstaining from this or that particular the relation of means and ends being beyond the stretch of their faculties nor have they the least notion  such intentions as will procure themselves some future good or guard them against evils their insensibility to corporeal objects show what little regard they have to future rewards and punishments they have only a few faint glimmerings of moral virtues and vices so that some things appear good and others evil without any reflection and though they enjoy the light of natural reason and that divine grace which is given to all without distinction yet the one is so weak and the other so little attended to that without any regard to decency pleasure and profit are the spring and end of all their actions  their will is proportionate to their faculties and all their passions move in a very narrow sphere ambition they have none and are more anxious to be accounted strong than valiant the most that is observed in them is some little emulation to see their companions praised or rewarded rouses them and is indeed the only thing which stimulates and prevails on them to shake off their innate sloth they are equally free from avarice that destructive passion which makes such havoc in polite nations the utmost extent of their desires is to get the present days food without much fatigue taking little care for that of the ensuing day  this disposition of mind as it gives them up to an amazing languor and lassitude their lives fleeting away in a perpetual inactivity and detestation of labor so it likewise leads them to be attracted by the first object which their own fancy or the persuasion of another places before them and at the same time renders them as prone to alter their resolutions with the same facility they look with indifference on any kindness done them nor is the bare remembrance of it to be expected from them their hatred and revenge are excited by the slightest causes but they are as easily appeased and even without any satisfaction especially if they meet with opposition for though courage seems the only thing they value it may be said with truth that they have not the least notion of true bravery their rancour and fury last no longer than whilst they meet with resistance the least thing daunts them and when once they begin to yield their fear will induce them to stoop to the basest indignities as on the contrary by obtaining any advantage or if the enemy becomes disheartened they swell with the most extravagant pride in a word these unhappy mortals may be compared to children in whom the developement of reason is not completed they may indeed be called a nation who never arrive at manhood their predominant passion is suitable to such an unhappy condition in which they make so little use of reason i mean a violent fondness for all kind of diversion pleasure festivals games dancing and revels in which they brutishly waste their miserable days however in the californians are seen few of those bad dispositions for which the other americans are infamous no strong liquors are used among them and it is only on their festivals that they intoxicate themselves and then with the smoke of wild tobacco what little every one has is safe from theft quarrels are rarely known among them and the several members of a rancheria live in great harmony among themselves and peaceably with others all their malice and rage they reserve for their enemies and so far are they from obstinacy harshness or cruelty that nothing can exceed their docility and gentleness consequently are easily persuaded to good or evil  the government of the californians cannot be supposed to exceed the short limits of their capacity there being among them neither division of lands or possessions and consequently no succession to immoveables nor on the other hand any complaints of illegal intrusions every nation or language consists of several rancherias more or less in number according to the fertility of the soil and each rancheria of one or more families united by consanguinity but when the missionaries came among them neither the rancherias nor the nations had a chief or superior to whom they paid obedience or whose authority they acknowledged by any kind of tribute or external ceremony every family governed itself according to their own fancy and the natural obedience from sons to fathers was very little after the former were able to provide for themselves the sorcerers and jugglers of whom we shall speak were possessed of some kind of superiority but this lasted no longer than the time of their festivals or during the time of sickness or other incidents which excited their fear or superstition however in the rancherias and even in the nations the missionaries found one two or more who gave orders for gathering the produces of the earth directed the fisheries and the military expeditions in case of a quarrel with any other rancheria or nation this dignity was not obtained by blood and descent nor by age suffrages or a formal election the necessity of applying for instruction to one or more on some common exigency rendered it natural that with a tacit consent he who was brave expert artful or eloquent should be promoted to the command but his authority was limited to terms imposed by the fancy of those who without well knowing how quietly submitted to him this leader or casique conducted them to the forests and seacoasts in quest of food sent and received messages to and from the adjacent states informed them of dangers spirited them up to the revenge of injuries whether real or feigned done by other rancherias or nations and headed them in their wars ravages and depredations in all other particulars every one was entire master of his liberty  chap iii of the ancient religion of the californians the most interesting subject for curiosity and which requires the greatest accuracy and attention in treating it is the ancient religion of the californians and the use to be made of such researches in favor of our holy religion is in enumerating the different sects ancient and modern of all nations in the world to increase from their darkness the luster of the christian dispensation on the other hand a faithful representation of the shadow of death in which these indians lay immersed will heighten the greatness of the divine goodness in bringing them into the bosom of the church many a father missionary has lost his life in the sacred cause but christianity has now gained a pretty firm footing among them  all relations agree that hitherto no idolatry has been found among the californians they neither worshipped any creatures nor had any representations or images of false deities to whom they paid any kind of adoration in short scarce any trace of religion was to be found among them nor did their external performances show the least knowledge of god yet there was among them a series of speculative tenets which must surprise the reader for they not only have an idea of the unity and nature of god as a pure spirit and likewise of the other spiritual beings but also some faint glimmerings of the trinity the eternity of the savior and other articles of the christian religion though mixed with a thousand absurdities and this light was so clear in them that some missionaries have been induced to think that they were descended from a people who had formerly been christians  there is say they in heaven a lord of great power called niparaya who made the earth and the sea gives food to all creatures created the trees and every thing we see and can do whatever he pleases we do not see him because he has not a body like us this niparaya has a wife called anayicoyondi and though he makes no use of her not having a body he has had three sons of these one is quaayayp i e man and anayicoyondi was delivered of him in the mountains of acaragui quaayayp has been with the southern indians and taught them he was very powerful and had a great number of men for he went into the earth and brought people from thence at length the indians through hatred killed him and at the same time put a wreath of thorns upon his head he is dead but to this day remains very beautiful and without any corruption blood is continually running from him he does not speak as being dead but he has a tecolote or owl that speaks for him they further say that in heaven there are many more inhabitants than on earth and that formerly there were great wars in that place a person of eminent power whom some learned men call wac and others tuparan rose up against the supreme lord niparaya and being joined by numerous adherents dared to stand a battle with him but was totally defeated by niparaya who immediately deprived wac tuparan of all his power his fine pitahayas and his other provisions turned him out of heaven confined him and his followers in a vast cave under the earth and created the whales in the sea to be as guards that they should not leave their place of confinement they add that the supreme lord niparaya does not like that people should fight and that those who die by an arrow or spear do not go to heaven but on the contrary wac tuparan wishes that all people were continually fighting because all who are killed in battle go to his cave there are two parties among these indians one siding with niparaya and are a serious discreet people open to conviction and readily listen to the christian truths which are enforced upon them from their own tenets the other party is that devoted to wac tuparan and are of very perverse dispositions sorcerers and unfortunately very numerous these partisans of wac tuparan have several opinions peculiar to themselves and monstrously absurd as that the stars are shining pieces of metal that the moon was created by cucunumic the stars by purutabui and the like  the tenets of the loretto nation are as follows they have no word in their language signifying heaven but express it by the general word notu which signifies above or high they say that in the north part of heaven lives the spirit of spirits which they call gumongo that he sends pestilences and sicknesses and in former ages sent down another spirit to visit the earth to whom they give the name of guyiaguai that he was no sooner come than he began to sow the land with pitahayas and likewise made the creeks along the coast of the gulf till he came to a vast stone in a very spacious creek near loretto called by the spaniards puerto escondido where he resided for some time here say they the other inferior spirits his attendants used to bring him pitahayas to eat and fish which they caught in the creek guyiaguais occupation was to make vestments for his priests who in their language are called dicuinochos of the hides which were offered to him after some time guyiaguai continued his visitation sowing pitahayas and making creeks along all the coast of the loretto nation and as a memorial left a painted table which the dicuinochos or priests make use of at their entertainments they add that the sun moon and the morning and evening stars are men and women that every night they fail into the western sea whence they are under a necessity of swimming out by the way of the east that the other stars are lights made in heaven by that visiting spirit and his attendants and that though they become quenched by the seawater he goes toward the sun to light them again it would be very tedious to enter into the many absurdities of the same kind which were imposed on this unhappy people by their stupid or designing priests  the nation of the cochinies is not only the most numerous and extended but they have likewise the best genius and less extravagant opinions and brutality in their customs their behavior is remarkably courteous and they never break their word they believe that there is in heaven a lord whose name in their language signifies he who lives that he had a son without a mother to whom they give two names one of which imports perfection or end of clay the other signifies swift besides him they say there is another whose name is he who makes lords though they give the name of lord to all the three yet when asked how many lords there are they answer one who made the heavens the earth the animals the trees and fruits also man and woman they likewise have some notion of devils saying that the great lord called he who lives created certain beings who are not seen who revolted against him and are enemies both to him and mankind to these they give the name of liars ensnarers or seducers they add that when men die these deceivers come and bury them that they may not see the lord who lives the converted indians could have no design of imposing on the missionaries in telling them that before their conversion they held opinions in some respects like their own it is reasonable therefore to conclude that some storm or other accident carried to the coasts of california some europeans or inhabibitants of the philippines of whom no memory now exists among the indians and these finding themselves among barbarians endeavored to instill into them the mysteries of christianity and that those instructions in process of time became more and more disfigured till the arrival of the missionaries when the place was conquered by spain  it is now above two centuries since the coast of california has been visited by europeans the inhabitants of mexico from the western coast of new spain have frequented the gulf of california to fish for pearls and others have arrived at the western coast by the way of the south sea and therefore among a variety of accidents either as punishment or from misfortune one or more may have been obliged to remain among these indians there are a few negroes among them the race of those who had been left by a ship from the philippine islands sir francis drake left a pilot on shore who after some years fortunately got away again and so lately as      the russians were obliged to leave on the same coast of america and at a higher latitude part of a ships company who had sailed on a discovery all which gives room to believe that some europeans under a similar disaster had not the same good fortune to arrive at a country peopled with europeans after wandering over vast tracts inhabited by barbarians but on the contrary were obliged to pass the remainder of their days among them  their edues or priests were what might be expected from this shadow or imitation of religion they are frequently called hechiceros or sorcerers but it is not to be thought that these poor creatures had any commerce with apostate spirits it is known that the same extravagant credulity obtained here which not long since deluged the old world with regard to the ancient pagan oracles but the most sagacious missionaries found them out to be rrant impostors pretending to hold intelligence with rits the existence of which was believed by the rnians this supposed commerce with the devil  them great authority among that simple people and this reverence they strengthened by certain ceremonies and gestures and the introduction of many mystic rites what also strengthened this authority was their being the only physicians from whom they could hope for relief when sick and whatever was the medicine it was always administered with great ostentation and solemnity  the loretto indians had schools in which these professors instructed their youth in the above opinions and recommended them as truths of great importance but the authority of the californian priests on no occasion appears with such splendour as in the public feasts there are no sacrifices or any other religious ceremonies at these times but the whole consists of eating drinking dancing talking and laughing yet the presence of their priests makes them considered as religious solemnities for they act the chief part and dress themselves in a habit of ceremony which is only used on extraordinary occasions this consists of a large cloak covering them from head to foot and entirely composed of human hair the head is adorned with a very high plumage of hawks feathers and in their hands they carry a very large fan formed of the largest feathers of the same bird the southern edues when they cannot get feathers adorn or rather disfigure their heads with the tails of deer and the cochinies of the north add two strings of the hoofs of the same beast one as a chain round the neck and the other as a girdle the ridiculoussness of this garb is still heightened by daubing their bodies over with red black and different colors so that the readers fancy will easily represent what figures they make  these priests open the entertainment with sucking the chacuaco till they become frantic and almost drunk with the smoke thus intoxicated they begin an oration on their tenets which they deliver with wild gestures and frightful vociferations pretending to be inspired by those spirits which the nation acknowledges and in their name denouncing whatever their frenzy or interest suggests at other times pretending to be the spirits themselves whilst these frantic preachers are haranguing the others are feasting and dancing and being inflamed by gluttony intemperance and dancing the whole concludes in the most abominable gratification of their appetites all mingling indiscriminately as if determined to violate every principle of shame reason and modesty  though these feasts are often made without any necessary causes yet those made at the gathering of the pitahayas for a victory for the distribution of the fish caught and the deerskins greatly surpass the others in solemnity but that on boring the ears and nostrils of children exceeds all to these all the women and men resort the ornament of wearing pearls from their nostrils to their ears being common to both sexes the shrieks of the children on these occasions incite the fathers to greater and louder shouts in order to suppress any sympathy with the cries and tears of their children at these feasts the priests do not omit exercising that authority which they owe to the fears of the people celebrating according to their private passions some as brave and generous upbraiding others as cowards factious and wicked and even enjoining them certain penances the most customary of which is fasting or abstinence this is not the only method of chastising them they sometimes order them to clear the ways along the highest mountains for the more easy descent of the visiting spirit when it comes to see them and at certain distances to lay a heap of stones where it may stop and rest itself but what cannot be read without horror is that these inhuman impostors sometimes even order them to throw themselves down from a precipice and though in so doing they must necessarily be dashed to pieces yet such is the blindness and dread of these poor creatures that it is very seldom their orders fail of being executed either willingly or by force besides this these priests raise contributions on all such as demand any provisions and certain portions of human hair to make their cloaks all which is paid as a tribute with a punctual willingness this tribute children pay in return for their instruction and the sick adults on recovery in gratitude for their cure and if not for their care after death for the californians are not forsaken by their priests when dead on the contrary they redouble their cares and extend them to the whole rancheria but when the distemper arrives at such a height as to be past cure they assemble all the patients relations that he may die with the greater uneasiness if the patient has a daughter or sister they in the first place cut off the little finger of her right hand pretending thereby that the blood either cures the patient or at least removes from the family all sorrow for his death but is in reality an additional cause of pain and grief then follow the visits from the whole rancheria who after talking to him and being made acquainted with his desperate condition set up a confused howling sometimes covering their faces with their hands and their hair and repeating this ceremony from time to time divided into separate companies and all in the presence of the dying person the women increase the horror of these howlings with passionate cries and exclamations setting forth the merits of the patient in order to move greater compassion the howling being over the patient requests the company to suck and blow him in the same manner as the physician had done this is by filling a tube made out of a hard black stone with tobacco applying the end of it to the part affected and then with their mouth at the other end sometimes sucking up the smoke at others blowing it through the tube on the diseased part with all their force this friendly office is performed by every one as this and the strength of their cries is the best proof of their degree of affection for the sick person in the mean time the doctors thrust their hands into the patients mouth pretending to pluck death forcibly out of his body the women still continuing their outcries give the patient many severe strokes in order to awake him till between one uneasiness and another they deprive the poor wretch of life and as soon as dead they proceed to bury or burn him as is most convenient the funerals are immediately performed without any preparation amidst a continuance of the same howlings and without any singularity only burying or burning with the deceased all his utensils and so little do they enquire into the reality of his death previous to the burning or interment that one day salva tierra tells us hastening to the spot where they were going to burn a man they supposed dead and perceiving some remains of life in him he snatched him from the fire and in time recovered him reproving their rashness and barbarity  father torquemada speaking of the island of st catherine in the neighborhood of california says in this island are rancherias or communities and in them a temple with a large level court where they perform their sacrifices and in one was a large circular space the place of the altar with an enclosure of feathers of several birds of different colors which i understood says he were those of the birds they sacrificed in great numbers and within the circle was an image strangely bedaubed with a variety of colors representing some devil according to the manner of the indians of new spain holding in its hand a figure of the sun and moon it happened that when the soldiers came to see this temple they found within the said circle two crows considerably larger than ordinary which at the approach of the spaniards flew away but allighted among the rocks in the neighborhood the soldiers seeing them of such uncommon size fired their guns and killed them at this an indian who had attended the spaniards as a guide fell into an agony i was informed that they believed the devil spoke to them in these crows and thence held them in great veneration sometime after one of the religious going that way saw some indian women washing fish on the shore but some crows came up to them and with their beaks took the fish from their hands whilst they observed a profound silence not daring so much as to look at them much less frighten them away nothing therefore could seem more horrible to the californians than that the spaniards should shoot at these respectable birds  in the year      there were    missionaries settled in different parts of the country and they had established    christian villages  a map of persia map of persia  persia from sir john chardin who was there in the last century elton who traveled through the northern provinces in      jonas hanway who did the same in      and william franklin who resided eight months at shirauz in      and      chap i of the country climate and productions the persian empire founded by cyrus the great     years before the christian era was the second of the four ancient monarchies established in the world and at that period extended from the gulf of ormus and the red sea and from ethiopia in the south to the euxine and caspian seas on the north and from the river indus now called the scind in the east to the deserts of lybia or that part of africa bordering upon egypt the mediterranean and archipelago seas on the west but the boundaries of this kingdom are now said to be india or the moguls dominions on the east the ocean and persian gulf toward the south the turkish empire on the west and circasia the caspian sea and the river oxus that divides it from usbectartary toward the north the most southern part of persia lies in    degrees north latitude and the most northern part in    degrees of course we may reckon it   00 miles long from north to south and the most western part of it lying in    degrees of longitude from london and the most eastern in    degrees its breadth and length are nearly equal and was it not for the caspian sea which divides the northeast parts of persia from the northwest the form of the country would be almost square  it consists of twelve provinces of which fars is the ancient persis in which stood the city persepolis whose magnificent ruins are the wonder of every traveller curdestan the ancient assyria erack the ancient parthia now reckoned the principal province and almost the center of the empire gylan the ancient hyrcania and aditbeitzan the southern part of the ancient media of the province of shirven armenia is a part  persia extending from the   th degree of latitude and to the   th the longest day in the south is    hours and a half and in the north above    hours in so great an extent of country it is natural to suppose that the air and seasons are very different as in fact they are in the middle of the kingdom their winter begins in november and continues till march with severe frosts and snow which falls in great quantities on their mountains but not so much in the level countries from march to may the wind is usually high and from thence to september they have a calm serene heaven with not so much as a cloud and though it is pretty hot in the daytime the refreshing breezes which blow constantly morning and evening as well in the night make the summer tolerable especially as the nights are near ten hours long the climate of shirauz in the province of fars where mr franklin spent eight months is says that gentleman one of the most agreeable in the world the extremes of heat and cold being seldom felt during the spring of the year the uncommonly beautiful flowers of which they have a great variety of the brightest hues and fragancy perfume the natural mildness of the air the beauties of nature are here depicted in their fullest extent the natural historian and botanist would here meet with ample scope for their favorite investigations so that the inhabitants of shirauz confidently assert the preeminence of their own city to any other in the world and the natural beauties of the place call forth the poetical exertions of a hafez a sadi or a jami in summer the thermometer seldom rises above    degrees in the daytime and at night generally sinks to    degrees their autumn is the worst season of the year the rains then beginning to fall and the air reckoned as unhealthy producing colds fluxes and fevers though a great deal of heavy snow falls in winter ice is rarely to be found except on the mountaintops and in the more northern parts of persia the air is so pure at night and the stars shine with that luster that one man may know another well by their light and people travel much more in the night than in the day in this part of persia there are very seldom any hurricanes or tempests and very little thunder and lightning nor is it subject to earthquakes in the fine weather particularly summer there is not the least dew or moisture and even at other times the dew is of that nature that it will not rust the finest steel if left to dry on it this dryness in the air causes their buildings to last a long time and is undoubtedly one of the principal reasons that the celebrated ruins of persepolis have endured for so many ages that place being situated in much such another valley as shirauz and but two days journey from it it very seldom rains even in the winter and no country as appears from the hale complexion of the natives is more healthy than the heart of persia  in the month of march says hanway the sun shines so strongly on the snow about casbin that the reflection is injurious to the eyes and halfblinds the people and the southern parts particularly about gombron we are told by other writers is so unhealthy about the spring and fall that the european factors never pass a year without a dangerous illness carrying off some of them it is a common thing for two to agree that if one dies the survivor shall possess the others fortune the months of june july and august are here so very hot that both natives and foreigners get up into the mountains at that time the hot winds which blow from the eastward over a long tract of sandy deserts are ready to suffocate them and sometimes there happens a pestilential blast that strikes the traveller dead in an instant it rains but very seldom in the course of the year and the water they save is very unwholesome  the provinces of georgia shirvan and aditbeitzan which lie in the most northern part of persia are very dry and warm in the summer but subject to storms and tempests in the winter and have as severe frosts for six months as any countries on the continent in the same latitude and as this part of persia is very mountainous there is frequently a great difference between the air on the north and south sides of the mountains and in a few miles traveling people think themselves in a different climate but cold as the mountains are in the north they are extremely healthy on the contrary the slat countries of ghilan and mezenderan which lie upon the caspian sea and was the ancient hyrcania are very damp full of stinking morasses and so unhealthful that the inhabitants retire into the mountains in the summertime all the water they have in the hot season being foul and corrupted  as sir john chardin observes there is not a country in the world which has more mountains and fewer rivers than persia and some of the mountains are considered as the highest on the face of the earth mount taurus branches itself out into different provinces and runs quite through the country from west to east the loftiest mountains are those called ararat in armenia and those which separate media from hyrcania and hyrcania from erack those that divide fars from carmenia are dry barren rocks and very lofty but those of hyrcania and curdestan covered with woods near baku is a mountain that sparkles like diamonds from the quantity of talc and crystal with which it abounds there are through this kingdom vast sandy deserts several days journey over where scarce a drop of water is to be met with and the land in general on the frontiers lies uncultivated to discourage their enemies from invading them there are however some fruitful plains and valleys where their principal cities stand which yield plenty of grain and herbage and no country is more fruitful than the provinces which lie upon the caspian sea  not onetenth part of the kingdom is cultivated many of the valleys are barren which formerly were fruitful when the waters were turned into them in some provinces there are hundreds of fine aqueducts choked up and buried in ruins  with respect to rivers there is not one in the heart of the country that will carry a boat of any burden the river oxus that divides persia from usbecktartary is a large stream but as there are no branches of it that rise in the persian dominions it is of little use to them but there are several small rivulets which fall from the mountains and are conveyed by subterraneous channels or otherwise to their principal cities  water being so scarce in persia there is no place where they husband it better or have more ingenious contrivances to convey it to their cities and into their cornfieldsd and gardens this is the care of government and there is a great officer in every province who has the charge of the conveyance and distribution of the waters  they turn all their little rivulets and springs to such parts of the country where they are most wanted they dig wells also of a prodigious depth and breadth out of which they draw water with oxen in great leatherbuckets which being emptied into cisterns is let out occasionally for sundry uses they have also vast subterranean aqueducts through which water is conveyed twenty or thirty leagues these are two fathoms high and arched with brick and at every  0 paces distance are large holes like wells made for the convenience of carrying on the arch without working underground too far and the more easy repairing of them the distribution of river and spring water is made one day to one quarter of the town and another day to another when every one opens the canal or reservoir in his garden to receive it and for which an annual sum is paid and as it is easy for any to divert his neighbors water into his own channel such fraud is severely punished  besides the ocean there are two seas belonging to persia the caspian sea and the gulf of persia the former we have spoken of when treating of tartary the persians have but few vessels on this sea but they are not so negligent of the gulf of persia or bossora on account of the pearlfishery which is reckoned the best in the world they are masters of both sides of this gulf as well as the islands in it the pearlfishery lies near the island of baharem of the rest of the islands ormus situated at the entrance of this sea is the most famous and is about thirty miles round this was once in the possession of the portuguese who then commanded the pearlfishery and all the trade of persia and who built on it one of the most elegant cities in asia but this city is gone and there is nothing on the island but an indifferent castle in possession of the persians the trade being removed to gombron about two leagues distant the island itself never produced any thing but salt which grows in a solid crust two inches deep on the surface of the ground and the hills appear at a distance with it as if covered with snow nor is there a drop of fresh water on the island the portuguese fetched their water from the continent  about   0 years ago the king of persia by the assistance of the english east india companys ships expelled the portuguese for which they were allowed half the customs of gombron which amounted to about  0000 l a year but the persians afterward took the whole customs themselves making the english company some trifling acknowledgment  near    miles to the southwest of kislar on the frontiers of tartary on the first circassian mountain lying on the south of the river tereck there is a well about  0 fathoms deep from which issues boiling water into a stone basin hence it falls down a precipice near  0 fathoms into the tereck in sufficient quantities to turn the wheel of a mill the tartars convey it into pits and find great relief in many complaints from bathing in it among several experiments which a surgeon made on this water he found that after it was bottled up close for a short time the napthasmell it had went off near this hill are seven springs of the same kind of water and one which appears impregnated with alium being so acid and astringent as not to be borne long in the mouth the heat of the water is so great that a fowl has been boiled in it in nine minutes this quick coction may be owing to the quantity of naptha in the water not far distant are several small pits dug in the earth in which there is salt of the utmost purity of color and brightness which dissolves in the mouth instantaneously giving a very pungent sensation even in cold weather the warmth of these wells produces near them the verdure and flowers of spring about half a mile westward of this hill are seven wells of naptha in which the wild swine delight to lie the tartars use it for their lamps and to grease the axletrees of their carts  the chief place for the black or darkgrey naptha is a small island in the caspian sea now uninhabited except at times when they fetch the naptha the persians load it in bulk in their wretched vessels so that sometimes the sea is covered with it for leagues together when the weather is thick and hazy the springs boil up the higher and the naptha often takes fire on the surface of the earth and runs in a flame into the sea in great quantities to an almost incredible distance it is a kind of oil that will encrust grow hard and look like pitch the people use it mixed with a small quantity of ashes to burn in lamps and boil their food but it leaves a disagreeable smell they keep it at a small distance from their houses in earthen vessels under ground to prevent accidents from its firing which it is very liable to do every family in its neighborhood is well supplied with it  they have also on the peninsula of apcheron a white naptha of a much thinner consistency but this is found only in small quantities the russians drink it both as a cordial and a medicine but it does not intoxicate it is taken internally for the stone for disorders in the breast and in venereal cases and sore heads to both the last of which the persians are very subject externally applied it is of great use in scorbutic pains cramps gout etc it penetrates into the blood instantaneously and for a short time creates great pain like spirits of wine it takes out greasy spots from silk and woollen but leaves a bad smell it has been carried as a great rarity into india and being prepared as a japan is the most beautiful and lasting of any that has yet been tried  in the neighborhood of baku on the caspian sea is a phenomenon of a very extraordinary nature in some manner peculiar to this country and therefore deserves a particular description it is called the everlasting fire and to it a sect of indians and persians called gebers or gaurs pay religious worship  it lies about  0 english miles northeast by east from the city of baku in the province of shirvan on dry rocky land here are several ancient temples built with stone supposed to have been all dedicated to fire most of them are arched vaults from  0 to    feet high among others there is a little temple in which the indians now worship near the altar about three feet high is a large hollow cane from the end of which issues a blue flame in color and gentleness nor unlike a lamp burning with spirits but seemingly more pure these indians affirm that this flame has continued ever since the flood and they believe it will last to the end of time that if it was resisted or suppressed in that place it would break out and rise in some other there are generally  0 or  0 of these poor devotees who come on a pilgrimage from their own country and subsist on wild selery and a kind of jerusalem artichokes which are very good food with other roots and herbs found a little to the northward  a little way from this temple is a low cliff of a rock in which there is a horizontal gap two feet from the ground near six feet long and about three feet broad out of which issues a constant flame of the color and nature i have described when the wind blows it rises sometimes eight feet high but much lower in still weather it is not observed that the flame makes any impression on the rock this also the indians worship  the earth round this place for more than two miles has this surprising property that by taking up two or three inches of the surface and applying a live coal to it the part which is so uncovered immediately takes fire almost before the coal touches the earth the flame makes the soil hot but does not consume it nor affect what is near it with any degree of heat any quantity of this earth carried to another place does not produce this effect eight horses were once consumed by this fire being under a roof where the surface of the ground was turned up and by some accident took flame  if a cane or tube even of paper be set about two inches in the ground confined and closed with earth below and the top of it touched with a live coal and blown upon a flame will immediately issue without burning either the cane or paper provided the edges be covered with clay and this method they use for light in their houses which have only the earth for their floor three or four of these lighted canes will boil water in a pot and thus they dress their victuals the flame may be extinguished in the same manner as that of spirits of wine the ground is dry and stony and the more stony any particular part is the stronger and clearer is the flame it smells sulphurous like naptha but not very offensive  here are also springs of hot water which strengthen the stomach by bathing in them and formerly caused the place to be frequented by a number of persians and other people of the first quality from the remotest parts for there are many stately remains of buildings an extensive buryingplace and a large mosque with a fine stone cupola  near great towns they improve their lands with streetdirt but at a greater distance they lay their fields into little level squares banking them round and then turning the water into them and flow them where the ground is light they plough it with two or three oxen or buffaloes but in ghilan and other stiff countries it is as much as eight or ten oxen can do to draw their ploughs which are very large  rice wheat and barley are almost the only kinds of grain growing in persia oats they have none and little or no rye their seasons are not the same in the north as in the south for when they are sowing in one part of the country they are reaping in another and in some places it is not more than three months between seedtime and harvest their land never lies fallow it is so meliorated and enriched by flowing and the heat of the sun afterward working on the mud that it is never out of heart and though we have not so warm a sun were we to flow some of our ground as they do i am persuaded it would be a vast improvement especially where dung and other manure is wanting  their kitchengardens are well stocked with most of the roots and herbs we have in europe they have no less than  0 several sorts of melons the common people make them their constant food in summer those that ripen in the latter part of the season are the best and largest some of them weigh eight or ten pounds and are as sweet as sugar at the tables of persons of quality they have them all the year round having a method of preserving them under ground and it is said some will eat eight or ten pounds of melon at a meal and not be sick the best melons grow in chorassan near tartary and are carried as far as ispahan for the kings use and as presents to friends cucumbers are another fruit much eaten by the common people one sort has scarce any seeds in it and is eaten without paring or dressing and not reckoned unwholesome  of grapes they have several kinds and very sweet and some so large that a single grape is a mouthful the celebrated wine of shirauz is made of a small black grape without stones it is very delicious and though at first taste rather unpleasant to a european yet those who have drank it for some time prefer it to every other they wrap up the bunches in linen bags and let them hang on the trees all the winter and gather them as wanted the dryness of the air preserves all kinds of fruit a long time cherries here are but indifferent but apples pears peaches quinces apricots nectarines and gage plumbs are all very good and in great plenty the pomegranate is good to a proverb the persians call it the fruit of paradise  dates are reckoned one of the most delicious fruits of this country they are no where so good as in persia the pulp which encloses the stone is a clammy substance as sweet as honey the tree which bears them is slender but tall and like other palms has no branches but on the top and the fruit grows in clusters of  0 or  0lb weight the tree does not bear till it is    years old and it is said will continue bearing  00 years when the fruit is ripe it is laid in heaps and melting will candy and preserve itself without sugar  if they knew any thing of gardening they would have most of the european fruits in greater perfection than in any part of europe but they understand neither grafting nor inoculating all their trees run up very high and are loaded with wood they have apricots of several kinds that come into season one after another and their nectarines and peaches weigh    or    ounces each they have an apricot red within called by them the egg of the sun these are dried and exported in vast quantities they are boiled in water which is thickened by the juice of the fruit and makes a perfect syrup without sugar  the pistachionuts are almost peculiar to persia and transported all the world over we have them commonly in london they have likewise nuts filberds almonds and olives but know not how to extract oil from or preserve the last they have also plantations of sugar and tobacco  among the gardentrees they have the cypress the palm and the mulberry of the last there are large plantations for silkworms which they never suffer to grow up to be great trees because the leaves are best when the shoots are young but the tree in as great esteem as any in persia is the senna the body of this tree is very large and generally  0 or  0 feet high strait as the mast of a ship having no branches but on the head the bark is of a bright gray and the wood serves them to make doors rafters and for other uses in building the tree which bears the gallnut is common in many parts of persia and there are trees which yield gummastic and frankincense that which produces the latter is very much like a pear tree there are trees also which produce manna of several sorts the leaves of the tamerisk mannatree drop liquid manna in summertime which the natives take to be the sweat of the tree congealed upon the leaf in the morning the ground under it is perfectly fat and greasy with it the cottontree is common all over persia and they have another little tree which yields a kind of silken down used for quilting and stuffing of pillows there is also a plant called hannah that bears an orangecoloured seed which they beat to powder and color their hands feet and faces with from an opinion that it keeps the skin smooth and preserves the complexion  the excessive heat in the southern parts of persia prevents any flowers growing but nothing can be more beautiful than the fields of hyrcania here are whole groves of orange trees jessamines and all the flowers we have in europe that part of the country which is called mazenderan is one continued parterre from september to april the whole country at this time is covered with flowers and this though it be their winterseason is also the best time for fruits in the other months the heat is so excessive and the air so unhealthful that the natives as i have observed retire to the mountains in media the fields produce tulips anemonies and ranunculas about ispahan and other towns jonquils grow wild but they have the greatest quantity of lillies and roses they export abundance of rose water in the spring they have a red flower that resembles a clove of a beautiful scarlet color every sprig bears thirty of these flowers which form a head as large as a tennis ball their roses are white yellow and red and others white on one side and yellow on the other but notwithstanding this variety their gardens are not to be compared to ours as flowers are so common they are little regarded we see them intermixed with fruit trees without any order no borders or knots of flowers all that is met with in their finest gardens is walks planted with trees fountains canals and pleasurehouses at proper distances nor do the persians take any more pleasure in walking in them than we do in the fields but sit down in some alcove regardless of that exquisite variety that every foreigner is enamoured with indeed were these things as common in europe and possessed by every cottager we probably should regard them as little as we do other things which we enjoy in common with the lowest of mankind  persia also affords great plenty of drugs as cassia senna antimony nux vomica gum ammoniac galbanum sal ammoniac and a kind of rhubarb the persian poppies are in great esteem from the quantity of juice they yield and the strength of it they grow four feet high in some places and have white leaves the juice is extracted from them in june when they are ripe by making little incisions in the head of the poppy a thick liquor oozes from them which is gathered in the morning before sunrise it is said to have such an effect on those who collect it that they look as if they had been buried and taken up again and their limbs tremble as if they had the palsy the liquor thus drawn from them in a little time grows thick and is made up into pills which we call opium the persian bakers strew poppyseed upon their bread which inclines those who eat it to sleep and eating it is not reckoned unwholesome after their meals the common people eat the seed almost at any time saffron grows plentifully in persia and assafoetida which to us is the most offensive of all smells is to them a most refreshing perfume and is to be found almost every where  assafoetida is a liquor which distills from the plant called hiltot it thickens after it is drawn and grows as hard as gum mummy which is human flesh embalmed that has lain in dry earth several ages and become hard as horn is frequently found in the sands of chorassan on the ancient bactria and some of the bodies are so little altered it is said that the features may be plainly distinguished  the bezoar stone of persia is held to be much better than the indian bezoar this is a stone with several thin coats over it found in the entrails of goats and other animals  persia is not without its minerals it is conjectured that among their vast mountains there may be some mines of gold and silver but none are open nor have they an account that any were ever wrought except their leadmines which yield a small quantity of silver as all leadmines do but not enough to pay for extracting they have however good mines of iron steel copper and lead the iron and steelmines are in hycania media and the provinces of eack and chorasian their steel is so full of sulphur that if the filings are thrown into the fire they will give a report like gunpowder it has a fine delicate grain but is as brittle as glass and the persian artificers not understanding how to temper it cannot convert it to any nice work  sulphur and saltpeter are dug in the mountain damaveid which divides hyrcania from erack antimony is found in carmenia and emery is had near niris vitriol and mercury they have none and their tin is imported from abroad they have two kinds of salt one on the surface of the ground and the other dug off the rocks there are plains ten or twelve leagues over quite covered with salt as others are with sulphur and alium the salt is so hard in some parts of carmenia that the poor people use it instead of stone to build their cottages with  their marble is either black white or red and some veined with white and red it is dug near hamadan and lusiana some of it will divide into large flakes like slate but the best comes from tauris and is almost as transparent as crystal this kind is white mixed with green in the country about tauris also is found the mineral azure in fars and shirvan is found abundance of bole ammoniac and a marl which the country people use instead of soap there are some mines of tale or isinglass in the same country  the most valuable mines in persia are those where the tuquois stones are found there is one at nisapour in chorassan and another in a mountain between erack and hyrcania all that are dug are preserved for the king and when he has taken those he likes best he orders the rest to be sold  in the gulf of persia there was formerly the finest pearlfishery in the world chardin says it did not produce less than the value of  0000 l english per annum and that he saw a pearl taken out of it that weighed fifty grains and was perfectly sound but the large that were usually met with in that sea did not weigh above ten or twelve grains all above that weight the fishermen were obliged to lay by for the king whether the pearlbanks are now exhausted or the people are become inactive cannot be said but the pearlfishery is now in disuse  there are two seasons for this fishing the first in march or april and the other in august or september at this time no the oysterbanks were to be seen  000 or  000 fishing boats in every one of which was a diver these boats being anchored in five fathom water the diver strips himself naked and having fixed a piece of horn like a pair of spectacles on his nose to prevent the water getting in that way and tied a stone to one of his feet that he may sink to the bottom he takes a net or a basket with him and descends to the bottom a rope being fastened under his arms and another to the basket when at the bottom having slipped off the cord which fastened the stone to his foot he gathers the oysters or nacres puts them in his basket and having remained under water as long as he can gives a signal to the people in the boat to draw him up and afterward they pull up the basket in the mean time the diver refreshes himself with a pipe and tobacco and dives as before thus working from eight in the morning till eleven and after dinner from twelve till three in the afternoon it is said these diverse will continue under water near half a quarter of an hour at a time toward evening they carry their oysters on shore where they lay them in heaps and when they begin to dry the oysters open of themselves and the fishers diligently search for the pearls  chap ii of their animals there being very little cover in the middle or southern part of persia there are not many wild beasts deer they have some and antelopes which are much of the same nature except that they are spotted and have finer limbs but in the woody parts as hyrcania and cardistan there are lions tigers leopards wild hogs jackalls etc jackalls are so very domestic that hanway says whenever he encamped they would run over his bed in the night and being very fond of leather he was afraid they would have run away with his accoutrements and they make such a barking and howling in the woods that there was no resting for them and when one begins to howl the whole pack does the same the country about hamadan abounds in elks which are as fleet as birds no horse can reach them the persians call them giran and pretend there is musk near their tails  among their cattle we find camels horses mules asses oxen and buffaloes very serviceable but the camel for a beast of burden much excels all the rest whether we consider the weight he carries the dispatch he makes or the small expense of keeping him of these camels there are several kinds some have two bunches upon their backs and others but one and there is a third sort engendered between a dromedary which is a camel with two bunches and a female with one which are most esteemed and sell for  0 l or  0 l each for these seldom tire and will carry  00 or  000 lb those which travel between the persian gulf and ispahan are of a much less size and do not carry above  00 or  00 weight but notwithstanding this are almost as serviceable as the other being swifter of foot and will gallop like a horse whereas the other seldom go beyond a footpace these swift camels are kept by the king and great men to convey their women from place to place and carry their baggage they are usually adorned with embroidered cloths and silverbells about their necks a string of six or seven of them are tied together when they travel and governed by one man they use neither bridle or halter to hold them in or whips to drive them but are governed by the drivers voice who sings or plays to them as they travel it is in vain to beat them if they tire they never go the better for it when they are to take up their burden the driver touches their knees on which they lie down on their bellies till they are loaded groaning however and giving signs of uneasiness under a sense of the fatigue which they are about to undergo this animal is very illqualified to travel on the snow or wet ground they carry their legs so wide apart says hanway it often occasions their splitting themselves so that when they fall with great burdens they seldom rise again he met with several skeletons of camels so killed lying near the road the flesh of which had been devoured by wolves in traveling they let them graze on the roadside on weeds and thistles with their burdens on their backs and sometimes feed them with balls of barleymeal and chaff made into a paste with which they often mix the cottonseed considering the size of this animal it is the smallest feeder of any beast and it is a happy circumstance that they will live without water two or three days together for there is scarce any to be met with in those deserts the caravans are obliged to cross they shed their hair every spring and are perfectly naked of camels hair abundance of stuffs are made they are very tame and tractable except at rutting time which lasts  0 or  0 days and then they are more unruly which makes the drivers increase their loads to keep down their flesh when once a male has covered a female he grows sluggish and unwilling to leave her they copulate as other fourfooted animals do except that the female lies down on her belly as she does to receive her load they go eleven months with young  oxen buffaloes apes and mules are also used indifferently for carrying of passengers or burdens and their land being ploughed by buffaloes and oxen these beasts are seldom killed for food the asses of persia are much larger and swifter than ours and will perform a journey very well but the finest beasts are their horses these are beautiful creatures and no where better managed than in persia the breed of horses in fars is at present very indifferent owing to the ruinous state of the country but in the province of dushtistaan lying to the southwest it is remarkably good they have fine foreheads and are well proportioned light and sprightly but only used for the saddle they are never gelt and wear their tails at full length though they are lovely creatures to look on they are neither so swift as the arabian horses nor so hardy as the tartars and the king has always a stable of the arabian breed horses are very dear in persia some of them being sold for two or three hundred pounds and seldom for less than fifty pounds each it is not so much their scarcity that occasions this price as the numbers that are sold to india and turkey they have mules also that carry very well and are sold at  0 and  0 pounds apiece and asses that are taught to pace are valued at nearly as much  the common feed for horses is barley and chopped straw they have no mangers in their stables but give their horses corn in bags as our hackneycoachmen do in the spring they cut green grass for their horses but never make any into hay sometimes they feed their horses with barleymeal balls as in india instead of litter their own dung is dried and beaten to powder and laid a foot deep for them to lie on and if any of it be wetted it is dried in the sun the next day their horses hoofs are much sounder and harder than ours and they are shod as are their oxen with thin light places  they daub their horses legs in winter with the yellow herb hannah and sometimes anoint their bodies with it as high as the breast to keep out the cold as they say but it appears to be rather done by way of ornament for in some places they do it all the year round  the king has large stables of horses dispersed throughout the kingdom almost in every city for the public service a horse is seldom refused to any man that asks for one if he can and will keep it but then such persons are accountable to government for them when they shall be called out but till then they may ride them these troopers horses are sometimes quartered upon people against their consent and if any horse dies in their hands oath must be made that it did not die for want of food or care  of sheep and goats there are great plenty the natives seldom eat any other meat the sheep at shirauz are of a superior flavor owing to the excellence of the pasturage in that neighborhood and are remarkable for the fineness of their fleece they have broad flat tails as in tartary and some other places so large that mr franklin says he has seen some that weighed more than  0 pounds but those which are sold in the markets dont weigh above six or seven pounds  such a sheep is represented in the kalmuck smoking party p  0  vol ii they are remarkable also in some parts of persia for having more horns than ours i have seen some says chardin with six or seven horns some standing strait out of their foreheads so that when their rams engage there is usually a great deal of blood spilt in the battle persian goats are good eating and their wool or hair is so fine that great quantities of it are exported hogs there are scarce any for as the mahomedans who are the governing part of the nation abhor this animal the christians do not endeavor to increase the breed unless about georgia and armenia where the christians are very numerous  insects they are not much troubled with in the heart of persia which is very dry unless it be with swarms of locusts which sometimes visit them these fly in such numbers as to look like a cloud and darken the sky and wherever they alight destroy the fruits of the earth but providence has so ordained it that there are certain birds which generally visit the country about the same time eat up the locusts and so prevent the ruin of the husbandmen  there are almost all the same sorts of tame and wild fowl in persia as in europe turkeys have been imported into ispahan but do not thrive there pigeons they take the utmost care to increase on account of their dung with which they raise their melons their dovecots are five times as large ours of around form and handsomely built of brick and of these it is said there are not less than  000 in the city of ispahan alone this dung is usually sold for   d the bisty or    pounds weight and government has laid a small tax upon it  as to eagles hawks falcons and other birds of prey there is no country where they have more or where they are better instructed to take the prey than in persia the king has  00 or  000 of them and there is no man of any figure without his hawks and his falconer  as there are so few rivers riverfish is very scarce and seldom eaten but the caspian sea and the persian gulf furnish them with plenty of seafish of almost every kind  chap iii of their cities i proceed now to describe some of their principal cities and as ispahan is the capital we will begin with that  ispahan or as it is pronounced spahawn lies in    degrees  0 minutes north latitude and  0 degrees east longitude from london it is situated in the province of erack which was the ancient parthia and now reckoned the principal province of the empire being of very large extent and almost in the center of the persian dominions it stands in a fine plain almost surrounded with mountains which lie about two or three leagues from it and the form is pretty oval the river senderhout runs by it at about a mile distance but there are several channels and pipes above the town which convey the water from it into canals and basins for the use of the city the town is without walls and about ten or twelve miles in circuit some travelers have said it is ten leagues round but they must take in julpha a town on the other side of the river about a mile from ispahan and about two miles square the streets are wider than those of ispahan with trees planted in them and gardens round the houses so that it resembles a country village it is inhabited by a colony of armenians though there are some georgians and several other christian inhabitants and also some convents of europeans but no mahomedans but to return to ispahan  there were formerly twelve gates to the city but four of them are now shut up the streets are generally narrowand crooked and either exceedingly dirty or dusty not being paved though there are no coaches or carts yet all the people of any distinction riding through them with great trains of servants renders them very unpleasant there are however some very fine squares in the town particularly the meydan or royal square into which opens two of the palace gates on the sides of this square which is onethird of a mile in length and more than half as much broad are buildings much like the new exchange in the strand london a covered way with shops on both sides where every particular trade has a quarter assigned and there is a second story where mechanics have their working shops there seems to be little difference between these exchanges and ours except that those of ispahan have no windows but great openings at proper distances to let in the light and people ride through them as along the streets in the middle of the square there is a market for horses and cattle and all manner of goods and eatables are exposed to sale on that side of the square next the palace there is a fine row of trees and a handsome basin of water and some great brass guns taken from the portuguese at ormus serve to make a show at the south end of the square is a great mosque and another on the east side over against the great gate of the palace several streets are covered and arched over which makes them pretty dark and this seems to be peculiar to the persian towns as is that their houses are at some distance from their shops it is a common thing for a tradesman to go half a mile in the morning to the bazar or marketplace where his shop is and at night he locks up his valuable goods in chests and counters and the rest are left packed up in the open square and seldom is any thing lost so careful are the watch appointed to guard the marketplace and so very little are the people in this part of the world given to thieving indeed the speedy and exemplary punishments inflicted upon pilferers is one great means to deter them from it  foreign merchants lodge their goods in the public caravanseras of which there are not less than   00 in the city of ispahan these are large buildings erected from time to time by charitable people for the use of strangers which serve them also instead of inns for lodging and diet but there is this difference between an inn and a caravansera that in the last every one finds his own bedding and cookery whereas in the first we have not that trouble there are two things however that render a caravansera preferable to an inn one is that a person is not subject to extortion but buys his provision at the best hand and the other that let the merchant take up ever so many rooms he is not disturbed in them and pays but a trifle for warehouse and lodging and on the road he pays nothing most of them are built on the same plan and differ only in dimensions there is a handsome portal at the entrance of each caravansera on the sides of which are shops from whence you enter into a quadrangle round which there is a cloister or piazza and within are lodgingrooms and warehouses for goods there is also stabling and conveniences for horses and other beasts on the outside or they may be brought into the quadrangle and there tied which is common on the roads where there is no danger of robbers in short both in the cities and on the road these caravanseras are empty unfurnished inns which travelers may make use of at their pleasure some have basins of water in the center of he quadrangle  as the mahomedan religion prevents the use of wine there are no taverns in ispahan though some of the persians will drink pretty plentifully in private but there are handsome coffeehouses in the principal parts of the town where people meet and talk politics though they have no printed newspapers in such places we meet with some amusement peculiar to the country as the harangues of their poets historians and priests who hold forth and get a crowd about them as dr byfield of comical memory did formerly in london in the coffeehouses about the exchange and temple and it seems they expect a small present from their audience for the entertainment  the palace with the gardens belonging to it takes up above a league in compass over the two gates which come up to the royal meydan or square is a gallery where the sophi or king used to sit and see martial exercises prformed on horseback no part of the palace where the court resides reaches this square but having entered the principal gate there is a hall or courtroom on the left hand where the vizier and other judges administer justice on certain days and on the right are rooms where offenders are allowed to take sanctuary from hence to the hall where the king usually gives audience is a handsome covered walk it is a long room beautifully painted and gilt and supported by  0 pillars divided into three parts one a step higher than the other on which the great officers stand according to their rank as to hereditary nobility there is no such thing in persia on the third ascent is the royal throne raised about a foot and a half from the floor and about eight feet square on which is spread a rich carpet here the king sits crosslegged upon solemn occasions having a brocaded cushion under him and another at his back this is the only part of the palace which foreigners can see of the rest and particularly the haram or womens apartments as none but eunuchs are permitted to enter them no exact description can be given but they are said to consist of separate pleasurehouses dispersed about the gardens much in the same form with those of persons of distinction which i shall describe and that their great beauty consists in fine walks fountains and cascades beyond the garden the sophi has a large park walled in where the ladies hunt and take their pleasure with the prince  i will endeavor to enliven this detail with some descriptions of the royal harams in ispahan a thousand fanciful things have been related and merely on the strength of imagination respecting these places which travelers have never been admitted to see some particulars however have been learned from the eunuchs and women who frequent those apartments and furnish the ladies with toys from these we understand that the womens quarter of the palace is the most magnificent and best furnished of the whole the prince spending the best part of his time here it is said also that the economy of this inward palace is much the same with the outer and that the women have their several posts and employments here as the men have in the other that there are stewards secretaries treasurers guards etc all of the fair sex whose cabals frequently embarrass and frustrate the bestlaid designs of the ministers without  in the haram there are three ranks of women first princesses which are born there whom they call begum as they do the princesses of the blood royal in the court of the mogul second those by whom the king has any children or who are his mistresses these have the title of canum corresponding to that of chan or khan among the men and third those whom the king has never taken to his embraces and many of whom he scarcely knows these are called katun or ladies only all the rest have the appellation of slaves and are employed in servile offices  in the royal haram are several distinct buildings which have no communication with each other when a king dies those ladies with whom he has conversed as wives are shut up in a quarter by themselves from whence they are not permitted to stir out as long as they live unless it be the mother of the succeeding prince who has generally great influence in affairs and almost a sovereign authority within the limits of the haram  when a son or brother of the kings is marriageable he generally gives him the choice of a mistress among the ladies of the haram and sometimes of two or more according to the love he bears him he gives him also such a number of domestics as are suitable to his rank consisting of female slaves and eunuchs and an apartment in the palace where he remains confined the mothers of these princes and their servants generally retire with them to keep them company for these princes are never after to have any conversation with the rest of the haram without the kings leave if they are ever known to have an intrigue with any other ladies than those they have made choice of it is fatal to both parties a single glance only is as much as their lives are worth and what is still worse they are excluded from the conversation of all men except the eunuchs who are placed about them so that should they succeed to the crown they are as ignorant of all worldly affairs as if they had just dropped from the clouds as to the young princesses their mothers generally use their interest with the king to get them married as soon as they are of a proper age  there are a great variety of beauties confined in the king of persias haram for the chans and governors are continually sending up a fresh supply of young virgins from all parts of his dominions if they hear of a beautiful girl in any family they immediately demand her and her parents are not much averse to parting with her but are rather proud they have an opportunity of obliging their prince especially as it may be a means of raising the whole family for whenever a young person enters the haram a pension is settled on her nearest relation if she becomes a confidant or mistress to the king the pension is increased and if he has children by her she seldom fails to procure the advancement of all her relations in the haram are the daughters of some of the governors of provinces and the greatest lords of the court but there are many more georgians and circassian women of meaner birth these being said to excel the rest of the world in beauty and some of these generally captivate the young monarchs heart  what is reported of the unnatural and cruel practices in the haram is very shocking so long as the king is without children every one of his mistresses is desirous of having one in hopes that their issue will succeed to the crown in which their happiness very much depends but when they find the king has several children they do all they can to prevent having them or to procure abortion for except the first happy woman that has a child the rest after they have any are confined to an apartment where they live in perpetual apprehension of having their children murdered or at least deprived of sight upon barbarous maxims of state that there may be no competitors for the crown as a blindman is not permitted to reign this cruelty seldom fails to be executed sooner or later either in the reign of the present king or that of his successor  hence it is that the ladies of the haram dread nothing so much as having children their principal aim is to be married to some great man which they sometimes accomplish by insinuating themselves into the good graces of the kings mother the mother of his eldest son or the king himself the kings mother holds a constant correspondence with the ministers of state who frequently desire her to bestow on them one of the ladies of the haram in hopes of advancing their interest at court and happy is she who is thus given to a great man as she thereby becomes a wife according to the persian law is mistress of his house and is treated as the daughter of a king  the women of the haram when they grow too numerous are sometimes also married to clear the palace and lessen the expense but those who have been with child by the king are seldom if ever sent out of the haram which is one reason they are not very fond of his favors abbas ii who reigned in the middle of the last century it is said caused one of his beloved mistresses to be burnt alive because she slighted his embraces he sent her word it seems one evening that he designed to have her company that night to which she answered that she was not in a state fit to approach his majesty on account of a certain indisposition the king therefore deferred his visit but went to see her the next morning and finding that she had deceived him he slew into a passion and ordering a fire to be made caused her to be burnt in his presence  the guards of the haram are composed of three different bodies   the white eunuchs who guard the outer gate these never come within sight of the women lest it should incite in them an amorous inclination   the black eunuchs these are generally from the coast of malabar their station is in the second court and the oldest and most deformed of these are selected to attend the ladies and carry messages to and fro the rest are employed either in the gardens kitchens or other places remote from the womens apartments   the third and innermost guard it is said are composed of women commanded by some antiquated matron who receives orders from the prince himself and conveys his majestys commands by the eunuchs which attend to the guards without  the women of the haram are all lodged in separate chambers or at most two in one room in which case they put an old woman and a young one together  the ladies of one apartment are not suffered to visit those of another without leave this is to prevent quarrels among rival mistresses or as some say left they should fall in love with each other and be guilty of indecent familiarities which is not uncommon in the east where they are so strictly kept from the conversation of men the women who frequent the haram report surprising things of the passion these young women have for each other of the jealousies they entertain of their rivals and of the plots and conspiracies of one favorite mistress against another those who delight the king most with their singing their dancing or their wit are sure to become the envy of the rest and the king is not a little troubled sometimes with their contrivances to betray and supplant one another when he is provoked he will order one to be confined another to be beaten and a third perhaps from a favorite is turned among the common slaves nay he proceeds so far sometimes as to put them to death so that a seraglio or haram is far from being that earthly paradise some are apt to imagine  it is reported also that the greatest part of the royal infants are put to death as soon as born to prevent their being too numerous the kings mother has the direction of these matters and her orders are executed without the least horror or remorse she is as it were the governess of all her sons mistresses and favorites their fortune and that of their children seems to be entirely in her hands and it is not easy for them without her to preserve the kings affection long the king is never formally married to any of his mistresses but takes which of the ladies he pleases to his bed without any manner of ceremony those he is intimate with are but a small number the others indeed sing dance and play before him and contribute to his pleasures in another manner but from the distractions he meets with in a variety of consorts he frequently fixes upon some one who may properly enough be styled the queen of the haram amid such a number of rival beauties the prince is sensible he can have but the hearts of a very few and she whom he most admires perhaps has least affection to his person happy is the lady whom the king admires and can make him believe she has an equal passion for him  the ladies of the haram never visit out of the palace but receive the visits of their female relations and it is observed in general throughout persia that those of the greatest quality of that sex stir the least from home scarce ever going abroad but on some extraordinary occasion as to a wedding a lyingin or upon some festival but when they do go their visits usually last seven or eight hours they take with them their sheslaves and eunuchs and the husband usually sends a governante and eunuchs of his own to observe their conduct  as these ladies follow the king to his other palaces or to camp in time of war they travel always in the night a troop of horse usually marches a hundred paces before them and another troop in the rear crying out courouc courouc by which every man more than seven years of age understands he is to retire to a proper distance the eunuchs with their batons also on horseback march between the guards and the women and if any man is found in the way or within the limits prohibited he is put to death if they march through a city the men in the street through which they pass and those adjoining are all obliged to leave their houses and fly to some other part of the town as those of the villages are for a league together on the right and left of the road through which they are to march and a detachment of dragoons is usually sent half a day before to drive them away they fire a musket at little intervals to give notice of their approach and all men that hear it fly as fast as they can and it is said there are frequent examples of men being killed by the eunuchs who have not been wise enough or fortunate enough to get out of the way in time  in the city of ispahan are above   0 mahomedan mosques or temples covered with domes or cupolas which appearing through the trees that are planted almost all over the town in the streets or gardens afford an agreeable prospect but the common buildings are so low as scarce to be discernable by one who takes a view of the town from without  as no christian is admitted within their mosques it is not easy to meet with a particular description of them those who have seen the great mosque of ispahan in disguise tell us there is a gate leading to it covered with silver plates through this we proceed to a quadrangle with a piazza on each side where the priests lodge who belong to the mosque in the center is a large basin of water where the people wash themselves before they enter the temple in this spuare opposite the great gate are three large doors which open into it the whole building consists of five aisles beautified with gold and azure in the middle is the cupola supported by four great square pillars the aisles on the sides are lower than the middle one and borne up by thick columns of freestone two great windows toward the top of the middle aisle give light to the whole mosque on the left toward the middle stands a kind of pulpit with stonesteps to go up to it there are no seats or pews as in christian churches or any kind of imagery or pictures but the floor is carpeted and all persons put off their shoes on entering the walls within are lined    feet high with white polished marble the building without is stone but painted with varnishcolours and on the cupola is a tower where the priests go up to summon the people to their devotion for no bells are made use of  mr franklin who got admission in disguise into the chief mosque at shirauz and who is most to be relied on gives the following description of it and as these temples throughout the country are similar to each other one description will serve for all it is of a square form in the center is a stone reservoir of water made for performing the necessary ablutions or washings previous to prayer on the four sides of the building are arched apartments allotted for devotions some of the fronts of which are covered with china tiles others with a blue and white enamelled work within these recesses or apartments on the walls on each side are various sentences engraved from the koran in the nuskhi character and at the upper end of the square is a large dome with a cupola at top this is the place appropriated for the devotion of the vakeel or regent it is lined throughout with white marble ornamented with curious blue and gold artificial lapis lazuli and has three large silver lamps suspended from the center of the dome here mullahs or priests are constantly employed in reading the koran this mosque has very good detached apartments with places for ablutions and other religious ceremonies and at a little distance on the outside are a range of handsome buildings inhabited by mullahs dervises and other religious men  there are here a number of hummums or bagnios some of these are square buildings but most of them round built with white polished stone and covered with tiles painted blue the inside is divided into many recesses or chambers some for pleasure and others for sweating and the floors are laid with black and white marble the persians bathe almost every day considering it as healthy and an effectual remedy for colds and other disorders  but what is admired as much by foreigners as any thing about ispahan is the charbag this is a walk above  00 yards wide and a mile long reaching from the city to the river on each side are planted double rows of trees and in the middle runs a canal not continued on a level but at the distance of every furlong the water falls into a large basin forming a cascade the sides both of the canal and basins are lined with hewn stone broad enough for several men to walk abreast on each side of this walk are the royal gardens and those of great men with pleasurehouses at a small distance and the whole together forms as agreeable a place and prospect as can be conceived  at the end of this walk is a bridge over the river which leads to julpha there are also two other bridges one on the right and the other on the left by which the neighboring villages have a communication with the city the architecture of these bridges is uncommon this river is not navigable though in spring owing to the melting of the snows on the mountains it is almost as broad as the thames at london yet in summer the channel is exceedingly narrow and shallow scarce sufficient to supply the city with water now not being navigable the arches of the bridges are not very high and on each side both above and below are covered passages through which people ride from one end of the bridge to the other as in the covered streets of the city and at little distances there are openings to admit of light  sir john chardin tells us the east india company had a factory at ispahan but being so harrassed and oppressed in the civil wars the company ordered their servants to retire to bossora the territory of which is governed by its own prince but tributary to the grand signior this city stands on the tigris two days journey below bagdat owing to these wars out of  00000 magnificent houses in ispahan only  000 are now inhabited and among these are    colleges of royal foundations another reason of the houses going to ruin is that every generation chooses to build new houses to live in and of course never repair those of their ancestors  the houses of persons of quality are generally built in the middle of a fine garden and make little or no appearance in the streets we see nothing but a dead wall with a great gate in the middle and perhaps a screen or wall within the gate to prevent persons looking in so fond are they of privacy and retirement far from our method of building where we lay our countryseats as open as possible and seem to intimate that there is no enjoyment in the finest palaces but what results from the admiration of the crowd that passes by our gates their houses have but one floor laid out as follows in the front of the house stands the virando being a little piazza open before where they sit and transact their common affairs beyond this is a large hall the divan    or  0 feet high used at great entertainments or on any solemn occasions on the farther side of the house is another virando with a basin a fountain of water before it beyond which runs a walk of fine trees as there does also from the street to the house at each corner of the hall is a parlour or lodgingroom for it serves both purposes occasionally between these parlours on the sides there are doors out of the hall into an open square space as large as the rooms are at the corners there are also several doors out of the hall into the virando before and behind the house so that in hot weather they can set open nine or ten doors at once in the great hall to give air in some palaces there is a hasome basin and a fountain playing in the middle of the hall which contributes still more to its coolness the walls of their houses are built sometimes of burnt bricks but most commonly of bricks dried in the sun the walls are of considerable thickness and the roof of the great hall is arched and five or six feet higher than the other rooms about it the roofs of the buildings on every side of the hall are flat with a ballustrade round them and there is a pair of stairs up to the top where the family walks in the cool of the day and sometimes carry up a mattress and lie there all night the kitchens and other offices are at a distance on the right and left and all their rooms except the hall stand detached from each other having no passage from one to another except from the hall there are some few chimnies but in general instead of a chimney the rooms have a round hole about four or five feet diameter and a foot and a half deep in the middle of the room in which a charcoal fire is made and the place covered with a thick board or table about a foot high so close that no smoke can get out and over this table is thrown a large carpet under which they put their legs in cold weather and sit round there being a passage for the smoke by pipes under the floor  the doors of their houses are narrow and seldom turn upon hinges but there is a round piece left at the top and bottom of the door which are let into a frame above and below on which they turn and the very locks and bolts are frequently made of wood their furniture consists only of carpets spread on the floor with cushions and pillows to lean on and at night a mattress is brought to sleep on and a quilt or two to cover them but very seldom any sheets the persians lay in their undergarments servants lie about in any passage on mats and take up but little room the floors are either paved or made up of a hard cement on which they lay a coarse cloth and over that a carpet the sides of the rooms are lined about three feet high with fine tiles not unlike the dutch tiles and the rest of the wall painted or hung with pictures the houses of the inferior people are built on the same plan as much like those i have described as they can afford and the palaces of princes are only more lofty and more magnificent  in the city of casbin hanway says the aivan or hall has niches in the wall or recesses which answers the purpose of tables the floors are covered with large worsted carpets and round the sides are felts made with wool or camels hair very soft and thick about three feet wide and from seven to nine long placed there to sit on in this hall the family sits when they do not retire to the womens apartments where no man but the master of it is admitted the haram or womens apartment is generally for the sake of privacy entered by two turnings this city stands on very high land though a plain and surrounded by mountains and the houses in general of which only   00 are inhabited out of   000 the rest being in ruins or are sunk below the surface of the earth as are many of the gardens adjoining them for the convenience of being on a level with the water brought to casbin in channels from a considerable distance they are built with sundried bricks and cemented with strong lime the rest are flat and the family in summertime often sleep on the top of them these buildings are enclosed with a mudwall  there is a palace in this city built about  0 years ago which hanway thus describes the entrance is formed by an avenue of lofty trees near  00 yards long and    or  0 broad the wall round it is about a mile and a half english in circumference thick and lofty having one entrance an arched gate within the gate are four large squares with lofty trees fountains and running water which makes the place awful and majestic the apartments are raised about six feet from the ground the aivan or open hall is in the center and shut in with falling doors the apartments are ornamented in an indian taste and the cielings formed into small squares embellished with writings of moral sentences in very legible characters most of the windows are of thick colored glass made transparent and painted with such art and in such proper shades that the glass seems cut into the several figures it is designed to represent many of the floors are only of hard earth and others of a composition of beaten stone and all covered with carpeting  the haram of this palace is magnificent consisting of a square surrounded by brick walls about  0 feet high and two feet and a half thick within are four distinct apartments in some of which are fountains to give coolness and refresh the air the rooms are lined with stuccowork painted in the indian taste with birds and flowers of different magnitude the colors beautiful and set off with gilt edges the aparments have small chimneypieces in a mean taste and some are ornamented with lookingglasses in small squares of many different dimensions set into the walls there are also some few apartments below ground admirably contrived for coolness near the haram is the eunuchs apartment remarkable for having but one door and that a very strong one this new palace is built adjoining to the old one of which some few of the apartments are still standing and ornamented with some bad pieces of european figures by european painters the persians themselves are as ignorant of shades as the chinese the apartments where the shah or king kept his casbin treasury mr hanway was not permitted to see nor even the place where it stood but he was told it contained above  0000000 of crowns or four millions of our money and that part of it was in large ingots of gold run into cavities in the earth the better to secure it from plunder  casbin is enclosed within a wall above a mile in each square side with a great number of regular turrets and portholes for arrows it is renowned in history as being one of the chief cities of ancient parthia the residence of many of the persian kings and the burial place of ephestion the favorite of alexander the great here is a very noted caravansera with a large entrance and magnificent dome which cost   000 crowns  at ashreef on the caspian sea is another palace over the gate which forms the entrance are the arms of persia viz a lion with the sun rising behind it alluding to the strength and glory of the persian monarchy within this gate is a long avenue on each side of which are  0 apartments intended for a royal guard the next gate in front opens into a garden in the middle of which is a canal made with stone about three feet wide and one deep in which runs a stream of water which has four falls about an ell high  0 yards distant from each other each having a small basin and fountain these falls must have a fine effect for on the side near the stream holes are cut to fix candles at equal distances to the number of about  000 at the head of these is a large stone basin about six feet deep in the building near this basin is a sumptuous aivan or hall painted with gold flowers on a blue ground very well executed here are also several portraits seem to have been done by a hollander but no masterly hand on the sides of the aivan are several small apartments and behind it three other cascades falling down the side of a steep mountain covered with wood  the garden consists chiefly in walks bordered by very large pines orange and other fruit trees dispersed in beds with streams of water running between them hence says mr hanway i was carried into another garden much in the same taste in which stood the haram there was no person in it yet being the womens apartment it was considered as sacred and we were not permitted to enter it before it was a large basin of water and a square with marble benches at each corner a sycamore tree of a prodigious size in the center shaded the whole with its extended branches here were also cascades as before thence we were conducted to a banqueting house which was dedicated to a grandson of ali out of respect to this place we were desired to leave our swords at the door the solemnity with which we were conducted struck me with a kind of religious awe but this was soon changed into contempt for the rooms were adorned with paintings that could only please a voluptuous mahomedan all executed by a european hand but ill done the room had no furniture but a number of rich carpets at that time piled up in great heaps  we were shown a fourth house and garden in which was the spring that gave water to the greatest part of the whole in this was a stately dome whose top was indifferently well painted and the walls were covered with dutch tiles as high as the gallery at some distance from thi is a small building seemingly intended for an observatory the whole commands a view of a very fine country the caspian sea being about five miles distance and a distant prospect of the great mountain demoan on which the persians say the ark rested though the armenians ascribe this honor to mount ararat which is here also visible in clear weather the vicinity of the mountains on the back of this palace the numerous cascades and the music of the birds gave me many pleasing ideas but the unhappy situation of the people from the miseries of acivil war and the dispositions of a tyrant still returned to my thoughts blunted the edge of that i might otherwise have received  shirauz is the second city in magnitude in all persia it is the capital of the province of fars and lies in the latitude    degrees  0 minutes about  00 miles south of ispahan tradition says cyrus the great and founder of the persian empire was here buried and it was thence called shirauz it is situated in a valley of great extent and surprising fertility this valley is    miles long and    broad and is surrounded on all sides by mountains the city in circumference is one furseng and  0 measured paces each furseng four english miles it is well fortified considering the country a wall extends quite round the city    feet high and  0 thick with round towers at the distance of  0 paces from each other it has a most excellent ditch round it made but a few years past  0 feet deep and  0 broad this alone exclusive of the other works would enable the city to hold out a long time against any power in persia where artillery is but little known and less used  the city has six gates guarded by  00 men each and four officers who every morning and evening attend at the citadel to pay their compliments to the khan or king or in his absence to the beglerbeg or him next in rank it is the duty of these guards to prevent all persons leaving the city without a pass and if any person obnoxious to government escapes the officers head answers for it the gates are shut at sunset and opened at sunrise before which time no one can go out or come in  at the upper end of the city stands the citadel built of burnt brick a square of  0 yards circumference flanked with round towers and encompassed with a dry fosse of the same breadth and depth as that of the city here jaafer khan the king of the southern provinces resides it also serves occasionally as a state prison opposite to the citadel in a large handsome square is a gallery where the khans music consisting of trumpets kettledrums and other instruments plays regularly at sunrise and sunset when the khan is in camp or on a journey they are always placed in a tent near him one side of this square leads to the dewan khana a chamber of audience and the other leads up to the great mosque this chamber is a very handsome building situated at the upper end of a large garden to which you are conducted through an avenue planted on each side with a persian tree a species of the sycamore the room is of an oblong form with an open front the inside about one third up the wall lined with white marble from tauris and the cieling and other parts ornamented with a beautiful gold enamelled work in imitation of lapis lazuli there are several portraits in it tolerably well executed and good likenesses in front there are three handsome fountains with stone basins constantly playing  in the great square before the citadel is the tope khana or p of artillery this consists of several pieces of cannon mounted on bad carriages most of the guns which are spanish and portuguese excepting two english  0 pounders are so dreadfully honeycombed that they would certainly burst on the first discharge  the city has many good bazars and caravanseras the great market is a covered street about a quarter of a mile long built entirely of brick and roofed something in the style of the piazzas in covent garden lofty and well made on each side are shops in which a variety of goods are exposed to sale these shops are the property of the khan who rents them to the merchants at a very easy monthly rate there are different bazars in shirauz for different companies of artificers such as goldsmiths workers of tin dyers carpenters joiners hatters and shoemakers these consist of long covered streets built very regularly  the jews of shirauz have a quarter allotted to them for which they pay a large tax to government and are obliged to make considerable presents these people are more odious to the persians than those of any other faith and every opportunity is taken to oppress and extort money from them the very boys in the street being accustomed to beat and insult them of which treatment they dare not complain the indians have a caravansera allowed them in another quarter of the city for which they are also under contributions there is a mint at shirauz where money is coined in the name of jaafar khan the present possessor here the public serafs or money changers sit and regulate the exchange of gold and silver  by the words present possessor i would be understood to say that this nobleman now reigns as king of persia in shirauz though another competitor for the crown a eunuch has taken possession of the northern part of the kingdom for since the death of kerim khan in      an officer in nadir shahs service who after two years civil wars from the death of nadir seated himself on the throne and had reigned peaceably and unmolested for  0 years residing at shirauz under the title of vakeel or regent for he would never be called shah and who had took great pains to restore persia to its former splendour the country has been torn by civil wars arising from sundry claimants to the throne and as when mr franklin was at shirauz in      there were two reigning kings in persia and these were at war with each other there was but little hopes of the countrys recovering from the ruinous state it has long been in for some time to come to show the tyrannical disposition of the persian monarchs we need only give from mr franklins work a short detail of zikea khans conduct who usurped the throne on the death of kerim khan  when the death of kerim khan was announced in shirauz says mr franklin much confusion arose two and twenty of the principal officers of high rank and family with the eldest son of kerim took possession of the citadel determining to support that son as their sovereign against all other pretenders but zikea khan a relation of kerims by the mothers side possessed of immense wealth bribed great part of the army stormed the citadel and finding he could not take it by force had recourse to treachery to each of the principal officers in the citadel he sent a written paper by which he swore upon the koran that if they would come out and submit to him they should have his protection and their effects should be secured to them as they could not hold the place against him they relied on his promises and agreed to surrender in the mean time zikea gave private orders to seize them all had them brought before him separately as they came out from the citadel and these deluded men were all massacred in his presence he was seated the whole time feasting his eyes on the cruel spectacle the manner of their execution was very singular and characteristic of the sanguinary disposition of the tyrant five or six pehlwaums or wrestlers being stripped naked to the waist were armed with scymitars each of them successively singled out a victim and cut him to pieces their bodies were thrown into the square before the palace kerims sons life was spared but made a stateprisoner and the adherents of these officers were taken into zikeas pay another claimant to the crown starting up zikea marched against him and on his arrival at yezdekhast about six days journey north of shirauz he sent word to the inhabitants that he expected they would deliver up to him the sum of  000 tomans about  000 l english which had been carried from shirauz at the time of kerim khans death this money had been previously sent to the governor of ispahan appointed by the shah who resides at ispahan and who has possession of the northern parts of persia jaafar only possessing the southern provinces the inhabitants sending word back they had not the money and knew not what was become of it he ordered eighteen of the principal people of the place to be brought before him when they appeared he again demanded what was become of the money they still pleaded ignorance but in vain for the cruel tyrant ordered them to be thrown down the precipice which hangs over the so tress of yezdekhast the sentence was immediately executed and they were all crushed to atoms still unsatiated with blood and irritated by disappointment this monster gave orders for a seiud to be brought before him this was a man universally respected for his piety and exemplary life and whom the people supposed to be a descendant of their prophet mahomet on his arrival in zikeas presence he asked him as he had done before of the    principal inhabitants where the  000 tomans were concealed and charged him him with having embezzled a part of them in vain did the seud plead his ignorance and innocence zikea with a savage fury first ordered him to be ripped up and thrown over the precipice which was instantly executed and then commanded the wife and daughter of the unhappy man to be given up to the brutal lust of the soldiery but they fortunately were more merciful than their master and being struck with indignation at this cruel insult on a religious man who from his descent was deemed a sacred character even amongst the licentious were fired with impatience to get rid of such a sacrilegious monster after the above horrid scene zikea gave orders to have the fortress of yezdekhast razed to the ground and it was immediately begun but the measure of the tyrants iniquity was full he did not live to see his order completed seventy of the goolaums or bodyguard having entered into a resolution to destroy him waited the approach of night to put their design into execution accordingly about nine in the evening they in a body drew near the tyrants tent where they perceived him sitting with his pistols and drawn scymitar by his side for he was never unarmed the sight of the tyrant so daunted some of them that out of the  0 seven only had courage sufficient to approach him these seven without the smallest hesitation cut the ropes of his tent with their scymitars which falling in and entangling him the other men rushed in and his body was cut into a thousand pieces and scattered over the encampment by the enraged soldiery from the death of this man the country was again torn by civil wars and was in this state november       shirauz has many fine mosques the chief of which i have described and a square building of a very large size formerly a college of considerable note where the arts and sciences were taught but it is now decaying very fast and has only a few priests and religious men residing in it there are places here distinguished by the name of zoor khana the house of strength or exercise to which the persians resort for the sake of exercising themselves these houses consist of one room with the floor sunk about two feet below the surface of the earth and the light and air are admitted to the apartment by means of several small apertures perforated in the dome in the center is a large square terrace or platform of earth well beaten down smooth and even and on each side are small alcoves raised about two feet above the platform where the musicians and spectators are seated when all the competitors are assembled which is on every friday morning at daybreak they immediately strip themselves to the waist on which each man puts on a pair of thick woollen drawers and takes in his hands two wooden clubs about a foot and a half in length and cut in the shape of a pear these they rest on each shoulder and the music striking up they move them backward and forward with great agility stamping with their feet at the same time and straining every nerve till they produce a very profuse perspiration after continuing this exercise about half an hour the master of the house who is always one of them and is distinguished by the appellation of pehlwaun or wrestler makes a signal on which they all leave off quit their clubs and joining hands in a circle begin to move their feet very briskly in time with the music which is all the time playing a lively tune having continued this for a considerable time they commence wrestling but before this trial of skill begins the master of the house addresses the company in a set speech in which he tells the candidates that as they are all met in good fellowship so ought they to depart and that in the contest they are about entering into they should have no malice or ill will in their hearts it being only an honorable emulation and trial of strength in which they are going to exert themselves and not a contentious brawl he therefore cautions them to proceed in good humor and concord this speech is loudly applauded and the wrestling begins the master of the house is always the challenger and being accustomed to the exercise is generally the conqueror by throwing each of the company two or three times successively the spectators each pay a shahee equal to threepence english for which they are refreshed with a calean that is a pipe of tobacco and coffee this mode of exercise must contribute to health and add strength and manly appearance to the frame and bears some resemblance to the gymnastic exercises of the ancients  the end of
