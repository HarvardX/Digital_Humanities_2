the eulogies of howard a vision price   s  the eulogies of howard a vision    to tell of deeds above heroic milton london printed for g g j and j robinson mdccxci  the eulogies of howard it was my chance to be conversing with a friend of the benevolent and indefatigable howard when our country was first afflicted with the public intelligence of his death after our first expression of surprise and sorrow we naturally fell into serious and affectionate reflections on the gentle character and sublime pursuits of the deceased on these articles we had no difference of opinion but in the course of our conversation a point arose on which our sentiments were directly opposite though we were equally sincere and ardent in our regret and veneration for the departed worthy to whom it related i happened to speak of the public honors that i hoped a grateful a generous a magnificent nation would render to his memory my companion immediately exclaimed that every ostentatious memorial to commemorate the virtues of his friend would be inconsistent with the meekness and simplicity of the man that all who had the happiness of knowing howard must recollect with what genuine modesty he had ever retired from the enthusiastic admiration of those who had hoped to gratify his ambition by undeserved applause that he had really sought no reward but in the approbation of his conscience and his god that the british nation however eminent for genius and munificence could not devise any posthumous honors or raise any monument truly worthy of howard except in adopting and accomplishing those benevolent projects which his philanthropy and experience had recommended to public attention for the benefit of mankind  i readily admitted the singular and unquestionable modesty of the deceased  i allowed that the noblest tribute of respect which the world could render to so pure a spirit would be to realize his ideas but i contended that other honors are still due to his name that it is the duty and the interest of mankind to commemorate his character with the fondest veneration i reminded my companion that although we were sincerely convinced that no human mind engaged in great designs could be more truly modest than that of howard yet we had particular reason to recollect that he was not insensible to praise he had once imparted to us his feelings on that subject with a frank and tender simplicity highly graceful in an upright and magnanimous being conscious of no sentiment that he could wish to conceal indeed a sincere and ardent passion for virtue could hardly subsist with a disdain of true glory which is nothing more than the proper testimony of intelligent and honest admiration to the existence of merit nor is it reasonable to suppose that the fondest expressions of remembrance from a world which he has served and enlightened can be displeasing to the spirit of a just man made perfect since we are taught by religion that the gratitude of mankind is acceptable even to god i endeavored to convince my companion that as the public had seen in howard a person who reflected more genuine honor on our country than any of her philosophers her poets her orators her heroes or divines it is incumbent on the nation to consult her own glory by commemorating in the fullest manner his beneficent exertions and by establishing the dignity of his unrivaled virtue  my arguments and my zeal made some impression on the mind of my antagonist and sunk so deeply into my own that on my retiring to rest they gave rise to the following vision  i was suddenly transported to the confines of a region which astonished me by its loveliness and extent it was called the paradise of true glory as i approached the entrance my eyes were delightfully fascinated by two beings of human form who presided over the portal their names were genius and sensibility  it was their office to gratify with a view of this paradise every mortal that revered them sincerely and to reject only such intruders as presumed to treat either the one or the other with the insolence of disdain or the coldness of contempt an incident that i should have thought impossible from the transcendent beauty which is visible in each but to my surprise they informed me it very frequently happened  as i readily paid them the unsuspected homage of my soul i was graciously permitted to pass the gate  immediately as i entered i was saluted with a seraphic smile by two benignant and inseparable spirits these were gratitude and admiration the joint rulers of the dominion  you are welcome said the first in a tone of angelic tenderness  you are welcome to a scene utterly new to your senses and in harmony with your heart you delight in the praises of the deserving and you are now wafted to a spot where those who have merited highly of mankind are praised in proportion to their desert and where the praise of exalted merit is fondly listened to by an extensive human audience here purified by our supernatural agency from all the low and little jealousies of the earth  i had hardly answered this pleasing information by a grateful obeisance to my radiant informer when i perceived in a gorgeous prospect that now opened before us three structures of stupendous size and superior magnificence the first was situated in a grove of olives and appeared to me like an ancient temple of attica remarkable for massive strength and a sober dignity  the second was less solid but richer in decoration and seemed to be almost surrounded by every tree and plant on which nature has bestowed any salutary virtue the third was shaded only by palms the form of it was so wonderfully grand and aweful that it struck me as a sanctuary for every pure and devout spirit from all the nations of the globe  these structures that you survey with astonishment said one of my benevolent conductors are devoted to what you mortals denominate the three liberal professions law medicine and theology whoever has a claim to distinguished honor from any one of the three has a just encomium pronounced upon his services by the temporary president of that particular fabric in which he is entitled to such grateful remembrance alas i replied with a murmur that i could not suppress the man whose welldeserved praises i most anxiously expected to hear in this region belonged not to any one of these eminent classes in human life  he had no profession but that of humanity  be patient said the sweetest of my aetherial guides with a rebuke that was softened by a smile of indulgence let not your zeal for the honor of an individual however meritorious make you unjust or insensible to the merit of others assume the temper of this region where praise is distributed by equity and affection but where prejudice and partiality are not allowed to intrude  let us advance continued my monitor with an encouraging movement of her hand it is time that i should lead you to the nearest assembly  i obeyed with reverential silence and as i passed the vestibule of the majestic edifice my heart panted with an aweful expectation of beholding the shades of solon lycurgus and other departed legislators from the various nations of the world i was cheerfully surprised by a very different spectacle  the capacious structure was filled with a concourse of living mortals lively yet respectable in their appearance evidently belonging to many countries but all as i perceived by their habits connected with the law throughout all the multitude i heard no sound of dissension or debate but over all there reigned an air of intelligence and sympathy while all were hushed in silent expectance and eager attention with their eyes directed to an elevated tribunal  on this a personage was sitting whose majestic figure i immediately recollected his countenance is marked with that austerity and grandeur which are the external characteristicks of law herself his heart as those who know it intimately declare expresses the tender and beneficent influence of that power who is the acknowledged parent of security and comfort with a voice that pervaded the most distant recesses of the extensive dome and in tones that sunk deep into the bosom of every auditor he pronounced the following oration  after passing many years of life in the painful investigation of human offenses it is with peculiar satisfaction that i find myself commissioned to commemorate in this assembly a character of virtue without example  a character at once so meek and so sublime that if a feeling spirit had been poisoned with misanthropy from too close a contemplation of mortal crimes this character alone might serve as an antidote to the worst of mental distempers and awaken the most callous and sarcastic mind to confess the dignity of our nature and the beneficence of our god in stating to you the merits of howard i might expatiate with delight on the various qualities of this incomparable man i might trace his progress through the different periods of a life always singular and always instructive i could not be checked by any fear of overstepping the modesty of truth in the celebration of virtue so solid and so extensive that the malevolence of envy could not diminish its weight the fondness of enthusiam could not amplify its effects but i must not forget that there are professional limits to my discourse it is incumbent on me to confine myself to a single object and to dwell only on those public services that peculiarly endear the name of howard to the liberal and enlightened community in which i have the honor to preside  it was in the capacity of a minister to justice that the pure spirit whom it is my glory to praise first conceived the idea of those unrivaled labors that have rendered his memory a treasure to mankind in discharging a temporary office that exposed to him the condition of criminals he was led to meditate on the evils which had grievously contaminated the operations of justice he perceived that law herself like one of her most illustrious delegates i mean the immortal bacon was grossly injured by the secret and sordid enormities of her menial servants that captivity and coercion those necessary supporters of her power instead of producing good often gave birth to mischiefs more flagrant and more fatal than those which they were employed to correct he found even in the prisons of his own humane and enlightened country an accumulation of the most hideous abuses he found them not nurseries of penitence and amendment but schools of vice and impiety or dens of filth famine and disease not the seats of just and salutary correction and punishment but the strong holds of cruelty and extortion the irons of the prisoner which he only beheld entered into his soul and awakened unextinguishable energy in a spirit of which compassion and fortitude were the divine characteristicks in the noble emotions of pity for the oppressed and of zeal for the honor and interest of civilized society he conceived perhaps the sublimest design that ever occupied and exalted the mind of man the design to search and to purify the polluted stream of penal justice not only throughout his own country but through the various nations of the world how low how little are the grandest enterprises of heroic ambition when compared with this magnanimous pursuit how frivolous and vain are the highest aims of fancy and science when contrasted with a purpose so beneficently great but mavelous as the magnitude of howards enterprise appears on the slightest view that magnitude becomes doubly striking when we contemplate at the same time the many circumstances that might either allure or deter him from the prosecution of his idea consider him as a private gentleman possessed of ease and independence accustomed to employ and amuse his mind in retired study and philosophical speculation arrived at that period of life when the springs of activity and enterprise in the human frame have begun to lose their force consider that his health even in youth had appeared unequal to common fatigue his stature low his deportment humble his voice almost effeminate such was the wonderful being who relinquished the retirement the tranquillity the comforts that he loved and enjoyed to embark in labors at which the most hardy might tremble to plunge in perils from which the most resolute might recede without a diminution of honor under all these apparent disadvantages unsummoned unauthorized by any prince unexcited by any popular invitation he resolved to investigate all the abuses of imprisonment to visit the abodes of wretchedness and infection and to prove himself the friend of the friendless in every country that the limits of his advanced life would allow him to examine against such an enterprise projected by such an individual what forcible arguments might be urged not only by every selfish passion but even by that prudence and that reason which are allowed to regulate an elevated mind how plausibly did friendship exclaim to howard your projects are unquestionably noble but they are above the execution of any individual you are unarmed with authority you have the wish to do great good but the power of doing little consider the probable issue of the undertaking  you will see a few hapless wretches and tell their condition to the inattentive world perhaps perish yourself from contagion before you have time to tell it and leave your afflicted friends to lament your untimely fate and the ungrateful public to deride your temerity what force of intellect what dignity of soul were required to prevent a mortal from yielding to remonstrances so engaging the divine energy of genius and of virtue enabled howard to foresee that the sanctity of his pursuit would supply him with strength and powers far superior to all human authority  his piercing mind comprehended that there are enormities of such a nature that to survey and to reveal them is to effect their correction  he felt that his sincere compassion for the oppressed and his ardent desire to promote perfect justice would serve him as a perpetual antidote against the poison of fear  he felt that in the darkness of dungeons he should want no associates no guards to defend him against the outrages of detected extortion or suspicious brutality  he felt that as his purpose was heavenly the powers of heaven would be displayed in his support that iniquity and oppression would not dare to lift a hand against him though they knew it was the business of his life to annihilate their sway in their most secret dominion how admirably did the progress of his travels evince and justify the pure and enlightened confidence of his spirit all dangers all difficulties vanish before his gentleness his regularity his perseverance insolence and ferocity seem to turn at his approach into docility and respect every hardship he endures every step he advances in his wide and laborious career of beneficence instead of impairing his strength invigorates his frame instead of diminishing his influence increases the utility of his conduct by making the world acquainted with the sanctity of his character witness ye various regions of the earth with what surprise delight and veneration ye beheld an unarmed and unassuming traveller instructing you in the sublime science of mitigating human misery and giving you a matchless example of tenderness and magnanimity o england thou generous country ever enamoured of glory contemplate in this the most perfect of thy illustrious sons contemplate those virtues and that honor in which thy parental spirit may most happily exult  what spectacle can be more flattering to thy native thy honest pride than to behold the proudest potentates of distant nations listening with pleasure to a private englishman and learning from his researches how to relieve the most injured of their subjects how to abolish the enormities of perverted justice to form a complete account of the good arising to the world from the life and labors of howard would be a task beyond the limits of any human mind an exact statement of the benefits he has conferred upon society could be rendered only by the attendant spirit whom providence commissioned to watch over him and who might discern by the powers of supernatural vision what pregnant sources of public calamity he crushed in the seed and what future virtues in various individuals he may draw into the service of mankind by the attraction of his example of good more immediately visible which his exertions produced there is abundant evidence in his own country in the wide circle of his foreign excursion what nation what city does not bear some conspicuous traces of his intrepid and indefatigable beneficence of the astonishing length to which his zeal and perseverance extended we have the most ingenuous and satisfactory narration in those singularly meritorious volumes which he has given to the world in these we behold the minute detail of labors to which there is nothing similar or second in the history of public virtue and for which there could be no adequate reward but in the beatitude of heaven an eloquent enthusiast whose genius was nearly allied to frenzy has expressed a desire to present himself before the tribunal of the almighty judge with a volume in his hand in which he had recorded his own thoughts and actions if such an idea could be suitable to the littleness of man if it could become any mortal of faculties so limited to make such an offering to the great fountain of all intelligence that mortal must assuredly be howard for where could we find another individual not professedly inspired who might present to his maker a record of labors so eminently directed by piety and virtue a book addressed to mankind without insulting their weakness or flattering their passions a book whose great object was to benefit the world without seeking from it any kind of reward a book in which the genuine modesty of the writer is equal to his unexampled beneficence the mind of howard was singularly and sublimely free from the common and dangerous passion for applause that passion which though taken altogether it is certainly beneficial to the interests of mankind yet frequently communicates inquietude and unsteadiness to the pursuits of genius and virtue as human praise was never the object of his ambition so he has nobly soared above it there appear in different ages upon the earth certain elevated spirits who by the sublimity of their conceptions and the magnanimity of their conduct attain a degree of glory which can never be reached by the keenest followers of fame  they seek not panegyricks and panegyricks can add nothing to their honor the eulogies have perished which were devoted by the luxuriant genius of tully and by the laconic spirit of brutus to the public virtue of cato yet the name of that illustrious roman is still powerful in the world and excites in every cultivated mind an animating idea of independent integrity the name of howard has superior force and a happier effect it is a sound at which the strings of humanity will vibrate with exultation in many millions of hearts through the various nations that he visited the mere echo of his name will be sufficient to awaken that noblest sensibility which at once softens and elevates the soul every warmhearted and worthy individual who mentions howard will glow with an honest a generous satisfaction in feeling himself the fellow creature of such a man wherever the elegant arts are established they will contend in raising memorials to his honor indeed the globe itself may be considered as his mausoleum and the inhabitants of every prison it contains as groups of living statues that commemorate his virtue there is no class of mankind by whom his memory ought not to be cherished because all are interested in those evils so pernicious to society so dangerous to life which he was ever laboring to lessen or exterminate it might be wished that different communities should separately devise some different tribute of respect to him whose character and conduct is so interesting to all not for the sake of multiplying vain and useless offerings to the dead but to impress with more energy and extent his ennobling remembrance on the heart and soul of the living it is hardly possible to present too frequently to the human mind the image of a man who lived only to do good i mean not merely such a resemblance of his form as art may execute with materials almost as perishable as the image of human clay but such an impression of his soul as may have a more lasting influence on the life and conduct of his admirers such as diffusing among them a portion of his spirit may in some measure perpetuate his existence  by this community i am confident such public honors will be paid to howard as may be most suitable to the peculiar interest which it becomes us to take in his glory what these honors shall be is a point to be settled by this liberal and enlightened assembly which assuredly will not fail to remember that he suggested to legal authority her omissions and defects with the modest and endearing tenderness of a friend that he labored in the service of justice with that intelligence fortitude and zeal which her votaries cannot too warmly admire or too gratefully acknowledge  the president arose as he thus ended his speech and the members of the assembly seemed beginning to confer among themselves but what debates ensued or what measure was adopted i am unable to tell as my visionary guides immediately hurried me to the adjoining temple  this second structure though less extensive and less solid that the first was more attractive to the eye as it abounded with scientifical and diversified decorations the assembly consisted of men who appeared to me equally remarkable for keenness of intellect and elegance of manners the seat of pre eminence among them was filled by a person who possessed in a very uncommon degree these two valuable qualities so happily conducive to medical utility and medical distinction though left a young orphan without patrimony and obliged to struggle with early disadvantages he raised himself by meritorious exertion to the head of a profession in which opulence is generally the just attendant on knowledge and reputation but neither opulence nor his long intercourse with sickness and death have hardened the native tenderness of his heart and i had lately known him shed tears of regret on the untimely fate of an amiable patient whom his consummate skill and attention were unable to save  thus strongly prepossessed in his favor i was delighted to observe that he was preparing to address the assembly in the moment we entered my celestial guides smiled on each other in perceiving my satisfaction and being placed by them instantaneously in a commodious situation i heard the following discourse which the character i have described delivered with an ease and refined acuteness peculiar to himself never raising his voice above the pitch of polite and spirited conversation  i am persuaded that every individual to whom i have now the happiness of speaking will readily agree with me in this sentiment that we cannot possibly do ourselves more honor as a fraternity than by considering howard as an associate assuredly there is no class of men who may more justly presume to cherish his name and character with a fraternal affection in proportion as we are accustomed to contemplate to pity and to counteract the sufferings of nature the more are we enabled and inclined to estimate to love and to revere a being so compassionate and beneficent if physicians are what i once heard them called by a lively friend the soldiers of humanity engaged in a perpetual and too often alas unsuccessful conflict against the enemies of life howard is not only entitled to high rank in our corpse but he is the very caesar of this hard this perilous and let me add this most honorable warfare perhaps the ambition of the great roman commander insatiate and sanguinary as it was did not contribute more to the torment and destruction of the human race than the charity of the english philanthropist has contributed to its relief and preservation of this we are very certain the splendid and indefatigable hero of slaughter and vainglory did not traverse a more extensive field nor expose himself more courageously to personal danger than our meek and unostentatious hero of medical benevolence in point of true magnanimity i apprehend the spirit of caesar would very willingly confess that his own celebrated attempts to reduce gaul and britain were low and little achievements when compared to the unexampled efforts by which howard endeavored to exterminate or subdue those enemies more terrific the gaol fever and the plague  but leaving it to more able and eloquent panegyrists to celebrate the originality the boldness and all the various merit of his philanthropic exertions i shall confine myself to a few remarks and chiefly professional ones on his invaluable character it appears to me highly worthy of observation that howard before he entered on his grand projects of public benevolence was subject to those little but depressive variations of health which have betrayed many a valetudinarian into habits of inaction and inutility happily for himself and for mankind this excellent person surmounted a constitutional bias to indolence and retirement the consequence was he became a singular example of activity and vigor his powers and enjoyments of bodily and mental health augmented in proportion to the extensive utility of his pursuits  beneficial as his life has been to the world his memory may be still more so it may prove a perpetual blessing to mankind if it dissipates as it ought to do a weak and common prejudice which often operates as a palsy upon the first idea of a great and generous undertaking the prejudice i mean is a hasty persuasion frequently found in the most amiable minds that some peculiar strength of nerve some rare mechanism of frame and extraordinary assemblage of mental powers are absolutely requisite for the execution of any noble design how greatly does it redound to the true glory of howard to have given in his successful labors the fullest refutation of a prejudice so inimical to the interest and the honor of humannature a prejudice by whose influence to use the words of our great poet  the native hue of resolution is sicklied over with the pale cast of fear and enterprises of great pith and moment with this regard their currents turn awry and lose the name of action   the life and character of howard if they are justly considered may not only annihilate this pernicious prejudice but tend to establish an opposite and consolatory truth his example may show us that some degrees of bodily weakness and mental depression may be most happily cured by active exertion in the service of mankind perhaps there never existed a more striking proof how far a noble impulse communicated to the mind by a project of extensive benevolence may invigorate a frame not equal in health strength and stature to the common standard of men it is a prudential maxim of the celebrated raleigh that whosoever will live altogether out of himself and study other mens humors shall never be unfortunate a maxim which the example of howard might almost teach us to convert into a medical aphorism by saying whosoever will live altogether out of himself and consult other mens wants and calamities shall never be unhealthy it is delightful to those who detest the debasing tenets of a selfish philosophy to see the happy influence of opposite ideas to observe what physicians have frequent opportunities of observing that as a selfish turn of mind often attracts and increases the malignity of sickness so an unselfish a compassionate spirit has a natural tendency to escape or subdue it what can be more pleasing to those who assert and esteem the dignity of humannature than to see that the having lost all thoughts of self and having acted in direct opposition to selfish principles has promoted even the personal advantage of a generous individual from such a series of philanthropic labor and peril as a selfish and timid mind might esteem it frenzy to encounter howard derived not only his unrivalled and immortal reputation but the perfect restoration of enfeebled health not to mention those high gratifications of the heart and conscience which are superior to all the enjoyments both of health and glory with such temperance in diet that his daily food would appear to most people not sufficient to support the common functions of life he cheerfully sustained the hardships of long travel through regions where traveling is most difficult and dangerous with a figure voice and deportment that seemed to preclude him from all personal influence and authority and with no mental acquisitions except those which are common to every cultivated mind he secured to himself not only universal admiration but i may venture to say the just and moral idolatry of the world so invigorating are projects of extensive beneficence so powerful is the energy of public virtue  never indeed was the astonishing influence of plain and simple goodness more strikingly displayed than in the deference and respect which this private and meek individual received not only from foreign and imperious rulers of the earth but from hardened and atrocious wretches on whom justice herself could hardly make any mental impression though armed with all the splendor and all the violence of power two particular examples of the influence i am speaking of i shall mention here not only as honorable to the prime object of our regard but as they may suggest to contemplative minds some useful ideas by showing how far the mere weight of an upright and benevolent character alone may give to the most callous nerves a trembling sensibility and awaken the most ferocious spirit to selfcorrection  when our indefatigable visitor of prisons was in russia he beheld in public the punishment of the knoot severely administered by a strong and stern executioner  on the following day he waited on this man to request from him various information the executioner attended him obsequiously but this athletic savage though trained to acts of cruelty and conscious he had a legal sanction for the barbarous violence he had exerted could not behold without shuddering the meek and gentle missionary of compassion  the second and more memorable example of his singular influence occurred in a prison of his own country and relates to an outrageous female delinquent a corrupt and ferocious woman is perhaps the most intractable fiend that human benevolence can attempt to reform but even this difficulty the mild and and powerful character of howard accomplished  in one of our western gaols he found an unhappy female loaded with heavy irons on his appearance she entreated him to obtain for her the removal of these galling fetters upon enquiry he found that many endeavors had been made to keep this turbulent offender in proper subjection without the severity of chains but after repeated promises of amendment on milder treatment she had obliged the keeper to have recourse to this extreme by relapsing into the most flagrant and insufferable contempt of decency and order upon this information howard said mildly to the unhappy criminal i wish to relieve you but you put it out of my power for i should lose all the little credit i have if i exerted it for offenders so hardened and so turbulent i know replied the intractable delinquent i know that i have a proud and rebellious spirit but if i give a promise to so good a man as you are i can and i will command it on this firm assurance of reformation the benevolent howard became a kind of furety for her future peaceable conduct on the removal of her irons and he had the inexpressible delight to find on his next visit to the prisoners of this gaol that the outrageous and ungovernable culprit for whom he had ventured to answer was become the most orderly among them  i could wish for the moral interest of mankind that it were possible to obtain a minute account of the services rendered to the calamitous spirit of many a forsaken individual by the singular charity of howard what could be more instructive than to observe how his beneficence increased by its exertion and success while his desire of befriending the wretched became as it were the vital spirit that gave strength and duration to his own existence  if we contemplate with pleasure the singular reestablishment of bodily health which howard derived from his active philanthropy it may be still more pleasing to recollect that it also afforded him an efficacious medicine for an afflicted mind perhaps it was to show the full efficacy of this virtue in all its luster that heaven allotted to this excellent personage a domestic calamity which appears to borrow an expression from a great writer of an unconscionable size to human strength  that capricious and detestable spirit of detraction which on earth never fails to persecute superior virtue has not scrupled to assert that the affliction to which i allude was the mere consequence of paternal austerity the earth itself though frequently accused of being eager to receive ideas that may a base the eminent could hardly admit a calumny so groundless and irrational in this purer spot it is utterly needless to prove the innocence of an exalted being to whom we are only solicitous to pay that sincere tribute of praise and veneration which we are conscious he deserves in truth this admirable character seemed to illustrate the philosophical maxim that mildness is the proper companion of true magnanimity he had a gentleness of manners that was peculiar to himself and instead of possessing such imperious severity of spirit as might produce the calamity i allude to he was really endued with such native tenderness of heart as must have sunk under it had he not found in the unexampled services that he rendered to the world an antidote to the poison of domestic infelicity it is among the most gracious ordinances of providence that man is sure to find the most powerful relief for his own particular afflictions in his endeavors to alleviate the sufferings of others and permit me to add it is this beneficent law of our nature that gives a peculiar charm and dignity to the medical profession a profession singularly endeared to the affectionate howard not only as its compassionate and active spirit was the guide of his pursuits but as one of its prime ornaments was his favorite associate and his bosomfriend if different classes of men are to vie with each other as it may certainly become them to do in rendering various honors to this their matchless benefactor i hope we shall display with the most affectionate spirit the deep interest that we ought to take in his glory i think it very desirable that every physician should possess a medal of howard not only to show his veneration for the great philanthropist but to derive personal advantage from such a mental amulet if i may hazard the expression most of us in the exercise of medicine feel at particular moments that our spirits are too sensibly affected by the objects we survey that scenes of misery and infection depress and alarm at such a time how might it rekindle the energy of our minds to contemplate a little effigy of howard to recollect that all the trouble and danger that we encounter in the practice of a lucrative profession are trifling in the extreme when compared to the labor and the peril which this wonderful man most willingly took upon himself without looking forward to any reward but the approbation of heaven  i mention not a medal as a new idea  it has been already in contemplation and a motto for it suggested which applies with such singular force and propriety to the person whom it is designed to commemorate that perhaps the wide range of classical literature could not afford another passage so strikingly apposite to a character so extraordinary  stupuere patres tentamina tanta conatusque tuos pro te reus ipse timebat    i must confess however that i wish for another which may seem to bind him more closely to us in a medical point of view but it is time to leave the different members of our fraternity at full liberty to propose any marks of distinction that they wish to suggest  it is sufficient for me to have reminded you of a truth which i am confident we all equally feel that while we justly consider ourselves as students in the extensive school of humanity it becomes us to look up to howard with a laudable veneration as the prince and patron of our order  on the conclusion of this discourse my guides immediately conducted me with their former celerity and kindness to the only remaining structure it was the most extensive and from the hallowed majesty of its appearance the most admirable of the three in approaching it i paused a moment in aweful surprise at the solemnity of the fabric the most lovely and communicative of my two aetherial conductors smiled upon me and said you will find here ministers of god from every christian country but only those who consider evangelical charity as the essence of true religion and who are disposed to honor in the favorite object of your veneration the most signal example of that virtue which the present age has beheld i hope then i eagerly replied i shall have the delight of hearing on this occasion the most eloquent of our english bishops on this exclamation my kind informer regarded me with that lively and soothing air with which intelligent benevolence corrects mistaken simplicity and thus continued to instruct me with united vivacity and tenderness  earthly distinctions you know are of little moment in the sight of heaven you will hear no prelate and perhaps you may feel surprised and indignant when you observe how very few of your mitred countrymen are to be seen in this assembly but you will not retain in this hallowed spot that most common of human infirmities a tendency to censure or to suspicion you will recollect that this convocation contains only those charitable men who are peculiarly disposed to honor your recent model of this christian virtue other good men may exist who from motives of innocent mistake or of mere inadvertency may fail to exhibit that animated regard to his exemplary character which assuredly it has merited from all men and which the ministers of religion may most properly display  one of these continued my director you are now going to hear not indeed a dignitary of your church yet a divine of talents learning and charity he was led by a laudable warmth of heart to suggest to your country the first idea of paying a public tribute of veneration to the signal virtue of howard and has acquired from this circumstance a title to commemorate here the merit to which he was eager to render such early justice on earth but it is time for us to attend him  we immediately entered the temple and i beheld an ecclesiastic rising at that moment to address a very numerous assembly of his order that seemed to contain christians of every sect and ministers of every degree the person preparing to speak was distinguished by a majestic comeliness of person though he appeared to have passed the middle age of life and with a powerful elocution he delivered the following discourse  the righteous are bold as a lion proverbs chap xxviii ver   in these few words my brethren we have a passage of scripture that served as a favorite maxim or leading truth to the admirable personage whose glorious qualities it is now both my duty and my delight to recall to your remembrance the words indeed are so consonant to that exalted spirit which his life displayed that they almost appear to me an epitome of his character let us consider courage as one of his principal endowments to contemplate so pure and resolute a being in this point of view may lead us to form just ideas on the true nature of this primary virtue on the sacred source from whence it should proceed and the sublime end to which it should aspire how large a portion of folly vice and wickedness have arisen from mere mistakes concerning this most important of human qualities so important that the real dignity of man can only rise in proportion as this virtue is perfectly understood and properly cherished in the same proportion let me add our courageous philanthropist will be found entitled to the praise of every upright mind to the homage of every feeling heart  if we take the word courage in the most common and simple sense of that term as a generous and noble contempt of personal hardship and danger who has given more numerous or more striking examples of such brave contempt or if we follow the definition of courage given us by a profound an eloquent and philanthropic writer namely that it is a just estimate of our own powers who is there among the most signal benefactors of mankind not professedly inspired that ever formed an estimate of what he might atchieve in the most glorious field of enterprise at once so difficult and so true so humble and so grand  with every apparent disadvantage howard conceived it possible that his endeavors might correct the abuses and mitigate the sufferings of men in various nations of the world whence happened it that a mortal so visibly weak and gentle shrunk not from an idea so pregnant with difficulty and peril it was because the righteous are bold as a lion it was because he felt the strongest internal conviction of this animating truth that while heaven blesses a man with health sufficient to pursue a benevolent and magnanimous design the vigor of his mind and most probably his powers of doing good will be proportioned to the firmness of his faith and the sincerity of his virtue  many achievements of beneficent courage have undoubtedly been accomplished by men influenced by no motive but that generous love of glory which is so frequently the predominant passion of an active and ardent mind but the virtues that arise from this source are as unsteady and as precarious as the reward they pursue he who acts only as a candidate for the applause of mankind will find his spirit vary with all the variations in the everchanging atmosphere of popular opinion he will be subject to hot and cold fits of action and inactivity of confidence and distrust in proportion as the illusive vapor that he follows may either sparkle or fade before him hence proceeded much of that inconsistency and weakness which appear in some of the most enlightened and exalted characters of the pagan world  wanting a purer light from heaven the most radiant spirits of antiquity were bewildered one in particular the mildest and most undaunted of ancient worthies who had a sufficient portion of heroic philanthropy to prefer the benefit of mankind to every selfish consideration had yet his hours of diffidence and despondency on a final review of his own generous labors he is supposed to have questioned the very existence of virtue though he had made it the idol of his life a striking proof that the temperate and invariable energy of soul which alone perhaps deserves the name of true courage can only proceed from a fuller knowledge and love of god from the animating assurance that however we may prosper or fail in the earthly success of our endeavors to do good the merit of the attempt is registered in heaven and we secure to ourselves the everlasting approbation of our almighty parent in proportion as we approach toward that blessed model of perfect benevolence who has taught us by his divine example to compassionate and to relieve the sufferings of the wretched from this source flowed the courageous beneficence of howard and how delightful it is to observe that the force the extent the utility and the luster of the stream has gloriously corresponded to the height and purity of the fountain  the sensualist and the skeptic may indeed deride the conduct of a man who sacrificed all the common pleasures of life and sought for no recompense but in the favor of heaven it may be said that an illusive fervor of mind has hurried men in all periods of the world into singular and wild exertions which excite the wonder of the passing hour and are afterward either deservedly forgotten or only recalled to notice by reason and philosophy to caution the restless and impetuous spirit of man against all similar excesses  but the pursuits of howard though they had all that sublime energy which so often distinguished the projects of superstition were so far from being influenced by any superstitious propensity that perhaps they cannot appear to more advantage than by being brought into comparison or contrast not with the sluggish piety of sequestered monks but with the bold and splendid feats of the molt active and enterprising fanaticism allow me therefore to recall to your thoughts those distant ages when every ardent spirit in christendom was inflamed with a passionate desire to deliver the christian pilgrims of palestine from the oppression of infidels figure to yourselves the whole force of europe collecting its violence like a troubled sea and preparing to pour a terrific and destructive inundation over the holy land behold the strong and the weak the ambitious and the humble pursuing the same object behold assembled kings and their people soldiers and priests the servants of earth and heaven rushing with equal ardour to rescue the sepulcher of christ and to drown all the innumerable enemies of their faith in an universal deluge of blood in this scene we have the sublimest spectacle perhaps that was ever exhibited by mistaken piety and misguided valor the love of god by which this heroic multitude was professedly impelled was probably in many minds as sincere as it was ardent the religious spirit of their enterprise can still animate and transport us in the song of the poet and in the more rational page of history while we justly lament the errors of their devotion we admire the force and perseverance of their courage  to the sublime fortitude of these collected warriors let us compare the mild magnanimity of howard let us survey him setting forth for an expedition as perilous as theirs not as the soldier of fanaticism but as the pilgrim of humanity attachment to god and resolution which no hardship no danger no difficulty can daunt are equally conspicuous in the sanguinary fanatic and the compassionate philanthropist but how widely different are the prime earthly objects of their pursuits the fierce crusaders invaded asia with a desire to exterminate the infidels the benevolent howard was led into the same quarter of the globe and into perils more deadly than those of war by a wish to exterminate or rather to restrain the ravages of that terrific enemy to human life the plague  he had conceived an idea that as this most alarming of mortal maladies has been often strangely neglected by the sluggish and superstitious inhabitants of the east it might be possible by a calm and courageous examination of its nature and its progress to set limits to its rage and particularly to secure his own country from a future visitation of a calamity against which the fearless and eager spirit of commerce appears not to have established a sufficient precaution for the prospect of accomplishing public good so devoutly to be wished he nobly thought it a trifling sacrifice to hazard the little remnant of his advanced life and however men or nations may differ in policy or religion wherever there is a human spirit sufficiently pure and enlightened to estimate public virtue the sentiments and the conduct of howard must secure to his memory the fondest veneration there is a perfection and felicity in his character that appears supremely laudable in every point of view if abstracted from all religious considerations we regard him only as a citizen who devoted himself to the service of his country the brightest records of antiquity afford us no parallel to his merit had he lived in those early times the generous enthusiasm of the ancient world would have idolized his name philosophy and genius would have found in his benevolent labors the most ample theme for instruction and the purest subject for universal pahegyrick they would have celebrated him as a benefactor to mankind who had built a new portico to the temple of glory superior to the dome itself they would have preferred the beneficent philanthropist to the dazzling conqueror to the fascinating demagogue to the attractive sophist and all the various idols of public praise but as antiquity exhibits no character of such unclouded luster we have great reason to conclude that such a character could owe its existence only to the pure and sublime spirit of our christian faith let us therefore contemplate howard as a christian it is by considering him in this light that we shall feel ourselves most happily related to his virtues and most delightfully interested in the honors they receive  in the poor and calamitous objects of his regard in the gentleness and purity of his manners in his modest and magnanimous refusal of earthly honors in the wide extent and courageous perseverance of his charity we cannot fail to discern how richly he was endowed with the genuine spirit of that pure and sublime religion which has the divine prerogative of converting weakness into strength and of giving to humility the influence of power there is not a feature in the character there is hardly an action in the life of this exemplary personage that does not mark him as a true servant of christ and may we not presume the blessed author of our faith in supplying us in these dissolute times with a recent example of such astonishing and unlimited beneficence is graciously pleased to afford us a new motive to prize and to cherish that animating faith which could form in an age like the present a character so wonderfully entitled to the veneration of the world the spirit of christianity is so visible in the conduct of howard that the prime objects of his attention might be thought to have been suggested to him by the very words in which our blessed lord announces to the heirs of eternal glory the source of their beatitude  come ye blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world for i was an hungered and ye gave me meat i was thirsty and ye gave me drink i was a stranger and ye took me in naked and ye clothed me i was sick and ye visited me i was in prison and ye came unto me  is it possible for us my brethren to recall to our memory these holy words without feeling at the same time in the most forcible degree all the christian merits of howard can we fail to admire and to venerate the unexampled ardour purity and perseverance with which he exercised the peculiar virtue so distinguished by our lord  while we behold him sublimely preeminent in this christian perfection shall we not cherish the delightful idea that his heavenly rewards will be finally adequate to his unrivaled labors on earth shall not those who have loved him exult in the persuasion that in that great and aweful day when the living and the dead are to receive their everlasting doom when the princes and the great ones of the earth may be confronted with those whom they have persecuted and oppressed or whom they have failed to relieve when the proudest sons of learning genius or wit may shrink at the superior luster of those whom they have ridiculed and reviled howard will shine encircled by thousands who will gratefully plead for his beatitude in those blessed words of our redeemer i was in prison and he came unto me  yes my brethren the day will assuredly come when the servant so signally faithful will be called to a reward surpassing the utmost reach of our conception by the voice of his righteous master  then and then only will praise be fully proportioned to his transcendant merit when this consummate christian is raised to glory by the glorified messiah when his pure spirit exults in the commendation of his god  the imperfect efforts that mankind may make to do honor to such a being cannot indeed so much promote his glory as they may conduce to the interest of human nature subject as it has been to the wildest excesses human panegyric in all its shapes may be safely devoted to a personage whom it is hardly possible to praise with sincerity without feeling our disposition improved in a beneficent a sublime and truly religious character there is a sort of magnetic virtue which to those who are affectionately drawn toward it though only in idea communicates a portion of itself hence arises what we cannot too fondly cherish the delight and the utility of commemorating departed worth if its title to commemoration be justly proportioned to its magnitude its singularity and extent not only various individuals but different nations will become rivals in promoting the fame of howard as the glorious qualities which his life displayed are equally open to the emulation of the great and the humble every class of human creatures is peculiarly interested in his praise if to honor his memory may be thought to belong to any one community more than to another surely my brethren we shall not fail to assume to ourselves so pleasing a duty so honorable a distinction well indeed might the insulting enemies of our faith reproach us with a supine and disgraceful inattention to the real interest of virtue and the true glory of religion could we suffer any other order of men to surpass the ministers of christ in a meritorious zeal to honor this faithful servant of heaven whose life exhibits a lesson more instructive and sublime than all the eloquence of the pulpit a christian who has shown us in the most signal manner how practicable it is to follow in succouring the distressed not only the precepts but the example of our god  in the moment that this benevolent divine concluded his address to his attentive brethren my kind and vigilant guides removed me from the temple  i was now led into a scene entirely different from those we left it was an open and verdant plain with a few elevations in the ground that afforded advantageous views of the whole extensive spot here instead of beholding the ministers of peace i found myself encircled by the multitudinous votaries of war it appeared to me that all the military and all the naval servants of our country were collected together and each different division of these wellappointed and welllooking men that formed a pleasing spectacle alone was attended by a crowd of miscellaneous spectators more numerous than itself yet in all this immense multitude there was no sign of tumult or confusion they were ranged in such a manner as to form a wide circular area in the midst of them i was stationed on a little eminence within this area and in the same vacant space i beheld a party of veteran commanders both military and naval who seemed to have been conferring together but separated by the direction of my aetherial conductors to address in different parts of this extensive field the different companies assigned to their care what they respectively said in their separate departments i was unable to discover as i only heard distinctly one gallant veteran whose character was particularly dear to me this consummate officer has raised himself by merit alone from the humblest rank of military life to a station of the highest honor and trust his modesty is as singular as his fortune passing close to me with a gracious salutation he approached a very fine orderly corpse of foot who looked up to him with a sort of filial respect while he spoke to them the few following words  as bravery and compassion are the characteristics of good soldiers you cannot want my friends any long exhortation from me to honor the memory of howard the most resolute and the most compassionate man that has lived in our time though he was not of our profession as his life was devoted to mitigate the united horrors of captivity and sickness those worst of enemies to the spirit of a soldier you will undoubtedly feel that he has a peculiar claim to our most grateful and generous regard  this speech was followed by a burst of acclamation from those to whom it was particularly addressed similar shouts of applause resounded from different quarters of the spacious field while our aetherial attendants gratitude and admiration who followed each speaker at the close of each address to different divisions of this innumerable assembly displayed to each division in its turn an extensive sketch of a simple but magnificent mausoleum to the memory of howard in the form of an english lazaretto on the first display of this striking and worthy monument the applauding multitude seemed to exult in the prospect of its completion but i soon observed to my inexpressible concern that while gratitude and admiration were busy in exciting the various ranks of the vast assembly to accomplish this favorite design they were followed by two earthy fiends of a dark and malignant influence these were detraction and indifference who shed such a chill and depressive mist around them that all the ardour of the assembly seemed to sink among the miscellaneous crowds that were visible between the divisions of the martial host there ran a murmur of obloquy and derision against the pure object of public veneration he was reviled as a whimsical reformer and a rash enthusiast who had absurdly sacrificed his life in a vain and fantastic pursuit this base spirit of calumnious malignity was not communicated to any one division of the martial multitude but the universal zeal for the glory of howard seemed to be almost annihilated even gratitude and admiration appeared to grow faint in their darling purpose during their languor they suffered their sketch of the mausoleum to be gradually stolen from their hands and to drop upon the ground at this moment a sudden and violent earthquake was felt through all the extensive scene the center of the vacant area opened  it threw forth a phantom terrific and enormous  its magnitude seemed to grow upon the sight its lineaments were shrouded from our view by an immense mantle on which were represented a thousand different and hideous images of death its name was contagion  it rushed forward with an indescribable movement dismay and confusion overwhelmed all that quarter of the crowded scene that was particularly threatened by its first advance the affrighted multitude rolled back like a tumultuous sea the horrid spectre stopped and left a wide interval between itself and the retiring host a ray of heavenly light illumined the vacant space i fixed my eye on the brilliant spot and soon beheld the meek and gentle form of howard advancing without fear or arrogance toward the terrific phantom with an untrembling hand he seized the dark folds of its extensive mantle and seemed animated with the hope of annihilating the monster in the instant a burst of celestial splendour was spread over the gloomy plain the angel of retribution descended and snatching the consummate philanthropist to his bosom he rose again while all the astonished multitude now reviving from their terror gazed only on the celestial apparition and heard the reascending seraph thus address the beneficent spirit now committed to his care  thou faithful servant of heaven thy hour of recompense is come justly have thou cautioned mankind not to impute thy conduct to rashness or enthusiasm weak and wavering in their own pursuits of felicity thou will not wonder to see them so in their sense of thy merit and their zeal for thy honor but i am commissioned to bear thee to that allseeing power who can alone truly estimates and perfectly reward thy desert i know that the praise of beings inferior to thy god never influenced thy life but the homage of good minds is grateful to the purest inhabitants of heaven and in departing from a world so much indebted to thy virtue let it gratify thy perfect spirit to foresee that as long as the earth endures the most enlightened of her sons will remember and revere thee as one of her sublimest benefactors  as soon as the divine messenger had ceased to speak every voice in the reanimated multitude that heard him raised a shout of benediction on the name of howard i started in transport at the sound and the effort that i made to join the universal acclamation terminated my vision  pardon me thou gentlest and most indulgent of friends that conscious as i am of the sincerity with which thy pure mind ever wished to avoid all exuberance of praise i yet presume to send into the world such a tribute to thy virtues as thy humility might reject let the motives of the publication atone for all its defects  this little work is made public not from a vain expectation or desire in the writer to obtain any degree of literary distinction for if his wishes and endeavors are successful the world will not know from what hand it proceeds  thou most revered object of my regard who art loooking down perhaps with compassion on the petty labors of various mortals now trying to commemorate thy merit thou see that i am influenced by no arrogant conceit of having praised with peculiar felicity the perfections that i so ardently admire no i am perfectly sensible that the most worthy memorial of thy virtues will be found in those pure records of thy public services which thy own hand has given to the world with all the amiable and affecting simplicity that distinguished thy character and in the more comprehensive composition of some accomplished biographer who may have opportunities and ability to do justice to thy life  the chief aim of these few and hasty pages is to recall at this particular time to the liberal spirits of our countrymen that generous ardour with which they embraced the first idea of a public monument to howard while the expense and dignity of that monument are yet unsettled a writer may consider himself as a friend to national honor who endeavors to animate his country to the most extensive display of her munificence and her gratitude toward the purest public virtue may the justly remember that to testify a fond maternal pride in such a departed son to manifest and perpetuate esteem for such a character is in truth to promote the interest of genuine patriotism of sublime morality and of perfect religion  finis
