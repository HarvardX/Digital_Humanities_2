submission to despotic power france might excite more reasonable fear than all her armies in their first career for when in tyrannys cold grasp she lay and strove to smile her sense of wrongs away on her soft breast a specious fiend she nursed of all insinuating fiends the worst pleased to empoison nations with her breath and sow the viewless seeds of public death to deaden virtue to dispirit joy

behind her apathy whose halfglazd eyes never melt with love or sparkle with surprise whose touch more cold than terrors icy breath shoots through the withered heart petrific death with these her ministers to rome she fled and struck the nerve of roman vigor dead the towering eagle fell her palsied prey and dying freedom cursed her baleful sway awhile she sat with triumphs flag unfurled the laughing victress of the roman world in pomp circean there she joyd to shine her cave the palace emperors her swine but soon her nerveless slaves unfit for war sunk into dust before the sons of thor

the heavy vapors of thy varying skies breed in our saddend frames the mental strife where fancy sickens with disgust of life not all thy fogs however damp and dense can fix such languor on our loaded

vapors of the blighting east within themselves an antidote they bear against all the dark caprices of the air it is fervent gratitude and fond esteem for names still bright with public virtues beam it is generous pride of reason the result that makes a briton in his birth exult as the compatriot of minds whose worth has given such splendor to this speck of earth that while over other realms in

strike this murmuring detraction dumb say in each group your blended scenes unfold keen admiration can no names behold that claim in public love a nobler part or win more honor from the upright heart than you ye legal heroes of my song as dear to fancy as in reason strong who in despite of mental toil and pain that seem to threaten the oerburdend brain breathed the pure soul of manly eloquence simple in language liberal in sense and with intrepid virtues guardian care rescued the captives tangled in the snare of bloodhound spies whose prostituted mind toiled to create the guilt it could not
