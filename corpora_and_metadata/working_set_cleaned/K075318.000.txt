mind if ever amorous plaint your ear could please or love or pity on your bosom seize with favoring smiles a wellmeant song regard and oh forgive an unexperienced bard if faintly he describe the bliss or woe which only you who feel it truly know from that sad hour when your unhappy son struck through the life that forfeited his own what doubts what fears your anxious soul possessed and tore the soft asylum of your breast oh where for shelter shall the afflicted fly or where expect a sweeter sanctuary accused forlorn the muchloved youth behold deprived of freedom destitute of gold gold that from dungeons criminals can free and even in newgate offers liberty prophets of fate where ravenous vulturs plied cruel as death as death unsatisfied where felons murdrers traitors are secured and if not guiltless uncondemnd immured where thick built walls the imprisoned wretch deprive almost of vital air while yet alive a place which scarce the grave to which it leads in damps in darkness or in stench exceeds how did your kindness ease this lot severe your fondness tend him and your bounty cheer no glympse of joy your pleasures then conveyed nor midnight ball nor morning masquerade in vain to crowded drawing rooms you run the court a desert seems without your son if sportive youth with sparkling vigor come you see with secret pain their opening bloom why was my son thus to yourself you say as young and not so fortunate as they nor sight of age your passion can endure  and must my son then leave me immature still others joys you viewed and tasted none still others griefs were lighter than your own and still whatever you hear whatever you see is cause for plaint and food for misery your soft distress your tenderness of pain can never be described or felt by man your anna dear

i recall my numerous fears the pains he cost me in his infant years was it for this i bore him on my knees was all my foresight were my throes for this each pleasing hope that with his life began all dashed preserved the boy but lost the man strike me and spare my child oh let me save the life by friendship i by nature gave so birds by instinct taught supply with food and cheer with genial warmth

who can the tortures of your soul declare your noontide labors and your midnight prayer let meaner friends to view the prisoner go whose slighter love can bear that sight of woe a sight too shocking for a mothers eye which yet your utmost caution cannot fly still to your mind the darling youth appears and racks your bosom with tormenting fears present wherever you move the phantom seems and haunts with ghastly shapes your morning dreams the scene of justice to your sleeping eyes stands terribly displayed  and now he dies thick to your heart the vital currents run you start and waking cry  my son my son let none object you no concern revealed fire often glows fiercest that is most concealed great griefs are speechless petty sorrow speaks the heart which vents its anguish never breaks

breast contagious mercy crept and fops and statesmen wondered why they wept hearts hard before unwonted yearning know even jaylers melted at a mothers woe but see he lives whose death you late deplored and angry justice sheaths her awful sword unhopdfor joy the imperial mercy brings mercy the best prerogative of kings with triumph now you see the tempest over with raptures mighty as your grief before not so tyrconnel welcomed the relief inferior in his joy as in his grief stranger to motions of a mothers mind in manners different as in kindred joined since for your seed such kindness you express oh may each child give equal happiness with boundless gratitude your bosom burns your taste for pleasures and for court returns to minds transported every thing is gay and januarys self

vigor to your veins impart and dance tumultuous to your beating heart but oh beware and curb the overflowing tide for often the overfortunate have died whom grief in vain had labored to destroy surprised unequal to excess of joy and ah too far the unwieldy joy prevails for life itself may sink when reason fails since often so high your extacies have grown you seemed the ties of nature to disown lost for a while to memory you disclaim a child so dearly loved and mothers name what dangerous transport parent hearts may feel let ovid soft the ladys poet tell thus old agave mad denies her
