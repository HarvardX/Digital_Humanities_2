the great advantage of the use of the bark in mortifications  with several additions  by john rushworth surgeon  london printed for lawton gilliver at homers head against st dunstans church in fleet street       to the masters or governors of the mystery and commonalty of barbers and surgeons of london not doubting but you will be very ready to join in any thing that may be of use to mankind and i having practiced surgery many years and also been acquainted with the practice of many of the most eminent of our profession who honestly and successfully practiced it yet being of opinion that surgery might still be very much improved by publishing such cases as deserve it and thinking you the most proper persons to encourage it therefore am desirous and should be glad you would appoint some of your members to receive and fairly and favorably examine and consider such cases as shall be offered to them by long experienced practitioners and give your approbation of such as deserve to be made public this i conceive would very much contribute to the reputation of surgery and be of great advantage to patients and to show how sincere i am in what i propose i here offer to your serious consideration a case i formerly communicated to some physicians and surgeons and sir hans sloan desiring me i in the year      left the following account in his hands  in the year      i was sent for to a man who had a mortification on the foot from an internal cause the fever very high attended with the irregular pulse that is usual in the case i made deep incisions into the part mortified to the bone and scarified all round as far as there was any inflammation and used the common applications upon which the fever abated the pulse became not only calm but also regular and in a few days i had a digestion at the edges i was obliged to leave it to the care of an apothecary but in a short time i was sent for again the fever being returned and the part mortified higher i used the same method as before with the same success but all the former symptoms returned the third time but upon repeating the same method again ceased i thought it to no purpose to take off the leg having too often found returns after it the fault being in the blood and juices but providence now first directed me to order the bark in this case whilst there was a remission of the fever it answered beyond what i expected the fever no more returned the leg was taken off and i saw the person well and lusty many years afterward and i have since several times had the experience of the good effects of it in the like case which has been no small satisfaction to me  i think it as much my duty to make a public acknowledgement of an error of my judgment for very many years because others also of greater eminency giving the same judgment i do verily believe it has been the occasion of several unfortunate women not only to continue in a deplorable state but also often to have a miserable exit which by my too late practice attended with success i have now reason to believe might have been prevented if their breasts had been taken off in time this i think is worthy to be compassionately considered by all surgeons least the too long omission of it may some time become an uneasiness to them as it now is to me when i reflect of it i hope none can put that construction upon this as if i expected that in all degrees of cancers taking off the tumor would be effectual for some are of that malignancy even to so poisonous a nature which if blended with the blood and juices nothing will answer but i would not have any too much discouraged by the ill aspect of them for two i had success in appeared as ill and threatening as most i have seen and therefore i would not have taken them off if the patients had not earnestly desired it i think fit to intimate that the fewer medicines have been taken whilst the tumor remains on the better for any thing that causes the least fermentation of the humors does the more contaminate and spoil the blood and juices  if you should think fit to encourage any thing of this nature in the way i propose or any way you shall think more proper i have several observations to offer to you which i hope may be of use  from a brother that heartily wishes prosperity to your society and is  your very humble servtjohn rushworth northampton october         postscript it is to me a very melancholy consideration that in a nation so happy in its laws and government there should be so little care taken to prevent the great misfortunes that are very often brought upon the miserable subjects by suffering those to practice surgery the ancientest and certainest part of physic with impunity that are so very ill qualified for it though i hope as far as your power extends this mischief is in a great measure prevented but for the sake of the country people so numerous and necessary a part of our fellow subjects it is certainly the duty of all those that are sensible of it to use their best endeavors to get it put upon a better regulation  and if you can propose a method to do it if your charter gave you power sufficient you can never have a more favorable opportunity to obtain the enlargement of it for so good a use their present majestys having always shown a humane tenderness and compassion for all their subjects  and if any new law should be wanting to complete so necessary a work it is not to be doubted but that a parliament that has made so great improvements in the law for the preservation of the estates and rights of the subjects will also if it be properly laid before them take the same care for the preservation of the lives limbs etc of the people in which a particular provision may be made for the advantage of the poor of the parishes by erecting an infirmary in the center of every county to receive such poor as have occasion for the assistance of a good surgeon and for want of it in some cases become cripples and in others lie long in a languid and miserable condition to the great expense of the parishes  the following is a letter from the master of the surgeons company  sir when your printed letter directed to the governors of our company was read in february last before a court of assistants our clerk was then ordered to return you our thanks for the same and to desire you to send us such other curious cases as you were then pleased to promise and at the same time to second your intention for the advancement of surgery twas ordered to print four times a year the court of assistants order which you have or will read from time to time in several of the public papers to encourage every surgeon to follow your laudable example all these cases together with such as will be found in the seasurgeons journals being entered in a book will from time to time be perused by the court of examiners and printed at the companys expense as the gentlemen who send them shall approve i wish your other proposal in the printed letter for establishing an hospital or infirmary in the several counties could take effect but at present i cannot find out any parliament men that will undertake so beneficial an undertaking i am now to acknowledge yours of the   th instant and to acquaint you that from your example i have given the bark in all mortifications with such success as has encouraged the gentlemen you mention to administer it i have now under my care a gentleman of    who owes his life to that medicine his case was at first a gangreen after a phlegmon the usual means seemed to have removed the danger but the fever continuing without remission or intermission a sphacelus soon appeared which nothing did stop the progress of till the bark was used and in twenty four hours and less the separation began with a laudable pus the same thing happened to a jew whose sphacelus had got ground for three weeks in spite of all means where several surgeons were concerned some years ago and to another patient of mine i have now used it in seven cases the circumstances in each being different and yet in all the bark has taken effect even within these few days to mr delenor who kept the bagnio in st jamess street in whom a mortification happened after several punctures in dropsical legs the bark stopped the progress in less than twenty four hours and the sluffs began to separate but the patient having a jaundice and spent with evacuations it revived and came into the other leg of which though he died yet the power of the bark was so plain that from this and the other cases i think it evident that we may be as sure of getting the better of or at least of stopping a mortification from any internal cause by the bark as conquering an ague thereby  as to the cure of cancers by amputation there are but few surgeons here that flatter themselves of it of late we recommend them to the drinking about two quarts a day of the water at the dog and duck in st georges fields southwark which i can aver stops the progress of and likely will get the better of that noli me tangere i am with all esteem sir  your most obedient humble servant claud amyand gerardstreet london july          to claud amyand esquire sergeant surgeon to his majesty and master of the surgeons company sir i heartily thank you for the favor of yours for until now i had reason to believe that our company slighted my letter for your clerk never wrote any thing to me about it nor did i hear any thing of it before your kind letter informed me for no public papers that come into these parts that i ever saw mention any thing of the good method the company has taken but if at the same time care be not taken to get surgery not to be suffered to be practiced by any but those that are regularly brought up and sufficiently examined the country people will be the more imposed upon by quacks being made if possible more bold and impudent by putting into their hands what they are not capable of making a good use of and surgeons of value who have the misfortune to live in the country will be much injured by it which i should be very sorry any ways to contribute to this cannot appear so plainly to you as to those that live in the country but i doubt not but your goodness will have regard to it by seriously considering it in order to prevent so ill a consequence i hope i shall not tire your patience by giving you an account of a case of a patient of mine this spring who was far gone in a dropsy and asthma attended with very many ill symptoms which daily increased though he had a very good physician dr freeman who made use of all proper internal means but they not answering i was consulted his legs and thighs were grown to a very great bulk and did appear to me and also to the doctor as if they would soon mortify i told the doctor i had never found that punctures would be sufficient to relieve in so dangerous a case but i was of opinion that nothing but making many large incisions into the legs could be of use though i was unwilling to begin such a work but in a few days we plainly saw that he could not continue long if not soon relieved the doctor encouraging me i was resolved to venture my reputation rather than the patient should be lost though i knew the censorious age did not spare to reflect on surgeons when they used any new method without success but i can with pleasure tell you that the patient was soon relieved by it and by often using fomentations and as often changing the cataplasms i not only preserved the tone of the parts but also constantly discharged vast quantities of the watery humor for more than two months until it was all carried off from all parts of the body and the legs have recovered their true tone and are as small as they were before he was ill and do not so much as swell at night though he daily goes about his business performing it with cheerfulness and is better in every respect than he has been for many years  i am very glad to hear that you have had so many demonstrations of the good effect of the bark though certainly a great deal ought to be imputed to your good and proper directing of it i beg leave just to mention that leaving off the bark too soon a patient of mine had a return of the mortification in about five days time but scarifying and repeating it i presently had the good effect of it again and she is now perfectly recovered and though she had a very ill habit of body before is now better than she has been for several years and her looks show it to all that knew her before though she is fifty years of age  i rejoice to hear of any thing that gives relief in cancers but if the tumor be not perfectly reduced by it i fear no cure will continue unless the tumor be first removed but i shall wave this until i have the happiness to see you which i hope to do at the beginning of the next sessions of parliament for i am very desirous to gain the point of having infirmaries and though my interest be but small yet joined with yours and others that i hope we shall meet with i do not despair and i flatter my self that you will excuse the length of this from  honored sir your most obedient and very humble servant john rushworth northampton august         the following was inserted in the norhampton mercury december  0      whereas in a postscript to a letter to the surgeons company oct         mention is made of the erecting of an infirmary in the center of every county for the reception of such poor as shall have occasion for the assistance of a good surgeon and for want of it in some cases become cripples and in others lie long in a languid and miserable condition to the no small expense of the parishes this design the proposer thinks himself particularly obliged and by judgment and inclination is led to promote to the utmost of his power but knowing his own insufficiency upon several accounts to do any thing considerable toward it therefore does humbly offer it to the consideration of the gentlemen of england and hopes that those who think it may prove a good charity will afford their assistance for bring it to perfection the proposer forbears to offer any method for the regulating of it because he is in hopes that those that are better qualified will do it to a greater advantage and it will be more regarded if done by persons of character and not of so low a station of life in order to make this design the more public the following advertisement was put into the gazette nov  0      viz   john rushworth of northhampton surgeon having sent a proposal to the surgeons company of london for the improvement of surgery in the postscript to which he proposes the erecting an infirmary in the center of every county for the receiving such poor as shall want the assistance of a good surgeon but thinking that not sufficient to promote it he humbly offers it to the consideration of the gentlemen of england conceiving it would be a great and as extensive a charity as any that has been done since the reformation and hopes it may require no great expense more than the parishes are already obliged to do for their poor and doubts not but what is further wanting will be supplied by charitable disposed persons and shall be glad to have an opportunity to subscribe fifty pounds toward it in the country where he lives  therefore he hopes that the gentlemen of this county will excuse him in humbly desiring them that are for the promoting this charity to meet at the county sessions or at what proper time they shall think fit to appoint for the taking it into consideration and if they approve of it he doubts not but they may put it upon such a foundation as may be an example to other counties  though i am sensible i may be censured for this yet if the giving this hint does in the least contribute to the bringing to perfection what i do so much desire i shall value that more than any other consideration  instead of an encomium upon that great christian duty charity to enforce this i shall only mention the following words of our savior as wrote by st luke the beloved physician when thou make a feast call the poor the maimed the lame the blind and thou shall be blessed for they cannot recompense thee for thou shall be recompensed at the resurrection of the just and if an infirmary can be made capable to receive the incurables also it will be making a continual feast for those poor miserable people   for the satisfaction of those that gave themselves the trouble of reading rushworths printed letter to the surgeons company the following letter is inserted london july        sir about two months ago i was sent for to a gentleman about  0 years of age who had a mortification on the back of his foot from an internal cause upon sight of it i scarified it and dressed it up s a and his physicians ordered him the conf raleigh rad serpt there v etc of the established medicines next day mr sergeant dickins and mr chesselden were consulted and they confirmed what we had done and desired us to go on which we did to no manner of purpose for eight days for the mortification increased and the fever did not abate upon which we had another consulation in which we agreed that in all probability he would not hold out    hours longer then mr dickins proposed the bark not upon his own experience but upon your authority and mr sergeant amyand who had also made several successful experiments with it which was with some difficulty agreed to upon taking the bark the fever soon left him the mortification stopped the wound digested and the sloughs cast off to the great surprise of every one that ever saw or heard of it i think this new use of the bark for which we are more obliged to you than to him who first showed the use of it in intermitting fevers is of too much consequence not to be communicated to the fraternity therefore i beg the favor of you to fend me a farther account of the send me a farther account of the experience you have had of the use of the bark in mortifications than you gave in your printed letter to our company which mr sergeant amyand our present master was so kind as to show me and it shall be inserted in your own words and the favor gratefully acknowledged by sir  your most obedient humble servant jo douglas   as this gives me reason to desire the surgeons company farther to take my letter into consideration so i take this opportunity once again to desire the gentlemen of england to consider what i before proposed in an advertisement in the gazette nov  0      for erecting an infirmary in every county for i shall be very sorry if i must own excepting london in this kingdom there does not appear that generous regard to the health and life of man as in several foreign parts and if their charitable care of the poor sick and maimed be an effect of their religion i blush to think that we who call our selves the reformed should come so far short of them in this great christian duty and as the gentlemen of this county did not think fit to take any notice of what i proposed to them i shall be very ready to subscribe fifty pounds if an infirmary be erected in any neighboring county that the poor may not suffer for want of advice and medicines as the rich often do by having too much  it is necessary that i intimate to all surgeons what i have mentioned to our company in a letter the   th of this month that i would not be understood by my printed letter as if the bark would answer in mortifications from all internal causes for in some it is not proper as surgeons may easily suggest to themselves  and that the aspersion of the adage of tres duo may not be cast upon surgeons as it is upon the practicers of the other branch of physic i shall conclude with heartily wishing that we may endeavor to prove our selves christians by being kindly affectioned one toward another and also public spirited not seeking merely our own things but every one also the things of others i e the common good  having within these few days met with an account formerly given by an ingenious physician in his time of great cures in surgery done by mineral waters it has given me great satisfaction in hopes that the water at the dog and duck in southwark mentioned in the letter of our worthy master mr sergeant amyand may prove of great use in cancers among many rational thoughts how this is performed he takes notice that as the juice of delicious fruit plays upon the organs of taste so does the right healing waters upon the ulcers at first touch it seems to tear the flesh off deeper but immediately changes the beginning of deep pain into a deeper pleasure and after many assaults and quick slidings the rugosities of the wounds or of the liquor or of both are by their dancing vibrations smoothed into a delightful accord and we may perceive how some waters may by their rolling particles be the greatest probes and yet the surest searchers cleansers and healers and hence also on the contrary we may see how some waters which cure ulcers and cancers by outward application may be too busily corrosive and dangerous if taken inwardly  he mentions several of the old holywells so called one he says he can affirm upon his own knowledge has done many cures upon putrid and faetid ulcers which were many years deplored for incurable he had seen it tried often and always to good effect sometimes considerably wonderful it is somewhat asperous but pleasing to malignant ulcers  now i fear the monks and priests making an ill use of these wells by pretending they had their sanative virtues given to them by their saints and by leading the people to superstition thereby has been a great means to bring them out of credit by which many miserable people may have been deprived of the great benefit they might have received by them and therefore it may be necessary at this time to take them again into consideration by comparing some of the waters of the old holywells with those at the dog and duck and also that they may with diligent and strict observation by some neighboring surgeon be tried upon cancers that no care may be wanting to promote so great and good a work as the cure of cancers  errata page  0 line the last for sub read subjects p    l    for bring r bringing
