  the sick monkey a fable  thursday afternoon david garrick esquire arrived at his house in southamptonstreet covent garden public advertiser april         london printed for j fletcher and co in st pauls churchyard mdcclxv  the sick monkey a fable addressed to mr garrick upon his arrival returned from travel to your native shore again to make us laugh or cry to turn your back we hope no more nor from your colors fly whether you fled for health or quiet harrassd with rule or sick of riot or whether you have kept us lean as slander says with lenten plays to make our appetites more keen whether it be or this or that no matter what for we before the curtain see but blindly now you are come to us and home we greet you sir and greet you kindly my muse is honest as she is bold a forward miss who loves to prate  but hold  i quite forgot before i tell you what she is i will tell you what she is not no bird of prey with wild uproar like churchill to disturb the grove nor comes she like the harmless dove to bill and coo and love  and nothing more in short to speak more plainly nor be it thought i speak it vainly averse to flattery and spite she is a modest sober dame i wish all females were the same and will not scratch or bite she is not one of those who show their genius in their dress whose inky fingers unpinnd clothes the slipshod shoe and snuffy nose denote her wit and sluttishness who with a play like pistol cocked in hand bid managers to stand  deliver sir  your thoughts on this  before you stir    but madam  miss   your answer strait  i will not wait    it is fit you know   i will hear no reason  this very season  ay or no not to kill more precious time in dropping sense to pick up rhyme or like friend shandy rattle and lose my matter in my prattle without much wit digressions tame so i shall give it over and beat about the bush no more but start my game the criticks pen has various uses it praises now and now abuses does this and that or both together as fancy strikes or rhimes come pat stabs with the point or tickles with the feather authors like bees buz round and round dramatic ground for all they meet have sharp and sweet they do no ill would fools sit still provoke em and they are dangerous things and every player should equally beware their honey as their stings garrick thou mighty chief of kings and queens despotic tyrant of the scenes think thou all human race to mock in buskin and in sock and will not fools thy mockry ridicules from chalkstones lord to dainty fribble rave chatter write in various ways display their spite for all can talk and some can scribble others again take up the pen in panegyricks gaudy colors paint thee as humor flows now friends now foes in prose and verse and verse and prose bedevil thee and saint thee and can such critics teaze thee and can such praises please thee o if they can alas poor man no more deride thy neighbors weakness folly pride but cure thy own if thou art able while i make known my friendship to thee in a fable an ape there was an ape of merit a lively sportive pleasant thing had so much fancy whim and spirit and made such sport he got to court and showed his tricks before the lionking such honor gave him fame and raised his name from far and near they came to see this monkeyprodigy though none were more expert and quick in tumbling backward over a stick though none with a more lordly pride and happy ease did ever bestride the rugged russian bear though he could skip it up and down and pick the pocket of a clown or whip away his hat or fondle with a cat the wonder of the fair this was not all  he had the art of acting still a higher part to each profession that he saw physic divinity or law he ludicrously shaped him so much possessed of all their notions their humors oddities and motions that not a soul escaped him in ridicules enchanted glass whatever forms are shown we all can see anothers face but never find our own to flatter self we all incline for self we plan and labor  pluck not good sir a hair of mine  and you may scalp my neighbor each laughed to see his friend the jest and praised the monkey highly not openly but slily at court you find a thousand such but what was best though there were none by turns he did not fall upon each thought himself the only one the mimic could not touch blessed fools who boast your happy lot from ridicule secure though leopardstaind you see no spot inimitably pure whether the jackanapes was clever or the court not over nice by various tricks he crept in favor and for those tricks had double price thus fortune in a whim resolved to turn his brain and filled his cup up to the brim thintoxicating cup of joy which better heads than his destroy no wonder he was vain whenever gossip fame prates loud envy in turn as loud will tattle and scribblers to her standard crowd cry havoc and prepare for battle malevolence with lynxs eye the most minute defects will spy and even friendship shame upon our kind is to those faults not always blind the looking up fatigues the sight and mortals when they soar should they once reach a certain height all wish to have them lower and friends there are in this good town will lend a hand to help them down about about my pen nor lose the fable in thy railing but to our monkey back again who found that brutes as well as men have this same cursed failing the moment he got fame and wealth how ill exchanged for ease and health the envious crew poor pug pursue abuse his active pliant spirit but chiefly those were marked his foes who felt a satire in his merit the dull and sluggish were the first to show their teeth if not to bite the hog the bear the ass had burst had they not grunted roared and brayed their spite this furious stir awaked the critic cur hound greyhound mastiff answer to the call the little dogs and all the games in view for man and beast scandals a feast where both with appetite fall to the bloated toad in silence stole to gather poison in her hole as mischief never knows delay she roused the viper in her way a neighbor and her bosom friend for though she crawled and could not run she kept this maxim strictly ye sons of law attend that mischief if it must be done twere well it were done quickly but then his friends  did they oppose a lukewarm friends the worst of foes the goat looked wise and waggd his beard the spaniel shook his ears the fox turned up his pointed nose thoughtful and dull the cat appeared or else in whispers purrd her fears the steed alone was firm and fast the generous steed stood by him to the last pug sickens mopes and looks like death speaks faintly and scarce draws his breath some call it megrim some the spleen words often used that little mean but scandal with her face demure hints it is heat of blood by which is understood an old amor in short they ransack all diseases and give him that their fancy pleases among the rest that fits him best which best the doctor serves of which he most avails him when knowledge fails him and with a face of wisdom calls it  nerves the horse who saw his friends distress did thus his honest mind express  come prithee rouse this lifes the devil  what sigh and sob and keep within  what you who used to frisk and revel  for ever chatter and for ever grin  zounds  it would make a parson swear   get on my back and take the air  away they went and as they pass the hog the dog the bear the ass pugs different foes in different places if in the least they showed their spite the horse would winny snort and bite and throw the dirt into their faces for all this care this exercise and air yet still the monkey pined for well we are assured that when the grief is in the mind it is sooner got than cured in this condition what to prescribe him  a physician there is a certain way of life which all must take for fashions sake or be with all the world at strife the rich must to the doctor give the poor to nature trust and live it must be so  or could the tribe of those who quack or who prescribe in folly find such ample gain could nostrums swell the advertiser or the wise heads of warwick lane buy wig enough to make them wiser our patient cannot wait  send for a doctor strait but not a formal halfbred fool who cures by chance and kills by rule a perriwigpated block physicians for the brutes were fowls and though the sworn practitioners were owls they chose a neighboring cock he enters with a stately tread his comb and wattles dignify his head no outward fign was ever seen that promised half so much within and yet  ye sons of physic blush the wine was better than the bush his learning backed by penetration a kind of radcliffeinspiration bound by no partial pedant laws shot through each symptom to its cause a rarity without dispute he was an honest cock to boot yet with this genius worth and knowledge he had a stain a deep disgrace no mortal merit could efface   he was not of the college but hold  our hero out of sight must now again be brought to light we left him in the doctors care who with a serious face attending to the case did thus his mind declare  i could like any learned brother  with a hard name my ignorance smother  it is one of our established laws  which daily we fulfill  whenever our skill cannot find a cause  to make a cause to suit our skill  thus we seldom meet disgrace  we only can mistake the case  what are these papers by your side  it is physic sir to cure my pride  this heap of papers verse and prose  is the joint malice of my foes  there is not a day but somethings sent me  to fret me and torment me this said the conversation stops for pug was faint and calls for drops with rage subdued the patient panted which struck a light the doctor wanted who thus pronounced  i know your ail  it is not in your heart or head  as some have said  where then good doctor  in your tail his tail of most uncommon make in action like the serpent kind a thousand different forms could take twirl twist and vary to his mind if lords were apd  this pliant queue was cross his breast a ribbon blue or green or red  and then slapdash a chaplains scarf or colnels sash when ever the city struck his brain twas round his neck a lord mayors chain or were his part to lisp and trip it hey prefto  twas a ladys tippet but now deprived of spirit life and strength it lies a languid lank inanimated length the doctor paused  then silence broke  i will strike a master stroke  this tail of yours we must amend  give it new life and force  and if we gain that end  the rest will come of course  with that same malice of your foes  both verse and prose  curl it each night and morning  but then take warning   never again to cast your eyes  on what is wrote or may be writ  whether it is or is not wit  for there the magic lies it is best by craft and not by book to cure these mental fevers  the monkey all for gospel took the sick are great believers so well the doctors words he noted his tail that night was papilloted his greedy eyes to cure his head no more on paperdiet fed the cause removed effects will cease deprived of oil the flame goes out our ape began to be at peace his tail to move about the more twas curled the more it twirld with head and heart the tail took part life frisks in every vein  pug was himself again  the monkey got his health the doctor wealth of patients he had plenty for though the cure was half a joke twas wondered at by silly folk and that is nineteen in twenty to fix his cure historians say that like sir wilful in the play he talked of foreign parts left all his griefs and cares behind sailed with the first fair wind and hey for italy and arts what he got there no creature knows nor he himself can tell us what lightly comes as lightly goes with all such pretty fellows he skipd the country over and then returned with what he learned a greater monkey than before the fable told the moral comes  garrick dont fret and bite your thumbs but take the monkeys place the sames your case the same prescription we advise should spleen and spite nay though critic truth should write for who is always in the right shut your ears and close your eyes whatever is published buy the heap you will have it cheap but not to read or hear it read would you strike detraction dead the doctors method cannot fail keep the poison from your head and clap it to your tail the end
