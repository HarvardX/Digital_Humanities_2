an appendix to the second edition of mr loffts observations on a late publication entitled a dialogue on the actual state of parliaments and on some other tracts equally inimical to the constitution of free parliaments being a farther examination of the argument lately published by mr hatsell in his precedents of proceedings etc against the ancient law and constitution of this kingdom that the king ought to hold parliaments elected annually  by granville sharp  great is the truth and stronger than all things  it lives and conquereth for evermore appendix the supposed opinion of mr hatsell in his precedents of proceedings in the house of commons under the title of king calls the parliament as compendiously stated by my worthy and very learned friend mr lofft in p   of his observations is a much more favorable construction than mr hatsells own words can really warrant though all persons who are acquainted with that gentlemans very amiable character including the writer of this remark have reason to wish for his sake that his opinion whatever it may be had been so expressed as to be really limited by the moderate and very friendly construction which mr lofft has put upon it mr lofft supposes the opinion of mr hatsell to be that the intent of the statutes of edward and the ancient law and constitution of the kingdom require parliaments to sit once at least in every year but not that they should be annually or oftener elected but mr hatsell himself if we may judge by his manner of writing is far from admitting that the constitution requires parliaments even to sit once a year or that the king is obliged to call a parliament once at least in every year for this he has contemptuously treated merely as a notion that has been sometimes entertained p     n and he asserts that those persons who maintain this doctrine i e the doctrine last cited in his own words as a general doctrine having two different acceptations arising from the  th and   th edward iii do not mean says he that according to these statutes a session of parliament shall be holden every year but that a new election shall be had etc  in answer to which it may be sufficient to oppose one eminent example for all viz that the learned commentator judge blackstone notoriously denied as well as himself that the latter doctrine ever was the meaning of those ancient statutes though he actually was one of those persons who maintained the former general construction of the said statutes the only operative construction they are now capable of bearing since the traverse of the modern acts for triennial and septennial elections as being still in force to bind the king see   com c   p     and     where the learned writer having mentioned that the king only can convoke a parliament immediately adds and this by the ancient statutes of the realm he is bound to do every year or oftener if need be for which in a note he expressly cites these statutes of k ed iii and immediately afterward he mentions the two different acceptations of the said statutes  not says he that he i e the king is or ver was obliged by these statutes to call a new parliament every year but only to permit a parliament to sit annually etc the words  to permit  being a verb in the infinitive mood do manifestly require a repetitio to be understood of the preceding verb is obliged  viz is oblige to permit which confirms by necessary grammatical construction the doctrine of the preceding sentence that the king is bound by the sai ancient statutes this doctrine is strongly confirmed by the nationa declaration in the preamble to the statute of    charles i c   that by the laws and statutes of this realm the parliament ought to be holden at least once every year for the redress of grievances etc which though the act is repealed is stated as being still an existing principle of parliamentary doctrine by judge hales in his original institution power etc of parliaments p    and which is still farther confirmed by the constant usage and custom of parliament ever since the revolution as well as by the obvious reason and necessity of it whereby the lex et consuetudo parliamenti upon this poin must surely be sufficiently clear not to be mistaken by persons o much less intelligence in those matters than the clerk of the house of commons yet mr hatsell does not admit even this general construction of the ancient statutes and as a proof that he does not i need only to observe that though he is writing expressly concerning what he call the undoubted prerogative of the crown to judge of the expediency of calling  parliament and to determine at what time the writs shall issue yet this prerogative says he is limited by two acts of parliament the   th chapter ii c   and the  th of wm and mary c   both of which etc  enact that from henceforth a parliament shall be holden once in three years at the least so that in obedience to these laws says he without citing any other limitation either of statute or usage but these two acts for triennial parliaments the ministers of the crown says he are bound to take care that the sitting and holding of parliaments shall not be intermitted or discontinued above three years at the most and it is their duty says he to give directions for issuing the writs of summons accordingly  ie according to the two acts for triennia parliaments or rather to a part of one of them viz the part he has selected for the direction of the ministers of the crown to take care that the sitting etc shall not be intermitted or discontinued above three years at the most whereby he leaves the ministers of the crown at liberty to intermit and discontinue for three years even the sitting of parliament for he has cited no other limitation of the prerogative on this head and with respect to the two ancient statutes of k edward iii he did not it seems think them worthy even to be named in his text but only in a note to show that he had not forgot them where he has treated even their general construction merely as  a notion etc see p         but though the original meaning and force of these ancient statutes are materially affected and injured by the modern acts for triennial and septennial parliaments yet they are certainly still in force as judge blackstone has allowed to oblige the king to permit a parliament to sit annually for the redress of grievances and dispatch of business and this without impediment from the words if need be in the loose and vague manner that the judge has applied them contrary to the necessary grammatical construction of the whole sentence see declaration of the peoples rights p     to     n  for our right to an annual session of parliament is founded on the ancient constitution of the kingdom  on laws that are almost coeval with our national existence in this island see the usage perpetual ordained by k alfred and cited by lord coke   inst p   0 viz le roy alfred fist assembler les counties etc et ordeina pur usage perpetuel que deux foitz par an ou pluis sovent pour mister mestier in temps de peace se assemblerent a londres a parliamenter sur le guidament del people de dieu etc  the testimony of knighton  one of our best historians as mr petyt calls him in his preface to the ancient right of the commons p    that by an ancient statute and custom laudable and approved which nobody could deny the king was once in a year to convene his lords and commons to his court of parliament etc mr nevills testimony concerning an ancient statute of edward i ordering that a parliament shall be held every year and oftener if need be for which see his plato redivivus p   0     the same doctrine declared in the very next reign as proved by mr petyt p    from rot claus  0 edw ii m    intus that upon a petition to the king k edw ii  he granted that semel in anno teneatur parliamentum etc whence it is evident that the act of   edw iii c    was not a new law but a declaration of the old constitution viz that a parliament shall be holden every year once and more often if need be which was again confirmed by statute in the    ed iii c  0 and the usage of those times proved by the writs issued for general elections frequently more often than once in a year excludes all doubtfulness from these ancient statutes so that new parliaments must necessarily have been understood until by the traverse of modern acts they became applicable only to the annual sitting of parliament  the opposers of the original meaning viz for annual elections and more often have rendered that construction still more obvious by their own miserable shifts to evade it one says  the words are loose and vague though such a charge is applicable only to his own ungrammatical construction and another would render the acts doubtful by boldly excluding the only just criterion for clearing up doubts in such a case viz the usage of the times in which the acts were made and instead of it would have us refer only to the practice and to the opinion of persons who lived from  00 to  00 years after those times but the proposer seems not to be aware that this mode of explaining ancient statutes is exactly similar to one of the most gross and delusive practices of popery the apostate church of rome for obvious reasons cannot submit the determination of what ought to be esteemed apostolic doctrine to the evidence of apostolic times and of course she is driven to this wretched subterfuge of referring for evidence in favor of her innovations and unscriptural practices to the traditions of more modern times and to the practices and opinions of persons who lived from  00 to  00 years afterward in order to invalidate all cotemporary evidence of facts and primitive usages  and surely this dishonest and arbitrary mode of settling doubts is equally unjustifiable in legal and political as in religious questions yet mr hatsell boldly ventures to tell us that where the expressions of acts of parliament speaking of the acts of edward passed above four hundred years ago are doubtful says he though the contrary is evident nothing can clear up and settle these doubts but the opinion of all the wisest and bestinformed persons etc from the beginning of the reign of queen elizabeth to the present time p     n thus even the commencement of the time here proposed as the best for affording information is actually more than two hundred years after the times in which the acts were made and he cuts off all cotemporary as well as intermediate evidence by a single bold assertion that nothing can clear up  but etc taking care to secure to himself the ample space of another two hundred years still more distant from the times in question that he may range more securely in his search for precedents of innovations both in practice and opinion and indeed he has most industriously displayed the practices of the stuarts reminding us in the course of argument even of intermissions of parliaments for several years together  an intermission of parliament of six years by k james i  an intermission of parliaments for twelve years together by k charles i these were surely most unpropitious times for parliamentary knowledge and mr hatsell does not seem to be aware that the fear of similar intermissions was probably the principal cause which withheld the patriots of those days from urging their electionrights at a time when the sum total of all their rights was at stake even the right to have any parliament at all so that their silence respecting annua elections does not at all assist mr hatsells argument against them  the people of england in those times were rendered so deplorably abject by the unlimited and therefore illegal rule of tudors and stuarts that it was considered as a crime in the preceding reign of james i even to urge the expediency of calling a parliament at all  i would fain know the man that durst persuade the king unto it  says the minister of state in sir walter rawleighs dialogue on the prerogative of parliaments p   so that this was undoubtedly the language of those times to which mr hatsell has referred us for acts opinions and speeches whereby with the addition of some still more modern in formation he thinks the true intent and meaning of the words used in the statutes of edward iii though made almost  00 years before might be best explained but to look for explanatory opinions and speeche in such arbitrary times when men dared not to speak their opinions upon the subject is too great an absurdity so that mr hatsell is peculiarl unfortunate in fixing his era for parliamentary information and ye if the wisest and bestinformed men of those times had shown a little more regard to the nations rights than to the security of their own persons and property for rich men are commonly the worst citizens for various reasons and had ventured like honest men rather than like wise and prudent the prudent shall keep silence in that time for it is an evil time  amos v    men to speak their opinions in favor of that sacred truth our indispensible right to the actual sitting of a new parliament every year once at least and more often if need be  a truth never to be concealed a claim never to be relaxed  they might probably with gods blessing in the cause of truth and right have so checked the progress of unconstitutional doctrines as to deter their kings and statesmen from changing a limited monarchy to an absolute tyranny and might thereby have prevented the horrible effects of misrule which speedily broke out and overwhelmed the state and indeed the infringement of our parliamentary rights was the true source of all the mischiefs that shortly followed for when the able patriots named by mr hatsell were struggling almost in despair to retain the mere existence of a parliament under k charles i they did not seem to apprehend that their full constitutional claim to an annual election was a subject proper to be discussed at such a time but their only aim when they met after an intermission of parliaments for twelve years seems to be how they might prolong their sitting at any rate for the redress of grievances whereby it is manifest that the obstinate monarchs unwillingness to permit a parliament to sit together with the previous criminal intermissions as one illegality is apt to beget another became eventually the parents of a still greater evil  a long parliament without any election at all which severely repaid the royal perfidy in kind by an  intermission in return of regal government  an exclusion of that perured monarchs family from the throne for exactly the same number of years that he had presumed to intermit the sitting of parliaments viz  for twelve years at one time and even the six years intermission n his fathers reign was severely repaid in a bloody six years war until the sons imprisonment and death  these are awful examples worthy the serious attention of all parties though we are bound at the same time to discriminate between examples or facts and precedents that such baneful examples may not by the critical observations of ingenious men be drawn into precedents for proceedings but that the legal acceptance of the word precedent may always e duly maintained  mr hatsells argument upon the whole is certainly a very extraorinary one not only because the arbitrary times to which he has limited the commencement of our parliamentary researches seem to be utterly incapable of affording the least information upon the particular point in question and are also near three hundred years after the only proper time for ascertaining the usage of the times when the statutes to be explained were made  but also because he peremptorily excludes all other evidence whatever  nothing can clear up etc but the opinion etc from the beginning of the reign of queen elizabeth etc  i am far more willing to attribute such an unaccountable argument to inattention and a superficial manner of writing than to suspect any rea design of the ingenious author to promote a mode of explaining ancient statutes so dangerously presumptuous and arbitrary and to justify the more moderate conclusion of the two he has luckily furnished me with an easy and obvious proof of it in the very next chapter but one to which he has given the running title of  king adjourns the parliament  king adjourns the parliament  for several pages together i e from  0  to     so that that one would naturally suppose that he really meant what he had so often written but at length though not till the very last page of that head he kindly guards us against that baneful error by an explicit stating of what he himself believes to be the true parliamentary doctrine viz that the king has no authority to adjourn the parliament and of course his superficial manner of expressing himself i mean on this particular head must be corrected in his next edition to the true parliamentary doctrine  king does not adjourn the parliament  so that he must put a negative upon his present title throughout all these pages  but to return to my subject i trust that the necessity of at least one sitting of the parliament every year and of our national right to such sitting is so sufficiently understood and acknowledged by the majority even of all parties that the contrary doctrine which arises too apparently from mr hatsells manner of treating the kings prerogative on that subject will need no particular refutation and yet so respectable is the authority of the writer not only by his office of clerk of the house of commons but also by the personal esteem which is certainly due to him from a very numerous and respectable body of friends and acquaintance that i thought myself obliged to take some notice of his manner of treating the subject before us in order to warn the public against a possible construction of it which might hereafter if not seasonably censured have dangerous consequences at the same time i sincerely profess that my censure is aimed more at this gentlemans manner of writing than his intention and that i am much more willing to believe that the opinion he intended to express was truly what mr lofft has supposed or that i myself may perhaps be mistaken in conceiving that his words are liable to a different construction rather than to suspect that the worthy clerk of the house of commons could really intend to favor a doctrine which is repugnant to the established usage of parliament for near a century and is equally inimical to the just privileges of the lords as to those of the commons and of course to the welfare of the whole nation  granville sharp old jewry may  0
