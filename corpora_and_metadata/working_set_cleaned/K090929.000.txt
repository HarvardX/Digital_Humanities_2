capt dampiers vindication of his voyage to the southseas in the ship st george with some small obseations for the  on mr fel s chimeical  of the voyage roun the world and deted in little until he shall be examined more at large in the first place he calls himself my mate he went out my steward and afterward i did mae a mihipman of him indeed he had the advanage of perusing draughts and books of which he afterward  a slender account for some he preended were lost and others the draug are torn  of th especially the draughts of winds which i grealy suspect him of doing because he is not the first man that has endeavored to build upon another mans foundation    in page   lin   he says that cap pullen was going in compny with us but while we lay at anchor in the downs there arose a difference between to wo captains on which pullen went away  i wonder at his impudence for i was at london when cap pullen ent away and  was the owners his and mine could not agree to whom i appeal    in p        our pposals says he were to go into the river of plate and to  airs to take   or   spanish galleons which cap  gives an acont of i say capt dampier as he does  gentleman that  not to return home   there i desre to knw of th gentleman when it was tha  gave this accou and to  i must confess there was some discourse about it but i never desig o go to buonas aires for em being such a dangerous river  up and i think capt pullen  something  from thence may conclude that be plea for  he giv reasons of his  we did not go to buonas aires  produce reasons  where mr funn says cpt dampier and liet huzford   tere  mr morgn purser and agent that disagreed with  huzford went ashore and fought upon  corriidor cofu mr hxford and a  he himself sent fr  cht and clothes which  i ay before  i ent for him aboard and  actually came  i had no  of  but mr morgan swore if mr huxford saved  not go the voyage and where ill blood  upon which i ordered him to go on boad capt  whose boat was on  along our ide an  after a genleman manner  but it happened  carrying  to the  he and xford disagreeing  they were goig from  he  him on boad a portugueze marhanman    in relation to jmes baby second liet he says that  and eight of the men went on shore and left us taking their chests and clothes with them  to the  i take god to witness i never  but i rfusd them  nothing like the former design this mr morgan can   in p   mr fanel to settle my mistakes says he saw  but every body know it is a greater       the thre may be more  that we pass over to abrevite this matter as yet my crew not being wholly ere i mion o the two action of the voyage   the first of which is the  engaged that was crsing to the island of an fernandos to whom we gave chase from   in the afternoon and  making of her  i found she was an eopean ship and not a spaniard  not willing to pursue  farther but the  right or wrong  followed her and next  we came up  her and when i saw nothing would  attempt i encouraged them  by this time my consort  given her a broad side  up  and gave her a broadside likewise  were then  they fired upon our  his  his help notwithstanding  and exchanged   or   broadsides  suffered   killed and  woundd which  much they atually run down off the deck and made nothing of it afterward so that when i could have boarded her and carried her the mate cleppington by name  the men ar all gone and belhah the master whose offic it was  upon deck  also th this   in p       mr funnell says the crew were desirous to  this ship  they made nothing of i while in  power what was to be done afterward and as to my telling  as he says i could et at ay time  00000 l i say so i  my boats which were then  my people have been ruled in p    mr funnell says we took a ship of  00 tuns laden  several good commodities as indigo cochineel etc  now for cochineel i never heard of any indigo there was  the other and the turtleshl he so frequently speaks of  be go the same wy th many rich and valuable goods have by the management of those pyrating fellows rather  sailors the indigo i could not take on board nor could i trust any of them with the sailing such a ship as could neither keep me company nor make a right steerageway  in p    he says truth as to mr observators ship and the monkey that was left in her but as to firing at any thing but the ship and the whole crew who before we could make up to her had made into their boats and nothing beside the cargo and the monkey were indeed on board which  along had we not observators enough at home  the next thing they charge me with especilly mr fnnll in p    in the  of st michael  were in the barque last taken and indian cnoe  and that i ordered her to be fired upon the  for when i saw some of them that had frd without my orders i wa very uneasy and troubled at it knowing the consequence of it  the second thing that is material is that the ship mentioned by mr funnel in p       where he seems to  dollars was hid in the run of the ship and i slipped the  of taking it and  her adrift so this i answer that i had evident proof had landed her money at truxille and as to provisions we took as much as would provide us for one year and much longer if well managed that was what our ship could well  and this was the steward and the crews calculation now as to a report that they make about town  dollars that  ransom first i had no convenient road to ride in and the strong southerly winds were set in and so if i had loyterd for her must certainly been imbayd for   or   months besides the winds through the treachery of the spaniards i have had the experience of it before in a like case riding  for ransom with capt swa and capt  for instead of keeping their faith they  off with a  the night and    peagoes and  better crew and  men we came narrowly of  now th they are judges in my case and conduct a  who were perpetually drunk and very tit you will say  the night or being kept in any decorum   p       whereas mr funnell frequently would insinuate that i could agree with no body and so says that parted this way with capt stradling i say i  stradling nay not only that but at juan de fernandos when all hi men left him i reconciled them and him again therefore     the next morning  who is a very valiant man  with  men and irearms with them   what is observable is it is not enough to run away with  do what you please with  of sik  or any other    and that i rfer my self to all sailors in the world wher it was right or not a csidering the inequality of our  of ship  fore  action we were to the wind of he  stndng  and we bearing  her ith  oderd my officers to  to  to  of her instead of this  of my heart they edged away and were so far from ving the power to command and board her as i intended  we lost the opportunity and were forced to leward the  time aft that i ckd cam abo and had her under my lee the i hoped to  with my chase guns she havg no chase to  this i took to be the best way of disabli he  this  made her yield  o this  show  orld now  my office were  master and the mate  the o the great  the piate men  her for  an  a man  man at hlm  oce moe  while thing  at  i asked  to bod her clap he  then sid i  his time the being  and  to our   now  i have gotten along  they were  her that the mast we about  of the           para          finis postscript having read capt le wrights proposals for another expedition into  seas i do think it poper and advantageous and that he was  right and i am ready to satisfy any  of  cable and expedient i is to put it in
