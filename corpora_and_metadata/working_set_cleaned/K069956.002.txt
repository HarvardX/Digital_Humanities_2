family secrets literary and domestic  by mr pratt  in five volumes  vol ii  here is much to do with love and more with hate shakespeare london printed for t n longman paternosterrow        to mrs cockburne of madras it was the opinion of mrs cockburne that much of the literary matter which the author had some thoughts of offering to the public separately in an introductory volume with a delineation of some of the characters and a design of the work might be wrought with better effect into the work itself he leaves the public to judge how far he is authorized in adopting that opinion the accurate and able manner in which this lady at a very early period of life transfused into the english language as well the profound and abstract as gay and elegant thoughts of the celebrated citizen of geneva thoughts of jeanjacques rousseau translated by miss henrietta colebrooke   where he reechoes in the character of the genius and representative of human nature and communicates to his readers that enthusiastic love of nature and virtue which glowed in his own breast at the same time that she has avoided intermixing the eccentricities and errors of what is excellent and useful in the writings of that exalted genius  sufficiently evinces the sterling value of her observations the author therefore has again ventured to incorporate part of what he had indeed twice before embodied and withdrawn from a sincere doubt of his own powers to interweave it with advantage to the general interests of the book for therein only can there be hazard of the possibility of raising the general character of the english romance by the interspersion of subjects of weight and sublimity either in science or morals so as likewise to raise the passions and affections of the fable there cannot be a doubt and it has indeed been by several authors occasionally attempted and with success to a degree but with apparent apprehension the author of these pages is therefore perfectly satisfied that the idea with which mrs cockburne has honored him will receive the unequivocal suffrage of the professional critics to whom his attempt to realise it is submitted and could he have a moments apprehension of that idea meeting disapprobation he would certainly not have subjected her to any part of the censure he may incur from his own failure in the management of it  but the obligation which the author owes to mrs cockburne on the score of literary arrangement is not the sole motive for addressing to her a proportion of this work and that without any previous solicitation the selecting of a patron is he conceives amongst the inherent rights of literature which however he is aware her delicacy would in the present instance have disputed or denied but there are privileges of an independent nature the assertion of which should rest on our own judgment and discretion and any petition to exercise these implies a doubt even that they exist the freedom of election as to the choice of a virtuous person to exemplify a virtuous even though it may be an unsuccessful endeavor ought to be looked upon as amongst the most inalienable rights attached to the charter of literature on that authority a writer should feel that he has the world before him where to choose and on that authority the author of these sheets takes leave to illustrate by the conduct of mrs cockburne his attempted portrait of a female which may serve as an example of the filial fraternal and conjugal virtues and to sanction this illustration he refers to that ladys family and friends nay to a yet stronger testimony  her

provoking cross purposes began in the morning and continued until the evening and were indeed resumed the next morning  a gentleman now arrived at the castle of a very singular character and conversation his youth had been past partly at sea and partly in foreign climes and being in possession of a very competent fortune as well from patrimony as from successful adventure he had for some years back quitted the ocean and all its enterprises and set himself down on shore in a very comfortable dwelling within a neighbourly distance of fitzorton castle mr partington had many peculiarities  there was a rough honesty in his manner and a fredom of expression corresponding to it which at first sight seemed more boisterous and rugged than the element on which he had been educated his person was something under the middle size and his features had little more of smoothness than his manners but beneath this uninviting exterior beat a heart every pulsation of which was genuine good will to mankind without the least alloy of sentimentality  that shining dross which makes so much glitter in these tinsel times partington if he liked you was a friend indeed but the more he fancied you the rougher would you find his address and this rule held good in all the degrees of his approbation  for exactly proportioned to his good opinion was his jocular rudeness if he thought tolerably well of you he would call you a sad fellow if on farther acquaintance you improved in his good graces you would advance also in the scale of abuse and he would speak of and to you as a cursed goodfornothing devil and when he had taken you into his heart  wherein by the bye you might confide your honor your happiness and your life  he would honor you by the appellation of a damned insufferable scoundrel this being the highest and most distinguishing mark of his esteem could be boasted of by few for partington never thought any man or woman deserving of this mark of his affection unless they appeared to him preeminently great or good we say man or woman because the sex of the person made no manner of difference to him  his dislike on the other hand was expressed in quite a contrary way but still he marked it by the same gradations if neither your head nor your heart was satisfactory to him  that is if the first was not worth carrying upon your shoulders nor the other in your bosom  he would if he spoke to you at all accost you in very civil language if you had any thing remarkably base in your disposition he would be yet more polite calling you sir or madam and if he thought you deserved a box on the ear or the gallows instead of a bow he would even pull off his hat  which being the last evidence of his abhorrence bore the same proportion of contempt that his damned insufferable scoundrel did of affection nor were even his benevolences themselves less remarkably his own than his modes of expression he never talked of doing any person a kindness and yet was kindness itself in truth while other people were only talking he would be doing the very thing they talked about for he would slip out of company on fifty different pretenses none of which you could suspect  and have had an interview with the party he had heard commiserated  then return to the company with no alteration in his general manner but that of loading with exaggerated scurrility the person to whom he was indebted for the opportunity of being bountiful for as this was the highest obligation his heart was capable of receiving he had no other way of returning it but more frequently he would appear altogether inattentive to tales of distress or if he did give ear to them would break out into  psha  dont tell me riffraff stuff a pack of beggars i should not have thought of their impudence i say distress too and many such like exclamations yet he would be at the door or at the bedside of the sufferers and have every thing that was really of comfort in their habitations before any other man of the party thought of leaving company if for instance an apothecary was wanted he would arouse him in the middle of the night drag him out of bed or some way or other get him under his arm and if common necessaries were to be supplied he would run to his little poorrascals warehouse as he used to call it  and making up his bundle according to the case carry it in his hand and have done his work before his orders to an uninterested domestic could have been well given  chapter ii partington had been long in the habits of intimacy with sir armine and honored the family with a liberal share of his loving abuse whenever he made it a visit and each individual was as jealous of that abuse as desirous of his company the trio of brothers filled his scale of epithets james was only one of his middling sort of fellows john had the pleasure to be ranked his cursed goodfornothing caitiff and henry enjoyed the supreme distinction of being almost the first of his damned insufferable scoundrels harkee you mr middling sort of fellow addressing himself to james after dinner how goes on the affair between this damned insufferable scoundrel  here he shook henry by the hand  and you know who  you cursed goodfornothing little devil  tapping olivia on the cheek  what say you you old rascal added he turning to sir armine are you getting your gouty legs in order to dance at the wedding sbud man you ought upon that occasion to give us an hornpipe upon your stumps like witherington for two such pretty caitiffs as these do not come together every day i can tell you but what are you all about you lazy vagabonds  shilly shally if i were a parson they should be married before i left the house  young folks cannot begin to be happy too soon  now look how that insufferable poltroon to henry shakes and trembles  why one would think instead of feeling the flames of love on sitting so close to a fine girl whose telltale blushes ought to make him blaze out like a bonfire that the ague had got hold of him by the arm of my body he quivers like a lapland witch well come i will give him my blessing in a bumper however marry when they will may the pledges of their love be just as goodfornothing as their parents the girls abominable husseys and the boys damned insufferable scoundrels put it round old vulcan said he pushing the bottle to sir armine he then stood up and sung some stanzas so replete with humor in themselves and in so quaint and ludicrous a manner that the whole company caught the hilarity of their worthy guest  was there ever such a comical creature exclaimed olivia smiling  but hold what is this i hear about henrys going to be hanged for his fine devilsworks at the abbey  henrys confusion was now redoubled upon another account for he did not at all doubt but that the subject which had been remotely alluded to by john would be fully explained by this unqualifying son of the waves henry winked nodded and made other signs of keeping silence which not only increased the curiosity of the company but made partington more determined i dont care for your wry faces a brass button you scoundrel said he i say notwithstanding all your antics you will come to the gallows  it is a serious matter to knock down a baronet on the very spot where he is to be buried then throw his daughter into fits and run away from both of them  knock him down said olivia why good heavens if it had not been for henry sir guise would have been murdered and as to miss stuart for whom my soul still bleeds her fits were occasioned god knows by the loss of her sweet mother for as her brother could not attend henry was her only comforter this is the whole of the matter i do assure you mr partington  the earnest simplicity with which she uttered this in the defense and to the honor of him she loved and for whom she had always a vindication had a visible effect upon all but more particularly on henry who torn betwixt the sensations of gratitude and shame tenderly caressed her  you are both of you a couple of insufferable scoundrels and encourage one another for that matter i would lay my life if this egregious villain  to henry   should be hanged this dimpling caitiff would tie herself up in her garters the next morning that she might lovingly dangle by his side upon the same gibbet so as i hope yet to see them tied up together i think it is the best way to pinion them now till their time comes  here he drew them close to his own bosom formed their arms into the wreathe of love and ordering the whole party to follow their example conducted them into the garden  chapter iii thus were matters reinstated to the general satisfaction and even henry felt it might have been much worse for though it had been so long the wish and endeavor of his heart to come to an explanation of its fatal secret  any disclosure of it at such a time in such a place and under such circumstances would have been the most overwhelming event that could have happened to him  partington who had the romping playfulness of a boy without the least of that mischief which usually attaches to the sport of youth continued his pleasantries amongst which was a proposition to run upon the greensward along the park with henry  the winner to be entitled to a kiss from olivia and olivia herself to be the umpire  he pointed to a clump of elms as the given distance the putting himself into a starting posture there  i will give you law you villain  so away with you henry was perhaps never less in disposition for a frolic but knowing that partington  who had now doubled his fists  would have pushed him headlong forward had he suffered himself to be overtaken he soon sprung to the goal in doing which however he contrived to trip up partingtons heels to the no small diversion of the company a bubble bet cried partington scrambling up the race was obtained only by a fraud else i should have beat him hollow  a contrived thing i saw both the villains laying their heads together concerting how it should be before i set off the truth is he loitered behind while he counterfeited exertion purposely that the supposed lovers might be thrown into each others arms  these sallies were interrupted by a knot of travelers who were passing that part of the park which sir armine left free for the accommodation of the public  the wanderers had the attractions of indisputable affliction and of sickness its too frequent attendant strongly impressed in their air looks and motions yet there was no external appearance of want in any of the groupe all were habited neatly and one of them bore a wallet laden with food but the moment you beheld them your own heart would have told you they were destitute of comforts which were not to be found in that wallet there are certain signs and tokens of misery so visible in the human form and countenance that every man without an insult upon the human character and understanding must see and feel them at a glance  the groupe consisted of an elderly man leading a boy about twelve years old  a woman something under the age of the man with a child at her back  and a beautiful young woman who sad and sorrowing followed the rest as the first and last mentioned objects stood by the side of the venerable fitzorton and the blooming olivia they exhibited in striking contrast the wonderful difference which sickness and health happiness and misery produce in beings of the same species and at the same period of life please your honors said the old man respectfully i hope we are not upon trespass here a man on the other side told us there was a footway here to the place we are going we have come clean from west to north and are somewhat footsore and every bit of ground saved therefore is something our jane here poor thing can hardly drag one foot before the other so as night is coming on and we are not acquainted with the country hereabouts mayhap your honors who i suppose are masters of thatun great house would be so kind to give us barnroom till the morning  to this partington made answer he was afraid the vagabonds had staid in their own parish till they were driven out of it bag and baggage and were living now by accident in a barn or a stable or the open field as they could manage it  the old man answered please your worship none of us have been ever a burden to the parish yet and i hope with the blessing of god upon our labor we shant but we are burnt stick and stone out of our parish where we lived upon our earnings and a little matter besides for these forty years may be your honor would like to hear a little about us i am a mason your honor  so i bought a bit of ground and built a house on him and furnished him a thing at a time and there twould have done your heart good to see how we lived till a sort of quarrel betwixt me and a great rich person who has an estate thereabout and has a house like a town  where nobody lives for a constancy but a savage old servant or two  for the master only comes a week or two in the spring season or to gather rents when the steward who by the same token is worth a hundred of his master cannot come down  god bless his goodness said the woman who appeared to be the mother of the family if it had not been for him i do believe it would have been bad off for us long before for the baronet was pecking and pecking at us years agone our jerome who is gone forward with the mule got himself made a freeholder and would not vote for a friend of this great baronight  for he is one who is titled to do as he likes with poor folk  bore us all a grudge  and somehow or other your worship resumed the old man about august in the summer after i shut up house whilst i and dame and youngster went a making a little harvesting at friend armstrongs a cousin of my wifes who has a bit of a farm and who wished me to bring all my family and as we could make ourselves tolerably tight and smart at that time we rigged ourselves out and off we went but when we got home from merrymaking  what a world it is your worship  i saw the top of my house where the bottom should be and the walls as black as my hat  why reuben exclaimed the wife how can you be so milklivered and mealymouthed reuben please your worship as sure as you stand there this great baronet i told you about set it afire  o impossible cried olivia  set it afire miss i say resumed the wise emphatically slapping her hands together and i will tell him so to his head and bring all my ruinated family in my hand to show him what he has done for we left neither fire nor candle and i will take my affydavid that i put up the shutters and locked the door and clapped the key in our pockets and the same to the little garden gate and god knows the keys are all now we have for it here they are your worship aye and they shall go with us to the wicked wretch though all the keys in the world cannot open his heart because it is harder than they but a shall hear on it and if there is law in the land he shall have it  hold your tongue sal said the old man i dont think sir devilscome as we call him in our parts would go to set a mans house on fire when there want a soul in it either to please or to tease him or to say why do ye so though to be sure my house as i said is down and all that was in it burned or moved off and what was worse i had put into a drawer a little modukin of money shillings and half crowns at a time  now and then a golden guinea and they are gone too though i have been pottering about with my stick and my family have all been on their knees grubbing in the ashes but it was all to no purpose this fellow would have gone to pot too continued the old man pointing to a curltail black dog that followed him and so would the kitten under our jennys arm there if we had not luckily put she to bide with goody brabson a neighbor of ours so here is the whole family your honor counting jerome and dorothy  olivia who had before put a trifle into the young womans hand now stroked the kitten and henry long before the story had arrived at this stage had made his offering james patted the dog called him a lucky fellow and assured him considering such dangers he had a very narrow escape at the suggestion of the house being maliciously set on fire every particle of blood that supplied the body of partington flew in his face he cried out o that the worthy baronet had been in the middle of the flames i would have set fire to my own house to have had him in the center but i dont believe a word on it it is a lie it must be a lie i will have it a lie are you sure fellow you did not see it on fire yourself and why do you keep that child woman swinging at your back all this time when there is such a fine soft bank by the side of you and the grass full of flowers and as dry as my walkingstick here partington loosed the bandages took the infant in his arms repeating answer me that answer me that down with ye down with every one  you two old sinners in particular  partington appearing to bend them to the ground forcibly but in truth lowering them with all possible gentleness as for you continued he good people addressing himself to his own party the evening begins to draw in the dew falls see how your fine neckcloths and handkerchiefs shrink at it  sunflowers can bear nothing but fair weather  the dew will not suit your gouty limbs you old scoundrel  to sir armine  nor your delicate ancles mrs abominable  to olivia  the vagabonds may remain they are used to clouds and so in with the family you blubbering waterheaded rascal  to henry  he spoke this as in rebuke though by the bye his own face was covered with tears  pack off i say i will have it so i will be with you presently  but you are to know that i smoke a damned lie all through this business and i am determined to have it out with the ragamuffins and i dont doubt but i shall have the satisfaction of seeing every one of them sent to the house of correction and that i shall bring them to old armine here to make out their mittimus all this time they had been moving or rather partington had been pushing them forwards and as the clares and fitzortons knew the poor creatures would be left in good hands they bent their steps back toward the castle  chapter iv good heaven exclaimed olivia to her father as the party were walking home do you think there ever was such a shocking thing done in the world as for a person to set fire to his neighbors house on purpose i have read of such horrid actions in newspapers and once i think in a book but never believed either to be possible indeed i felt a kind of disgust at the author of such incredible fictions  it is almost a sin my sweet girl said mr clare to destroy your opinion of human kind formed on the basis of your own innocence painful as it is to oppose the wisdom of experience to the blissful simplicity of a pure and unpractised heart  i have known more instances than one of it  yet we seldom  i never did resumed olivia hear of people coming to an untimely end for these horrid crimes  that too is amongst the vices of the times rejoined sir armine people make their fortunes nowadays by being ruined and undone in a few months after these lucky misfortunes we behold new trades carried on by those who had been turned pennyless out of their shops and we see new houses rising like so many phoenixes out of the ashes of the old  my dear girl cried her father who can detail the history of modern inventions in the art of living  there is comparatively a poor livelihood child now to be picked up out of the real miseries of life but luxury and independence pour in their stores on the designing  thus some impositions are a decent maintenance and others a very comfortable sinecure in short to make fictitious distress the instrument of real good fortune is amongst the most dextrous refinements of this improving age vice is always at work and works with the greatest success on the sensibility of virtue  dreadful exclaimed olivia but i cannot think the poor creatures we have just left are of this description for surely that old miserable man who asked for nothing but the charity of a bed of straw in our barn could not trump up such a falsehood against the person he spoke of  and indeed i have blamed myself every step i have come that i did not beg my dearest sir armine to let him have some comfortable place to rest his family tonight  the young woman really looked ready to sink into the earth with fatigue and yet she kept the poor kitten in her arms and i heard her ask her mother to let her carry the child twenty times  indeed indeed mr partington judges too harshly of them gracious heaven henry if the world is half so wicked as you and your brother john have painted it to me i do not see how such a simpleton as your olivia is to live in it  here the lovely girl ran to henry and placing herself betwixt him her own father and sir armine she said in a tone that might have taught hypocrisy to forego its victim well thank god while i am thus protected not all the bad people in the world can do me any harm saying which she entwined her arms and clung toward her parent and lover as if she felt herself in a sanctuary  but said james with his usual good sense and moderation the miseries of human life induced by inevitable misfortunes are alas so manifold and so various that the soul is not to be frozen up because vice can assume the appearance of virtue in distress and by applying to the same source may partake of the same bountiful stream  respecting the wretched family we have been talking with said henry we have all seen they are both sick and sorrowful my dearest father and i dare pledge myself every tittle of their story is true  truth may perhaps lie between interposed james  i would go barefoot a thousand leagues exclaimed henry to punish the author of their ruin but if having found him he was evidently under the pressure of any heartwringing misery pining with want or wasting in disease i hope i should do what i could to comfort him  it is certainly right said james half conceding to take care that vice does not run away with the perquisite of virtue but it is nevertheless better that they should divide our bounty than that from sear of encouraging the one we should refuse to reward the other  the virtue of designing well said sir armine with a deciding voice as he reached the portico of the castle if it fails of some is seldom deprived of all its rewards  let the honorable passions and emotions of our frame declare the unrivalled privileges of a gentle and unsuspicious heart  let the power which it gives us in the energies of our loves and friendships pronounce its eulogy  let pity charity candor benevolence easiness to believe the best and tardiness to credit the worst  yea and the sweet very sweet simplicity that sometimes conducts us to the precipice down which we are hurled by the villain guide  let even the pure and innocent heart itself through all its meanders of sensibility  let it in vibrations of transport declare it is the prime delight of man and the choicest gift of god  olivia here pressed the hand of her father then that of sir armine upon her heart you have now all settled it so entirely to my satisfaction and have brought me again into such good humor with that world which some of you had almost put me out of conceit with that i will not stay to hear another word  the whole company went into the house  chapter v it is among the wonders of the world when i wonder quoth partington to the family in the park and yet i must confess the audaciousness of your telling that impudent lie about some worthy gentlemans burning down your house because you would not vote against your conscience does throw even me into astonishment  sir answered the old man with some dignity i do not pretend to say it is so for sartain but goody brabson is ready to swear it for she was disturbed the night before and saw illlooking fellows lurking about and before that day comeweek my house was down  but as for a lie i dont know whether i would tell one to have it built up again  no answered partington  then give me your hand you scoundrel  but for that matter resumed the old man there are hotter doings at electioneering than burning down poor mens houses  why bless your worship i have seen the candidates as they call themselves ready to set fire to one another  aye your honor interposed the old mans wife that is not half the mischief there was something worse than lection riots in this affair  naughty jenny there and this poor brat at my back if it could speak could tell you all about that  here the young woman whom she called jenny made signs for her mother to keep silence upon which the mother exclaimed hussy i will speak his honor here shall know who are scoundrels and who are not mayhap his honor is a justice of the peace and will give us some law  an please your worship that baronet is the father of this babe after my reuben had refused his vote this baronet grew so kind that we thought god help us he repented his hashness to us whereupon i was a kind of a charwoman now and then at the great house when he came down for a week or two and if i was wanted at home why i sent jenny there backwards and forwards as well spoken and likesome a girl your honor aye and as shamefaced then and for that matter now though she has had a bastard as any she of the country  and so behold ye this villain of a baronet was only kind for the sake of she and behold ye he contrived to get to the sight and speech of her and soon put the girl aside herself she could talk of nothing but the baronet  the baronet told her this  the baronet gave her that  i believe in my conscience he turned her silly head and overset her in such a way that she was crazy enough to think of becoming my lady  aye and he put a new golden ring on her finger and called her wife  though he was married before and they do say to a moral of a woman  not that he ever brought maddam down  and he persuaded silly jane she was dead  thof a maddam he had there too and there she comes at times still for a month in the summer and says she is the baronets cozen  marry come up a dainty cozen i warrant she cozens his virtuous wife finely but to return to our jenney  reuben and i began to think it odd the girl should get so much into favor seeing how we were hated before but we still were fools enough to believe that sir guise    sir guise exclaimed partington is he the baronet it is all true  get up  tell the rest of your story as you go along i see you are a pack of sad scoundrels and i shall insist upon fitzortons house covering all of you somewhere until morning and do you hear girl  jane i think is your name  do you lean on my arm and do you mother blab take hold of the other arm  you young varlet keep close by your father  hussy keep you by your mother  but as to the suckling you must carry that sin yourself jane for the devil seduce me if i touch any thing belonging to that pretty gentleman unless i should have the felicity of tucking him up under the gallows well but that happy day may come yet  partington had the family all up on the march before he had got to the ejaculation with which he finished his harangue  and disposed the several persons in the order described in this manner they were moving along toward the castle when they encountered henry who partly in consequence of olivias whisper and partly to gratify his own curiosity  or perhaps from a better principle  was returning to the spot where he left the groupe without relating stories or entering into causes partington ordered henry to run as fast as his legs would carry him back to the castle order a comfortable supper but not among the servants and half a dozen well aired beds and tell old squaretoes it was his command  nay that it is the old caitiffs duty said he for here is justice business enough for a whole sessions and moreover if he dont choose to accommodate them come back again and tell me so that i may take them to the fitzortonarms public house for they shall not go out of my custody till i sift the affair to the bottom and as it is moonlight a mile or two more less for good suppers and good beds can make little difference  henry who was ever ready to assist the unfortunate without paining them by a recital of distressful stories hasted without asking a single question to execute his commission  partington returned to the travelers who began to think him insane and put himself nearly in his former situation with the difference only of taking the child gently from the young woman who had been giving it suck and saying at the same time come as that little rascal may one day be brought in evidence against its virtuous father i think i will give it a lift and so go on with your walk and your story old caitiff  as i was saying then your worship we foolishly thought sir guise stuart   proceed cried partington if you can without any more mentioning that worthy gentlemans name for it puts me in a fever call him  call him  baronet  the baronet then answered mrs atwood was never easy but when some of us was at the great house he wanted reuben to give up masonry  we staid in the parish a twelvemonth after the fire with goody brabson  the baronet wished us to take one of his farms  sometimes he said he would pull down the great house and build up a finer which would do for his son when he married and give reuben the job and as for jenny i dont know what he was to do for she  he would take her to his other great seat in these parts  i never was there your honor but i will be there and sooner than he thinks  well he would pull this other down and let her live with miss  miss caroline  so we even let her go and coil enough there was about it from reuben who had been told by neighbors what would become of it however i thought it for the best and away she went  accursed be the hour she did said reuben  dont interrupt her you vagabond cried partington doubling his fists  not at reuben however nor at any person present  the upshot of it was an please your worship that one valentine miles a man that used to do all sir guises  i beg your honors pardon i mean  the  the  baronets dirty work such as pounding our strays suing for rents and the like  miles i say your honor took jane as he said to guise abbey but in fact far enough afield from that he carried her up to london always calling her my lady  and as the foolish girl was in love she believed it  and for that matter she lived like a lady sure enough  ladys maids ladys liverymen and what not  no wonder your worship poor jane believed it all gospel for i thought it so myself  for ater this he had her married over again but that was sham too just like the ring business before for the fellow who married her was as little of a parson and as great a rogue as himself  so your worship sees the end on it  this poor boy   whew whistled partington  and we might have lived in ignorance and she in wickedness poor thing a great while longer continued the afflicted father caressing his betrayed daughter had not somebody sent us a nonmus letter as they call it saying our daughter was a double u sir guise stuart an r  and the child a b   partington here gave the old mason another shake by the hand and then bade the wife proceed  she then related a variety of other heinous particulars unfolding the villainy of sir guise and his agents and ending with the recovery of the deluded jenny to the arms of her family yes your honor said mrs atwood in conclusion  and so this very day was six weeks brought jenny and her brat home to us again dressed in the very gown she went away in  a good stuff of our own honest buying and which she has got on you see at this present  but with the blessing upon us well make the baronet ashamed of it yet for we are going to settle not passing more than thirteen or fourteen miles on the other side of his abbey and we have come a matter of that about purposely to tell him a piece of our mind and if your worship can do any thing in this affair give us some justice for well have none of his money so far contrary indeed that one of the mules paniers with jerome is loaded with all the things  some of em pretty smart ones too  that he gave us before jenny went from us  as to the fine clothes and trinkumtrankums he gave she they were all left behind at the wicked place where we found her  their walk and their recital ended together for they had now arrived at the castle where they were again met by henry who told partington all things would be done as he had directed  then lead the way said partington for these are much greater vagabonds than you think and must be taken care of accordingly  henry conducted them to a large apartment adjoining the stewards  partington ushered them in ordered the servant to place chairs  assisted in the business himself observing that though they were vagabonds they were every one to be treated with the utmost respect  he desired them to eat drink and be merry  to be in good humor with one another but above all things not to say a single cross word to that goodfornothing hussy jane and to take care that the child had some pap  chapter vi henry and partington returned to the company where olivia was still presiding at the teatable declaring mr partington should not go without his usual beverage this was a pint basin filled with tea and milk and honey in equal proportions if you would not have me choked with rage give me the slop  so he always called it  and seeing the basin before him he spilled one part of it and swallowed the other then taking breath he threw himself into a chair the blood starting into his face while he recited the history of the atwoods making no other variations than distinguishing sir guise by the words fine fellow pretty gentleman the hero of the tale but though thesee pithets were not bitter in language they were intolerably so in the manner of their delivery for at the mention of his atrocities he would sometimes leap up take the room at a couple of strides exclaiming to a chair to a table to one of the company or even to his own shadow in the glass supposing it were sir guise your most obedient very humble servant my noble baronet i trust your execution is not very far off for other facts are coming out i dare say and all the crimes of human nature will conduct your honor to tyburn i flatter myself would to heaven they could all be bundled with you into the same cart that you might be put out of the world together i would empty my cellar  aye and almost my strong box too  to celebrate that glorious event  the effect which the narration had upon the company was various lady fitzorton lifted up her hands and wept silently  mr clare exclaimed execrable wretch  sir armine knit his brows and said poor charles what does he not deserve to atone for the curse of such a parent  olivia said the poor girl and child deserved every care that innocence betrayed and helpless infancy could receive from pity  these old caitiffs too have their merits cried partington but what can be a sufficient tribute of admiration for miss stuart exclaimed olivia  so good so considerate  how my dear henry shall we do honor to her  henry held his tongue and spoke nothing yet looked as if he subscribed fully to the eulogy  partington however was the most busy of the groupe his hands head and heart seemed to be full and he divided the evening between his insufferable scoundrels above stairs and his abominable vagabonds below  olivia too frequently stole out and whispering henry who always disappeared soon after hasted to partingtons guests and under pretense of asking if they had every thing comfortable about them took occasion to show many little marks of a generous nature and of genuine good will  she had particularly directed her own maid to provide all things proper for the child and would have sent to the manorhouse for her own cradle but was prevented by henry who reminded her there were several in the castle  gracious perhaps your own  what an honor if we could procure that exclaimed olivia the poor babe is innocent you know alas and its mother can scarcely be called guilty my henry  she took care that a comfortable change of every thing was provided from her own wardrobe and placed ready for jane atwood in her bedchamber nor was she unmindful of the rest in such little additions as might be proper to the general happiness  prior again to this true george had been dispatched by partington to the eastern gate of the park at which atwoods eldest son jerome with dorothy was appointed to wait his familys joining him  the boy will stand stock at the gate please your worship said old atwood as he overheard partington giving directions he said he would thof it were for a couple of nights i never seed such a boy for that bid un do a thing and if he answers aye the things done but then again if he gives you one of his noes icod your worship he is more of a mule than dorothy  i see into the vagabonds character at once replied partington go then george you will find him stuck to the gate and if he will not leave it take armines team and bring gate and all  true george when he had a goodnatured thing to do never addicted himself to unnecessary delays and was besides one of the most active young fellows in the world he set off therefore for the eastern gate as if his own bed and board depended on his dispatch  to confess the truth this honest fellow had been more in the secrets of atwoods family than any other of the servants indeed he was a youth of most insatiable curiosity where the gratification thereof had but the probable aspect of being attended by a good office in searching after which he was indefatigable and judging from his beloved master henrys second visit to the park by moonlight too that some new adventure was near he had contrived to take his usual station of an outpost for fear of being discovered by a little bushfighting however which is extremely honorable he formed his ambuscade behind some flowering thorns which grew in that part of the park where mr partington recapitulated in an audible voice so much of the atwoods story as had then been told  chapter vii were it our intention to give to each of the heroes and heroines of this epic history a day of prowess after the manner of the great maeonides who dedicated one book of his iliad to ajax another to agamemnon and so on  we should certainly consecrate this chapter to the achievements of olivia who from the orient sun even to his downgoing and again to his uprising was employed in doing at least as much good as any illustrious ancient or modern whom fable or truth has yet celebrated were we to begin with philip of macedon and end with frederick of prussia and we do not at all deem it unreasonable to declare that we expect the very abridgment of her acts during the abovementioned space will make the reader more in love with her though rehearsed in humble prose than if in imitation of those royal butchers she had laid a thousand of her fellow creatures with her own hand dead at her feet in the field of battle  the day then of the fair olivia clare was ushered in by an act mild and lovely as the first ray of the morn which shone on it  even by an early walk round the garden with the unfortunate jane atwood luckless victim thy modest appearance and blushing graces and all the deep regrets of downcast consciousness streaming from thy eyes thy keen sense of the novelty of a virtuous woman soothing and not aggravating the fate of a woman betrayed  justified thy mothers description and made the compassion and loving kindness of thy protectress a virtue worthy to be imitated by thy sex a sex too often cruel and unrelenting to most pitiable victims  after several turns about the walks olivia conducted her still trembling protegee to the breakfastroom where the atwoods had been invited by sir armine to join the family but seeming to feel themselves farther from home there than in the apartment where they had passed the preceding evening they were again committed to the care of partington and true george  olivia understanding this begged permission to seat jane between henry and herself saying in a whisper to her father because you know we can comfort and make her cheerful besides the shyness which only an intercourse with the world can remove a painful consciousness of her error and of the knowledge which the company had of it made the timid jane discover so much uneasiness that the goodnatured olivia perceiving it led her first to the window and then out at the door saying her young friend was not very well and though sensible of the honor intended her wished to take breakfast with her own family partingtons proposal to blend the atwoods and fitzortons at breakfast was amongst the generous little inconsistencies or rather indiscriminations which were interwoven into his character insomuch that you would sometimes see at his table persons whom from their difference of character and condition any man who attended to the ceremonies of the world and indeed to the distinctions of ranks in society would have thought it impossible he could bring together but the same objection by no means held against the propriety of olivia bringing this young woman into so much good company  the best and most justifiable motives influenced the fair protectress and there was a natural grace and gentility about the no less fair protected which sir guise in giving her the best masters had not a little improved in truth jane attributed her misfortune and all its fatal consequences to the violence of the baronets passion for her and she looked on the mock nuptials as so solemn a pledge of his love that she herself encouraged the wish of sir guise that the union should remain secret from an idea which sprung from the purity of her affection that having the joy to tell her own heart he was her wedded lord she had rather continue to be thought herself dishonored than that he should be degraded her fathers finding and carrying her off she long considered as the sole cause by which she had been separated from the baronet  and although none of these motives wholly obliterated the inward sense of her first indiscretion prior to her supposed honorable union or suppressed the sigh so often as she turned her thoughts toward her deserted father and his family  she cheared herself by reflecting that if ever she should qualify herself so as to justify sir guise in owning her as his lawful lady all would still be well inspired by the expectation of such a reward  she applied with unwearied diligence to whatever might render her more attracting in manners and cultured in mind  her grand object in attempting the adornment of both was to deserve the honor which she believed sir guise had conferred on her and to enable him to acknowledge her with less comparative disgrace  and as the baronet sometimes found relief in her gentleness from the violence of mrs tempest and the disturbance of his thoughts on his usage to the real lady stuart  his kind treatment of her made her still lay much of his deception to his fear of losing her by a discovery of the truth and although her parents more especially her mother never uttered his name without annexing to it a curse  she acknowledged to olivia in the garden that although she too well knew she had herself acted very wrong she did not believe he was half so bad as people represented him this i must say though except we happen to meet with him at home this morning i must never hope and indeed i do not  de  desire  that is  i do not  ought to desire ever to see him more  this morning child questioned olivia what do you mean  yes madam my father and mother and my brother jerome are determined to see him and  and jerome swore on his knees  but what good can it do madam to drag me before his family and then my brother is so passionate  if indeed sir guise could be sent for to any other place but his own house  and  and  talked  to  about me or about the poor child  or if  if  i  if  i  i    here grief awhile choked her utterance  not that my father added she would suffer either of us to receive another farthing of his money he would sooner work his poor fingers to the bone nay all which jerome has in one of those great panniers are presents sent by sir guise or myself from town since i imagined alas myself and assured them i was his sacred though secret wife and my father and brother have worked night and day for these four months past  indeed ever since they knew of my disappointment  and almost starved themselves to save up the money they have received that they may throw it back to the baronet  though if any thing should happen to my brother or to my father or  or  or  to  any  body  else  i know not what would become of me would i were dead miss i am a wicked girl and have no right to live bringing the gray hairs of my poor father and mother to the grave you do not know how they are altered  they are not like the same people since they heard of my misfortune  though they have not given me one harsh word since i came home yet i cannot curse poor sir guise as they do  indeed i cannot pray forgive me miss i tried to make him love me  indeed i did  i shall never see him again so i do not speak on that account but were he as much to blame as myself i had rather die than be the death of  of  of  any  body in the world much less the father of  my  my  pray forgive me  yet i would to heaven some kindhearted person though i know i do not deserve it would try to persuade my father from going to the abbey would to heaven miss caroline stuart did but know or that i could any way get a letter to her i have one ready written  i am sure she would contrive  o miss you do not know what an angel she is  not that i ever saw her but once  but that once i shall never forget it  she almost broke my heart  one mr dennison the baronets steward whom we sometimes saw at clare place brought her unawares to my lodgings when he knew his master was gone a journey then it was that she told me if i would return home to my poor father and make my family a visit and then find some excuse to stay with them without letting any body else know of it except mr dennison she would take all the care of the child to herself nurse and provide for it as her own and that she would promise i should not only hear about its welfare but contrive now and then to let me see it by means of mr dennison and none of my family being let into the secret and that as to sir guise said the sweet young lady  except yourself miss i never saw her equal either in goodness or in beauty  it will be easy for us to manage matters with him for you know jane continued she he must at times be as grieved as yourself for the injury you are both of you doing to the most affectionate wife in the whole world  then it was i first discovered his former marriage and on authority alas i could not disbelieve she saw the agonies into which the information threw me and tried to sooth them  ah why are not all good people all virtuous ladies so mild as her when they speak to  to unhappy women sure the gentle accent would have more proselytes than the stern rebuke  what an atonement it will be  exclaimed the angel daughter of the unfortunate sir guise  what an atonement jane for the wrongs you have done my poor mother who is both in spirits and health a sufferer if you  who were so often the unknown cause though i own an unconscious one of her husbands estrangement and absence from home  should also be the secret cause of his return to her i am sure i as his child shall be bound to pray for you during my whole life and shall look upon the attentions i show this poor little thing  my child you must know was then continued the weeping jane asleep in the cradle just by me  i say i shall look upon the attention paid to your babe jenny as part of the gratitude i owe the mother for the amiable consideration shown for my own parent and indeed your merit my good girl  she called me so miss though i did not deserve it  will be much greater than mine on this occasion for you perhaps will sacrifice a strong though an improper passion to a much superior principle and i shall be but an humble instrument to reward you for so doing but your reward jenny will be much greater and administered to you by an infinitely higher power whose forgiveness of the past will be accompanied by eternal happiness in future  here miss the sweet lady took my child in her arms and kissed it several times and putting it again into the cradle said  yes and this dear little thing too shall honor its mother the first words i will teach it to lisp shall be bless my mother for all her goodness if you consent to this jenny  dennison and i will devise some means for you to have the child properly disposed of when you go into the country and it will be as true as easy for you to say you know a person who will take care of the infant till you come back  then taking my hand and again kissing my poor little one she went down with mr dennison who wept as he assured miss caroline that my infant  was like the  the  i  i  i  forget what miss  but something about its likeness to sir guise  i often thought there was a resemblance  and i am sure i could not but kiss the hand of good mr dennison for what he said about it  pray forgive me madam  but all miss stuarts intended kindness was put a stop to by a wicked woman mrs tempest  and a tempest she is by name and by nature  who ferreted me out and called me all manner of names i deserved them indeed she pulled the hair from my head by handfuls before his face she made him promise i should go away from him before she would quit the house and after repeating all the shocking names she had before made use of and cursing me several times for she swore terribly she threw herself out at the door declaring she would be the death of us both if her own soul was the forfeit unless he brought her word i had left the lodgings never to return so that you see sir guise was forced into that he did yet i thought on what his good daughter had said to me though it was no time to make him more wretched by my reproaches or speak of the fatal truths which had been told to me but i was going to send my father word if he would receive me i would return home and never see the baronet more  when my father himself and my cousin jonathan entered the room while sir guise was there they found mewith my hair dishevelled and every part of my dress in disorder which led them to suppose that sir guise who looked no less terrified than myself had been beating of me for it was just after mrs tempest had gone away but i never breathed the name either of good mr dennison or his young lady to sir guise or to mrs tempest so that they cannot come to any harm on my account  there is some comfort in that  here the tender and afflicted jane talked to the infant kissed and wept over it while olivia experienced strong emotions of grief love and admiration as well for the friend of her infancy miss stuart as for the mother and the child  chapter viii upon the return of olivia to the breakfasting parlour which was immediately after she had placed jenny more at her ease with her own family she seated herself even though her beloved henry was in the room between mr clare and sir armine and in that situation recapitulated with great fidelity  but with many comments and illustrations supplied from that rich repository her own good mind  all that had passed between her and the humble companion of her walk both the old gentlemen were much affected and experienced in their turn the sensations though perhaps in a less vivid degree which had before been felt by olivia nor were those of lady fitzorton who had a very tender disposition less animated but what shall be said of the emotions of henry especially at the passages that depicted the virtue of caroline stuart on whom olivia passed an eulogy that would not have been unworthy of henry himself  regretting at every sentence that the friendship formed between them in childhood had ever been destroyed  we must in truth leave this matter as we have done many others to the readers own imagination  if he has been or is a lover he will not be at a loss to conjecture  if he has not he may be still able faintly to judge what a young man of an ardent temper and under henrys circumstances would be likely to feel on such an occasion  be it noted also to the honor of olivia that in her recital she sunk upon her little auditory probably in consideration of henrys friendship for charles stuart as many of the indefensible parts of the baronets conduct as she could or rather she gave to truth its most candid form at this moment partington entered the room took a chair and sat thoughtfully down to let the atwoods meet the stuarts you know  said olivia addressing herself to lady fitzorton and looking at the old gentlemen  would be little short of actual madness  at least till matters are in better train and to allow them to take possession of the cottage they mentioned just at present while left to the guidance of their own resentments would be as bad suppose then  here she had a long whisper with her father at the end of which she sprung up and running to henry asked him if he was disposed for a walk to the poor deserted manorhouse that fine morning  my father said she has given me a commission which must be executed immediately  henry was rising to attend her when partington getting up cried out hold hold you little villain i see you and your old scoundrel of a father are upon some scheme to trick me out of my vagabonds  but it will not do  i have settled the whole business they are getting ready to go with me and i have ordered your little messagecart armine to come in tow of my chaise and i had a good mind to have ordered your chaise into the bargain  and you might have done so said sir armine warmly  and my coach too  and my curricle cried olivia putting on her cloak  and all our carriages added mr clare  but then you must not cheat my poor olivia out of her share of the atwoods  she tells me the eldest daughter is to succeed the foolish young woman who is marrying off  o exclaimed olivia i cannot do without dear jane  she is the only woman in the world to replace lucy  and her child will be no hindrance and the manorhouse is really catching cold for want of company  you know my dear lady fitzorton you never let us live any where but with you at the castle  and we are ten times greater vagabonds as mr partington calls them than any of the atwoods  so do not interfere with my part of the property pray mr insufferable  be it so  you are a sad fellow though answered partington  but as that is the case my chaise and the cart will do  i have sent the caitiff true george after jerome and his dorothy as he calls her  and i will go before upon one of your horses  not your madcap bucephalus though henry you have taught him some of your poetical flights  ods pranks the highmettled rascal would throw apollo  one would think he was making pindarics while mere mortal man was upon his back  no no jamess evengoing pad for me  order white surry for the field tomorrow quoth henry sportingly  but whither demanded lady fitzorton  are you going to carry the good folks  to where all vagabonds ought to be carried  to a place of safety  so dont ask any more questions  look to the hussy and her brat who are to go into your custody  but shall we not  resumed lady fitzorton  see them again before they go i have not seen any but the eldest daughter and her infant yet  no answered partington  no leavetakings the people are sick and sorry  and as to gratitude and all that time enough to settle these matters when our work is done we are officers of justice you know and of course are responsible for our prisoners  meantime it is easy to suppose the men and boys have made their bows and the women and girls dropped their curtsies i hate blushing and blubbering  so good bye to you  i hear the carriages wheeling round  aye and there i see steps on steady  your youngest villain armine is leading him  i shall have the vagabonds come whimpering if i do not stop them  not a step therefore on your lives you scoundrels till we have got through the park  but promise me  said olivia following partington to the door  you will leave my property i ought to go and settle that matter myself  settle nonsense cried partington  i will tell the girl she and her child are to be put into prison by you instead of me  oh but another thing said olivia  i would not have you go to the abbey nor within sight of it for the world  you know not what may be the consequence  gracious  mr partington you are the best man in the world  almost  but  but  are so precipitate  so    did you ever hear such a saucy vexatious talkative prittleprattle insolent insufferable scoundrel since you were born cried partington taking her hand and kissing it  why you little impertinent villain do you pretend to instruct an old rascal like me where i am to go and what i am to do  do i ask how you intend to dispose of your share of the ragamuffins  whether strangling shooting or only whipping is to be their portion  as to the abbey do you suppose i will carry such a set of abominables before the worthy gentleman  here he took off his hat and bowed respectfully  who has been so kind to them till they are in a proper condition to bring him to the gibbet  but you have kept me talking here while i could have got with my whole crew almost halfway to my journeys end  so ask no questions  stay all of you in this room without ringing the bell twenty minutes by olivias watch  and so god mend you all  saying this he opened the door and meeting henry he thrust him into the room also crying out god mend you too you scoundrel  then locking the door gave the key to one of the servants here sirrah if you let them out before the expiration of twenty minutes by the click of that pendulum opposite to which i now station you  pointing to the castle clock  i will anatomize you  nay more i will have an hole dug chin deep in the very spot where i now place you  and turning you into a sundial with a brass plate nailed to your head make you learn to keep time for the rest of your life  stay here comes george  you are released sirrah  this rascal will serve my purpose better  here mr scoundrel said partington  twenty minutes to a moment keep this key  then open that door  and have an eye to the windows too but as i know you to be a thoroughpaced villain and therefore to be depended on  you may move about a little just to stretch your legs  partington mounted steady after a short conference with jerome and his mule who now came up  packed the atwoods into the carriages  and george took his station  chapter ix the clares and fitzortons had too sincere a veneration for the virtues of this excellent man not to let him conduct them in his own way  sir armine and lady fitzorton could not however but smile at the conceit of their own castle being converted into a jail and one of their own servants into the jailor  and they were puzzling themselves to know in whose custody they were placed when a voice which they knew to be that of true george addressed them through the keyhole  pray my ladies and gentlemen dont be angry  i hope you will be pleased to be shut up for as long a time as mr partington has ordered  not that i mind being natomised a pins point  but says he you are a scoundrel of honor george  this was in a whisper  shaking my hand at the same time  your worship knows his way  so i am sorry i cannot let you out my ladies and gentlemen but i know if i did he would never call me a scoundrel again  though mayhap i should be more of a scoundrel then than i am now  the time will soon be gone fourteen minutes and almost a half now  they say time has wings but i think i never knew him creep so slow in my life  i wish i could tell you any pretty story or sing a good song or do any thing to keep your honors in spirits while you are my prisoners as for that had your honors been confined in a dark room you would have been better off than poor me or mr partington either  for there was such kissing and crying with the old folks on leaving jenny and her child behind  and jenny i believe is hardly out of her fits yet  in fits answered olivia  let me out this instant  no  run and tell her  i will be with her in  a  very few minutes  i cannot go to tell her miss though i had rather be in fits myself than she  yet i may not budge till my time is out  among the other good qualities of george he had one well worthy the adoption of all his partycolored brethren  to wit that simple but rare property of doing what he was ordered  but here she comes with the child in her arms and the tears all about her pretty face  now i can tell her miss  nay for that matter in about another minute and three quarters you may tell her yourself  here he entered into a short conversation with jane  looking alternately at her and at his watch  then he exclaimed  huzza  huzza  the times out the times out  and he vaulted in the air as if he himself had gained his freedom after years of slavery  he unlocked the door entered the room and entreated their honors pardon on receiving which he went comforted away  olivia hasted to her charge  henry was about to take his share in the business when his father requested him to stop a few moments as he had something to communicate to which the presence of his mother and their mutual friend mr clare could be no objection  being indeed parties concerned no added he recollecting himself  it will do rather better tomorrow morning  i forgot a few points which i have to adjust previously with you my dear clare  tomorrow morning then henry we will have our conference the result of which i trust will be as perfect happiness to you as can be expected in a world like this  henry stood irresolute whether to speak or not  and while he was balancing olivia came back light as the gossamer and said to him in undeniable accents  now then for our walk to the manorhouse  and jenny atwood will be of our party the air will do her good  and besides she will be wanted  or if she should be fatigued my good papa has commanded me to take the coach going and coming if necessary  and why should not dear jane and you and i henry have an airing this morning as well as the rest of the atwoods and mr partington  we will be back by dinnertime sir  added she to her father  and then distributing to the rest of the family her little caresses with a grace perfectly her own as she always did before she went out  she took her henrys arm and as jenny atwood modestly declined the carriage they all three walked through the park of fitzorton and to the manorhouse of clare  chapter x this little excursion was productive of an event which had well nigh brought about that very explanation which henry had so long desired yet dreaded should take place  olivia had at this first setting out arranged jane atwood between henry and herself  each insisting upon taking an arm but soon after olivia made a little alteration by putting herself in jennys place declaring that she was resolved to have the charge all to herself whether this was the whole or only in part the reason for the change it is impossible for us to say but it was that which she thought fit to assign and there was no time to dispute it for just as the trio had gained an eminence in mr clares park jenny was led by curiosity or some other motive to ask whether the fine seat to the right did not belong to  to  to    perceiving her faulter olivia relieved her by saying yes that is the abbey but we shall have a better view of it presently  yet the manorhouse will be quite jealous if you give the preference jane to the abbey  henry suppressed a sigh as he directed his view to the latter  and i suppose then that forest resumed jane with increased emotion is  is  is  the one i have heard  so  so much about  you are right answered olivia those are the abbey woods  but i would have you to know our dear little groves and shrubberies will supply you with more fragrant flowers and enchanting walks  do not you think so henry  jane appearing faint olivia proposed resting a few minutes in one of the small alcoves hither they repaired  jenny and henry sat on the same bench  perhaps by accident or out of respect to olivia for they left to her one which commanded an extensive prospect whereas theirs had nothing to recommend it but an indistinct view of the abbey and a skirt of its forest  olivia did not profit by this mark of their politeness rather preferring a seat on the same bench  and no doubt by a like chance or compliment thinking she had sufficiently asserted her claims placed herself by the side of henry  almost in the next instant her attention was drawn to some pencillings on the opposite panel of the wainscot  she rose to read them  henry impelled by a sudden recollection caught her gown and gently drawing her toward him she again sat down without in the least suspecting there was any other motive in the mind of henry than that which to her own was the most delightful  the sweet thought of henry  and she would have left the alcove without perhaps thinking of her former intention had not jane atwood as she was going out exclaimed good heaven here are the names of that angel miss caroline and lady stuart and  and   had olivia permitted her to stay another moment in the alcove she would have discovered the rest but that amiable girl believing she could not get her away too soon hurried out protesting they should not have time to settle their business and be back by dinner  she took however the first opportunity when they had got into a path which did not admit their all walking together to assure henry she was doubly indebted to him for his considerate goodness in preventing her from running on to perhaps fatal discoveries  generous henry you feared jenny who finds alas but too many occasions to speak of sir guise would have been led by seeing the names of his fair daughter and deceased wife into a train of thought that it is not for her peace she should indulge  but i wonder we have never observed these names before  indeed it has not been the manorhouse summer this year  the castle has made us truants from this our other home i do not think continued olivia availing herself of being behind henry in this narrow pathway and jennys walking before the grass on the opposite side being left for mowing and almost ready for the scythe  i do not think any of the family has been in that alcove since july was twelvemonth when you remember we all dined and passed the day there i do not remember any penciling then and it is odd enough how the names of the stuarts should be there as none of them except charles would be likely even to come upon our grounds since our unfortunate quarrel you know  is it not strange henry but hush said she  do not answer me now dear jane will think we neglect her  stop let me pass you and join her  but do not loiter behind  saying this she bounded beside him at a place where the grass happened to be scanty  and like camilla seemed scarcely to bend the blade  thus did henry escape a discovery of an imprudence which the excess of disappointed love alone could excuse  for had olivia put her first design into execution or jane continued to go on the following verses would have been found pencilled in a smaller character immediately under the names of caroline lady stuart sir guise and henry  o potent love that thy true sighs could reconcile antipathies ah then thy rosy bands should join henry and faithful caroline then too their long contending sires warmed by thy soulcementing fires to thy pure shrine should incense bear and parents aid their childrens prayer ah try then love thy potent sighs to reconcile antipathies this effusion escaped henry in one of his tender migrations  for there was scarce a spot on any one of the estates which had not received some memorial of his disappointed passion  and in not a few places his muse had been called upon to celebrate the fair object of his afflicted heart  except in those exigencies when he was really too much distracted by his passion for caroline to indulge his passion for poetry or even to know that the fictions of poetry had a place in his heart  so entirely was it at those times rapt by the realities of love happening to be one day sitting in the alcove which we have just left when he was far from happy yet as far from being hopeless  the precise state of mind perhaps which admits a poetic description of real feelings his thoughts took that turn in prose which he afterward versified in the manner we have seen the warmbreathed prayer for the moment soothed the woe but how he suffered such a telltale evidence in which his hand appeared against his heart to remain we know not  certain however it is that a future hazard from the same cause was put at defiance for the verses were rubbed out so effectually the same evening that not a trace was left for the searching eye either of curiosity or jealousy  chapter xi as henry and his fair companions were ascending the flight of steps which led to the front of the manorhouse olivia observed that two persons on horseback were near the paddock which was at the distance only of a few paces from the back of the mansion  olivia with jenny ran to the edge of the steps to see and henry followed as the persons on horseback were passing the great gate  the ironwork adjoining to which ran the full length of the house and courtyard  jenny cried out oh heaven there is my guardian angel herself  there is miss stuart  i should know her from a thousand  that is she madam  the beautiful lady on horseback  and the person with her is good mr dennison  i must indeed i must go and pay them my humble respects  she was down the steps and round to the iron railing in a moment exclaiming at every step heaven bless your ladyship  god preserve you miss caroline and you too mr dennison  they were returning from their morning ride round the parks by the public road which encircled the three estates  olivia hearing the name of caroline impelled by the recollected fondness of infant days and by veneration to see a lady for whose virtues she bore such respect ran with no less speed  and henry agitated by a thousand emotions rather flew than ran to behold the cause of all his bliss and all his anguish caroline having stopped her horse on the first hearing of jennys ejaculations recognized the person who had uttered them but had scarcely time to exclaim whom do i behold  is it possible  can it be jenny atwood  before the sight of henry and olivia put all her ideas to flight dear associate of our blooming hours said olivia  has chance at last permitted me again to offer personally to your virtues that tribute which henry fitzorton has a thousand times heard me pay you  and which my secret heart had mingled with my constant prayers for the choicest blessings of heaven upon the good  caroline was about to reply but was so visibly affected by the emotions of admiration and astonishment excited by the unexpected sight of perhaps the three persons upon earth most calculated to raise those emotions  and possibly by some other not undelightful reflections  that she could not utter a word and with great difficulty kept her seat on the horse and when dennison reminded her that sir guise must be within a very short distance as he heard the gate shut which belonged to the cottage where they had left him conversing with the labourer  and as the sudden sight of jane might occasion some disturbance the good old man recommended a separation of the parties for the present  gracious heaven exclaimed both the ladies as if inspired by the same wish and vexed at the same disappointment  how cruel  i have ten thousand things to say cried caroline  and i a million observed olivia  sir guise stuart coming did you say questioned the trembling jane atwood  o how long my heart has ached for this meeting but you shall hear all from our dear henry said olivia to caroline  and i hope some favorable moment will arrive when  but at present this deserving object of your attention might make it perhaps    i hear the sound of the horses feet cried caroline  barbarous fortune  ride on for goodness sake miss exclaimed the alternately flushed and pallid dennison guiding her horse from the railing again into the road  jenny atwood get out of sight i charge you  my master is just behind then beckoning henry toward him the old man whispered  joyful news dear young squire joyful news you will hear it soon  but master must not see jenny  we shall be in a peck of trouble again if he does  joyful news joyful news  the rapidity with which all the parties conversed and separated and the characteristic actions and looks of each person were such as to exceed our powers of description dennison and caroline were soon out of sight for when they had past the iron rails the interposing trees and thickening hedgerows shut them from the view henry and olivia though scarcely able to support their own emotions were engaged in carrying rather than leading poor jane atwood into the house  where they were no sooner arrived than the hapless victim of love and conscience almost fell on her knees burning at the same instant with her blushes as she implored permission to be taken where she might just have a glance one glance at sir guise without being herself seen  promising that it should be the last request she would ever dare to make concerning him  and oh pray pray consider whatever be his faults he is the father of  then seeing olivia give a half assenting half denying look betwixt compassion and reluctance as she raised her up  the hapless girl followed to a chamber in the second story without seeming to want any of the strength or life which had before left her  and running to the window that looked into the road she clasped her hands together crying there  there  there is  there is  the father alas of my poor  poor  dishonored   and without finishing the sentence fell senseless upon the floor lost to the view of what she had so earnestly supplicated  it was not easy to recover her for when she had any return of life and reason her quick sensibility of shame for the confusion she had caused and the weakness she had betrayed produced such terrifying relapses that had not true george been dispatched to the manorhouse to say dinner waited and gone back with his usual speed seeing the posture of affairs and asking no questions but taking it for granted the coach with which he soon returned would be necessary  it is not probable they would have regained the castle that day  when olivia and henry had leisure to separate the reflections which the foregoing scenes had crowded upon them a new light was thrown over many old subjects  first it appeared very clear to them both as it afterward did to the whole family that such was the dominion sir guise stuart had still over the affections of jane atwood it would be highly improper and indeed impossible to place her at the manorhouse or any where else in the neighborhood of the abbey secondly olivia was struck with the increased personal beauty and graceful manners of caroline set off as they were by an ineffable kind of smile which seemed to open upon the person addressed the warmest and most brilliant rays of her heart and understanding  indeed she saw caroline also under the influence of unusually happy feelings proceeding from the joyful news that dennison hinted at she therefore gently reproached henry for not having done her justice  she doubted whether even his candid mind had not suffered the insults received from the father in some small degree to create a prejudice against the daughter  but this idea was done away on her reconsidering the matter for said she with the most unsuspicious simplicity if this were the case it would have operated equally and perhaps more so to the disadvantage of the son  she then tried to account for the matter in many other ways and it ended in her reasoning as usual to her henrys credit she told her own heart  and the intelligence communicated to her cheeks a suffusion of that beautiful bloom which is produced by conscious pleasure  she told her own heart that the tender partiality which henry entertained for herself made him blind to much greater perfections in every other woman  this settled the point to that hearts content and he was again honorably acquitted as to prejudice but found guilty sweetly guilty of injustice  yet love pardoned him even that offense for in truth said she injustice to caroline is love to olivia  it is at any rate very certain that amongst all her ways of investigating this want of rhapsody in henry on a subject whereon she thought its whole scope would have been warranted  she never once hit upon the only cause to which it might have been attributed and to which a thousand other young ladies would most likely have assigned it  reader whatever be thy sex in the degree that thou art armed with knowledge of the world  or art arrayed only in that natural innocence which has no suspicions or concealments and which may long be the amiable victim of its credulity without at all supposing it is so  thou will pronounce upon this part of olivias conduct and character if thou have the worlds wisdom about thee thou will condemn her as a silly girl wanting penetration where the most stupid are said to be sharp sighted  but if thou art endowed with that unsuspecting quality we have mentioned proceeding from unpractised innocence thou will love her for possessing that which were thou united to congenial virtue would make thy home a paradise and thy partner such as the old poet has described where he observes thou might lay thy sleeping life within her arms but whether thou believe such excellence for natural or not we can only reassure thee such was the excellence of olivia clare  and if thou art a man the worst we wish thee is that thou may be convinced of its possibility by marking such another woman for thine own  chapter xii in the progress of the evening after these occurrences jenny by the tender assiduities of olivia became much more composed though at the first sight of her own little one she burst into a flood of tears amidst which she told the infant she had encountered her namesake  she tried to impart to it a share of her own emotions  and concluded by asking the poor babe  as if it were of an age to feel and reason on its misfortune whether it would be possible for sir guise to look upon that innocent face without kissing loving and affording it some protection  but the greatest difficulty for the historian of these pages is to enter into or explain the result of henrys sentiments and feelings on the various incidents of this eventful day every hour of which as indeed of several preceding ones had gradually wrought him to a tension of thought and sensation almost too oppressive and tumultuous for his reason to sustain  every time he beheld olivia he witnessed not only her particular attachment to himself but the general excellence of her character  he saw all that is most graceful and most worthy uniting in her disposition  he perceived that she was so guarded by the ingenuousness of her own heart  it would have required none of the refined arts of a hypocrite to deceive her in whatever most concerned her peace even for her whole life together  he observed that her faith was so entire in him that as he never did and indeed never had opportunity to intimate her affection was not returned  it is doubtful whether any thing but the strongest confirmation of positive proofs could have persuaded her to believe it for his deepest mysteries she had an explanation supplied by her love and satisfactory to her reason  and for his very languors  we will not use so chilling a word as coldness  it was perhaps not possible to his nature  for his languors her own delicacy suggested an apology or rather a vindication her warm encomiums on his caroline evinced the superiority of her soul to that petty jealousy which too often takes alarm at the charms of another woman  and her behavior to the poor atwoods more especially to the dishonored jane notwithstanding her trespass in a point which few females can pardon in each other under any circumstances no not even where their conscience tells them for the most selfish reasons they ought to have a degree of fellow feeling  was a fresh instance amongst innumerable others of her liberal and forgiving spirit  placing her conspicuously on the list of the truly good though not on the catalogue of those whom mr addison has emphatically called the outrageously virtuous  these considerations reinforced by those which as auxiliaries he placed before his eyes  the family arguments in her favor such as a similarity of religion  the ardent hopes of both their parents  the reward which so much constancy such unwearied tenderness and goodness claimed from him  with the sad reverse in case of his remaining insensible or undecided  such as a religious dispute the most of all human contentions to be dreaded whether in families or in states  the misery perhaps the death of olivias father and of his own parents  the despair perhaps the distraction of olivia herself should she discover not only that she had not been the object beloved but that he had all along loved another  these reflections we say with the impressions left on his mind by the keen observations and cautionary hints of his brother john had at intervals since he returned from the funeral of lady stuart almost reconciled him to the idea of surrendering up his love as a sacrifice to his friendship gratitude and filial duty  and how powerfully these three advocates can plead their cause in a heart like that of henry fitzorton those who are acquainted with their eloquence alone can tell  at times he even pleased himself with the proud triumph he supposed he should feel on such a sacrifice and thought for a moment the felicity of many ought to outweigh in a generous mind all considerations for the happiness of one  to encourage him in these sentiments he now paid more than his wonted attention to the words and actions of olivia  expatiated on her various attractions personal and mental  talked to others and to himself about her and absolutely set himself seriously down to the task of trying to ripen his affectionate friendship for her into love  at least such a degree of it as would guard her from his own wandering feelings should they join their hands  the natural effect of all which was that although he did not make olivia more in love with him because that was impossible he riveted the affection she sincerely felt for him in a manner that death alone and that her own death could break the chain for she had been heard to declare and truth guarded while it graced her lips that henrys descending first to the grave could not impair her attachment since i am convinced said she weeping at there being a human possibility that he might die first  the memory of him would be infinitely more dear to me than the life of any other man be his professions or pretensions what they might but alas the very attentions which we have observed henry had imposed himself were imposed as a task and  like other forced formalities and coercive lessons which must be learned  turned the whole into a reluctant but necessary toil  hic labor hoc opus est was its motto which in the end made him recede from the point he thereby proposed to gain in the very proportion that olivia whose tenderness was prepared to receive every the least impression and expression of his  and whose own tenderness was her hearts spontaneous joy  advanced toward it  and indeed those efforts in favor of olivia were always made by henry after several days absence from caroline but the bare mention of the name of the latter the sight of her miniature which the reader certainly recollects he was in possession of and to which though it be not here written down we trust the said reader has represented the too faithful lover as frequently paying his secret devotion  or even the most trivial circumstance that had allusion to caroline would in a single moment level with the dust the labored fortification he had built in his fancy for the reception and defense of olivia  and when he supposed his partiality to that lastmentioned amiable girl was greater than it used to be after he had heard her launch forth into eulogies on the person manners voice or recorded deeds of caroline it was then most demonstrable that his esteem was the greater for the one because she had then done most justice to the other  in fact because olivia his friend had offered homage to caroline his love  and thus did the former become the victim of her own unsuspicious generosity  chapter xiii after this explanation it will not be matter of surprise to the reader that though henry neither spoke nor was spoken to in the momentary interview he had with caroline at the manorhouse  the sight of her and perhaps another look of which he only knew the sense and sentiment  for lovers alone can translate with accuracy the silent language of love  the most recent cordial poured into his heart by honest dennison in those brief but potent sounds of joyful news at home young squire  these were more than enough to make him forget the little he had learnt from contemplating the virtues of his fair inmate  and convinced him that his heart was neither a convert to olivia nor an apostate to caroline  while yet in this disposition the hour appointed for his interview with his father approached and he determined it should also be the hour of his long smothered confidence  but what was his surprise what his disappointment when betwixt the time of true georges coming into his apartment to announce his fathers being prepared to receive him in his chamber and his ascending the stairs to obey that summons his mother hastened in much disorder to say the interview must be postponed as a sudden return of his poor fathers complaint made it impossible to speak on any subject in which his feelings were interested but that if he found himself not sufficiently recovered in a day or two he would depute her to communicate his sentiments which i am sorry to say my dear henry added she are of a nature not to brook delay  and i am not without my fears that something he has just heard respecting you henry has been the chief means of bringing on a fit of the illness to which you know he is unfortunately subject  the trembling henry after expressing the most sincere sorrow for his fathers sudden attack earnestly entreated to know how he had been the unhappy cause  i have received your fathers strong injunctions replied lady fitzorton not to breathe the subject either to you or to any of the family till farther notice and must now return to his chamber for alas sir armine is all this time in extreme pain turning round however as she was going out at the door and looking steadfastly  henry said she if the intelligence which has reached us be true your own conscience will point it out and if happily it be false the same bosom instructor will acquit you and leave on your mind no other regret than that your father must suffer from the misconception till it can be done away  in either case added his mother the report we trust in god has reached only to your father and myself  heaven forbid that it should have extended farther  henrys bosom instructor told all and more than all perhaps of the tale to which his mother alluded  it did not hesitate a moment to suggest to him that the fatal secret of his heart was beginning to circulate he still suspected it had come to the ears of john and he did not at all doubt but it was now rapidly making its progress through the castle  the first wish of his soul we have seen was that this might be the case but all the feelings of gratitude of delicacy of duty and as it will speedily appear of interest  made him desire the discovery should be attended by those preparatory explanations which if they could not exculpate might qualify his conduct  indeed he began now to suspect that the secret was already more spread than he had before supposed though it was plain from olivias whole demeanor that it had not yet been communicated to her  and this reader seems to be the place at which we must speak to thee again though not perhaps for the last time in the character of recorder of these annals  we are not to learn that a printed book is a very perilous and in some sort an assuming undertaking and that the wit and wisdom of a reader are upon guard and in arms like jealous sentinels to espy the weakness vanity negligence and ignorance of the man who comes forward as an entertainer or instructor of the public  some of these errors are of course obvious and it is extremely probable that thy acumen has enabled thee to detect many many more not generally apparent and in good time thy faultfinding powers may assist thee in discovering others but as we would not perversely maliciously or wittingly leave any of the stumbling blocks in thy way we will at all times do our best to remove them as well for thy ease as our own for it is as sorry a thing in books as in life  and we hold it alike villainous  to put people whether writing or talking to them out of temper when it is in any possible way to be prevented  now it may happen that before thou have gained this stage of our history we have put thee a little out of humor by a seeming violation of probability it may have offended thy critical talents that we should have as it may seem to thee maliciously contrived to lock this family secret in our henrys breast although such a number of keys not only in his own house but in the neighborhood were ready to open it perhaps thou have long since exclaimed go to  can it be supposed an impetuous youth should pay his court to a lady in the neighborhood to the daughter of his fathers bitterest enemy for so long a period undiscovered that many of the servants of her family and of his that a brother of each house and now perhaps of both notwithstanding all the private and public tumults  can it be supposed that this matter should be any secret to half the surrounding parishes and was there not to be found one officious enemy or goodnatured friend or idle gossip who on the swift wing of folly or curiosity or the yet more rapid one of malice would have even panted to carry the tidings to the only two persons most interested in its truth or falsehood namely olivia and her father or was the neighborhood of fitzortoncastle the only spot in the whole world where no such friend enemy or gossip in petticoats or in breeches resided  in reply to such interrogations it behoved us to search somewhat deeply not only into henrys secret but into the secrets of human nature and having so done we firmly believe that our knowledge in these hidden mysteries  reverentially and not vauntingly be it spoken  will clear up to our readers entire satisfaction whatever talents he may have for discontent all that remains to be discovered on this at present questionable subject  and that in a way that may justify us in keeping olivia and her father out of henry fitzortons secret should it be necessary a great while longer  at present it may be sufficient to remind the reader that if he looks into the history of life he will find that the persons most interested in any family secret are generally the last of that family to whom it is imparted  chapter xiv no wonder therefore that olivia and her father were in the castle the last and the only persons who heard the secret that so nearly related to themselves  for although lovetales being amongst the most light are the most easy of carriage  yet it may very possibly happen that even the strong temptation which naturally arises out of a strict inhibition to do the very thing forbidden may in some minds be contrasted by a yet stronger desire to resist  and this was the exact case at present  that stronger desire was the sincere love which was entertained for olivia by every part of the family even the gossiping part of it in the servants hall would sacrifice the delight of doing what was commanded not to be done to the superior pleasure of saying and doing every thing that could keep her from the knowledge of whatever might give her pain and as to sir armine and his lady there were other obvious reasons why the intelligence that might reach them would be withheld from mr clare and his daughter  now in regard to caroline stuart though the same motives would operate the same way toward concealing from her the secret of olivia and henry  for olivia could not be more the object of domestic good will amongst the servants  it was in her case less necessary to act upon those motives for sir guise scarcely ever had a guest at home since his disgrace but henry and father arthur and there was not the smallest intercourse between the kitchens of the two houses from whence most of the materials for secret history are collected  and she really had no opportunity of knowing nor did she hear any thing that related to the fitzortons since the separating quarrel save what henry and her brother charles chose to communicate  and whether those unhappy friends were likely to tell caroline as matters now stood the reader may by this time well judge  henry fitzortons illfated passion therefore yet remained to be told to those at the castle who were the most deeply interested in its effects  yet in the proportion that he imagined it known to others he panted for its being communicated even where he most trembled to confide it and in the perplexity which his long suppression produced he began to wish that it were unravelled by any means rather than it should not be unravelled  and the more especially since the mystery of his love was not the only one that oppressed his heart  sometimes he determined to write sometimes to speak the whole story to olivia and throw himself on her generosity sometimes he had thoughts of making her father first acquainted with the history whereof by parcels he has somewhat heard perhaps says he but naught distinctly  this was however rejected and all his hopes were again anchored on olivia whom he fully resolved to inform of every thing  and that the very first opportunity  on the heel of this determination olivia herself who had been giving her assistance to henrys mother to mitigate the sharp agonies which his father had been enduring came running into the room and presented a letter to henry  saying as she delivered it  i hope it will prove a cordial to your spirts which i know your fathers sickness must depress  it comes from the abbey  and who knows but our good stars may be working together so far for our good that sir guise may permit his angel of a daughter to be upon the same terms at the castle as are enjoyed by his son charles  for know my henry i am a great dreamer and i have had a sort of vision about this  i see it is a ladys hand  i would lay any thing we shall find that our caroline is the writer  but even if it should be so and my dream should come true we must keep it to ourselves and not say a word of it to any of the family  because it will be so delightsul so have the secret between us and divulge it just at the time we have brought about a reconciliation  ah henry if you and i should after all be the means of such a happiness how comfortable will it be to all parties  for it is such a shocking thing for neighbors to bear malice for so long a time  and though perhaps we can do little good with sir guise we might put up with a great deal from him to be in friendship with miss stuart  do then read the letter and tell me what it says  that is if it goes at all to my last nights dream  henry who know at the first glance that the letter was directed at least by caroline had been trying by every means in his power to conceal his agitation  when a servant came to desire olivias immediate attendance upon lady fitzorton she had scarcely left the room when the trembling and impatient henry opened the billet which contained these words scarcely can i hold my pen  such is the satisfaction of my heart to inform you i write by the command of my father to invite you to the abbey where we may enter into the particulars of the extraordinary but endearing and renovating encounter of yesterday morning  an encounter which presented to my view three persons i had long most anxiously desired again to behold  jane atwood my lovely playmate olivia and henry fitzorton  do not write any thing in reply to this hasty billet part of which is confidential  but come yourself tomorrow noon the time appointed by my father to receive you you will imagine how i rejoice in a reconciliation betwixt my father and my brothers dearest friend  ah henry guess the emotions of caroline stuart  he had just finished the perusal when true george came hastily into the apartment presenting another letter  just brought by the post your honor and i came with it as quick as i could because i believe it is from squire stuart the lieutenant and i thought it might bring your honor good news  honest george was partly right in his conjecture  it brought tidings at once of the most pleasing and painful nature  charles acquainted his friend  that he would listen to no terms of accommodation with his father unless the restoration of henry at the abbey was made the preliminary condition of the treaty observing to his father that  he had plainly discovered the strange conduct of caroline had originated in her fathers cruel commands  then followed these expressions  if you ever sir hope to see the face of the son whose heart you have almost broken  reinvite my injured friend to your house where i have my good colonels leave to give him the meeting and shall hope to be at the abbey almost as soon as this letter and in a full confidence of your treating my friend as he deserves  i am your dutiful charles stuart  go then my dearest henry hasten to reassume your privileges  so the letter went on  it is but returning to a happiness i owe to you in kind  ah i owe to you far more than i can ever pay till my sister is your own  but pardon the vanity of my affection if i consider her hand as a recompense in full even for all your pain for all your goodness  even for the last  the commission  and yet that disinterested office is so  but i accept it  from you  yes i accept it with tears  of joy your brother john too noble generous manly john  how shall i ever settle the account with him  you know not the prosessional service he too has done me my colonel i find and your military brother have been in correspondence for my honor  the former swore and by a heros oath the god of war  it would be sinful to conceal it from me though our glorious john had enjoined it yet as i did not promise it is no breach of trust you know and it is fit a man should know his real friend  i have no second caroline my henry to offer john  indeed i know but one more such woman in the world  oh if caroline could call her sister  but it is madness to think that way yet such an alliance would bind up all our wounds it can never be  those wounds must flow though the lifeblood of charles mingles in the stream had the heart of my friend been captive to my olivia  pardon me for the weakness of calling her what she will never be  i think my own would have been guarded from captivity  or reflections on the prior claims of my dearest henry would have made me look upon his choice with the eyes i look upon my sister or as you yourself henry look upon olivia  or if a tender idea had at any time obtruded i would then have expelled it as a traitor encroaching on the rights of sacred friendship and mutual love  but as i know your heart is anothers  as i know the love is not reciprocal and as i feel she is dearer to me than the breath i now draw in deep and bitter sighs  oh how peace would return to us all henry did olivia experience that sentiment for me that she cherishes so fondly so fatally for my friend  but why do i talk of peace  alas i have never known what it is since last we parted  the loss of my mother and the little prospect of my ever being happy with the adored olivia preys upon my health and bears down my spirits  on these subjects ever dear and ever fatal to my remembrance i dare not dwell  but the only solace in this long absence which i have been capable of receiving has arisen from proving that my own evil destiny has not rendered my heart callous to the happier fate of my friend  hasten then i say to the abbey  enable me my dear friend by your presence to support that of sir guise stuart without forgetting i am his son or too keenly remembering that he is the cause why i shall never more behold the face of my dearest mother  ah how shall i look  in vain  for one of the smiling welcomes of my return how shall i feel the change  your society therefore will be even necessary to the dejected spirits of your poor charles as well as to our beloved caroline  surely some happy event will yet take place to displace the barriers which appear immovable  i speak only of those which oppose the union of my friend and sister  for myself alas a barrier stronger even than the errors of my father or the just indignation of yours opposes my every hope of happiness with olivia  even her own cold indifference to me and her hearts warmest though unrequited attachment to my friend  accursed fortune  yet by heaven i would rather unite myself to a fiend who loves me than to a seraph who could not give me the heart they talk of a war henry would it were come  selfish cruel murderous as is the wish to thousands of the human race  i cannot but exclaim would it were come  my fatal passion seems to gain such strength as to render me weak to every other tie  even to that which holds me to my species it is not without difficulty i conceal my sufferings from the excellent colonel  you droop stuart said he to me this morning taking me by the hand but with a smile of encouragement you droop my lad  i am no talker charles but do you want any thing within my compass  i do not desire to clog you with obligation i shall therefore only ask would you borrow  i have heard your father is not so liberal as his son is deserving  or is there an enemy here laying his hand on my heart got into the breastwork and in possession of this little fort  is there mutiny within  i do not however ask for love secrets and if i did you perhaps might be disobeying orders even to your colonel  cupid is greater than a generalissimo and takes command of all the armies in the world  fieldmarshal my lad of the universe  but how is this i hear you are going to give me up  your friend henry fitzorton i find has procured you an advance  i wish it had not taken you out of this regiment but  i wish so too sir said i  but  replied the colonel  it takes you to one in which that henry fitzortons brother john is captain and may one day have the command  and so as it moves you only from one friend to another i must learn to be content  the generous man shook me by the hand and walked away i shall bid adieu to him and to many of my valuable brother officers with infinite regret  and be assured amongst all my cares i am not insensible that your generous heart assisted i cannot but think by your good fathers heart should have fixed me in the regiment of john fitzorton  why henry have you interdicted the subject  but alas military and every other ambition but that which cannot be gratified is i fear dying in my bosom  an unfortunate passion alone lives there  it will consume me henry i shall grow insensible to every thing else  no surely the affection i have for my henry fitzorton will survive the general wreck and holy friendship be preserved entire amidst the ruins of charles stuart  so various were the emotions which the perusal of carolines billet and this letter occasioned that henry could scarcely read to the end love friendship pity hope fear admiration joy and sorrow took possession of him by turns and at the conclusion they all seemed to be at war in his bosom his friend charles his brother his parents olivia and caroline tyrannized at once  the empire was long divided long contended for  but love as is generally the case in such dispositions asserted its dominion looked upon all other passions as usurpers and reassumed its sovereignty on the throne of his affections  caroline stuart appeared to be fixed there too steadfastly for any usurpation to prevail  chapter xv it was in this crisis that olivia reentered the apartment eager to know the contents of carolines billet and to convey to henry the intelligence of his fathers being much better  she never omitted any communication which she supposed might obviate pain or promote pleasure  well said she with vivacity   is my dream out  does miss stuart mention any thing of our yesterdays adventure  does she honor her playmate with her remembrance  does she notice jenny atwood  and is there any chance provided our little plans succeed with all our fathers of olivia and caroline ever becoming friends invested with the privileges of charles and henry  what a cruel string of questions  each kindly conceived and sweetly delivered  henry was however collected enough to stisfy her who attributed all the emotions of his ardent love to sentiments of glowing friendship  and she entered into the reconciliation of the families in general and the longdesired intercourse of caroline and olivia in particular  only in a less degree and on a much more disinterested principle than himself  miss stuart said henry  is so earnest to hear more of jane and to pour forth the tribute of praise to olivia that she has even persuaded sir guise to give me an invitation to the abbey where i have not been you know since the funeral of lady stuart  and caroline has written in the most impatient terms to acquaint me with her fathers acquiescence  here henry pretended to rummage his pockets for the billet itself and expressed some surprise what could possibly have become of it  though we are afraid there was very little reason for surprise  the said billet being probably not only in his pocket but often in his hand during the affected search  and no doubt he could have produced it with nearly the same degree of difficulty as the taking the hand which held it out of the aforesaid pocket  but henry simulated you see reader  this letter having again thrown out the explanatory bill he predetermined to withhold the billet and was accordingly inspired with a due degree of wonder what could have become of it  never stand looking for the letter observed olivia who appeared always fated to help him out of his embarrassments unconscious that she was thereby plunging deeper into her own  never stand looking for the letter  for heavens sake go to the abbey directly  i have heard you say sir guise is a passionate capricious creature and has his starts of rage and reconciliation and who knows how soon he may change his mind again  then we shall all be at a loss for such another opportunity  beside your good father is better and you can go with perfect ease  i need only say to him you are taking your beloved wood walk  you can go to the forest you know  and that you were quite in spirits at the thought of his mending so fast  i am sure every word of all this will be true  henry now observed that an epistle was just come also from charles  and without any of that surprise or difficulty attending the production of carolines billet he drew it from his pocket  see said he  olivia what a packet  there were one or two passages which he could wish to have read to her as descriptive of his friends passion for herself  hoping the knowledge of it might lead the way to something favorable  for although his own passion so far as it depended on caroline was now in a better train than it had been for a considerable time  he felt the situation of his faithful charles as one of the most oppressive of the many heavy drawbacks upon his newlyrevived hopes  unfolding therefore the packet to see whether it was not possible to bring out something like an explanation of two passions of which olivia had as yet no suspicion  he was hastily running his eye over the pages in order to separate the communicable sentiments from such as could not safely be read aloud  when olivia repeated her wish that he would repair to the abbey promising to hear his friends account when he returned  you provoking thing you cried olivia  i feel that i shall love the sister as well as you do the brother  and here you are so taken up with your friendship for the latter that you are losing the only opportunity which may happen this age of bringing me and the former together  upon my life i shall again suspect you have taken some unwarrantable prejudice against that sweet girl and do not love her half so well as you ought  set off this instant if you would not have me feel confirmed in this hard suspicion  olivia drew him betwixt sport and seriousness toward the door where henry exclaimed  ah olivia if you knew the condition of that excellent young man charles stuart at this moment your gentle heart would pity him  his condition answered olivia  good heaven has any thing befallen him  he is and long has been suffering all the tortures of an hopeless passion  then i pity him indeed said olivia  for i do really think were such a misfortune to have happened to me it would have broken my heart  i know myself henry so well added she  it would have killed me  and indeed the certainty of that would be my only consolation  poor charles  he is an amiable creature  he is one of the noblest young men upon earth answered henry  and would make the best woman in it the happiest  what then prevents the lady of his choice from being so  can she be insensible to the affection of such a lover  i do not believe replied henry  though it has been of some standing and they have been very often together  that she yet so much as suspects his passion  that is very strange said olivia  you ought to do all you can to assist him my dear henry  i am sure the kind youth would do the like good office by you  nay he has spoke to me of you an hundred times not in so animated a manner indeed as you deserve but very very warmly  he perceived your virtues wanted no advocate  i protest if i knew the lady i would try all the force of my little eloquence to win her heart for him  why does not his divine sister exert her powers  can any one resist her  methinks we should all confederate combat and conquer in his cause  are you not of this opinion  here was another home question asked in the utmost simplicity of olivias heart which sincerely ached for charles  henry turned round and walked away to the window  i do not wonder that you are uneasy continued olivia  but what can be the reason of the ladys indifference  is she already engaged  fatally so i fear replied henry  that is terrible answered olivia  and to a man who is himself betrothed in the most solemn manner to another cried henry  worse and worse rejoined olivia  and does that other lady return her lovers passion  entirely  and i suppose the gentlemans affection is as great  it is alas it is  i know not then what can be done for your poor friend for the case seems to have shut out all service all good offices  i do not see a single opening to promote his suit  for who you know would attempt to divide two hearts already united to make any third happy  make the case our own a moment my dear henry  we should never bear even the sight of the wicked seducer of the affections of henry and olivia for instance even though we were both perfectly convinced all his or her arts would be vain  i protest my blood runs cold at the very thought of such a monster  nevertheless the condition of the unhappy charles added olivia after a recovering pause and finding henry much disturbed  is dreadful indeed  and i am not surprised at the misery i see you are suffering on the occasion  i now clearly perceive that your sympathising heart has made this one of the strongest sources of your late alas too frequent melancholy  i cannot blame you for it it fills my own breast with grief and i weep that i cannot mitigate it  henry was extremely affected more especially as olivia now applied all that her tenderness could devise to give him comfort  and though intended to promote a very different emotion to fill up the measure of his despair on his friends subject and his own she took his hand and carrying it to her lips where it received a chaste and delicate pressure  how infinitely grateful am i to you my beloved henry she exclaimed  and how grateful ought we both to be to heaven for exempting us from those agonising trials which are and must be inseparable from hopeless love  oh that your friend could experience the felicity which is permitted you and me henry to feel at this moment with the sanction of both our dear parents upon our heads  i cannot feel my blessed state without the tears of joy gushing from the fullness of my happy heart  i see you share my sensations  long long may the sacred sympathy continue and may these drops  she wiped away the tears which were running along henrys pallid cheek  may these drops of overflowing felicity be the only ones olivias tenderness or your own shall bring from your eyes  in pity cease olivia cried henry  i can bear no more  let us separate a little while answered olivia with the most bewitching accents  compose yourself my dearest friend and then pursue your walk  the air will restore you and be sure you try to make caroline love your olivia as charles does henry when we are all friends  olivia now made an effort to rally her spirits that she might recover those of henry  when we are all friends and mixed together you i caroline and charles  we may beguile the latter of his griefs  at least our loving endeavors shall not be wanting  i insist therefore upon your setting off and i will give you as you have so great an undertaking in hand leave of absence for the whole afternoon  olivia was again leading henry out when recollecting herself she cried but stop a moment i have had something of yours in my pocket these two days  your brother john sent it me  and it is very charmingly finished indeed my father says  and so does yours  it is much more like than when you saw it before but for my part i really think it a thousand times too handsome  before olivia had finished her prefacing speech she had taken out of her pocket and unfolded a little parcel which proved to be that miniature of herself which the conflicting john had painted for henry and which was now regiven by the lovely original with a grace and at a moment which might have ensured its welcome almost from an enemy  much more from the deeply penetrated though unfortunate henry  as he received it from olivia she said tell the truth now henry  does it not flatter me greatly yet do not tell me so for i should weep if i were to think your fancy and affection could not draw as partial a likeness as any painter in the world  so take it with you and as i can not with any propriety go with you to the abbey just yet let it be my substitute  and be sure you show it to miss stuart and tell her that i send it as my representative and if it could speak it would soon make out my dream  do not forget this i charge you  so now i will go to poor jane  i declare henry i can never get from you and must run away at last  chapter xvi henry had an anxious desire to make his personal enquiries after his father but was really afraid to encounter him  under the different impressions therefore of that tender fathers displeasure  of his brother johns silence  of olivias overwhelming goodness  of charless generosity and distress  of carolines summons  and of sir guises mysterious invitation  he once more took the road that led to the abbey  at the sight of which mansion after again reading carolines billet as he past along the great avenue his heart began to resume its accustomed emotions  and as he approached within view of that little window already commemorated in this history those emotions increased  and by the time he gained the grand portico late so sternly closed upon him and now to be so wide opened by authority they totally absorbed every other consideration  to say the truth caroline herself had for some time thought it strange  perhaps taken it a little to heart  that henry had not since the evening of the funeral made an effort to visit at the abbey  she was satisfied of the great propriety of his conduct it was certainly what prudence prescribed and had he attempted to act otherwise it is probable she would have marked out the very line of behavior he ought to have pursued and declared herself much dissatisfied had he not obeyed  yet love my good reader is  as peradventure thine own heart can attest  a very inconsistent deity and can very much approve and disapprove be pleased and angry at the same time and at the same thing caroline had as lively a remembrance of the parting look she bestowed upon henry at the abbey gates on the night or rather on the morning after the funeral as if she had seen it on her countenance in a mirror  and she thought it expressed enough of gratitude and affection to hold out a future welcome and almost beckon him toward her  there was no immediate probability indeed of his meeting with any such welcome but on the contrary every likelihood of a repulse from sir guise and consequently from herself  and yet perhaps she would have been better satisfied had he hazarded this than as it appeared to her to be so over exact as wholly to estrange himself  if there seems any thing in these observations incongruous to the reader we can safely refer him to our patroness nature  from whom every word has been faithfully copied we speak here to readers in general of lovers we shall only request that they will consult the little historian in their own bosoms  henrys conduct at the funeral however  his defense of sir guise  his attention and delicate consideration at the awful ceremony which preceded the affray  wrought very powerfully in his favor with caroline and she was truly desirous of an opportunity to pay him her hearts acknowledgements  indeed such desire began to take possession of her the very hour she bade him or rather looked him an adieu and had continued increasing ever since  her transport therefore at having the power to receive him now by her fathers consent may more readily be imagined than described to imagination then we shall leave it  but notwithstanding carolines impatience we are sorry we are unable to grant them or our reader the pleasing interview till we shall have shown him the means by which that consent was obtained  for the packet of late ensign now lieutenant stuart unfolds but a part of these means  chapter xvii the reader has in perfect recollection no doubt  because it was a very materialpoint  the worthy resolution of sir guise stuart to become at least in his external behavior to his own family and even to the fitzortons an altered man  now as this could not be done without a considerable degree of address he resorted to a power whose aid and inspiration he always invoked whenever he had any great undertaking to perform  and to conceal the bitterest resentment and deadliest hate certainly came under that description this tutelary power was neither any of the demons above nor below but simply and solely that bosom friend which enabled him to effect his foulest intents more completely than if he had been in league with all the infernal deities  namely his own fraudful heart  this indeed was allsufficient as well to suggest evil thoughts as to devise the means of carrying them into execution  and in the present case it not only empowered him to conceal the hate and resentment abovementioned but to substitute in their places the fairest appearances of forgiveness and good will  in short he was a master in that great and useful science to a determined knave so finely described by shakespeare  he could smile and smile and be a villain he began to put in practice a system of this kind immediately after the funeral  as he sat at breakfast the succeeding day caroline said he  your brother having thought proper to leave us at such a time to ourselves we must comfort each other as well as we can  this is but a melancholy house at present my dear  suppose we were to leave it and walk out a little into the air  it may be of service to us both  he took her hand and they walked into the garden  meeting dennison upon their return into the house sir guise exclaimed tell the gardener to be particularly careful of those myrtles in the corner of the hothouse  they were the favorites of your poor lady  and one of them i see is drooping cried caroline  as if it mourned her loss  good dennison let this be remembered continued sir guise having said which he held his handkerchief to his face and shed as many tears as were consistent with his grief caroline had herself noticed these myrtles as she past the greenhouse and bestowed upon them many of those drops of real sympathy which might give her father the hint to counterfeit thinking that as good as any other piece of hypocrisy to advance his plan  a more perfect example of genuine and affected sorrow has rarely been seen than what the father and daughter then exhibited  dennison like caroline was touched by the novelty of this conduct  they were soon convinced it was not the start of the moment by an increase of good humor the next day and so on in succession as well to the rest of the servants as to dennison  and at length the whole kitchen pronounced their master to be bona fide a new man  prior to which charles had written but not by carolines medium such letters of reproach and menace to his father that possibly the fear of that which they threatened being put in execution might have some weight in bringing about this mavelous reformation  the baronet however without communicating the contents of the letters to caroline answered them in the most unexpected manner to the entire satisfaction of charles who thereupon wrote the letter to henry which has been communicated in a former chapter  but this was not all  the conduct of sir guise was of the most general kind and extended even to father arthur he made ample confession of the errors of the past promising as large atonement in future  and in regard to caroline he was every day proposing some little plan of consolation  gave her one of his favorite horses  and not only allowed dennison and another servant to attend her but often accompanied her himself more than once introducing the name of the fitzortons and particularly charless favorite and her own without any other allusion to old grievances than observing that it was a great pity when neighbors could not agree  there were always faults on both sides  for his part he looked upon implacable hatred as the blackest amongst the crimes inasmuch as it was the farthest removed from the relenting mercy of him who is ready to pardon all our trespasses whenever his forgiveness is piously and unaffectedly sought holding such sound doctrine as this before caroline and dennison  particularly in the presence of father arthur  he by degrees so thoroughly persuaded these and indeed the whole family that his reformation and repentance were sincere that stuart abbey now resounded the praises of the man whose vices all its echoes had before so often repeated  this happy change was attributed by all to the salutary impressions made on the good baronets conscience when he came to reflect on the fate of his lady in private discourses of this matter among themselves dennison observed it was a long lane that had no turning and that it was better late than never  recounting at the same time an history which he conceived to be in point of a poor wretch who had been in a constant habit of all manner of wickedness till he was turned of sixty and then took up all at once because his conscience would not let him sleep anights whereupon he made his peace with god and was so good a christian before he died that though he was as sinful a creature as sir guise before all the parish blessed him and went to his burial  father arthur gave the praise of this conversion where he thought it due  to the great restorer  and took more than his accustomed delight to visit at the abbey for the past week indeed he had been an inmate often wandering in the woods of stuart so well calculated to inspire and cherish meditation till the hour of repast which he would take with the family  and then devoting an evening hour to private prayer which was his invariable custom he would remain in social endearment yielding to all the felicities of his mind and constitution till bedtime  the happiness of caroline was indeed extreme  her gratitude to her father was in proportion  and had she not now and then retired to her chamber to shed a tear of regret to think that her dear mother lived not to witness and to share this blessed alteration her happiness would have been without alloy for besides the above felicity a prospect of reconciliation opened once more on the houses of fitzorton and stuart she even had the comfort of hearing and being herself permitted to mention the name of henry with due respect  her brother was made partaker of her joy  and her favorite father arthur no longer withheld his visits on the score of shunning the house of strife where he had so often found it impossible to be a peacemaker  and in so fair a train was the general happiness that on the day she encountered the party at the manorhouse gate she would assuredly have forgot she had a little secret quarrel with henry for not doing that which had he done she would have resented  and have told him the delightful tidings which she had in store for him had not the sudden appearance of jenny atwood the sight of whom might have thrown a cloud over all these agreeable prospects made it impossible for her to say or do more than has already been shown to the reader  chapter xviii the abbey door was opened to the summons of henry fitzorton by the good and trusty dennison who gave him a thousand welcomes as he entered and ensured it to him afterward in the following words which after the fashion of the speaker were delivered as he led the way to the object of henrys wishes  joyful news as i told you dear squire  the old gentleman and god be praised for it has renounced the devil and all his works he is clean and clever another thing  and he makes us all weep for joy more than he used heretofore to make us cry for grief he has made young master happy also  miss caroline is even almost aside herself  and my old wits are about to take leave of me  and for the matter of that if i thought master would be at his old tricks again in the way of relapses as they call em i had rather bid them good bye now  for if the devil should come into the old boy any more it would be worse than before your honor knows  true very true answered henry who shaking dennison heartily by the hand exclaimed in the words of othello thinking perhaps rather of his approaching interview than the old mans description of sir guise though it would well apply to both  if i were now to die my dear dennison i were now to be most happy  see what it is to be a scholar  learning is better than house or land after all quoth dennison  but here added the old man opening the door of that very apartment from which some weeks before henry had been expelled  here is that which is better and prettier than house land and learning put em all together  sir guise and caroline were both in the room and both rose to receive henry mr fitzorton said the former bowing familiarly i had promised myself you would have obeyed a ladys summons more willingly in which case i should have had more of your company  but some business calls me out  i must therefore leave caroline in the double charge of doing the honors of my welcome and her own sir guise repeating his bow went forth  we see as palpably dear reader as if we were now looking thee full in the face and through that could penetrate into the recesses of thy heart that thou art making thyself up in this place to hear some of the many sublime and beautiful sentiments which now fell from the enamoured henry and enraptured caroline and therefore though it were extremely easy for us  did we prefer fancies to facts  to fill a very honest modern volume with what they might be supposed to say  it would be the most difficult matter in the whole art of bookmaking to eke out one sentence with what for the space of several minutes they really did not say  and that for nearly as substantial a reason as ever was given viz because neither of them during that period of time spoke a single word  and upon consulting our goddess thou rememberest the deity here spoken of is nature we find it recorded in a minute of her own divine hand writing  these lovers did not for so long a space enter into discourse for two of my most powerful reasons  first because they had too many things to discourse upon to know which to begin with  and secondly because their tenderness was unspeakable  their actions however were sufficiently expressive leaving indeed other language unnecessary henry held caroline in his arms and caroline perhaps for the first time since she became sensible to the thrilling power of his magic touch did not shrink from his embrace in this situation they gazed on each other with so perfect a joy that they were deluged in a flood of those tears which at once enrich and give relief to heartfelt felicity but are deied to the excesses of woe  the transports of the first admitting of those salutary streams which freshen as they fall whilst the paroxysms of the latter are denied this balmy relief then it is that the current seems suddenly to be frozen up  the blood itself congealed  and every drop of comfort dried by despair  who may truly be said in such cases  to leave no channels for the tide of tears  having remained as we have said several minutes in this situation of indescribable ecstacy nature permitted caroline first to speak  and with a frankness that demonstrated she was superior to the little pride of giving pain when it was consistent with her sense of right to impart pleasure she assured henry that as the happiness of now telling him as far as words could tell how unutterably dear he was to her was derived from her fathers goodness she hesitated not to confess it was the only truly consolatory moment she had experienced since her mothers death  and but for that everlamented event would perhaps be the most blissful period of her whole life ah your own good and just heart my dearest henry said she will inform you what mine has often told me  that then only can it dare to avow its felicity when that felicity issanctioned by those who gave us life when she had said this her beautiful hand was presented in a way that justified her sentiment and though perhaps the doctrine wandered a little from his late practice henry warmly subscribed to the theory with his lips  giving the aforesaid hand so impassioned a kiss that the place on which he thus signed and sealed the assent sweetly blushed in confirmation  it is probable that henry would have given in at the same time some other reply suitable to the occasion had he not been prevented by caroline who anxious to satisfy her heart in the midst of its own happiness about that of others prefaced her enquiries after olivia and jenny atwood by observing that she never should quite forgive either henry or her brother charles for the niggard manner in which they had both described miss clare who said caroline is absolutely a grace  a love  a cherubim  i have thought of nothing else henry except yourself  do you know she has grown out of my recollection ah in times long past i remember we flew about our forests and her and your fathers parks like woodnymphs  but to behold her in a few years shot up into such a noble yet elegant creature  i declare i am suprised that my brother and you have not both lost your hearts  the telltale in his cheek might literally be said too often to put him out of countenance  and either obstruct or contradict the story of his tongue  and though there is a blush which denies and a blush which confesses  they are frequently confounded and mistaken even by persons who are thought to be the most skilful interpreters of silent language  the manner in which caroline construed the blush before us may be seen in what follows  even so as i live and i suppose you are rival friends  come be honest henry have i not a shrewd guess  indeed i had a suspicion before as to my brother but must confess i  i  i  yet as i said it was inevitable it was  that is  pshaw how ridiculous i am i cannot speak plain to day  but do tell me henry which is to be the happy youth the allconquering henry fitzorton doubtless  alas poor charles and alas poor caroline prithee inform me  here on viewing certain changes of color in henrys countenance her own underwent more serious alterations do i  i  i  beseech you instruct me which of you claims my  my  felicitations which my condolence  but  no  you may save yourself the trouble  i perceive who i am to congratulate you  yes  yes  you  are the happy man mr fitzorton i  i  i  give you joy  a few minutes previously to this conversation henry had in obedience to olivias wish presented with proper comments as he delivered his message that lovely girls miniature  but even this as it turned out was an addition to his misfortunes  for as caroline surveyed the wellimitated countenance her own actual visage colored to crimson  she admitted the excessive likeness the extreme beauty  she even pressed it to her lips and declared it represented an angel in beauty as in graces yet her voice faultered her eye filled with tears her lips quivered and lest it should drop from her trembling hand she laid it down  henry saw with strangely mingled emotions that the sublime caroline could fear and feel a supposed rival  henry could not but make the discovery with a proud and heartfelt consciousness that he was most dear to her whom he adored but he still found himself daily more and more entangled in the web of his perplexing destiny  even as if he had been as dark and insidious a doubledealer as sir guise stuart the difference appearing only in the motives of their conduct  but this difference indeed forms the distinction betwixt the evils of vice and the trials of virtue  while a sensation like this was oppressing him he fixed his eyes on those of caroline and exclaimed  good heaven when  when shall the unfortunate henry be understood by any body  he is understood answered caroline taking his hand and raising the back of it to her lips  and thus i solicit forgiveness for the  i hope  almost only unworthy emotions begun in sport and continued to seriousness that ever my bosom harbored  oh may they never more be its guests  how has caroline dared for a moment to express a doubt of henry fitzortons faith his oaths his honor  i see and acknowledge the justice of his reproach the accusing spirit arms his countenance  yes well may that deep indignation which overspreads his face be kindled against caroline would she had been as incapable of a base suspicion as he is of the treachery that would warrant it  and yet henry the strongest test of our affection is the weakness of our fears even when we are assured they are without a shadow of foundation but as indifference never felt those fears  nay as indeed nothing but the most unalterable love was ever guilty of this weakness if guilt it can be called  surely my henry will forgive it  perhaps he will do more than forgive should it add energy to his own affection  if it be not more unjust than vain in me to suppose it capable of addition  his pardon is perhaps the only thing which can teach me to forgive myself  alas my own anger i have ever found  what you have often told me of the selfrebuking of the noble john  is the most intolerable to bear  but this is a misery my beloved henry can never have had cause to inflict upon himself  henry caught her passionately in his arms still struggling with his emotions and caroline  feeling that the supposed crime of accusation could not be too effectually done away  entered at once into the plan of happiness which she earnestly hoped would result to both families from her fathers present favorable disposition toward them  surely my dearest henry this may be improved  our beloved charles may have his share in the accommodation  i have a whisper for you about him and the lovelier original of this lovely similitude  i will tell it you when you have entirely sealed my pardon and reconciled me to myself  should it be any way in your power i know how readily you will promote the happiness of your friend and my brother  these expressions caroline accompanied by such atoning smiles and by those little endearing attentions which are of such immeasurable magnitude in matters of affection  that had henry really been as displeased as he had been delighted and but half as much in love as the reader knows he was  he must not only have forgiven but forgotten all her offenses  and moreover circumstanced as he was at this oblivious moment he must himself be pardoned for neglecting to avail himself of so fair an opportunity to explain his family secret at least to caroline  her tenderness indeed was as balm and oil poured upon his wounds  and he had almost lost the sense of anguish in the solace of her love now as unbounded in expression as in feeling but some farther questions she put him by way of finishing the whole  and finishers in truth they were  tore open again all those wounds and made them bleed with renovated fury how  ah how my henry said she  even now my father sir guise stuart is not averse to our happiness  how is yours  how is sir armine fitzorton to be reconciled to accept of  of  of   caroline held down her head and a very different hue  the hue of fear  usurped her cheek  even now that sir guise is become fully sensible of his sons exalted merits  how will the venerable father of such a son said she be persuaded to give his honoring hand to caroline  i suppose it has been impossible for my henry even to glance at this circumstance but possibly  for i know your generous solicitude  possibly you may have employed your brother john who i am sure bears good will to charles and must adore you  or your brother james may have undertaken to sound your father on this subject  or the sweet olivia herself who has a face and figure to convert hate into love  by the bye i cannot think how you came to prefer me to that angel  it is well for me that love is blind  i say henry it may be that you have got that charming creature to speak in favor of caroline though i think it is as strange that she should not love you and that you should not love her  heigho  well how i run on yet methinks i should like to owe the greatest happiness upon earth to olivia and poor jane at wood  i blush to think my selfish heart has so long neglected her she is an old acquaintance of mine  but it is impossible to express my astonishment when i saw her with you and miss clare  though to say the truth we every one of us appeared to be planetstruck  do explain all this  caroline had hardly ended her interrogatories before dennison came to the door rather stealing in than delivering a letter which he said was brought from the castle in great haste by mr true george and that he believed it required an answer  dennison however  having like george an high veneration for the privacy of all true lovers and especially these  no sooner perceived they were in earnest discourse than he immediately withdrew saying he should answer the bell the moment their honors thought proper to ring  thou have heard of presentiments reader peradventure thou have felt them at least they may be in the little superstitions of thy secret heart  the very delivery of this letter and its coming from the castle had an inauspicious air and sound  the superscription too in sir armines hand was yet more ominous and the epistle itself alas confirmed all these mystic tokens  chapter xix let the reader go back to the state of henrys mind previous to the receipt of this epistle  and he will not wonder that the additional anxiety it produced was too vehement to be concealed from caroline  who suspecting some misfortune had happened at the castle earnestly entreated he would break the seal  he obeyed with a trepidation that denoted he knew not in whose presence he was about to commit this rash act and having read it to the end  in the progress of doing which caroline vigilantly watched the varying emotions and passions that took possession of his countenance  he rose traversed the room and stamped with a vehemence which surpassed all former displays of his known enthusiasm  it was a sudden access of insupportable phrenzy  he smote his breast earnestly supplicated pardon of caroline on his knees  then flung from her deplored he had ever seen her  and execrated his own being  my hour is at last come  long desired long sought and now it is arrived  death sudden death would be relief  mercy  blessedness  the affrighted caroline who lost all her usual presence of mind wanted power to console him  speech color motion and almost lise forsook her  the disordered soul of her lover now having ascended its tremendous climax he caught her hand and again smiting his bosom exclaimed  oh caroline ill fated caroline  the utmost malice of antipathy never equalled this constant this cruel conspiracy of love and affection to which i see it is the determination of my whole family to sacrifice the lost the agonizing henry  but you and you only can prevent it caroline  behold read from my dear inhuman father  i am bound  i am at the stake the fires are kindling around me  and my peace my happiness my heart itself will be consumed if you do not this instant devise some means to save me from being led to the hated altar  caroline took the fatal scroll and read it with such pauses and ejaculations as its contents were well formed to create  henry fitzorton esquire fitzorton castle beloved son olivia  the pride of all our hearts the ornament of both our houses and the glory of henry the sole possessor of her love  having informed me you are gone on a visit to the abbey to explain the story of jane atwood i take the earliest opportunity of my being able to hold the pen to tell you i rejoice to find by a letter from our excellent john this instant come to hand that the report is groundless which insinuated the clandestine disposal of your heart where your hand must never be given without forfeiting all claims to the affections of your family  without indeed a sacrifice of your fathers mothers all our loves  the life too of olivia and the death the annihilation of all your religious principles  john i say consoles us with an assurance that the foul report is the wicked invention of some enemy to our house  these good tidings have almost recovered me i shall be able to hold you in my aged arms on your return  and though this i trust will be within a very few hours  for i understand your friend charles is not come down  i thought it a justice i owed my beloved son to remove from his mind the idea of his fathers heavy displeasure in which his blessed mothers would of course have been included  but thank heaven we suffered only from the poisonous insinuations of some dark assassin  olivias and my dear clares peace is not we trust invaded  believe it not sir says john in his letter neither attempt to trace the infamous falsehood to its source  a life most dear to us all might be sacrificed to a worthless slanderer eject the aspersion even out of your and my mothers bosom forget it ever gained entrance there  blame almost your own credulity as i did mine severely and take henry to your arms  olivia is in my chamber while i write and seeing that some tears had got unawares into the furrows of my cheek she has been kissing them off without enquiring the cause and did she know it  or rather did she know what had been the cause of those more bitter ones i have shed upon my pillow unwitnessed  how would her sweet eyes stream in sympathy  but i told her and truly that i now wept for joy and for love of her dear henry to whom i was sending agreeable tidings  are you sir said she  then for heavens sake make haste that he may get them speedily  had i wings which could aid me to fly half as fast as my wishes he should have what you have already written and ere he had read those i would come back to carry him the remainder  henry i wish not to disparage any amiable woman whether the daughter of friend or enemy  but excepting her who gave to me the blessing of your life olivia clare surpasses all i have yet seen and i can truly say i love her as well as if she were my own blood  i do not think it will be possible to appreciate her more when she is your wife  which i hope and trust god she will be in a few days you know not how busied mr clare the too generous mr clare has been to hasten the hour of your felicity but sickness and infirmity you know my dear boy are loitering agents in the affairs of love  olivia has lost all patience at this length of letter and seems to think i never shall have done  old men are so tedious  i can see that expression written on her lovely face she has been herself to light the taper has laid some of her own wax and a seal which bears true loves motto  always the same  close to me and has many times told me your privy counselor true george is ready therefore though i could go garrulously on even till i had wearied you as i have olivia i must hasten to bless you and bid you farewell  armine fitzorton   chapter xx it is most likely henry knew not in his extreme confusion more than half the contents of this epistle so calculated to astonish perplex and terrify even caroline  the blow precluded all presence of mind and cut down all energy of character while she was reading the fateful letter the disastrous henry sat rocking himself in a chair with his hands spread over his face  caroline now perceived that she had before spoken but too prophetically  that she had been long supplanting another woman  and that woman an inmate of her lovers family  each and all of whom with the concurrence of her own father approved of the alliance  she had not for some time the power of utterance or of motion  but vainly trying to fold up and return the packet she let one of the sheets fall to the ground and begging henrys pardon attempted to pick it up  then tottering toward the nearest chair she sunk into it and remained in tearless consternation something in the way we before described her in the dying moments of her mother  and indeed an affection cherished even in the midst of the most trying circumstances for many years even till it had twisted with the fibers of her heart  might now be said to be in its last agonies  and from a wound as sudden as fatal  at length she made an effort to rise with intent to leave the apartment  henry observing her rose also and throwing himself at her feet i perceive you look upon me to be far more culpable than i am said he  and you impute to treachery the effect of dire misfortune  i call therefore as well upon your justice as your humanity to hear me  without waiting for her permission or reply he recapitulated as clearly as he was able the whole secret history of his situation with olivia  with the long train of mysteries perils and penalties that had attended it from the first moment of his discovering the family designs to the very instant of his taking leave of her at the castle he pourtrayed in the most lively colors his esteem gratitude and brotherly affection for that amiable girl  but asseverated with yet greater warmth that she never had possessed or could possess any part of that tenderness which belonged solely and exclusively to caroline  he then took a retrospective view of the insurmountable difficulties that had hitherto been placed in the way of his explanation of himself either to his own father to olivias to his brothers to olivia herself or to caroline he enumerated the sundry and manifold attempts he had made toward this to each to all  and the ways and means by which all his purposes were defeated  the forcible manner in which he painted these sad truths and the agonies he had endured from this necessary suppression  his abhorrence of all duplicity notwithstanding the appearance of having acted the part of a dissembler  the nights he had past in the forest when the castle was irksome and the abbey shut against him  brought a shower of tears from the lovely eyes of caroline  he pathetically conjured her now that his cruel condition was at length unfolded not to add to the miseries he had yet to encounter by withholding her tender advice how best to extend the discovery to the other parties concerned  her wisdom goodness and unalterable affection he declared he must now regard as the supporting pillars that were to sustain him against the anger of his parents  the resentment of mr clare and the displeasure of his brothers  all of which however he might consider as unfair and unwarranted since they had though with generous intentions ensnared him without his consent or concurrence given or implied in any manner whatever  chiefly he relied on his caroline for counsel how best to break the affair to olivia for whose peace of mind he swore he would sacrifice every consideration in the world but the honor faith and eternal happiness of his own  these said he passionately  depend on caroline  and should she persuade me to break them  but it is impossible  they find a counterpart in her own soul and she will strengthen my resolution to preserve them with the most religious care to my latest hour  and as to olivia so well do i know the goodness of her heart continued he  so many instances have i seen of her noble disposition that i am convinced  were it possible to tell her how much and long i have suffered from these continued misconceptions on what resistless antecedent claims my vows are founded and what would be the consequence of my breaking them  she would not only resign all pretensions but even be an advocate with the three families to bless and sanction the loves of henry and caroline  he then observed in conclusion  that her brother charles only shared the sorrows of his heart  and he was confident his friend would aid her to remove them  to all this caroline only said faintly i am extremely unwell you must suffer me to depart  the terrifying circumstances which you have related and which i have read shall when i am able to think be duly considered  but oh if you ever wish me to have the power of thinking again do not detain me now  she left her chair with great difficulty  in tremulous accents bade henry adieu  and quitted him in a state compared to which probably many of his former situations of mind thought at the time to be intolerable were consoling  he did not however remain long in this condition  for a gentleman entered the room soon after who came in this crisis as a comforter  being his second appearance in that character  this was no other than sir guise stuart who was extremely surprised to find him alone and equally concerned at seeing him so much out of spirits  henry hereupon notwithstanding his former illluck when he tried to gain the baronet over to his interest was now so thoroughly convinced of the sincerity of that gentlemans reform that he repeated the heads of what he had said to caroline  acquainting him with the abrupt manner in which she had gone out of the room and conjuring him by all those things which have most weight with good friends and fathers  namely honor humanity and the dread of plunging his own child and the man she loved in ruin  to use his strongest dearest influence to persuade his daughter to give him such an answer as with his own intercessions and explanations at the abbey might bring about the general satisfaction and their particular happiness  all this sir guise very kindly promised to do  and surely said the amiable baronet  if i am ready to forget my wrongs and acknowledge my share of error in the subjects that divided our families  caroline may contribute her part to the good work  as to poor miss clare that to be sure cries sir guise  is the worst part of the business and there is no foreseeing how caroline may take it  or if she could be brought to pass it over who knows but the ladys father and yours and all your family might consider it a stronger objection to an alliance with our house even than our other domestic hostilities  however depend on it nothing shall be wanting on my part consistent with my friendship and my own honor  after this sir guise stayed consoling henry for a considerable time  carolines waiting woman coming into the room to enquire whether mr fitzorton was gone  the considerate baronet said in a whisper to henry while he beckoned the servant to stop  had not you better hear her answer now henry eagerly assenting the maid was directed to say her ladys company was earnestly entreated for a few minutes  and while the girl was going on this message sir guise himself departed saying at his exit and with right dramatic effect it will be best to leave you together  i may be some check upon her  and it is necessary you know to have her own undisguised sentiments  after which in the degree that they oppose our own we may take our measures  you are too good sir guise said henry cordially taking his hand and drawing it toward his bosom  as sir guise went out he cried still dramatic and at the edge of the scene  i must away  she will surprise us  i will take a turn in the garden  there is yet half an hours light and as you certainly will not think of leaving us till after supper an opportunity may occur for your telling me what she says  hush  i hear her coming down stairs  this door however will conduct me into the garden by another way  be sure you tell me all that passes  whether it was necessary for this injunction to have been repeated or whether indeed any mention of it in the first instance was not superfluous will be shown hereafter at present our entire attention is called to caroline stuart who reentered the room almost in the same moment her father had left it  she had been in tears  her visage was pale and her limbs yet trembled  with less interruption however than she had herself apprehended she at length addressed henry  though i expected from my maids report to find my father with you i rejoice  alas why do i talk of rejoicing  it is  it is best you are alone  i know not whether what i feel at this moment henry deserves so harsh a name as womans weakness  but i am ready to confess that the tenderness which is the cause of it is almost too much for me to bear  alas the preparation of a whole life for a history like that you have told  and for supporting the event which i  i  i foresee will  must  result from it    what event cried henry catching her hand and looking as if he anticipated the most dreadful of all the evils which can happen to man  do not interrupt me resumed caroline answering his look of impetuosity and terror by one of energy that commanded his patient attention  you will not take an undue advantage henry of the tenderness i have even at a crisis like this avowed for you  ah what an hour have i past since i left you  alas this apartment seems to be marked out by our ill fortune as the spot where i am to meet varieties of wretchedness  here was my poor mother struck with that which proved her dying disorder  here was asseverated a fathers curse  here o why have i forced upon me the remembrance of these successive calamities  they unfit me to endure the present  alas it is so sudden so unexpected  it has fallen upon me in so cruel a moment  pardon me  i feel altogether unequal to the conversation i would wish to hold or the conduct i ought to pursue  this last dire blow has left me nothing but powerless tears such tears indeed fell from her eyes in overwhelming torrents  and henry instead of drying them up could only augment the torrent  relieved however at length caroline observed that the impression left on her mind by the past intelligence would be eternal  that amidst all her selfish regrets and the agonising ideas that gave them birth she had sense and honor enough to be convinced henry fitzorton and caroline stuart were now placed beyond  so far beyond the possible reach of each other that even if her father were to lay his sacred commands upon her to marry she should in this second instance of her life think herself justified in disobeying him  chapter xxi caroline paused and wept  she then recapitulated his situation  placed before him all the strong parts of his duty and her own  showed in new points of view the irresistible claims that olivia her father and both the families had upon him  she observed that though strange impediments had combined to prevent him from an earlier explication those very impediments had given force to the pretensions of olivia who never suspecting any impediments had existence had been cherishing a pure affection all the while  she gently upbraided henry for supposing that she herself would deign to become his wife under the corroding consciousness of having made any other woman who had so many superior claims unhappy  but more especially olivia clare the friend of her earliest youth  with respect to myself  cries caroline  being in the constant habit of meeting ill fortune i better know how to struggle with it in the severest shapes it can present itself  and alas the power that punishes me knows it is now about to take a form the most dreadful  perhaps  the most insupportable  carolines fortitude again forsook her and henry in the struggle betwixt the contrary emotions of hope and fear drew his chair so as to be within reach of her trembling hand which he pressed in his own  but could not speak  yes misfortune my dear unhappy henry continued the firm but faultering caroline has i hope inured my heart to bear what would probably break that of miss clare who has been bred up by every smiling power in the lap of indulgence  the pride and joy of two respectable families  and has perhaps never known any disappointment but what i have already occasioned  ah henry how would she hate your caroline  alas yours did i say  how would she contemn the cause of all the delays and mysteries which have involved her in one eternal maze did she know that caroline stuart had like her evil genius so often robbed her of henrys dear society  yet alas this transient pleasure should not be envied me  for oh what vengeance follows it indeed henry i can scarcely bear the thought  but  but  it must be borne and whatever happens to me i will endure that or any other misfortune it may be the will of providence to inflict rather than the consciousness of carrying grief distress hatred and perhaps death into the houses  into the hearts of so many persons  such an abhorred union indeed would now force even upon you henry a just opinion of my unworthiness  and ought i not to be displeased that you should believe i would take refuge in olivias mercy to me when i had not shown any to her  or that caroline bowed as she is by many griefs could be content to owe the possession of henrys hand to that bounty which would consign herself her aged father and henrys parents to wretchedness and despair  why henry should you suppose even olivia could surpass your caroline in doing what is right  added she giving dignity to her before humbling distress  when caroline has the advantage of the point of rectitude being first shown her  and had you henry carried on the concealment longer and availing yourself of my unhappy partiality made me under these circumstances your wife  something associated with the word wife fainted on her lips as she pronounced it and many moments past ere she could conclude the sentence  and had i afterward been proved the dire though innocent scourge of your family how wretched should we both have been  my disgust  perhaps my hatred even of henry fitzorton  might have been the consequence  and will it not said henry starting up with violence  will it not be far worse to give my loathing hand to olivia  and the afterproof come out that she has been the cause of all my misery and yours  and though she never can have my hate she never had my love and would then be the bane of henrys of carolines and or her own happiness  no such proof cries caroline more assuredly  need ever happen  you are too good and generous to treat any woman who sincerely loves you unkindly  and kindness from henry fitzorton will be in the place of a warmer sentiment  nay it is in him a sentiment more tender than the love of an ordinary mind  at all events it is in your power to make olivia clare the happiest of women  but caroline stuart whom you have now acquainted with your situation you could render even more wretched  there remains nothing for her but accommodation to those severe trials in which alas her whole life has been past oh i blush not though i weep to say i would not yield up the prospect which delusive hope recently spread before me on weak surmises  or let any visionary clouds that might gather to darken it prevail  no  i would embrace whatever might dispel the surrounding darkness  but cast your eyes on every side and you will see the fatal necessity of taking our resolution  hold exclaimed henry  i see the point you aim at  your resolution would not affect the general peace to which you would thus sacrifice your own happiness and mine  i warn you that it would subvert it  there is a cause still behind  alas alas there can be none interrupted caroline still bathed in tears  there can be no cause why i should not here solemnly bind myself by the most irrevocable vow never more to see henry fitzorton  the pride pleafure and passion of my soul  till  till he is the husband  of  of    the word husband had even a more powerful effect upon the whole frame of caroline than that of wife for the expression sunk her to the earth  the husband  of whom exclaimed henry  of olivia clare oh monstrous monstrous  oh god  exclaimed henry raising the convulsing form of caroline into his arms  yes this barbarous effect even of the very thought is a fresh proof dearest life that were henry fitzorton the husband of olivia clare he would be the most perjured traitor to love and friendship  he would be the most perfidious viper to sting and wound every breast most dear  and caroline stuart would become accessory to all his fraud to all his treachery  alas my love continued he still holding and still caressing the unresisting the almost lifeless caroline  there is yet another fatal mystery to be explained  reserve it said caroline faintly  i can hear  i can bear no more  remember said henry  remember that i bid you beware as you would avoid the despair the destruction of all that is precious to your blood  beware of coming to any resolution which shall preclude you from acting as your future duty may prescribe your brother can disclose the rest  caroline had been several times waving her hand as a sign for henrys leaving her assuring him by such broken sentences as she could utter that he might depend on her doing what she thought was right  but that she could not answer to what a degree her illness might augment if he persisted in the conversation any longer till she was more recovered henry therefore went mournfully but hastily out of the room and by the greatest good luck or something that answered his purpose just as well met sir guise gliding from an adjoining apartment he appeared however somewhat confused and agitated  perhaps at seeing henry uneasy few words therefore passed between them and those purported on the part of henry a request to defer the particulars of his discourse with caroline on account of her sudden indisposition till the next day alleging that as his father was confined to his chamber it would be expected he should sup at the castle  with this requisition the worthy baronet readily complied  expressing less curiosity than might have been expected he therefore civilly demanded of henry whether he chose any of the servants to attend him and on his courtesy being as handsomely declined they parted  chapter xxii but our sympathy of virtuous and superior woe demands that we should leave henry on the road to the castle and return to caroline at the abbey this truly amiable and as truly unhappy girl remained without words and almost without sense long after her lovers reluctant obedience to her repeated requisition the first thing which struck her when she felt herself somewhat collected was olivias miniature which henry had left on the table in his general agitation her examination of this led her to account for several of the mysterious expressions which fell from henry toward the close of his conversation for on his way to the abbey henry had penciled on the paper that had been the envelope of the picture and which remained also on the table this shall be a transfer to dear charles thus not only the words of her brother which were once overheard and asserted to her by dennison but those which charles himself dropped the same morning previous to his setting out to join his regiment were brought forcibly to her mind  it was hence apparent that her brother loved olivia and not less evident that olivia had fixed her entire affection upon henry and finally that both henry and charles were nevertheless in the strictest friendship but although this discovery developed the maze one way it involved in it another beyond all her power to unravel yet one inflexible truth pressed on her in a more unrelenting shape even than it had before  that whether henry and olivia were or were not to be united henry and caroline could never join since to suppose that olivia clare would ever dispose of her hand to charles and that henry would thereby be at liberty to offer himself to caroline stuart were points equally preposterous  in this state of perplexity her father entered the room and although he was in some perturbation from a cause yet untold he saw his daughters dejected countenance with parental regret and observed on it that as the occasion had in some measure been related by mr fitzorton he would not give her the pain of again telling the story but do every thing in his power to make her happy saying at the same time she must be sensible as well as henry how ready he had been to sacrifice himself to their felicity though he could not take upon him to answer for events and that he relied upon both her and henry doing him every justice with his son charles  the deeplyafflicted caroline acknowledged that his goodness was written in the tablets of her heart and that she was sure mr fitzorton and her brother would ever retain a due sense of it then entreated her fathers indulgence to retire for the night  sir guise granted this petition also as willingly as he had done the other and after saying he hoped a good nights rest would set all right again desired her to hope the best called her his dear caroline and bade her adieu  since the burial of lady stuart caroline had succeeded to the chamber in which that amiable woman died and this succession proceeded from the very opposite sensation to that which had there not been any separation of sleepingrooms between sir guise and his wife would have induced the good baronet to change it for another indeed he had moved to one at the other end of the abbey but as this motive might have been suggested by the love which could not endure the sight of the desolated spot which brings to memory the object of affection no less than by the hate which survives the grave or by the fear which always attends upon guilt but more particularly when we view the place where our selfcondemned crimes were committed and of course where the consequences of those crimes might be faid to stare us in the face inasmuch as they seem to the minds eye the ghosts of our past foul deeds  it is but fair that we leave the choice of these several motives to the readers own selection  certain it is that the night after the funeral  on the same night the reader remembers one or other of the abovestated sentiments kept him out of any bedchamber  he did remove far from his from his deceased wifes apartment and whatever were his motives those of his daughter in giving that very chamber the preference to every other in the house proceeded from the sincere affection which attaches itself to whatever brings to mind the venerated though departed object nevertheless we are ready to admit the same measure of affection that filled the bosom and memory of caroline might be possessed by many other daughters who might yet find themselves unable to support the sight of any thing their deceased parents had worn touched or been accustomed to behold  and indeed we have known some of the most amiable persons fly from their houses their estates and their coutry on this principle and forbid it nature that we should be supposed to ridicule any of the pious terrors or even the superstitions of filial love  we only feel it necessary to say  as has indeed more than once been proved to the reader  that the mind of caroline stuart though melting as love itself had none of these apprehensions yet the resignation of her late apartment which was also precious to her remembrance was connected with some other circumstances that ought not as they are in keeping with her character to be passed over  we can sometimes better endure the sight of that room where we have seen a dear parent expiring than of that where we suppose ourselves to have taken an eternal leave of a living lover when caroline at her fathers command had bade as she thought it to be an everlasting adieu to henry she gave vent to all the tender effusions which are set down for thy sympathy reader in a former part of this work but this little spot late so dear to her soon became an object of escape because she found it more difficult for her to perform the severe task of obliterating henry from her mind while from the window of that apartment she looked upon many things that brought his image back too keenly upon her sense and although in her mothers room when she was devoid of all the powers of recollection henry had supported her in his arms her reflections thereupon were more divided than from the view of that window  has the reader forgotten that it had in full prospect the grand avenue of tender memory the spot where the loves of henry and caroline were first declared to each other and alas discovered to sir guise and to close the whole artillery which it levelled against her lacerated heart has it escaped his memory that it carried the eye to the most appreciated part of fitzortoncastle even to the chamber of henry himself  resolved therefore to avoid as much as in her lay the objects which fed her despair she tore herself from these temptations and took refuge in a place where perhaps her grief from one cause was mitigated by the claims from another for it is certain that two sorrows equally great provided they are of distinct kinds demand that division of our thoughts and afford that sad relief which in any single calamity often overwhelms the sufferer  her mothers vacated room then she for some time occupied but since her fathers turn of behavior she considered the prospect from her old apartment as both literally and figuratively clearing up and had therefore moved into it again but now that it was overcast by another cloud more dark and menacing than any of the former she settled the plan of a third alteration even as she was ascending the stairs  sent her woman for her nightdress  and directed her steps once more to the room of lady stuart  all that was heroic about caroline was subdued she had not only exerted but exhausted whatever the natural strength or acquired energy of her mind could supply to support her in the last discourse she had held with henry and from the weariness of a soul more harassed than the frame that enclosed it she had scarcely gained her mothers room ere an extreme faintness overtook her and she fell down in a swoon in which without any violence  indeed scarcely without any sound or motion  she remained till the maid whom she had sent into the other chamber came to restore her  or more properly speaking till persecuted nature by a temporary suspension of life restored herself  but with the powers of her life the sense of that happiness which would have made life desirable was not alas renewed on the contrary she revived to the most agonizing reflections her present appeared less to be endured than her former fate to that if she had not been reconciled she had in some measure been resigned she had imposed on herself the severe but necessary task of calling to her assistance whatever would be most likely to keep her heart under some discipline though she found it impossible to vanquish the host of tender but powerful enemies that had there gained residence these however reason duty and time three of the most able and experienced generals and on whom she wholly relied for success might at length have routed but when the enslavers were almost worsted  when love himself after many desperate skirmishes and some pitched battles with the forementioned chiefs was made a captive and led out of his citadel in carolines breast in chains  then to have reason and duty not only demand a truce but throwing down their arms and as of old in the story of the horatii run into the embraces of the opposite party declaring that the war was unnatural  after such a treaty approved of by duty and indeed signed and sealed by that aweful power  nay after both the armies formed by these potentates were disbanded a chosen few only keeping garrison at the abbey to prevent surprise from the castle where it was imagined some malcontents not yet brought over were posted  then we say to have the amicable convention broken by an enemy from the most unexpected quarter  even in the gentle olivia clare  who without herself being as yet conscious of it involved the houses of fitzorton and stuart in deadlier hate than that which the daughter of king priam occasioned  this  this was indeed too much  such however was the case  hostilities recommenced  every passion and every principle mustered their forces  sounded to arms  and duty compassion reason and rival love were all at once warring in carolines bosom  chapter xxiii when this amiable but unfortunate girl was left at her strong desire alone she cast a mournful look over the apartment and derived some little comfort from reflecting that her dear mother who breathed her last in it was now in her peaceful tomb  that is some comfort yet said she  it is the cordial drop thrown into the bitter cup of my despair  taking from her pocket that handkerchief of which her eyes but too much stood in need  she felt the little packet that henry left with her whether discreetly or not we cannot now stop to consider for her brother  her confusion at the time it was first shown her did not allow her to observe it accurately  scarce indeed to take it from the paper in which it was wrapped or to do more than lay it again on the table  indeed she did not as yet know whether it was intended for her inspection  for she seemed now to have no memory of any thing but her own weighty sorrows  on taking it up again however it slipped from the silken envelope which olivia had folded round it  she once more examined the resemblance of the innocent girl who had already been the cause of so much anguish to the families which she so anxiously desired to see happy  it is not an easy matter to describe the mixed sensations that took possession of caroline as she attentively looked on this picture  how distinct from those she felt on receiving that of lady stuart and the two others from the hands of her dying mother  at olivias she looked and to olivia she spoke as if it were the original  beautiful author of the misery which awaits us all said she  dear playmate when life was young  wherefore are we rivals  yet how was it to be avoided  how could it be possible for thee to live in the presence of my henry  of thy henry and his thousand virtues and not give him all thy heart even alas as i gave him mine  and what but that pride which must now be severely humiliated could so long blind me to the certainty of this  but how is it that his own has escaped the magic of thy merit and thy charms  how has it been possible for him not to return thy passion  yet love is capricious else had thy empire been unquestioned  ah had thou honored my dear unhappy brother with thy affection  for now i see into the source of his long concealed distress  yet thou art not my rival but my associate in grief  even the irreparable loss which caroline must sustain will be no gain to thee olivia  we must both be wretched  wretched in the extreme  the breath of her sighs had dimmed the crystal of the miniature but her tears falling fast upon it at the same time  heaven knows continued she  i would not willingly obscure thy sight or happiness nor would thou mine  ah that we could relieve the misfortunes which i foresee are in store for us both  for indeed olivia to thy painted image i may without fear of wounding thee confess henry fitzorton cannot be more dear to thee than he was  than he is  and i fear ever ever must be to    she pressed the miniature to her bosom without finishing the sentence  yet resumed she  in this confession i do not wrong thee  i do not wrong thee olivia  for i have lost him for ever  he is gone from me never never to return  and were he thine this moment or divided from thee even as he is from caroline  such is the severe destiny in which we are both entangled we must be both miserable  in the struggle of these emotions she had turned the miniature on the other side which presented several little devices done with olivias hair such as cupid and hymen binding venus with her own cestus  and underneath a motto in pearls suitable to the design  on seeing which she uttered many more sentiments expressive of her feelings in the course of which she adverted for the first time since the death of her mother to the circumstance of her own and brothers miniatures which she knew had been in lady stuarts possession and not spoken of at the time when she received the other on the very bed which was now spread before her  thinking however they were deposited in some of her mothers drawers into which she had not yet examined all thoughts respecting them soon subsided  that of her mother however she drew from her bosom which had been its most delicate lodging ever since and kissed it fervently  then returning it to its tender but now trembling throne she resumed her attentions to henry and olivia who appeared by turns to occupy her entire soul  it is beyond question that her affection for the one notwithstanding all increase of misery and impediment was now at its height  and her pity for the other derived perhaps partly from fellowfeeling was no less extreme  the sense of her fathers unwonted kindness the sincerity of which was not for one moment doubted relieved her much  she thought it far better that her sorrows should flow from any but the domestic fountain whose waters of strife indeed are the most bitter we can possibly taste  blessed be god it is not my fathers fault now cried she that i am relapsed into my former wretchedness with every aggravation that could be heaped upon it he alas  which is indeed one of those aggravations  partakes my grief after he had generously sacrificed to me his strongest resentments and taken my dearest henry to his arms  she then adverted to her brother  and again taking up olivias picture she exclaimed in a softly rebuking tone  and thou also art the unhappy cause of my dear charless affliction  a youth scarce less deserving thy adoration than henry himself  but for his love of thee o insensible he at least might have been happy and in this dread hour of my own woe i might have looked up to him for comfort courage and pity  he will now alas be absorbed by his own griefs  she had no sooner uttered these reproaches against olivia than she turned several of a more bitter kind and with as little reason against herself whom she accused of cruelty folly falsehood and madness  recapitulating the several causes of impediment why neither charles and olivia nor henry and caroline could ever hope even had their own hearts so arranged matters to be united by holy vows  she next pressed the miniature to her lips and bestowed on it a kiss in token of her reconciliation and repentance  in short she proved in every reflection she was in love and in despair  she proved indeed at once she was tortured by all the feelings of her heart in which jealousy was not the least tyrannic  chapter xxiv while the picture was yet at her lips the door was opened by her woman who seeing her mistress not yet in bed first announced and then ushered in charles stuart  dearest sister forgive my impatience  i am this instant dismounted from my horse  but your father telling me you had retired to your chamber at this early hour i was alarmed especially as he said our beloved henry had passed the afternoon here and had but just left you  i should have thought such a teteatete  for my father intimated he had left you together  under such smiling prospects too would have kept sleep from your eyes for this week to come  my dear dear charles cried she tenderly embracing her brother  sleep was never farther from them than at this moment  or had they been closed surely nothing but the sleep of death could have rendered me insensible to the arrival of my ever good and affectionate brother  sleep answered charles surveying her countenance  no  those eyes i perceive have been but too much awake  for heavens sake what is the matter  is not joy as well as grief returned caroline  the cause of tears  ah my sister cries charles  but that pallid countenance that desolate air and the galled borders of those weeping lids demonstrate a far different cause than that of joy  i thought to have found you and my friend as happy as mutual love and a fathers authority could make you  and i came with all the speed of friendship for him and affection for you to devise some means that might incline those toward your happiness who might be averse to it  and that miniature in your hand  has our beloved henry at last given it to you  i chid him once that he had not done it before  and called him a loitering lover  no truly said caroline sobbing with stifled emotions  it is not his  not his returned charles  surely nothing can have happened between you to make him return your own  my own exclaimed caroline  yes caroline said charles  i found yours with mine on that very bed soon after our everlamented mother had expired and gave him both with the benediction of her dying breath still warm upon them  he was entitled to the gifts for now that saint is in heaven who upon earth can love caroline and charles like henry fitzorton  i will not think any thing could induce him to give it back  let me see  perhaps he has presented you with mine  but could that make you weep  it is yours charles said caroline  and left with me in trust to present to you the moment i should see you  caroline gave the miniature to her brother who on the first view exclaimed  gracious heaven what do i see my dear olivia  tell me sister i conjure you  tell me have our happy destinies been so run together that while  heaven knows how disinterestedly  i have been laboring for the felicity of henry and caroline  they by some yet unknown good fortune have been promoting the happiness of charles and olivia  oh if i could flatter my heart that this dear dear resemblance of all which is most precious was given by the loved original to be presented by henry to caroline and by her to charles  but that is impossible  i rave  alas it is no wonder  i love  forgive pity me  here instead of ending his rhapsody he fell to kiss and caress the miniature  ejaculating as he gazed is she not an angel caroline  did you ever behold such a brow  such an eye  such a lip  she certainly inspired the artist who is he  i could worship him  why do you not speak  oh my foreboding heart you are weeping still  caroline felt the utmost regret at the sad necessity of dissolving the charm that bound up her brothers senses or rather at restoring him to sense out of that sweet delirium that carried him beyond the bounds of reason into that delicious phrenzy which to such dispositions in such situations affords bliss superior perhaps to what reason ever gave  finding however that he was still impatient  nay that he stamped and raved for explanation  she at length reluctantly cried  alas charles would i could continue the delusion till it could be realized  i grieve to say our disappointments are reciprocal yet your friend henry desired that picture might be given  but told me you would explain the impossibility of the original ever becoming his wife   his wife reiterated charles  friendship forbid  should i live to see that day  but i conjure you to tell me all  if the happiness  the life of your brother be matter of concern conceal not a tittle of what i perceive is now laboring in your bosom  the sudden sight of this miniature has indeed hurried me to a sweet oblivion of all my cares  but i now return to the curse of my reason and the certainty of my despair  olivia  olivia  my delight  my destruction  he now again renewed his attentions to the picture  swore that with whatever intent it was put into his hands it should never go out of them more  and concluded with asseverating that unless caroline immediately satisfied his heart in all it panted to know he would quit the abbey that moment and repair to the castle to demand of henry a full explanation  the wild and extravagant manner in which he spoke terrified caroline  but looking at him with a softness that might have extracted the sting almost from despair itself  alas my brother said she could my life procure to you and your friend henry the bliss you have lost it should be laid at your feet  she then explained all that had happened in the conversation betwixt her and henry and when she had brought down her narrative to the deposit of the miniature she observed that she referred for the particulars respecting olivia and charles to charles himself  our dear father however said caroline deserves our warmest acknowledgements on this occasion  he has shown such indulgence that my grateful soul avows he has made ample reparation for all former mistakes  nay i feel assured that as much as in him lies  oh that his power were now equal to his generous inclinations  he will promote the loves of charles and olivia i am persuaded he will  if for caroline he could condescend so greatly what exertion will he not make for the felicity of his darling son  but as yet my brother i am to learn how far you yourself are interested in this matter  i long yet dread to hear  o caroline replied charles  if i have hitherto concealed from you the secrets and the sorrows of my heart it was from the same generous motives that actuated my beloved friend to keep them from you  he then related at length the story of his unfortunate attachment  the friendly behavior of henry  and the noble conduct of john fitzorton  he enlarged upon the cruel kindness of the whole family to him  confessed that his visits at the castle like those of henry at the abbey were the consequence rather of love than of friendship  he particularly dwelt on the manifest impossibility of his ever becoming in any measure dear to olivia till the passion of henry for caroline was declared  yet acknowledged that he did not see though he had revolved it ten thousand times in his mind how such a declaration was to be made  he averred if so heartrending an event as the union of henry and olivia were to take place  though heaven could witness that his friendship for the former could be surpassed only by his love of the latter  he would not dared not think on what might ensue  it would break my heart  it would make me mad  cried charles  would my friend were here at this moment  why did you let him depart  some way must befound to preserve him  olivia  you  myself  and all that belong to us  from the horrors that are impending  consider of it caroline  oh consider of it  consult your pillow  remember what we have at stake  it is an awful crisis  if there is not any expedient to save us from irremediable despair what must be the result  oh caroline for the sake of pity friendship love suggest something  my brain seems turning as i speak to you  my sister and my friend alone are in the confidence of my affliction  it involves themselves  it will spread to all who belong to us  caroline weigh the matter well  i am distracted  he broke from her and hurried down stairs leaving his sister more perplexed than ever for she perceived too plainly by her brothers vehemence in the relation that the designs at the castle were almost ripe for that event which would determine the destiny of all whom it concerned  the miniature of olivia had wrought him to a curiosity whose gratification had proved worse than the mystery of his sisters distress  in short she perceived that charles had been long as violently in love with olivia as henry could possibly be with herself  but with this strong and unfortunate difference in the returns of the passion  that olivia was not sensible to indeed was not conscious of the tenderness of charles  whereas caroline felt in the bottom of her tyrannized heart in despite of her disappointment and despair  that it beat only for henry  it was no less apparent to her that her brother and her henry had been generously but unavailingly playing into each others hands to prosper their affection by imparting favorable impressions of each other to the beloved object  and that although the interest of charles was not thereby in any measure advanced henry had not acted with less zeal consistent with the caution it was thought right to observe than charles in fine that the friendship of these young men was equally noble generous and indefatigable  chapter xxv the vigilant sir guise like a kind parent who has reason to fear his children were unhappy was upon the stairs to receive his beloved son when he came from carolines apartmentmdashsolemnly protesting the supreme delight of his life would be to see his offspring as happy as their own wishes could make them  which was an exact compromise betwixt sincerity and deceit for in the case of charles it was true and in that of caroline it was false  in fact he was in some sort alienated from the former by the almost constant upbraidings he received on the double scores of his tyranny and cowardice  charles however still retained much of his involuntary affection  and if any thing in the world except the miscarriage of certain great designs which had been long rolling in his mind could have broken down the bulwark of that impenetrable stuff of which his heart was composed it would perhaps have been the total loss of his sons society so often threatened  it is needless my dear charles said this affectionate father  to give you the pain of repeating your discourse with caroline  i have heard too much already for my peace and i see you are much affected  this letter indeed added sir guise is of itself a history of the plans carrying on at the castle  but do not read it at present tomorrow morning you will be more able to take measures in behalf of your poor sister and counteract their stratagems  charles received the letter and seeing it had been written by sir armine  indeed it was that brought to the abbey for henry and left there in his confusion  i must read it sir said charles though every sentence were a poignard and my lifeblood should flow from the wounds  he perused the fatal epistle which had already been the cause of so much distress and when he came to the passages that mentioned the state of the preparation for olivias marriage he burst forth into the most extravagant gestures and expressions  have you come to that part said sir guise where fitzorton insolently talks of the disgrace and infamy of an alliance with our family  charles replied to this question only by a wild insensible kind of stare  and did you take notice my dear boy of the saucy air which the proudhearted john gives himself  insinuating than an union with the stuarts would be pollution  o sir breathe not an accent against john fitzorton  answered charles recovering himself  he is the second young man in the world and his brother my friend henry is the first  my obligations to both are infinite and i love henry next to  but perdition if he marries her  it must not be  i will sooner put an end to both their lives  to my own  charles crushed the paper between his hands  then opened and read it again  his father began to fear he had carried this exploit too far  he saw with terror these violences increase  and did not know how soon they might be turned upon himself  what is this i see  questioned charles taking a light to read the passage more clearly  who is this  jane atwood  jane atwood  reiterated sir guise who  in his eagerness to show his son doubtless for some good reason this letter  had forgot what he would at present have concealed  but after the confusion of a moment he exclaimed with admirable presence of mind  yes they have i understand hunted up that infamous hussy in order to fortify themselves with fresh malice and do me fresh mischief in the country  think charles what i am ready to do for the happiness of you and your sister when i am willing to pass over even this mean insult  his low paltry revenge  jenny atwood you know is the girl who i told you ran away from her parish with child and then put it round the country forsooth that i was the father of the brat  you remember the impudent story i dare say but heaven knows i forgive them all  nay my dear son shall even carry my advances to them for the sake of my childrens happiness  and indeed for that of my own i will meet my bitterest enemies on the road of reconciliation more than half way  as to jenny atwood old fitzorton and the furious mr john i will  i ought  i am at peace with them all  sir guise now strung together and strewed around his pious harangue many an holy text from sacred and many a moral axiom from profane history  ending with this asseveration  yes charles i repeat i forgive them all  whether his beloved son was sufficiently collected to hear any part of the foregoing speech or was a skeptic as to its sincerity is uncertain  he only replied to the passage that had reference to jenny atwood  and to that he said with some difficulty but with a marked though obstructed emphasis  as to the poor girl by whatever means she found her way to the castle sir i am sure she will there find those who will pity and protect her  then you did not expect this marriage would take place quite so soon  interrupted the baronet willing to shift the discourse  i should not wonder if they were to hurry henry into it so soon as tomorrow  especially if they should any how hear what confusion we are in about it  tomorrow  raved charles  what henry and olivia  marry tomorrow  does this accursed this murderous letter say so  have you heard  did henry dare to intimate  it is well i am come thus opportunely for the ceremony  i will be there  yes depend upon it i will be there tomorrow  damnation  sir guise felt himself now in a worse scrape than ever and wished he had let the conversation take its course even about jenny atwood  charles tore one of the sheets of the letter with a vehemence bordering on phrenzy  put part of the fragments into his mouth and champed them between his teeth  the affrighted dennison came in saying his poor young lady had in a great fright rung to know what was the matter and whether her presence could be useful  charles rose  shook the old man by the hand  begged him to entreat his sisters forgiveness for such unseasonable disturbances and that if she would try herself to get a little rest he would withdraw to his chamber and not utter another complaining syllable though his poor heart should burst in his bosom bear this message to her good fellow said charles and tell her you saw me going to perform my promise  but let me be called early then taking a candle and bidding sir guise respectfully a good night he went into his bedroom without thinking of any refreshments after the fatigues of his journey or the greater weariness of contending passions  dennison shook his head as he went at full trot upon his commission observing as he ascended the stairs  there must be a place of comfort bye and bye seeing that here upon earth there was none  that high and low rich and poor can get no rest in this world for the soles of their feet  and seeing besides that if this had been intended as a place of happiness his young master and mistress and squire henry would be as merry as their days were long  sir guise stuarts morality was all in soliloquy for he immediately went to bed though we have our reasons for thinking not to sleep  peradventure courteous reader thou art disposed to retire into thy chamber also torpid indeed must have been thy disposition if it has permitted thee to nod while the foregoing scenes were representing but as a feeling spectator enters into and may be said to partake of the exertions of the actor thy sympathy for the sufferings of some of the principal characters may have no less fatigued thy spirits to read than ours to relate on which presumption we here resign thee to what one of our poets has called natures soft restorer and while thou art refreshing thyself we will endeavor to prepare something worthy of thy renovated powers  chapter xxvi it has been intimated that the worthy baronet had heard or rather overheard the preceding conversation betwixt his son and daughter in truth it is very certain he knew every syllable of their discourse as well as if he had been present the whole time indeed those parts of him best adapted to take in the intelligence were in a manner present for though he could not in strictness of speaking be said to be an eye he had been an ear witness and could have sworn to the facts on auricular demonstration in any court of judicature as conscientiously as if he had been a spectator the worthy baronet constantly put himself in the way of enjoying all the benefits of this mode of collecting evidence and as to hearing now and then such a character of himself as he knew he deserved  in drawing which his servants or others would liberally deal forth the words  profligate  villain  coward etc he treated these things as mere matters of course which were no more able to reach his conscience at least to wound it than the paper pellet of a popgun from a schoolboys arm could penetrate the anvil which had stood the heat and hammer of a century in a blacksmiths shop  by these laudable means he knew every bodys family secrets without any hazard of divulging his own  which is frequently an unwelcome interruption to the business in hand perplexing it with adventitious matter sometimes it must be owned the listener who is justly said seldom to hear much good of himself is a little put to it to maintain his post which the baronet like the poet  leaving out only the expletive word honor  found was a private station  chapter xxvii the meditations of henry fitzorton on his second expulsion from the abbey and partly by that very clearing up of affairs so long dreaded and desired were not more enviable than those of caroline his night scenes indeed from this place were generally gloomy enough and some evil planet seemed to rule his destiny whenever he passed along the famous grand avenue by which he now again sought the castle  his old habit of holding conversations with himself returned strongly upon him as he reached the pathway at which the first fatal declaration of his love for caroline took place since that moment cried he ah what has been my life but a succession of mysteries and misfortunes i am driven from the castle to the abbey and again from the abbey to the castle only to be made more and more the sport of my malicious stars if a gleam of hope breaks upon me from caroline it is instantly clouded by olivia if i labor to teach my heart to sacrifice itself to the latter the former seems to pronounce that my peace and my vows are broken for ever here the misery of my bosom friend and there the desolation of my own family even the approbation of sir guise which i thought a blessing beyond my reach is no sooner obtained than another impediment starts up to render that blessing of no avail i have left those consecrated walls again in despair and what awaits me at the place to which i am directing my steps if i unravel the like mysterious causes there the like effects must ensue  the tears of olivia and the wrath of my dear  dear  father if i remain silent which i have already done but too long that silence will be again adduced in proof of my consent to their disposal of my revolting heart  all this time true george was within a few paces of henry but said not a word whenever his master turned or made any transverse motions the faithful servant who had the legs of a hare though he had not the wings of a bird was on the opposite side in a moment his custom when there happened as in the present instance to be any trees or hedges was to keep as near to them as possible and in case of necessity he was in over or under them in the twinkling of an eye  in truth this honest fellow independent on the veneration he bare to henry for his booklearning and especially for his quotations from the poets had long suspected and for some time past looked upon him to be absolutely mad and from the various soliloquies he had overheard in which the name of caroline was so often mentioned he had set it down that this injury on his poor masters brain had been occasioned by his being crossed in love but his sense of honor was naturally too great to breathe the discovery which he thought he had made to any second person upon earth and his fear of offending and indeed of making his master worse had in like manner restrained him from speaking of it to henry himself in the daytime george was pretty easy thinking henry sufficiently safe in the society of his friends or relations but from the very instant that the evening drew in he was as assiduously upon guard as if it was his turn to hold watch on the toll of the curfew and he attended his masters motions from nightfall even until bedtime making it a constant rule not to leave him till he was ordered to take away his light  this general assiduity had not a little endeared him to henry whose gratitude for every degree of kindness shown to him whatever was the rank or station of the obliging person was lively and sincere hitherto however georges nocturnal attendance had escaped the discovery of his master  the dexterity and management with which the poor fellow kept sentry upon henry is curious  if any sentence dropped toward evening signifying his masters design to take his moonlight stroll or retire to bed earlier than usual on the pretense of sudden indisposition  or if he saw henry more than usually merry or sad  for so well had he studied him he looked upon both these extremes as symptomatic  he was from that instant at work  he had long known that no impediments of weather could prevent his masters going forth when the wandering spirit seized him  if then the night was stormy or likely so to be george would be provided with his comfortables as he called them according to the state of the element  he would be as restless in the kitchen or servants hall as his master in the parlour or drawingroom  george was as great a favorite below stairs as was his master above  and his fellow servants found it difficult to make him sit down to a dish of tea or if they prevailed and his hour was almost come he would swallow it in haste  the maids jeered him upon this  one said he was like a troubled spirit  another likened him to a bad conscience  and the butler who was a great scholar to the perpetual motion  rachel one of the housemaids who was suspected to have a kindness for him tossed up her head and said she supposed the poor devil was in love  and that he had some lady or another who met him every night in a fairy bower  but for her part she never knew any good come of forward hussies who went skulking after fellows in lanes and alleys  if a man follows a woman said she  let him follow her fair and above board  for her part she supposed a brat would be laid at the gentlemans door for all his slyness   lord mrs rachel replies mrs cook  why for sartain sure you are jealous  mr george has only got the fidgets and as for brats here she winked with one eye at the coachman and looked steadfastly at mrs rachels shape with the other  as for the matter of brats  my notion of theseum things is that they are to be had without going into lanes and alleys or out of the house either  what say you coachee  here the cook began the laugh the coachee as she called him continued it and the rest joined in chorus  till rachel would sometimes times bitterly assert that heaven knows nobody can ever accuse you mrs cook of having brats  you may thank god for that however  look in the glass  that is all  look in the glass  at other times she would content herself with calling every one a pack of slanderous enviable personages take herself off into her ladys chamber where she often sat at work  saying as she left the room it served her right for mixing with a set of vulgar vandalgoth souls who were born to the kitchen  she was naturally a parlourbred young woman  none of these gibes or jeers however had the smallest effect upon george who heard them out if he was certain of his master  and if not he would often leave them in the midst of their irony and pursue his designs  once indeed he was dogged by another of the servants as far as the outer gate that led into the park but luckily henry was then a good way forward and george turning round told the fellow that if he followed him an inch farther or ever served him such a trick again he would pull the skin over his ears and throw it in his face though he were to die a thousand deaths for it  i pry into no mans business said george  and dmn me if i suffer any man upon earth except my master whose bread i eat to pry into mine  the fellow hereupon stole off while he had the whole of his skin to cover him  and as it may be supposed told every servant in the house for none ever after presumed to interrupt george  though it was universally believed he was desperately in love with some maid wife or widow in the neighborhood who dared only have a stolen interview with him in the evenings  george however was so kindhearted a young fellow and so generally beloved that every body forgave him but mrs rachel and even the man he so dreadfully menaced exclaimed why it is after a woman i warrant and there is no harm in that  he that will not go out at pitch dark after a woman ought to be dd  but mrs rachel observed such goodfornothing forward harlots who draw young men astray  and the fellows too who can like such filthy nasty hussies  ought every one of them to be burnt alive  to which the learned clerk of our kitchen the butler before mentioned slyly answered taking her considerately round the waist god forbid mrs rachel they should all take flame unless you are prepared to go off to the other world in a flash of fire like a skyrocket  in short george made use of as many stratagems and was as much put to his shifts to avoid being seen or suspected by his master as his master put in practice to escape the detection of olivia whose custom of becoming as heretofore the companion of his wanderings he had for some time as much as possible prevented  george however was himself in no small hazard of being discovered as he was now following his master to the abbey  for when henry had got almost to the castlegate after cursing his fortune at every second step he all at once wheeled round exclaiming in the language of romeo whose destiny he considered at the moment in some respects similar to his own  turn back dull earth and find thy center out this he uttered with a rant of natural grief more truly felt but with much also of the wildness and extravagance of the theater  henry then asked himself why the montagues and capulets should be thus at variance  then answered his own question my only love sprung from my only hate cried he down with the capulets down with the montagues  henry traced such resemblance to his fate in this celebrated love story  and rose so high in his heroics as he ran the parallel betwixt himself and romeo and caroline and juliet  that he was to the full as much distracted as they could have been  no ejaculated he it is past oh never more must i hope  to kiss the wonder of my juliets hand or drink delicious poison from her lips then i defy you stars at the end of this rhapsody he set off at full speed as if carried away by the sentiment  and he had indeed so absolutely made the case his own  forcing it to apply where it did not and appearing almost to think he was the identical romeo where it did  that had not the darkness favored  at the sight of a man running as fast as he could toward the avenue and then hiding behind the trees in the vista  george would have had good reason to say with mercutio a plague of both your houses  when george thought all safe he ventured from his hiding place  but not daring to risque another scene of the same kind that night suffered his master to go into the house first and then stealing softly round to the back gate of which he had a key he was in time to slip on another frock and get into his masters chamber soon after henry had rung his bell  the family and even olivia had given up all thought of seeing henry for the night and had gone to rest  one of the servants having observed while waiting at supper that young squire stuart was just arrived  george glad that he had escaped so well went to bed but not without strong suspicions that his poor master would not be long out of bedlam  nay the honest fellow began to debate with himself whether it would not be better at once to tell the melancholy or rather raving state in which he often saw him to his family for fear worse should come of it  who knows but he may lay violent hands on himself before one is aware said george  and then what is to become of us  heigho sighed george  loves a sad thing  i suppose jenny atwood is abed and asleep now  well god bless her  and god bless us all  heigho  i will go to bed too  i hope i never shall be so much in love  heigho  yes i dare say jenny atwood is asleep  heigho  george repaired to his truckle bed which was in a closet adjoining his masters where he had begged long before he might sleep  to be within call  in case any thing should happen in the night  the good fellow quietly undressed himself but the affair of romeo and juliet the montagues and capulets had quite settled with him his masters madness which he now considered as incurable and his last words that night were ah poor dear gentleman it is all over with him now sure enough  what a terrible thing love is when it comes to this  heigho  the lord deliver us  i wonder how jenny is to night  i hope i never shall love at this rate  chapter xxviii whatever roses hope might strew on the pillow of olivia that of henry was on this night lined with thorns  when for an instant he dropped into a transitory slumber all the images of a disturbed imagination and tortured mind rose to his view  at one moment his fancy represented him tossing in the ocean at another laboring in mud  sometimes his ears were assailed by the shrieks of both caroline and olivia falling in the general ruin  and sometimes he beheld his friend charles pointing a dagger at his bosom  in his waking hours he often resolved on a stratagem to escape the union of olivia by an elopement with caroline  and projected this so as to form a double plot including the flight of olivia with charles  the violent emotions accompanying this idea extravagant as it was operated with such force on his burning fancy that he suddenly started upright in his bed and exclaimed would it were morning  i will be at the abbey by daybreak  surely charles is by this time arrived  if not i will go post to meet him  were he at the end of the earth i would travel toward him  then pressing his repeater which hung at the bed head he found to his infinite mortification that it was only two oclock  the sound of his exclamations had pierced the ear of the trusty george who had himself been kept awake by his own reflections partly about his master and partly about himself  for the havoc he had witnessed in a human breast by disappointment in love made a very strong impression and convinced him more fully of a truth he had before begun to suspect in regard to his own heart  george was certainly much alarmed at the state of his master yet no less struck at the prodigious effects of the passion itself  and as well from the dread of his being one day reduced to the same condition as from the hope that he should not  each lover commonly making himself the happy exception to a general rule  he was effectually kept from closing his eyes  the moment therefore he heard henrys concluding asseveration that were charles at the end of the earth he would travel toward him  he leaped out of his own bed and was at the side of his masters just as the watch had repeated the inauspicious hour  for goodness sake what is the matter with your honor  can i do any thing for your honor myself  shall i go for the doctor  shall i call up the rest of the servants  or the family  i fear your honor is very bad  how is your honors head  hot  very hot  all of a coal  your honor is in a high fever  let me strike a light  no answered henry not so honest fellow  i know you love me george  love you your honor yes though my distracted senses too should forsake me  i would find as the play says and as i have heard your honor say  i would find some interval when    go then to bed said henry rise at the first peep of dawn  run to the abbey  ask if lieutenant stuart is arrived and bring me word unknown to any body  he is arrived your honor our coachman told me he saw him ride by the park pales about ten oclock last night which must be soon after we  we  that is after your honor left the abbey  arrived answered henry then let my own horse and yours be saddled and in the stable ready to mount by four oclock leave me now and be sure you are not after the time my good george  i will make very sure of that your honor by not going to bed any more  try to get a bit of rest yourself dear good sir and i will call you to the click of the quarters so that you shall be on horseback as the clock is striking  george  knowing this to be the best mode of arranging the business both for his masters ease and his own  did not wait for any objections thereto  but commending henrys lost wits to god shut the door of the chamber and returned to his own  at the time appointed with an accuracy that marked the exactness of his character he had not only done his work in the stable but in the house also for he had made a fire boiled the kettle had a dish of coffee and all his comfortables smiling upon a table in what was called the hunting parlour to greet his master on coming down stairs  and by calling henry a few minutes earlier than the specified hour had allowed time for taking the refreshment  what was the nature of his masters business george never enquired this young man had first been in the service of john fitzorton as the reader remembers while yet a boy and since a private in johns regiment and had so well profited by his military education that he practiced ever after toward his commanding officer  and such he now looked upon henry to be  the law of nonresistance and passive obedience  indeed a slight nod often testified his assent to what was required of him but most commonly the last word of any message sent him off without any sign or token at all  henry however having had leisure to reflect on the inconsistency ingratitude and even impossibility of carrying his wild scheme into execution  told george that he had altered his mind as to setting out so early but should perhaps ride or walk to see his friend mr stuart in the course of the day and would try to sleep an hour or two now that he might be ready to attend his own family at breakfast  and cordially advised george to do the same  the joy of our worthy domestic on seeing his master unexpectedly composed was so great that he sunk involuntarily upon his knees exclaiming with much fervency the lord be praised  then drawing the curtains and closing part of the shutter next to the bed that the light might not prove unfavourable to his masters slumbers  he went on tiptoe out of the apartment reiterating in whispers  the lord be praised the lord of his infinite mercy be praised  he may do yet  henrys fixed resolution however was  let the consequence be what it might or whatever involvements it might bring upon the abbey or the castle or both  to make a full and free confession of the past and present and longestablished state of his affections in the course of that very day  and indeed at all hazards to prevent his union with olivia clare even if the loss of caroline stuart and his own ruin should be the issue of the explanation  chapter xxix after turning this at length irrevocable determination as he called it into various shapes  how best to proceed in it  whether to begin by discourse with olivia with james or with his mother whose heart he knew was his own  or whether to make his confessions and his round unvarnished tale deliver in presence of the whole family  he lay for some time in a state betwixt sleeping and waking  a state produced by a violent tension of the thoughts to one of those objects which hurries the animal spirits till the mind having fatigued itself and the body is compelled from very heaviness of the flesh and spirit to grant the relief of a pause  during which we cannot strictly be said either to sleep or wake  the word which for lack of a better we have for it is dozing a kind of intermediate state betwixt a vehement emotion and no emotion at all  the mind still carrying on though feebly her former designs till the body relaxed and languid is unable to keep pace with her  and a person may lie in this state several hours and find himself in the end without any material refreshment  out of this dozing then henry was aroused by a scratching at the door as from the foot of a dog  this was presently followed by another and that again by a whine which spoke as plainly as any language that whoever might be the petitioner he earnestly desired to be admitted as henry was going to the door he was saluted by the barking of the said petitioner accompanied by a smart pat against the panel of the door indicating that having done with supplication the said pat might be considered as a sort of threat to effect a forcible entry in case of longer resistance  on opening the door who should make his appearance but little fitz  so was he called  the favorite and almost constant companion of caroline stuart  it had been henrys gift to that young lady who was grown so fond of it partly for its own sake and partly for the donors that she never suffered it out of her sight without feeling uneasy  it had been present of course at all the scenes of joy and sorrow which had passed between the lovers and therefore was much in the good graces of both  but how to account for this unexpected visit henry could no way conjecture  however little fitz came at the right moment to receive a hearty welcome  for henry no sooner beheld his visitor than he hugged kissed and called him as many endearing epithets as if it had been caroline herself  the fancy of henry always ready to encourage the illusions of his heart soon gave to this delightful airy nothing more than a local habitation he called the dog dear little namesake  indeed it was at his own desire fitz had been so honored  for said henry it will make caroline then think of the donor  he assured little fitz that he was more grateful for his attention now than at any former period of their friendship for each other as he was convinced he came on purpose to comfort him in the hour of his despair  but how did you find your way to my chamber  and how long have thou been sitting at my door poor fellow  and why did thou not address thyself to me before  so thrive my soul as i would share with thee my bed and board sooner than with the finest object amidst the works of creation thy mistress alone excepted  but what will she say to thy playing truant  does she know of thy coming  or did caroline send thee in charity to henry  he continued this rhapsody much farther and kindled in his course till it is to be doubted whether he did not really expect regular replies to those interrogatories  be that as it may we never understood that the dog gave any answer whatever  save that he had now changed the whine of complaint to the exulting note of joy  for it admits not of a doubt that the little animal was extremely glad to see henry who had frequently taken him into the fields and forests and treated him with the sight of a hare or partridge  for which as well as other tokens of good will little fitz who was extremely well born and well educated too  being of the spaniel kind and of a choice breed  was entirely grateful so that in fact there was no love lost betwixt him and henry  but whatever impression this enthusiastic address to little fitz might make upon him it sunk peculiarly deep into the mind of true george the door being open when the dog entered he heard quite sufficient to convince him that the few hopes he had before entertained of his masters wits being restored were now over and that the unhappy gentleman was ten times more distracted than ever  the various questions he heard put to the dog gave george the strongest apprehensions even of raving madness but when henry with the utmost extravagance of voice talked about sharing bed and board with the dog and giving him the preference to all the objects of created nature except caroline  the poor fellow could hardly contain his sorrowful emotions which in despite of himself forced their way between his teeth as he muttered alas quite gone  mad as a march hare  lord have mercy upon us  if i thought the case would ever be mine i would hang myself at once out of the way oh jenny  jenny  all this for a dumb beast  very well in his place i would not hurt a worm  but a worm is a worm  and a dog is a dog  and a dog is a beast of the field  and what is a beast to do in a mans bed except a christian gives him a pat and away or so to get him down  as much as to say if you please sir off my bed and make room for your betters and to be sure christians are better than dumb beasts at any time and if they ant more shame for em  poor soul  quite lost indeed  gone for ever  o merciful father for pity how mad he is  most of this speech was delivered as george walked to and fro in the long gallery which extending the whole length of the bedchambers henry heard only the words which began and ended it  viz quite lost  mad as a march hare  gone for ever etc to which he replied what is that you say  who is there  george  yes your honor replied george giving the matter a turn for fear of making his master worse  ever an uppermost idea  it is only me sir  gone for ever  and mad as a march hare  what are you talking about said henry  little fitz please your honor  i found after we  that is your honor  got home he had followed us  followed you that is  from the abbey so i let him have a nights lodging in my room knowing he was lady carolines dog and made him a snug birth in the corner and when i got up he was off and i was saying to myself  says i  he is gone  he is lost  and if he is it will make lady caroline as mad as a march hare  but i see your honor has him safe so it is all well but breakfast waits your honor  well then said henry give this dear little fellow something to eat and keep him out of sight till i can walk over with him to the abbey and be sure you let him have what he likes for dn me if i dont love him almost as well as if    he shall be taken good care of your honor depend on it interposed george lifting him from the bed and walking off with him under his arm before henry could finish his asseveration  henry had always been much attached to and not a little superstitious about the fidelity and genius of dogs and this friendly visit of little fitz was to his poetic heart a fresh proof that the canine came very near to the human species in those matters barring some very nice and subtle distinctions about which he would sometimes reason with john till that philosophic youth would pronounce him as did true george sometimes to be mad and sometimes only merry  it was in the present case a yet farther confirmation when before henry had left his chamber little fitz had given george the slip and again paid his respects to the lover of caroline and at the time of this his second appearance henry was offering his devotions to carolines miniature this he told fitz lest he should approach it in an unhallowed manner  this he told fitz was the picture of her they both adored but you happy creature added henry you will be fondled by the original when i perhaps   he then fell to caressing the spaniel and the picture by turns and concluded by exclaiming as he was going out of his room dear precious resemblance  never  never  will i part with thee  not death himself shall snatch thee from me  the chamber door was all this time wide open and the above words were heard distinctly and the speaker of them seen by lady fitzorton mr clare and olivia  the two latter at that instant coming from olivias chamber where the former had as usual given her a gentle summons to see if her daughter as she always called her was ready to go down to breakfast and they met mr clare as he was shutting the door of his apartment  the trio were all of one mind as to what they heard and saw olivia blessed herself and cried  dear soul  how he honors my poor gift  see madam  turning to lady fitzorton  ought i not to be proud  it gives me almost as much joy as it does you replied her ladyship for as he was not prepared for our coming as you see by his agreeble confusion we may be sure his caresses of the picture are  warm from his heart and faithful to its fires hey henry exclaimed mr clare what signify your prosings to a bard caught in so poetical a situation  there is a quotation for him that describes him in his own way for my part i say nothing  but were i olivia i should be little pleased with the cold compliment paid to my inanimate picture when the original stood blooming like the morning before him without his so much as offering to    come madam said olivia shall we go down stairs  with all my heart my dear answered lady fitzorton  mr clare will have his joke you know  you will follow henry said olivia blushing delightfully and tripping down stairs is your friend charles come and pray how fares my sweet playfellow my sweet friend  olivia recollected it might not be quite prudent to mention carolines name at that instant and so made the best of her way  henry had seldom been thrown into a more awkward situation the mistake of the miniature which on being discovered he put hastily out of sight was so extremely natural and so impossible to be then explained that he was utterly confounded and his complexion now almost as nearly resembled the carnation as olivias a circumstance which literally gave a still stronger color to the supposition that the picture he had been so transported with was the one that olivia had presented  what became of little fitz we never heard but it is probable he had shyed off at the sight of so much unexpected company for he had naturally more diffidence than belongs to favorites in general whether of the biped or quadruped kind but indeed he might very possibly have been at henrys feet and not noticed by either of the parties in their confusion and for the moment henry himself forgot perhaps that this dear little soul whom he preferred to created nature had any existence within the bounds of the universe be that as it may henry went down to breakfast  but from what happened afterward  and indeed from what might be expected to happen from the questions which would arise on the unexpected sight of such a guest  we are rather inclined to think henry did not perceive his companion till it was too late of this the reader will presently form his own judgment  chapter xxx sir armine fitzorton who stood in the great hall which led from the chambers to several of the apartments encountered henry as he came down stairs and received him with an ardour of affection and applause to which nothing but henrys consciousness of not deserving it could have rendered him insensible  it is surely decreed said sir armine embracing henry that my life is to be preserved by one or other of my children twice has it already been in danger and twice have my sons rescued me  here henry is the accursed scroll whose contents had they been true would have been far more fatal than the injury which this aged frame received from sir guise stuarts horse for i am convinced they would have broken mine and your mothers heart  henry therefore merits in a still greater degree even than our beloved john the title of his parents preserver  i am grateful and i am happy  the venerable man threw his arms round henrys neck and wept  a circumstance no way inconsistent with the transport either of gratitude or happiness and which nature often adduces in proof of both  the heart of henry though throbbing with love for caroline was by no means unmoved by such an appeal to it it is more than probable indeed that at such a moment his heart had little to do with caroline or with any thing in this world but with the sacred object in his embrace  oh sir exclaimed he i cannot  indeed i cannot bear it spare me i conjure you for i feel powerfully that these tears and the goodness which occasions them will be more fatal than that paper whatever it may suggest  i cannot speak  my dear  dear father i cannot speak  i perceive my child thou can not  blessings upon thee let us hasten then to those whose affection for you is equal to my own  they proceeded toward the breakfast parlour the door of which was at that moment opened by olivia who began to be impatient of henrys delay  your tea will be quite cold gentlemen said she complainingly  sir armine turned his face gently from her and said give me your hand olivia and let us take a turn or two before we go in  there henry do you follow my example  henry took the other hand and they all three traversed the hall for the space of some minutes  sir armine attempting to hide strong emotions and henry laboring in the same way both were unsuccessful olivia perceived they had been in tears and indeed still discovered some which had lodged in the furrows of sir armines cheek  heavens said she what can these mean wiping them softly away with the back of her hand  and yours henry are not quite dry said she removing them by the like action  why should we endeavor my son to conceal the effects of our transport from any one but least of all from her who has a right to share them  daughter continued sir armine what you have noticed in our countenances has been produced by the joy of our hearts  and it was churlish in us to wish to rob you of your just division this our henry has  but no matter  i charge you to love him better than ever and if he proves to you as good a husband as he has done to me a son  as i am thereby the happiest of fathers so will you be the most blessed of wives ask no more questions but let us to breakfast  it is very unfair however of you said olivia with all imaginable sweetness as if betwixt sport and earnest to have all this transport to yourselves for i would have you to know i am as fond of weeping for joy as either of you and am now almost ready to cry with grief at your cheating me in this cruel manner and as to being more fond of this creature than i ever was before i am sorry sir at the necessity of disobeying you in this particular for he very well knows that  that    knows what questioned sir armine  that it is impossible whispered she but the whisper was conveyed in another of those stage tones which have so amply been discussed in one of the family conversations for when she mentioned to sir armine the impossibility of loving henry better than she had done she certainly intended her lover should hear indeed she resigned her hand to his caresses while this reason was communicated and gliding herself between henry and sir armine  the former in almost an oblivion of every thing but his filial love  she drew them into the apartment  as they entered little fitz had placed himself in olivias chair and thinking perhaps he had waited long enough for his breakfast was helping himself very cordially to some bread and butter that stood commodiously near him  lady fitzorton and mr clare having entered into a serious teteatete at the other end of the room  olivia therefore running to him said oh but i forgot henry to tell you about this dear little dog  he is quite taken with me  i think he likes the castle better than the abbey  what is his name  i see by the collar he belongs to  to  to  to    olivia checked herself on a cautionary hint from henry and though she could not guess the motive of that hint as the name of the dogs owner was no longer proscribed her henrys wishes were always followed by prompt and smiling obedience  as sir armine advanced toward little fitz henrys agitation was so extreme he involuntarily took hold of his fathers coat to prevent his examining the collar  olivia was taken up with considering the beauty of the animal so that henrys situation escaped her  but sir armine gave him such an interrogating look as sent his very blood into his face to answer it  let me see olivia said sir armine stooping down as if to read the engraved letters  indeed you must not sir cried olivia turning the collar round till the engraved part was hid under the dogs throat  dear sir he does not choose to tell the name of his owner besides it is a family secret  or perhaps he means to change his situation  then he ought to bring a character from his last place said lady fitzorton now first joining in the discourse  very true said mr clare  so pray mr whatsyourname whom do you belong to  dont mention sir guise say he belongs to caroline  whispered olivia to henry and  and    judge reader if this was not helping this lame dog over the style with a vengeance  if you must know  said olivia  the little fellow belongs to miss stuart only you know we are not to talk about it as perhaps some other persons name may be on the collar  and though i know you are all too good to turn your enemys dog out of doorswithout his breakfast i  i  in short i had half a mind to steal him and love him for his mistresses sake  if you will but help me out this will do nicely  added olivia to henry  not in a stage whisper  miss stuart  said mr clare  then you ought i am sure to be jealous either of the dog or his mistress for i saw henry almost devouring him with kisses  and i could kiss him myself  said olivia  for he is a dear and a love and if i did not think it would break miss stuarts heart i would steal him yes i would you dear thing added olivia renewing her caresses  not that i saw henry kiss him at all  it was something else i saw him kiss  the bloom which accompanied this observation covered the cheeks of olivia and was inexpressibly beautiful  admitted said mrclare pleasantly  but methinks a lover of mine would not a little anger me if he were to salute the prettiest cur in the world and my picture in the same breath  however as that is your business not mine you must even settle it between you  let you and i lady fitzorton finish our breakfast as fast as we can and go on with our conversation which as is but too often the case a puppy in favor has interrupted  with all these reliefs henry had collection enough to say the dog was a favorite at the abbey from whence it had followed him as it had done more than once before though not perhaps noticed  but that as often as it did he sent it back immediately knowing what search there would be after it  as he should have done now had he discovered it in time  henry now patted the dogs head  and said he supposed if he did not send or take it back soon there would be a searchwarrant after it  breakfast now went on smoothly except that sir armine and henry rather overacted their parts  the former being too talkative and the latter too taciturn  yet both equally anxious to conceal their sensations  the engraving luckily escaped  for the collar bore these words  little fitz the gift of henry to caroline  mr clare and lady fitzorton disappeared  olivia soon followed and ran up stairs with the spaniel in her arms  and almost in the same instant she had so done true george came whistling through the hall calling at every step little fitz  little fitz  the door of the breakfast parlour being left open george came to the threshold put his head into the room still whistling for and calling after little fitz  what is that you say  questioned sir armine  about fitz  george instantly perceived his error and trying to repair it answered  nothing ant please your honor  but that i was looking for the little spaniel that had strayed from the abbey and i was saying to myself says i god forgive me for fibbing aside if he should be lost the person he belongs to might go into fits  that is all your honor  and  and  jenny atwood said  she thought she knew the dog and  and had a bit of a fancy to see him againyour honor  that is all  and that is enough said sir armine  go and shut the door after you  george obeyed the word of command in much perturbation  sir armine spoke sternly and rose himself to shut the door even while he was giving orders  chapter xxxi henry i wish to look at olivias miniature  that which john painted for you  forgetting perhaps in his confusion he had left it with caroline for a purpose the reader may remember henry put his hand into his pocket as if to feel for it and not finding it there his agitation increased  i  i  i  must have left it sir stammered henry  i mean that said sir armine on which you bestowed as your mother told me so many caresses this morning  that sir cried henry his breath almost gone  the same rejoined his father  mr clare asserted you have heard it more than divided with you the fondness you discovered for miss stuarts spaniel  heaven sir what a comparison said henry with vehemence  spaniel  yes little fitz observed sir armine looking searchingly at henry  but to leave comparisons fetch me the picture  perhaps it may be left in your chamber it may be even at this moment on your pillow  it ought by the laws of love let the original be who she may  here his eyes seemed to penetrate into the very heart of his son  it ought i say to be always within reach of your lips perhaps it is so now  your bosom companion let us see and pray sir what is this  his father pointed to a small piece of ribbon which had perhaps in his endeavor to conceal it from the party who surprised him at his chamber door insinuated itself on the wrong side of henrys shirt and pulling at it abruptly that bosomsecret which had literally been so long suspended would then have come forth and carolines wellpainted resemblance stood confessed had not a little contest ensued between the parties  henry defended the passes to his breast with his hand which grasped the frill of his shirt and perhaps the mystery underneath it  sir armine renewed the attack saying sarcastically  what can be the meaning of all this  is it not olivias  is it not the counterfeit presentment of one who is alike dear to us both  the fair object of the fathers choice as well as the sons what other could be cherished in henrys bosom  is it not olivia clares and if i am any longer denied the pleasure of paying it my tender respects i shall ring for olivia herself and ask her consent  sir armine without letting go his hold made a step or two toward the bell  henry aiding his fathers intentions tore open his shirt in a kind of phrenzy and cried it must  it must be explained the hour is come  thank heaven the hour is come  i am the sport of every accident and will here accumulate or put an end to my misery and all its mysteries at once  have a care said his father preventing henrys design  have a care your fathers happiness your fathers life and not singly his but the happiness and life of a man venerable as myself of her likewise who gave life to you  and more than the existence probably the selfdestruction of the innocent olivia    sir armine panted and paused  these my son are in your hands as entirely as if you were our fate  beware then  i tremble at the omens i have just seen  deep plots are discovered by trifling occurrences  heaven forbid i should be right in my present forebodings  oh if i were  sir armines looks and accents seemed to anticipate and confirm the sentiments he was about to utter  if i were loss of fortune and of life would be as the tender mercies of god compared to what is reserved for the houses of clare and fitzorton  henry falling at sir armines feet exclaimed that god is my witness sir  if the loss of my life could prolong the happiness of yours and of my mothers but one day  with a prayer as earnest as ever came from the heart of man i would invoke my death this moment  invoke it thus on my knees a posture befitting a son to receive it  but there are circumstances which would make my existence so hateful so dishonorable in my own eyes  this picture sir could it speak   here he drew it half from his bosom  forbear henry forbear answered sir armine closing his eyes and averting his head  i will not look on any thing that may    i have forborne too long resumed the madding henry  enthralled by inexplicable events i have been too long involved in a thorny labyrinth  and this o my honored my almost adored father  this is the crisis at which i must force my way out of it  hear me sir hear me with patience pity and parental love while i confess  while i explain by what a series of unavoidable delays entanglements and almost more than human interventions i have day after day onward to weeks months years  to the desolation of health happiness all offices all studies even the most sacred    henry interposed sir armine  let me not listen to what would must and ought to turn that heart against you  where perhaps i ought to blush while i confess you have been from the hour of your birth to this moment the most cherished of human beings  if you have in your bosom any passion which has made its way by stealth to effect the havoc of soul and body and derange every pursuit of duty and devotion  and if you rashly carry the resemblance of the unhappy illfated object of that passion in your breast  let the consideration you owe to the united lives and fortunes of united families  to your religion and to your god whose ministry you have promised to assist though even that promise seems forgotten  let all these sacred motives aid you to expel the intruder  i was silent sir interrupted henry  because i could not explain  but i did not promise    it is still in your power to derive additional virtue from the very sufferings by which such complicated misery to the aged and to the young may be prevented resumed sir armine  for my own part i here declare to you dearest henry that were my individual felicity were my single life the only points of destruction which would result from what i tremble to name i would give up that felicity and that life a sacrifice to you  a willing sacrifice  it is enough my son i will not expatiate i will not remonstrate or reason  any attempt to subdue you by the force of argument would lessen you in your own eyes even more perhaps than they would disgrace you in mine  i would rather leave every thing to your own graceful duty and good principles  and that i may give you an opportunity of exerting these i thus raise you from the earth fold you in my arms and leave with you in trust  what  all that ought to be most important to you on earth  in vain did henry attempt to detain his father  in vain did he struggle in his embraces  in vain lift up his streaming eyes and exclaim cruel cruel perversity of fortune  detested dissensions which have thus placed one duty in opposition to another  accursed domestic feuds which set even the virtues at variance with each other  at the end of these disordered and almost frantic ejaculations sir armine cried out i have heard too much  half of this indecent violence would distract the rest of my family and murder olivia  he then rushed out of the room  perhaps forgetting he had been exhausting himself in similar paroxysms  chapter xxxii by means so apparently insignificant was this longdelayed and longprojected discovery brought about and sir armine was strongly confirmed in all his former suspicions by the simple circumstances of the miniature and the spaniel thus bad begun and worse remained behind for henry had hereby also more fully convinced himself that the disclosure was likely to be attended in its progress through the families with worse mischiefs than had resulted to them or to him even from the concealment disastrous as it had been  but one of these mischiefmakers namely little fitz was destined to be the small but important instrument of several other discoveries  for while henry was in the midst of the above distressing reflections olivia and her canine companion with whom she was by this time on the best terms possible returned into the breakfast parlour where she no sooner perceived henry alone than she took up the dog in her arms and said do you know my dear henry that this little fellow had like to have thrown poor jane atwood into hysterics  he followed me into her sittingroom where she and your good george were teteatete and on perceiving the dog she caught him up kissed him as much as we have done and said it was the very spaniel that was with miss stuart when she and sir guise paid her a visit in london and that she heard caroline say she would not have any thing happen to it for half her fathers estate adding that it followed her wherever she went and shared her very bed  but i have another reason for loving it said jane pray pardon me miss but what is constantly in the sight of  of  of an absent friend you know miss is always dear to us  her hesitation made it difficult for her to speak  i declare henry when i heard the poor girl say this  though i was sorry for having been the occasion of her shedding tears on a subject i have constantly endeavored to keep out of her mind  i loved her the better for her tenderness though i knew it was improper for her to indulge it  ah i know by my own feelings continued olivia that had you but touched a flower a leaf or the most trivial thing you can imagine my fancy and heart would hold it consecrated from that moment  and indeed it would be estimable beyond all price this locket for instance  though that is not a well chosen example either because it is not a trifle and is very dear  i have assured it of my affection a thousand thousand times  here she took what she described from her lovely bosom and forgot most likely for the instant that little fitz was in the world  i have heard or read henry continued she that it is unsafe or unwise  some have pronounced it foolish and philosophers i am told have called it indelicate  for a woman to express the extent of her tenderness to the man she loves even if he be most amiable  now that has always appeared very strange for it is one of the sweetest i feel likewise it is one of the most innocent pleasures of my life to declare how much i esteem love and honor my dearest henry  where can be the peril of trusting with all his powers the man who has long given you an equal degree of confidence and affection in return  i should hate myself if situated as we are i could coldly repress a sentiment the declaration of which might produce to henry but the smallest added proof of my attachment  but how i am running on  i know not whether you ought to be angry or love me the better for it  do set me right decide for me henry  before this question could be replied to true george came to say lieutenant stuart was in the blue room and begged to speak to squire henry before he paid his respects to the family  run to him this moment replied olivia  i see henry you are out of spirits  he and i will make you quite well and happy and if he assists me in doing that i will forgive him even for robbing me of this little fellow  for i foresee he will take him  but alas he is you say out of spirits too then i will nurse and comfort you both  be very particular in your enquiries about caroline henry  i suppose he is just come down but you drive every thing except yourself out of my head  i forgot that you must have seen him last night at the abbey  i wonder what he can have to say to you alone  shall i leave the dog  no  he will go with me you see  i declare caroline would be jealous of me if she were to know it  if you had but seen the face of true george when jane fondled the dog  i have no notion of people kissing puppy dogs muttered he  they could do no more to christians  but suppose we take off the little fellows collar  then you know sir armine   henry caught at the hint  slipped the strap from the buckle and put the telltale in his pocket  delightful cried the unsuspicious olivia  now i think we shall be a match for the old gentlemans curiosity but i have forgot to look myself  let me see  no  now i think of it your friend is waiting for you while i am prating she then exultingly left the room  the meeting of charles and henry was extremely affecting they ran into each others arms and forgot for a while their sorrows in their embraces  beloved unhappy friend cried charles  i feel that even hopeless love since you must have been innocent of my despair would have wanted power to dissolve our friendship  dissolve it  no  my poor breaking heart would rather have flown to that friendship for succor and support as the only good it could expect in the hour of its despair  but i do not despair henry for although i have heard seen and read all that might be distracting on this subject my friend  charles here held out a letter  still our fate is suspended by one precious hope    on that letter questioned henry  from my father replied charles  it proposes  in a language so humiliating indeed that though as i said all depends thereon i am at a loss whether as a son i ought to be the bearer  it proposes henry an accommodation between our houses on your fathers own terms  it paints in glowing colors regret for our long dissensions and holds out a general amnesty to each offending party  whatever be the result continued charles  the motive which led sir guise to this signal kindness has more than atoned for all that i have suffered from his former conduct and though i greatly fear because i greatly love lest his generous effort should be in vain  i shall remember the intention with my dying breath  yet wherefore should i entertain an unworthy doubt of the success  if the aggressor can sue for pardon the man whom he has offended can much more easily forget his wrongs  and sir armine fitzorton i trust    alas interposed henry i have to paint a scene which blasts that hope in the bud  he now related what had recently past with sir armine in consequence of the discoveries brought about by carolines miniature and little fitz and added thereto by way of filling up the gap in their history all that had fallen out to oppose the progress of their illfated loves since they parted  when he had closed the narrative  at several passages in which charles shuddered with apprehension especially at the proofs of olivias rooted attachment to his friend though henry mentioned as few instances of these and touched those few as lightly as possible  charles exclaimed notwithstanding all this something whispers me a sudden and unforeseen good will result from the operation of this epistle on a heart so noble as your fathers consider my friend we live in a world of wonderful revolutions and amongst the infinity of changes and chances that surround us on all hands who can tell but from this source may spring my happiness with olivia and yours with caroline  until the mention of carolines name as a party in this matter henry notwithstanding the constitutional and habitual intemperance of all his feelings could not help considering his friends hopes as the mere offspring of a mind violently agitated by the passion that most strongly believes it can reconcile impossibilities but now he found out all at once there was much sound reasoning in his friends observations and he indulged a credulity that showed he was again in a disposition to believe every thing practicable which favored his ruling passion he exclaimed oh my friend if the exertions of your now generous father should have influence with mine  and if the same kind star that induced the divine caroline to look favorably on me should dispose the gentle olivia at length to incline an auspicious ear to the suit of my friend    o if such bliss should be in store for us interrupted charles for i can with truth inform you henry that my sisters affection for you in despite of all that has past is greater than  in short nothing but the returns which are made by your own heart  and the ardent and unspeakable tenderness with which mine throbs for olivia can truly indicate how much you are beloved by caroline stuart  let us lose no time exclaimed henry with the utmost impatience sir armine ought to have had the important letter long ago give it me my friend  no  deliver it yourself  yet that may not be right  let us think a moment what is best to be done  a gentle tap was now given at the door on opening which a voice more gentle than the summons said  forgive my interruption of you dear friends but i long to ask mr stuart how he does and it is not fair of you henry to keep him all to yourself in this manner when i will answer for the whole family being rejoiced to see him  as well as this little fellow pointing to fitz  who you see asserts his claims to a share of his company as well as you mr henry  this sportive reproach ensured the fair speaker a cordial welcome and both the friends seemed to be animated by the same sentiment namely that of making olivia a party in the reconciliation for they both exclaimed at the same instant with very little variation in the expression and both with equal fervor good heaven who so proper so likely as miss clare to assist us with her counsel in this exigence  i beg repeated olivia instantly to be made acquainted with the nature of it if either of you suppose there is a probability of my being useful henry perceiving his friend too much agitated by the presence of his beloved mistress to proceed informed olivia of sir guises wish of being reconciled to the family and his almost supplicatory letter to effect it  and who can tell lovely creature said charles almost forgetting himself but that if it were presented and supported by such an advocate it might succeed and then    and then exclaimed olivia it would make us three of the happiest of families in the world you know i dare say mr stuart your friend henry who i suppose keeps nothing from you told you my heart throbs again to embrace my ever remembered caroline methinks i seel for her a sisters love  a sisters ejaculated charles good heavens  what a thought  i will pledge all my hopes of happiness here and hereafter she would rejoice to call you by that endearing name  do you think so said olivia  then we shall be all as one family and this little fellow too added she patting the dog upon the head  see here is the dear creatures spaniel  make much of him mr stuart  if he could tell your sister how i have fondled him  you know the old proverb  but what have i to do with proverbs at such a time as this  i see you are both ready to quarrel with me for loitering on my commission  prosper it good heaven  give me the letter then this moment  give me the letter this moment added olivia taking it from the trembling charles and i could almost worship the hand of the bearer of such overtures  the sweet girl held her own hand in a way that would have made a novice in the little courtesies of life understand that it might be seized with impunity charles conveyed it in a disordered manner to his lips from which olivia drew it away and left the room saying you young soldiers are so used to carry every thing by storm that the destined object of your attack has no hope of escaping when it is a poor damsel like myself but by running away  now though all this was only the play of a friendly and benevolent heart happy at every prospect of promoting happiness and at being chosen as the instrument to reconcile alienated minds the two friends were no sooner left again to a teteatete than they derived even from the alacrity of their embassadress a fresh supply of hopes that fortune was turning in their favor  charles was too much transported with his having almost for the first time ravished or rather received as a freewilloffering the beautiful hand of his mistress to think of or feel any thing but the tumult into which it had thrown him  he therefore only seized the hand of his friend and carrying it to that side where nature has thought proper to place the heart  he cried  god of feeling how it beats  did you ever feel any thing like it henry to which question his friend observed in the words of his favorite shakespeare there is a tide in the affairs of men perhaps charles we have now taken it at the flood and if so it will lead on to more than fortune  in honest prose his friend assured him he was almost weak enough to subscribe to his opinion they then proceeded to increase this delightful phrenzy by every means in their power superstition itself is not more credulous than love when in the very bosom of despair hope as if by stealth darts but one ray upon it  and if after all our disappointments cried henry whose heart was an admirable sophist and could when warmed overturn the most elaborate philosophy and reasoning if after all our miseries this unexpected chance should be the groundwork of that temple of felicity to which we might at length conduct our destined brides  shall we not   shall we not both go out of our senses with joy questioned charles brides o henry how often have we known one happy change lead on and prove as it were the harbinger to another and when fortune does bring her atonements she is frequently like a long tyrannous but at length yielding mistress as kind as she had been cruel  the selfdeluding friends then enumerated all the instances their memories could furnish of one unexpected piece of good luck producing or having been followed up by others no less unlooked for charles related a story of two young people coming together whose parents friends and fortunes were all in opposition to their dearest hopes  henry bringing the matter more into point said he had read somewhere the history of a lady in love with a gentleman whose heart was otherwise engaged notwithstanding which after a course of hopeless years she was married to the object of her affections by an accident that had induced the gentleman to transfer his passion from his former love  and why should not this be the ultimate event in the case of charles and olivia  such was the romance of their hearts that they could not stop or indeed stoop to examine whether this was not a mere rhapsody of the affections in the heyday of youthful blood indeed the wisdom of reason and of common sense is so unwelcome and disgusting to lovers of this character when the heart is in this sort of delirium that it sincerely adopts the maxim of the poet by pronouncing it folly to be wise  chapter xxxiii to this delusion of a fond and lovesick imagination then did henry and his friend deliver themselves up so entirely that they had sketched out and communicated to each other several of the delicious plans of happiness which it was agreed upon should take place when charles became the husband of olivia and henry of caroline the soul of poesy was at work in the bosom of henry his fancy performed miracles his head and heart were both on fire the enraptured charles caught the flame and both enjoyed those painted clouds that beautify our days while reason halfblushing halfsmiling withdrew and that species of madness which indeed can never endure so stern a power resumed its reign the prospect of felicity seemed to approximate as our young friends looked upon it and to brighten as it advanced all the impediments which had so long stood like a dead wall of separation betwixt the abbey and castle were by the help of reconciling fancy removed and in its stead a verdant wall like that of paradise upreared its florid head the turrets seemed to smile on each other  the trees on each estate appeared once more to form their branches into truelovers knots and extend their marriageable arms till they embraced both houses the very flowers of the different gardens were as by instinctive amity disposed to waft fragrance to each other stealing and giving odours and that this courtesy might be the more expeditiously done henrys muse was commanded to create a zephyr on purpose commissioned to bear upon his balmy wing the rosy sweets of fitzorton to the abbey and with no less celerity to fly back with the violet perfumes of stuart meantime henry had stationed the loves and graces of which he had a warehouse in different parts of the groves and gardens to twist flowers and wreathe chaplets to adorn the brows of caroline and olivia nay he had placed cupid in one part of the forest aiming a new dart at the tender bosom of olivia in favor of charles and had set old hymen at work in the sacred form of sir armine to build a nuptial bower to be ready for that double marriage which was to complete such infinity of happiness  should thou reader be either a poet a lover or both thou will here exclaim if this be madness let me rave  but if thou art a reasoning being and wise that is cold enough to keep the track of common sense thou will pity or despise those distracted daydreamers and not being able to conceive any happiness in such phrenzy think bedlam or st lukes the only places proper to hold our two frantic young gentlemen  now as the frozen caucasus and the burning aetna do really exist in the natural world so do these opposite degrees of heat and cold in the human temperament  and as it would be no less impossible to convince thee of even the transitory rapture of being mentally distracted than to persuade the man of sanguine disposition  a charles or a henry  there was infinite gratification in carrying a lump of unthawed ice in the bosom by way of a heart  we shall attempt no means of reconciling such extremes  satisfied in our own mind that intense heat and cold have their separate and peculiar use in the little globe of mans nature  no less than in that great globe the world itself  thou know reader that greenland is a perfect bagnio to the temperature of the planet saturn to whom the sun himself appears but as a little pallid star and that its inhabitants would expire with heat in our coldest countries  while on the other hand mercury is so full of fire that the heat to which its supposed natives are accustomed is so excessive that the most glorious day here would be to them no more than declining twilight and they would be frozen to death in the torrid zone  if thou art saturnine therefore thou will not hesitate to pronounce our mercurial sparks absolutely mad and sit only to live in that planet which has been called the bedlam of the spheres  yet grudge not henry or his friend the momentary bliss they derived from this flame of their fancy although it may have raged in contrast with thy more sober matteroffact sensations  it was but as a meteor of the night that appeared and passed away making the darkness that followed the more horrible from the gleam and its coruscations  alas while these children of imagination were triumphing in the visionary happiness that blazed about their eyes reason and common sense assuming soon the shapes of a father and mother entered the apartment  sir armine held the opened letter of sir guise in his hand  i suppose said he addressing the youths  you are both acquainted with the contents your friendship no doubt indulges unlimited confidence and i take it for granted whatever is imparted to one is in effect communicated to both  upon henrys assuring him he had not seen the letter and that his friend had only partially mentioned the general purport sir armine gave it to henry desiring him to read it aloud  to sir armine fitzorton bart dear and longoffended neighbor this method of beginning may indicate the friendly disposition under which i write  both our sons as well as ourselves are the victims of our antipathy  they have pleaded so often for our reconcilement that i am unable any longer to resist their amicable intercessions  the bond of union may perhaps through the medium of our children be yet more cemented between our families after this reconciliation than if no fatal breach had ever happened   what does that mean questioned lady fitzorton looking at henry  henry directed his eyes to charles for the materials of an answer  but not finding any was silent and embarrassed for charles was at that instant consulting for a like reason the countenance of henry  proceed with the letter said sir armine  but more powerful advocates than even our sons have pleaded for putting an end to our family feuds  conscious feelings my good neighbor urge me to seek reconciliation  i have lifted  o it was foul my hand against mine ancient friend and i could even humble my unworthy self in the dust of the earth  should that have been said  at least in that grovelling way  by the father of a soldier asked sir armine darting his eye on charles  charles blushed  young soldier said sir armine let us quit this letter it will agonize you more than any wounds you could receive in the defense of your country i desire to converse with you on another subject  directly and at once therefore i shall demand of you in the presence of my wife who has an equal interest in the matter whether you have any knowledge of a correspondence which is said to subsist between your sister miss stuart and your friend here  he has sir answered henry relieving charles who stood irresolute  he has the most perfect knowledge of it and has done his utmost to    not to promote it certainly interrupted sir armine  he is of an honorable profession and incapable of clandestine baseness  baseness sir exclaimed charles reddening  yes young man returned sir armine  it would be the last excess of baseness to aid and abet an intercourse which would render every individual of this house except that rash boy unhappy and make him ungrateful and infamous you are aware of your friends solemn engagements to olivia  but he neglects her  his friends  his relations  his god  solemn engagements sir exclaimed henry  i know not of any i ever made to that lady they have all been taken for granted  and whatever may be the issue i here disclaim them  i here declare that my whole soul is has been and shall for ever be betrothed only to caroline stuart  even as firmly and irrevocably as is that of my friend charles to    henry checked himself a moment and then proceeded   yes wherefore should a virtuous but unfortunate passion be thus hid from those who ought earlier to have known it  lady fitzorton perceiving the emotions of sir armine were swelling into one of those dreadful extremities that sometimes tyrannized his bosom would have drawn him out of the room and made signs of silence to henry who too much stirred to regard them with his usual respect exclaimed  no madam silence has already wrought this mighty complication of mischief and mistake  let me hear all let me hear all cries sir armine his articulation almost buried in his sensations  it is heard in a sentence replied henry throwing himself at his mothers feet  the sister of my friend is not more precious to your son than is olivia clare to   to whom questioned sir armine staring wildly and stammering violently  to the unhappy wretch who now throws himself upon your mercy answered charles falling on his knees before sir armine  miserable that i am  the flame has long been consuming my vitals and the life and death of us all depend upon some sudden changes in our favor  a sudden change will soon take place exclaimed lady fitzorton  look at my poor husband you have already deprived him of speech  you will destroy him between you but his death shall be upon your heads  i shall not die said sir armine exerting himself after a deep struggle that shook his venerable frame as if he were contending with death himself  i will not die the young assassins shall not have that satisfaction  he paused for breath  then i am to understand sir continued sir armine recovering his utterance and staggering toward charles that you and my son have availed yourselves of my permission to carry on your friendship for each other independent of my just resentment elsewhere  i say i am to understand    no sir interposed charles still keeping his humble posture  i have never yet dared to breathe my unhappy passion for miss clare to herself or to any other person but my friend till within these few hours even the sister of my heart from whom nothing was ever shut out before did not suspect it  that is still something answered sir armine in a tone much softened  henry still kneeling perceived the favorable moment and applied his whole artillery of moving eloquence in the cause of himself and friend  he briefly recapitulated the most important parts of the mysterious history of their unhappy loves  he set the honor generosity and heroic virtues of charles in the most affecting points of view and concluded his harangue by observing while he held the lieutenant by the hand  that if his father and mother were disposed to prevent unheard of horror from overwhelming all parties it could be done only by devising some means to bring about the double nuptials on which they had set their hearts  any thing short of which says henry i foresee will bring desolation upon the three houses  desolation which as an earthquake shall swallow them  lady fitzorton whose affections were much moved tenderly wept over the young men  sir armine gave a hand to each of the youths and raising them up addressed them trembling as he spoke yet his manner and tone of voice determined  suspect your enemy when he brings gifts and have a doubly guarded eye upon your ancient foe when he suddenly changes his frowns into smiles are long established maxims  how far these are applicable to sir guise stuart in his labored professions i presume not to say  as for you charles when i have told you that added to former impediments you must pass to the arms of olivia clare through the blood of her father my own and the life of this afflicted woman  i shall point to you the alternative of an honorable action which will justify the trust i have long reposed in your assertions however i may suspect the asseveration of others  charles eagerly desired a farther explanation  save us dear youth  save yourself your sister and your bosom friend said sir armine  by retreating from if you cannot conquer a passion which it is impossible without violating every law of friendship and hospitality to indulge  nay which were it sanctioned by our united suffrages and assistance could not prosper with olivia whose happiness and life are contracted to your friend  charles fetched a deep sigh and shook his head as if to express at once the difficulty of complying with the request and the too evident strength of argument in the observation  having done this continued sir armine  your virtue will be complete for you will have done all that in you lies to alienate this infatuated boy from farther pursuit of a sister whose very tenderness in this case calls upon you to rescue her from herself  for inasmuch as she loves must she be wretched  as it is no less impossible for her to be married to my son than for you to wed mr clares daughter  unless at the sacrifice of every thing in this world that ought most to be valued by an honest man  perceiving charles was absorbed in grief and that henry was about to speak   as to you henry i have to trouble you with a very few words  let not your friend who i see is contending with himself but whose virtue will triumph in the end  let him not surpass you  emulate him  your parents aged and infirm are before you  your union with miss stuart would destroy both would murder olivia and therefore make caroline far more wretched than the disappointment of her passion  dear  dear son  child of my heart  most favored  most precious  save your family  you know not half the claims that olivia has upon you though you know they are manifold  i will not in this moment disguise that her father has preserved yours preserved him from unexpected but utter ruin  from imprisonment  behold your weeping mother is borne down with sorrow with love with gratitude  behold she kneels kneels to her son  your father joins her petitions in a posture no less suppliant  must we both supplicate in vain  alas look upon us my son  the venerable pair were almost suffocated with their sensations  charles raised lady fitzorton  henry lifted his father from the ground into his arms exclaiming as he held him in his embrace  live live my father  let me alone be the sacrifice  it shall be so  most willingly will i be the victim  do with me as you both see fit here he embraced his mother dispose of my hand my life to your wish  i will not murmur no destiny no agony can equal what i at this moment feel at seeing you in such a situation and yet my friend  my poor friend    henry left his mother and ran into the open arms of charles  take no thought of me exclaimed his friend i cannot bear to witness much less to create a scene like that which yet pierces my soul  i will banish myself for ever  my own sword should end me if i could be the cause of such another to those who ought to have shut the door which they threw wide open to give me welcome  sir  madam continued charles as olivia knows not yet of my unhappy love i here swear to you  although it may and i hope it will break my heart  i swear never  never    charles answered sir armine  i will have you bound only by the sacred ties of your own reason friendship and honor  and thus from my inmost soul do i pour out my thanks  in which are included said lady fitzorton my heartfelt acknowledgments  my house is your own cries sir armine when your visits afflict you or interrupt the generous task you have imposed on yourself you shall be free to depart unquestioned and whenever you return our smiles shall welcome you  neither shall henry be restrained from the abbey  we submit him to your protection to the guard of his own duty wisdom and virtue and to the sacred office for which he will now again prepare his head and heart  we yield him to the counsels of caroline stuart herself who from those traits of character and conduct you have at different times related will i am sure when you explain to her more fully our situations help us  even against herself  another word and i have done added sir armine  the care with which the fatal mysteries that have entangled us has been guarded from olivia and her father my best benefactor my preserver  i consider as more than chance  as providence  if the peace of innocence be dear oh be jealous of dropping a hint that may lead to any discovery of what has past between us this day  but let us part we may be surprised  do not be seen at present henry and do you dear charles take to your father my best acknowledgments of his letter to which i will return an early answer  it shall be such i pledge myself as is consistent with the new system of goodwill i hope mutually sincere that again subsists between us  but in the meantime i wish you both to peruse this paper and to give me when opportunity favors your joint opinion of it  hush i think i heard olivias voice said lady fitzorton  i got her to write some visiting cards for our next weeks annual party thinking she might be securely employed in that manner while our conversation which i foresaw would be interesting lasted  perhaps she has finished and is returning  let us separate said sir armine who led lady fitzorton out of the room leaving charles and henry again together  chapter xxxiv deprived for some time of the power of speaking to each other henry and charles could only express by signs a mutual desire of perusing the paper left in their hands henry opened it and found the obligation mentioned by his father  it consisted in mr clares having advanced no less a sum than fifty thousand pounds to replace the amount of what sir armine had lost within the past week by the failure of a banker whose credit he had generously attempted to save in the hour of an exigence that threatened destruction to himself and a whole family  to prevent this threatened ruin sir armine who had been long in friendship with the banker put himself to the last difficulty but had scarce effected the accommodation before the banker was declared insolvent and the news getting air the person of whom sir armine borrowed the money made sudden claim for a return of the sum which was only borrowed for one and twenty days to cover sudden losses which the banker had himself sustained in this extremity sir armine confided the case to mr clare who immediately deposited the money insisting it should not be considered as any part of olivias independent fortune but what it had been his solemn design out of his distinct property to leave to his oldest dearest friend in case he should be his survivor and if not to be divided equally between his young friends james and john  mr clare had farther said that as sir armine had informed him he had no way of paying off the sum borrowed but by trenching on those independencies which though duteously surrendered he knew his old friend considered only as a more solemn trust  the advance of what he mr clare had willed to be presented after death would better be offered now which you know my friend added mr clare  will give me an opportunity of seeing an important article of my last will and testament performed in my lifetime  besides making olivia one of the happiest girls in the world for to tell you the truth this is one of her plans after i had thrice refused the offer of her own fortune but that i have determined must come clear to one whom i have long considered as her husband  both the young men were greatly affected at this act of generosity on the part of mr clare and were not so blinded by their passion as not to feel it was a natural and strong though not perhaps altogether justifiable inducement in mr fitzorton to promote the match between henry and olivia  for indeed there is not any degree of family distress though it may be pleaded as a palliative can be admitted as a justification  following therefore the impulse of a similar sensation they mutually deplored the cruel destiny which did not give them an apparent pretense to censure the event of which they were to be the victims  on the contrary they seemed to catch the spirit of chivalry which characterized the action of the good old clare and warming by degrees they worked themselves up to such a sense of the conduct they ought to pursue that each resolved to strong then the other to the performance of the promise made to sir armine and lady fitzorton  and thus for a time in this wellconducted victory over themselves they forgot that they were still passionate lovers  alas how nature plays with her children she seems to rank them even amongst her sports  in the midst of all this heroism a small circumstance happened to convince the heroes that theoretical and practical philosophy are somewhat different  charles had a glimpse of olivia and henry of carolines little spaniel exactly as they had settled their point of resolution  the sight of these objects shook the goodly fabric which imagination had reared in their hearts and from the pride of victors they sunk in a moment to the condition of the captive that had only been dreaming he was free  must i resign thee beautiful olivia sighed charles  must i then relinquish the very hope of thy ever being mine  o thou envied little animal exclaimed henry to the spaniel  how will thou be fondled by my souls dear caroline while i  must no more indulge the thought even that i am beloved  then as if by sympathy both the youths embracing they came to another settled point namely that they were a couple of miserable fellows who had nothing left in the world that took the shape of consolation but that one was as wretched as the other  a conclusion which though not perhaps strictly generous has been often thought comfortable  proceeding possibly from a social idea for few can bear to be happy or sorrowful alone  olivia and her canine companion soon joined the young gentlemen  she was delighted to see them hand in hand which she considered as the result of their mutual happiness  her spaniel enraptured to behold two of his best friends leaped alternately upon them with every demonstration of gratitude and joy but more especially upon henry who we believe was of the two the greater favorite and henry in turn received him with undiminished affection and indeed appeared to be either for his own sake or some other persons more fond of him than ever  olivia with an air of pleasantry counterfeiting mortification declared that she should now in reality be jealous and would therefore the less reluctantly suffer charles to take her rival back to his mistress for said she to charles  you see plainly the little seducer receives henrys first attentions and i shall presently be but a secondary object  to confess the truth said olivia  i am a little jealous of you too mr stuart for you and your friend in your last interview with sir armine and lady fitzorton  who by the bye insidiously kept me out of their party  have contrived to run away with their hearts in a manner that throws poor olivia and the rest of the family in shadow quite into the back ground of our domestic groupe  nothing now forsooth but the praises of the two inseparables henry and charles has for the last half hour been heard through the castle  they are the best the noblest young men in the world says the old lady  excellent youths cries the old gentleman  why what have you done to deserve all these fine things  but do not tell me  i hate secrets  the knowledge of them would only serve to increase my jealousy for i suppose i should have the mortification to find you have done every thing to effect the charming reconciliation which i find is to take place between our families and i have been only the lettercarrier you the ambassadors  and you are to know i am of so perverse a disposition that i quarrel with the happiness of my best friends unless i have been some way aye and importantly the medium  the friends consulted each others looks  yes you may plot and lay your wise heads together against a poor feeble woman resumed olivia  but i will have my revenge yet and with interest too  for when we are all again as we should be i am determined there shall not happen a single thought or word that shall make any one of us wish to part again except under the assurance of a speedy return to each other for the rest of our lives  so that being the case i shall now go to your father and mother whom i left in the garden mr henry  and see if i can get back some of my stolen goods  a little bit of their hearts again  meantime added she as she was quiting the apartment  do not forget mr stuart to tell your sister that if she be but half as happy as i am at the prospect of our amicable association she will be almost as blessed as i wish her to be  not that i should be quite contented till she was as happy as myself either  as to you little mr fitz  but you know my mind already and so this parting caress and adieu sir  little is that reader skilled in the history of the human heart who cannot suggest to himself the additional dilemma into which the two friends were thrown by this animated harangue  when olivia had departed henry caught hold of little fitz and turning to his friend observed from the bottom of my soul my unhappy charles i regret that you and i ever came into the world  would to heaven we were both out of it my dear henry answered charles  if we were both dead all would be very well said henry  you are perfectly in the right answered charles  henry seemed solemnly to recur to a suspended idea the expressions were trite and if considered as the language of despairing lovers are ludicrous and unmeaning  but on the part of henry they betrayed the image that was but too deeply rooted in his mind  the lietenant after a mournful pause observed that as either way they must be both miserable it would be better for only two persons to suffer than to increase the number of victims hereupon henry who had been holding the silken ears of carolines spaniel to his cheek and wiping away the tears which had dropped upon them very gravely demanded of charles what was his opinion of suicide  to speak of it professionally i think it the worst sort of desertion and flying ones country answered charles  to speak of it morally i feel it to be sinful  in sorrow as in joy such have ever been my sentiments  i wish we were both in our graves my friend with all my soul but i do not hold it right to gratify this wish by shortening our lives death would be a blessing but could it be purchased by an action accursed  henry gave a sort of dissentient shake of the head but dropped the subject  i can endure this house no longer at present said charles  and will therefore go home  but without any hope of greater happiness when i get there  i will attend you  part  of  the way says henry stammeringly dividing his sentence  they went out and little fitz was still in the arms of henry scarce had they reached the park when charles asked whether the family would not think it somewhat rude to go without his taking leave  very ill bred certainly do not you think so my dear henry  and he was walking again toward the house without waiting for henrys reply then as if changing his mind he turned and took the path to the abbey saying with a dejected voice it was not material  they now walked arm in arm and little fitz being set down ranged the hedgerows and traversed the grounds  far the happiest being of the trio  they soon gained the nevertobeforgotten grand avenue from which the abbey and the castle could be viewed distinctly in all their parts  it would be no easy matter to decide whether henry gazed more earnestly at the one or charles at the other they both stood fixed midway betwixt both edifices employing themselves with the view of objects in the most opposite directions and after feeding their separate unhappiness by all those tender thoughts which they had resolved but a few minutes before to consider as the forbidden fruit of their heart and therefore never to be tasted  charles declared that this nursing an unfortunate passion was extremely wrong and if they were wise they were now taking their last look of the devoted castle and the illfated abbey  very true said henry  here then let us  yes  after we have taken another look let us separate  at least for the present  no  added he  i will go with you my friend just as far as those trees on the left  for there  and then  and then    yes observed charles gazing  true my friend and  th  the  then    henry absolutely stuttered and was dragging at the arm of charles as he spoke  charles in the same degree hanging back as the other pressed forwards just as this seesaw situation ended charles recollected he had left his stick at the castle but protested he would not lose it for the world it was a gift  one of his gloves too was missing  this indeed he had the instant before taken off and put into his pocket  so he strode back some paces pulling his friend whose turn it now was to linger behind  they will be taken care of said henry  you will walk over again soon you know or  or  or i can bring  bring  bring them  myself  to the ab  ab  abbey   i walk over again to the castle  you bring them to the abbey  alas my friend have you so soon forgot our solemn resolutions  exert yourself cried charles  bravely  what a noble pile is fitzorton castle my friend  the abbey methinks is a more attractive object  such grandeur so many awful charms  so many  only look at it as the sun falls on the western turrets  a long and eternal adieu thou sacred mansion farewell for ever  henry walked toward it with hasty strides all the while he was speaking  yes adieu thou venerable edifice whose very ruins are dear to my soul  and ye o conscious woods who have often witnessed my sighs and tears  my fervent vows and bitter execrations against persecuting fortune  but chiefly thou oh heartenshrined bower  henry quickened his steps till he almost ran  thou receivedst my first trembling declarations of a passion that has not hitherto for one moment continued he  and shall never quit my troubled breast  and thou oh wellremembered tree whose tender bark is still i trust faithful to those names which alas must never never be united   the spirits of passion and of poesy were now at work and henry desirous that his feet and tongue should keep pace with each other had got to the side of the very tree of which he had been so pathetically taking an everlasting leave  when happening  then for the first time since his soliloquy began  to recollect his friend he turned round and saw that no less distracted lover going as fast as his legs could carry him in the contrary direction toward the castle to bid as affectionate and as eternal an adieu to its appreciated objects  henry exalted his voice and assured his friend he was going the wrong way  which charles retorted upon henry  and thus they stood for a considerable time hallooing and beckoning to each other each steady to follow that part of the compass to which his own affections pointed  alas the abbey and castle were as the opposite poles  henry and his friend the attracted needles  chapter xxxv while they were vibrating to their different points little fitz whom fate seems to have intended as the small but important instrument of many a great event in this history was heard to give tongue and chase a hare which he had started at full cry till all the woods of stuart were made vocal with his music  the animal took up the great avenue and seeing the unequal enemy she had to contend with rather played with her slender legs than put them on the stretch keeping only at a safe distance before the panting little fitz as if she intended to afford him diversion  henry taken by surprise though not a great admirer of the chase now followed the sport and by turning toward the same side of the hedge with the hare whenever she deviated from the track that led immediately to the abbey seemed to wish she would keep the straight road while charles who came slowly after perhaps would have been better pleased had she taken her course toward the castle  it was however decreed that the abbey should now be the asylum for the poor hare and having reached the gate of entrance she sprung through a wellknown meuse formed among some bushes that clustered at the bottom of the avenue and notwithstanding the utmost efforts of little fitz was soon lost in the windings of the forest  the hue and cry of the spaniel however and of henry who though on very different motives was not less vociferous had not only brought forth into the front garden that faced the grand avenue several other fourfooted lovers of the sport who swelled the thunder of the woods at they knew not what but alarmed sir guise honest dennison and lastly caroline herself who all ran to the iron railing to see what was the matter  henry who was very conveniently for his embarrassment out of breath from his pursuit explained the circumstance and was relating the heroic achievements of little fitz  accounting at the same time to caroline for his delay when the courageous animal came panting into the garden where hardly finding breath to express his transports at being restored to his mistress he threw himself on his side upon one of the grass plats and still the most happy of the groupe recovered his strength and spirits at leisure  presently after arrived the tardy charles and when dennison had consulted the countenances of the whole company and seeing nothing there either particularly to delight or to distress him he patted little fitz on the head telling him puss had led him a fine dance and like many other fine folks had made a fool of him at last and with this pithy remark the good old man withdrew  there never perhaps was exhibited in any four faces more characteristic impatience than in those of the party then present  henry and charles to disguise their secret emotions  sir guise and caroline to discover them  this threw them all into very awkward situations  caroline from certain clouds not unattended with showers that gathered and fell involuntarily on the features of henry was afraid to ask any questions and charles whispering her not to be inquisitive observed that ill tidings always arrived too soon augmented her distress  at length sir guise counterfeiting a generous anxiety to know the result of his advances to reconcilement and expatiating on the ardent desire he felt to complete the good work he had begun insisted upon his sons telling him how his overtures had been received  charles made shift to acquaint him with the truth so far as his father was concerned  he said that sir armine received them with proper kindness and would be as ready to conciliate as sir guise  henry finding that his friend got through this garbled relation but very lamely offered him a helping hand by taking up the narrative and carrying it on so far as had any relation to olivias amicable message to caroline  but henry was not more successful than his friend for though he likewise indulged pretty copiously in mental reservations the difficulty which he found to separate what was unfit for communication from what might safely be divulged rendered the whole story so dismembered and incongruous that a far less discerning spectator than either the baronet or his daughter might easily conceive there was a great deal more hid than there had been discovered  sir guise therefore choosing to interpret their confusion to a dislike of relating all that had past thought fit to act the part of the man of violated feelings and nice honor and to exclaim very well i see how it is  i have been insulted  my foolish goodnature has been rejected  i might have expected as much indeed  but you would overruled me  you know your influence and see the consequence of it  however thank heaven i have the consolation to suffer this fresh outrage for my childrens sake and so i submit  but methinks when i condescended to make the first advances toward the castle your father young gentleman should not have driven me back to the abbey with disgrace or have himself retreated  henry was about to reply and with some generous warmth in defense of his father  from a tender love of whom no sufferings of his own though proceeding from that father could detach him  when charles who was a young man of high honor and exalted principles felt it an incumbent duty to take the justification of sir armine upon himself sir said he the overtures you offered were as i before observerd received with suitable kindness and i am convinced your visit will be returned with a confirmation of the most hospitable assurances  but    but what questioned sir guise  henry who presaged some possible good from concealing and much positive mischief from divulging all that might naturally be supposed to follow observed in an abrupt manner that nothing had passed between his father and friend any way inconsistent with  that is  as to that  he only meant  he could assure sir guise as to what had past  nothing material relative thereto he could take on himself to say  in regard to the circumstances which    mr fitzorton interposed the baronet your attempts to explain away the repulse i have met with from your family are as generous as they are unsatisfactory there is at the bottom of all this a something    caroline interrupted the father discussion of this matter by declaring she was suddenly seized with so dreadful a giddiness that if she did not hurry into the house she should certainly tumble indeed her whole appearance but too clearly confirmed the description of her situation she was with difficulty conducted to the abbey under the supports of henry and charles  the former pressing her to his heart and whispering a thousand tendernesses in her ear as they passed along to the total oblivion of every thing on earth but carolines anxiety and her brother scarce less affectionately tried to recover his sisters spirits for he now plainly saw that her disorder originated in the apprehensions of her mind as to what had past at the castle  sir guise stuart not being quite so much interested in or affected by these kind of disasters took a turn or two round the garden where we shall leave him to the only person he did really interest himself for  to himself  his afflicted daughter now in a voice of woe and terror called upon henry and her brother to unfold the dreadful mystery which lay hid behind or was partly seen struggling in their expressions what new grief has befallen us said she it cannot surpass what my despair suggests and i conjure you both by friendship love duty and all that is dear to us reveal the whole i know not wherefore i am thus affected but i feel as if something more terrible than any thing i have yet endured was about to involve us all  no said henry dropping suddenly on his knee no caroline neither father nor fate itself  i here solemnly swear    whatever be the nature of your oath it must not be made replied caroline nor could i hear it now  for so great alas is my present weakness that  o my father why when i had yielded myself up to the cold mandates of despair  why did you revive my hopes  or how knowing as i did the many insurmountable evils which environ all of us  ah how could i be so frantic  so    while she was proceeding in this apostrophe the venerable dennison made his appearance bearing two letters one of which he delivered to caroline the other he laid upon the table saying it was for sir guise  the baronet himself came in immediately after and charles desiring dennison to leave the room the rest of the party before assembled in the garden were now grouped in the great hall where caroline it being the first apartment had rested  although her strength appeared in the moment before to have left her she rallied sufficiently to break the seal of the abovementioned letter and was just about to read the contents when sir guise having with no less curiosity opened that which had been directed to himself read aloud what follows  premising that it came from the castle and appeared to be written by sir armine fitzorton  human attention or expectation never perhaps having been more fixed than during the perusal of this epistle we will assign it a distinct place  chapter xxxvi sir armine fitzorton and family receive sir guise stuarts advances to reconciliation with all the attention due to them and although some domestic concerns prevented an immediate reply in writing proper acknowledgments were dispatched by our friend charles whose many virtues we all hold in high regard and sir armine for himself and his family in which he includes by authority that of the clares now assures sir guise his welcome to the castle shall be no less cordial than they expect to find at the abbey and that the first visit shall be left to his own nomination as soon as he pleases after an event arranging between the families of fitzorton and clare has taken place which it is now expected to do in the course of a few days  the consternation of henry and charles while the baronet read this card could be surpassed only by that which like a hurricane shook the frame of caroline on hearing the last passage she dropped the paper which had long trembled in her hand upon the floor and sinking herself after it cried out in a feeble yet agonized and interrupted voice in  a  few  a  a  very  few days  henrys eye caught the superscription of the card which was addressed to caroline and perceived the hand writing of olivia he would hereupon have glided it into his pocket to prevent at least farther mischief but sir guise with a solicitude truly characteristic of his paternal feelings  wounded no doubt at seeing his now beloved daughter in such profound affiction observed that as it was possible the contents of the second might serve as an antidote to the poison of the first paper he must gently insist on reading it  henry stood by carolines side hovering between sense and insanity  charles was in a kind of stupor perhaps at that time friendly to his reason and caroline seemed to shudder betwixt life and death  to miss stuart  the customs of the world require that i should begin and end my introductory letter with certain prescriptive formalities but in the first place can i consider caroline stuart as a stranger when even in our almost infant days i bore to her a sisters love and have since been intimately acquainted with her virtues and as long have loved and honored her for them and indeed i am so little an observer of etiquette where my affections are concerned that i should put the greatest restraint imaginable on those affections were i to clog them with common ceremonies in this address which is simply to describe the happiness i feel in the longwished and longsought opportunity of making it consistently at once with my duty and love  sir guise paused  i told you said sir guise the young lady would atone amply for the old gentleman  so let us go on  the prospect of our family reunion in which caroline and olivia  pardon my boast  shall be as sisters henry and charles as brothers and our parents scarcely distinguishable from each other is so delightful to me and is indeed a transport which has been so long watched wished and prayed for that you must pardon me if i forget not only the modes of the world but the world itself in the sensibility with which i reflect upon the completion of those wishes and prayers almost in the instant of their being granted to me    dear sir guise said henry it is cruel to proceed when you see how your daughter and indeed all of us are afflicted  afflicted reiterated the baronet surely there has nothing of an afflictive kind yet occurred and i therefore augur well of the rest  i entreat said caroline  that my father may be permitted to proceed  charles was silent  sir guise read on i catch up the pen to inform my longloved caroline of my happiness not only because i could not suffer the coldness of delay to hang on such heartfelt tidings but because i cherish the hope that my felicity will be shared by miss stuart  felicity exclaimed caroline  henry who had taken advantage of this pause having cast his eye over the residue of olivias epistle which the baronet held carelessly down that he might the better observe on the parties took hold of the paper and cried excuse me sir  we have heard too much already  what remains i see is of no consequence so if you please we will    if you please mr fitzorton answered sir guise pretending offense we will go through the rest and form our own judgment of its consequence  charles and his sister seemed to anticipate the sentiments that were to follow in henrys countenance which was at all times an expressive one and might now be said in shakespeares language to be a book in which one might read strange matters from their perusal of this they prepared themselves for something miserable  the baronet asserted that hitherto he saw nothing but what was in good train and proceeded thus i must inform my dear caroline  that  that  i protest i hardly know how to write it  that  after a life of wooing  a certain event is likely to take place between one of my family  and  and one of  but i understand henry accompanied his friend home and as i suppose him to be still at the abbey i refer you to him for the particulars  or if he refuses your brother may be applied to  if the readers own mind furnishes not a sketch of the situation of the trio most concerned in this intelligence and especially the reference to henry and charles we must fairly confess the inability of our pen to describe it  sir guise having insidiously made unobserved observations read on   i only mention the circumstance as a tender thought at the moment of my writing steals into my heart purporting the honor and happiness i should derive had i the privileges of a friend to invite the gentle carolines service on an occasion which  in short as i said before not being able to consider her in any other light than an old  an intimate  a bosom friend  i  i    sir guise masking a cruel purpose in kind expressions declared that he feared what followed was coming rather too closely to the point  however added the baronet it is but another sentence the sooner an unpleasant thing was over the better  suspense was the sorest of evils and he would therefore get rid of the remainder as fast as possible he then appeared to hurry over what follows  i feel a degree of anxiety for which i cannot account that the i hope and trust in heaven most joyful day of my life even though i thus tremble at its approach should be distinguished by two of the greatest blessings  the acquisition of a  how shall i name it  of a tender husband  i can scarcely write  and the recovery of my earliest friend  and this double felicity i am ambitious to mark by the latter undertaking the gentlest the most endearing office of friendship ah cannot my caroline conjecture what the tumult of my soul permits me not to    she wishes you to be one of her bridemaids i suppose said sir guise affecting a bluntness for which almost in the commission of it he pretended to reproach himself  her bridemaid ejaculated the trio at the same time  her bridemaid  that indeed is too much said sir guise affecting to sympathise  damnation exclaimed charles rising and stamping as he walked toward the door  then turned and taking henry by the hand  yet god bless you together it must be so it ought  and i submit  i  i  i  do  my friend farewell  caroline attempted to follow her brothers example but catching his arm as he was going she could only say  i  too  resign myself  and  and  from my soul  repeat the benediction she withdrew supported by charles  my dear henry said sir guise almost betraying his triumph in the attempt to refine upon it you perceive i have done my utmost  i have sought petitioned and almost prostrated myself  but all in vain my children and myself remain unhappy and yet in this instance none of us perhaps can blame any of your family  the baronet paused seeing henry start from his seat seize his hair in desperation and then striking his breast as he ejaculated no my worthy friend it is not you nor any body else  it is the work of my own cursed cursed fortune  a servant entered saying to sir guise the gentleman you expected sir is come  i will attend him immediately observed the baronet then adverting to henry  i am really concerned to see you so much affected mr fitzorton i have only to regret that my paternal efforts have not answered the end proposed and as some very particular business claims me elsewhere i must bid you farewell but we shall meet yes we shall certainly meet  the abbey is still open you know and though my good offices have failed my best wishes are yours  chapter xxxvii henry was now again left to his soliloquies in that house where it seemed fated for him to meet varieties of distress disappointment and despair  he found himself more sorely beset than ever  his grand discovery had been made to some of the parties who were principally concerned in it  and he had the mortification to perceive his secret might have been better still confined to his own bosom  at the castle his father mother and brother james were made partakers of it letters had been sent on the subject to john  at the abbey it had been communicated to sir guise and caroline with equal ill fortune  olivia and her father only had escaped and were the knowledge of his involvement even to extend to them it was plain to be seen that although the secret would then have taken its full range like the flight of an empoisoned arrow it would have lost nothing by its passage though the air but scatter desolation in its progress  under this conviction henry once again left the abbey staring wildly at dennison who once more opened the door to him in an extreme of his misery  and in a state betwixt sense and distraction  as the reader has several times accompanied the illstarred henry in his gloomy walks to and from these mansions we will not now press his attendance but while henry is on his way we shall enter that apartment in the abbey where the person who it has been noticed came to wait upon sir guise stuart was conducted and whither sir guise was now gone to give him audience  but previously to our joining them it may be right to take a short retrospective view of the points which the worthy baronet had gained since his antipathy to the house of fitzorton and his no less radical aversion to his daughter had arrived at their height and since for certain purposes yet in the womb of time he had assumed the mask of affection and good will  from the date of this memorable era when his hate admitted not of augmentation the said mask of kindness had continued to thicken till not only the innocent victims thereof charles caroline dennison henry and the rest were deceived by it  but even the principal agent in his own designs was enabled to penetrate the darkness of its folds  by this resolute and patient hypocrisy he had without any personal hazard the only point which his fell nature felt as a check effected in a degree what was absolutely necessary to his safety in the perpetration of some nobler works of wickedness he had by his pretended reform taken off the bitter edge of that detestation in which he was held by every creature of his own household  he had contrived to shift from his own shoulders the weight of whatever consequences might result from those hapless loves which his cold heart had assured him would at least he was determined to take care they should be more sickly under his chilling influence than if he any longer appeared to oppose them and his seeming to shine upon them was but like the transient gleam of the dog star that darts upon flowers after an untimely blight had lodged the worm within their bud  he knew indeed that even if henry and his daughter should come together as one consequence of his affected reconciliation the union itself might be made subservient to his purpose of final revenge not only in working the woe of both the husband and wife but of every individual of the two detested houses of clare and fitzorton and principally by the disappointment of their views in the disposal of olivia the whole scope of which he had been made acquainted with before the partial discoveries of caroline or henry although we have not yet thought proper to communicate his sources of intelligence to the reader  but in fact he did not seriously believe his advance to good fellowship would produce a match between his daughter and henry and only provided for it in his own prolific mind as a possible contingence he rather anticipated what really happened that either the folly of the lovers themselves or his own contrivance would but the more destroy their hopes the more they were made known  and that independent on the satisfaction which their vexation would give him for the sincere hate he bore them he should derive from the appearance of having annihilated all his own resentments the more solid happiness he expected from entrapping the credulity of the fitzortons  we must not omit the mention of another and that not the least important point acquired by his thus seeming the thing he was not viz the measure of odium he hereby took from himself in the opinion of his neighbors who heard of his great change of conduct not only from the servants who had before reprobated his behavior but from the parties who were the objects of this extraordinary alteration  the people of the parish indeed interpreted this extraordinary change into a miracle but the good monk who was now one of the most zealous of his advocates assured them it was the simple operation of conscience which it had pleased god to awake in his heart in time not only to make atonement to all whom he had injured in this present world but effect his future salvation in the world to come  to say the truth the baronet had been at more than usual pains to observe a consistent conduct in the presence of our monastic who though a man of great simplicity and devoid of the suspicion which those who are themselves guilty cultivate most was likewise of a very penetrating mind  yet the uniform diseretion of sir guise was more than a match for the doctors clearness of head or purity of heart  insomuch that the best warmest and most able as well as most active defender of the baronet far and near at home and abroad was now father arthur  it is hence apparent that sir guise in a very short space of time but with a diligence suitable to so great an object might be said to have done what is justly to be considered amongst the most arduous of all human labors  to have redeemed a lost character even when indeed it was supposed to be gone past redemption  it was still remembered by many how bad he had been but it was generally believed he had though late seen his errors and that if he was now sometimes as outrageous in doing worthy as before he had been violent in committing wicked actions it should be imputed to him as an overanxious desire to make up lost time and to finish his own career of virtue by laboring doubly in the vineyard that he might work out the salvation which had been so long neglected upon the whole therefore few persons enjoyed a fairer regenerated fame since the death of his lady as a good father a good neighbor or a sincere penitent than sir guise stuart  perhaps sir armine and john fitzorton and one or two more might still have their suspicions  yet there was only one man living who at the moment here alluded to could bear witness that he was much more consummate in the ways of deceit than he had ever been before  and this single living person was himself  it was even doubted by the person who now came to discourse with him and to whom we shall immediately introduce the reader  this person was no other than the notorious mr valentine miles the active agent of sir guise upon all occasions  he collected his rents and improved his estates he got in his moneys and laid them out to what he thought the best that is to say his own advantage  he was no less the parasite than the tyrant of sir guise  to him the baronet was first indebted for the honor of mrs tempests acquaintance and like other providers of his cast of character he was shrewdly suspected to have first tasted the dainty himself yet at other times jackall as he was he knew the art to make the lion crouch at his feet and tremble before him  the abovementioned lady numbered this gentleman amongst her first impressions although we hardly know how to call him or any other person her first love because there were about the same period so many candidates for her favor and from a peculiar philanthropy she was so little disposed to that species of cruelty whereby lovers are said so often to suffer wounds and death that it would be narrowing her kind and relenting nature to confine her loving kindness to any individual  mr miles was certainly one of her happy men  and mr tempest whom she honored with her hand was another but somehow the latter soon died and the former had at least one rival less  indeed miles continued amongst her first favorites after the ladys heart got more into practice and even when her love of mankind increasing with the knowledge of suffering objects and her pity for their sufferings was unbounded  but then her valentine recommended himself by more than one congenial passion  that of gaming  the love of the dice was paramount over all indeed it nearly extinguished every other or rather it was in process of time so much the master passion that every other was in vassalage to it  love itself great enlarged and impartial as it was in the ample heart of this generous pair became subservient to it  for the lady imagined her mighty flame might be fed by once more lighting at it the torch of hymen a dicebox in such a hand seemed to have all the magic power of that torch and as sir guise stuart raised his admiring eye to the enchantress the dice themselves were as two balls of electric fire and a thousand sparks and gentle shocks were drawn from his heart in love affairs miles was nothing selfish  he secretly saw this conquest and interrupted it not  on the contrary he had long called the object of it his bosom friend and sir guise became another happy man and entered into the gaming association with a spirit like that of his friend and mistress and although the aforesaid hymeneal torch had not yet lighted our baron a second time to the altar it was only consigned to cupid as a little deity in waiting for a more convenient season  meantime the loves and games of valentine and mrs tempest went gaily on  what though she had no nuptial torch for him she had a cupid still very much at his service and that did full as well  and as to the gambling affection they might both be said to be pleased with ruin for they had very often been ruined together on the same evening yet retired in the most benevolent humor on the social principle of making each other happy  they had indeed often been made whole again the next morning by their chosen friend sir guise stuart who was altogether unskilful but whom the lady by the pretenses of violent love and the gentleman by those of as vehement friendship contrived to pillage of what ought to have been appropriated to his own family  for whatever praise is due to profusion when he had money in his purse sir guise might claim wherever his pleasures or fears were concerned  his temper was sufficiently niggard indeed but he was coaxed or terrified out of enormous sums because in truth except by the starts of a moment which he always paid for he dared not refuse  his own miserable soul was a reservoir but miles and mrs tempest were the impure streams that exhausted and literally played it off  yet so radical was this vice of gaming in the widow and miles that sometimes after a run of good fortune had sent them home  for they were generally under the same roof  laden with spoils they would pass an hour before they went to bed in playing against each other and that with the same desire to cheat and win as if they were at work upon some marked novice upon whom they had a design  and whichever in this teteatete game came off loser was to undertake the odd trick  in other words it was the losers part to wheedle the baronet out of the next supply  a slight specimen of the abilities of mr miles was exhibited to the reader in the cheat he attempted to pass upon the family of the atwoods after he had favored the plan for jennys journey to london  but since the discovery of his treachery he had lived wholly with the baronets mistress as an ami de maison and had been the confidential medium betwixt that lady and sir guise in certain important points that are now to be communicated  the most material of these on the part of the lady was to make good her ground at the abbey with a view as has been intimated to her becoming no less than lady of the manor and the death of lady matilda gave an unexpected opening to her bold aspiring  to accomplish this however was an undertaking that called for very extraordinary powers and although those of which mrs tempest was in possession were certainly of this extraordinary kind they were yet insufficient to bring about so great an event without some congenial assistance  for this she applied to a man whose talents she had employed in various instances with unvarying success  indeed there was not any one amongst her acquaintance  unless she could have brought sir guise into a plot against himself which indeed she did in many instances  so able or for the rewards so willing as her valentine to advance a project which he had some time suspected was going on in the mind of his beloved  miles was blessed with a head and heart so strictly in alliance with each other that like copartners they carried on business in the utmost harmony  they had indeed embarked in the same trade that of devising and carrying into effect all sorts of commodities which promoted the meum without considering the tuum of this life so early that they were now become from long habit and constant practice equal to any human undertaking that ever has or may be done in roguery  and to complete the allusion it might be said that the best established warehouse of all kinds of knavery ready made for every possible purpose was under the firm of mr valentine miles  this gentleman was of a good figure and genteel address and had indeed in his youth been a distinguished favorite of the ladies  he was now only in the maturity of life somewhat inclined to a corpulence not strictly consistent with elegance but in perfect unison with our ideas of confirmed manhood  he was of an assured air confident expression ready utterance versatile talents and accommodating manners  and from an uncommonly wellknit construction of limbs and great natural strength of body with a certain constitutional power of drinking others out of their wits while he retained his own he had run his career in almost every species of debauchery without being checked by one distemper or punished by any pains of body and as to those of mind he set them gloriously at defiance  he had in short arrived at that preeminence at that perfect imperfection which annihilates the sense of fear or of shame and herein was confessedly the superior even of sir guise stuart who had an abundance of the former though he possessed not a jot of the latter  upon all these grounds he was the fittest for a connection with the baronet of any man in the world for as there was not an infamous thought which the heart of man could conceive but was engendered by sir guise so was there not any man who had so much intrepidity of practical baseness to carry such conception into action as miles  this accomplished gentleman therefore and mrs tempest divided the baronet between them and had been for some time contriving how to dispose in a more legal manner of his family and fortune to their wishes for as the widow had after sounding him avowed her design to miles of becoming lady stuart  so had miles in return of confidence then first mentioned a longcherished intention of making proposals to the baronet for getting rid of the encumbrance of his daughter caroline  now his was a kind of underplot to be woven into their domestic plan in order to strengthen their interests  this little episode indeed rather endeared the expected catastrophe to mr miles who at the fall of the curtain promised himself from this double marriage which might indeed be called the title of the farce more than double advantage  while mrs tempest was reconciled to it on principles of equal convenience and accommodation differing only a little in the idea as to caroline  she did not love miles well enough to feel any jealousy about the division of his personal favors but she indulged the secret thought that she should come in not only for an equal division of carolines fortune  miles having promised her a moiety in case the match should be brought about  but for the sole and sovereign authority over the estates of sir guise stuart meditating indeed to hold these so much at control that neither her sir guise nor her valentine should have a greater proportion than their good behavior to her seemed to merit from her bounty  as to the baronets person her discovery of his infidelity with jane atwood was the finishing stroke to the remains of what she was pleased to call love  she held it more cheap than that of miles but not being over nice in her sensations she foresaw the possibility of still retaining both in the voluminous list of her happy men  in regard to the nature of valentines attachment to caroline it as little partook of the troublesome and avaricious tenderness which confines the great passion of love to one person as that which mrs tempest bore either to her intended husband or to her old protector for though mrs tempest was a woman of some violence in all respects she professed sovereign scorn of those who affected to argue against pluralities in the belle passion and though she declared she doated on miles to distraction it was thought various others were her doting pieces also and a domestic of her fathers had distracted her in the same manner so effectually some months before that the outward and visible signs of it were obvious even when her elopement from her family was determined on and the arms of the accommodating valentine were open to receive her with all encumbrances it was a longbalanced point on her part whether she should stay with mr thomas the footman or run away with mr valentine miles her papas engrossing clerk for at that time her father was an attorney and miles was his assistant a compromise however took place between all parties mr thomas had a parting douceur and a promise of future provision and mr miles agreed to the arrangement in all its parts and so carried off the lady but whether they did or did not provide for mr thomas cannot at this moment be made known  miles had often seen miss stuart both in her mothers lifetime and since her death but had never intimated his passion otherwise than by certain sighs and smiles moral sentences and wellturned compliments from time to time which partly his subordinate situation in life as her fathers agent and partly her own preoccupied sentiments had prevented caroline from seeing in the least degree the drift of he intended indeed at first only to seduce her but he now entertained honorable sentiments as the most profitable in regard to the former objection to him miles considered it on reflection now done away by his profession as he always maintained before those who were disposed to question his titles that a gambler was a gentleman seeing it mixed him constantly in the very best company and if ever the baronet disputed the claim miles would rise up in great displeasure use some terrifying menace and insist either on receiving a suitable apology or the satisfaction due to a gentleman  of late indeed some pretty smart contests about division of spoil had past between miles and the widow their affection for each other was almost worn out and yet their ties of interest were so strong that fear operated now as love had done before to keep them together for each well knew a very little treachery on either side  as is the case with most rogues who confederate  would destroy both  believing that the reader is by this time as perfectly acquainted with these great personages as it is necessary for him to be to the right understanding the events which chain our history  we shall proceed to unfold the business which brought mr miles to the abbey but as what past between the worthy agent and his illustrious employer will be in part best given in dialogue we shall as being indeed fit company only for each other give them a chapter to themselves  chapter xxxviii miles what am i to believe my dear friend is it true that you have offered your daughter in marriage to the son of your direst foe is it fear or is it madness that induced you to this step whatever was the motive it was carrying the point too far it was passing my prescribed line of policy and giving an advantage which    sir guise with conscious pride ha ha ha and have i deceived the deceptive valentine miles then is my art triumphant indeed   miles not so triumphant as you may suppose sir you are the dupe of your own artifice and if especial care be not taken you will yourself fall into the trap you have set for others   sir guise i understand you not   miles our trusty emissary brings certain intelligence that your enemies at the castle with the tremendous john at their head design to take advantage of this your pacific disposition  and breaking the truce when you least suspect it cut you off at once   sir guise in consternation cut me off murderous villains   miles but we are i hope yet in time to circumvent them   sir guise in terror you hope is there still a doubt then let us take our measures this moment what are they what could induce the assassins to this at a moment too when i supposed the credulous fools    miles that is the misfortune of it while we are attempting to succeed in our design upon others we are apt to forget they may be as wise as ourselves and have their plans upon us thus it is with the fitzortons and stuarts  it would be distraction to suppose the former toward whom it has been the business of years to show every mark of obloquy you dare safely hazard should ever believe your sudden overtures to good fellowship sincere or be so blind to the human passions as to accept them if they were  the lovesick boys alone excepted this cobweb artifice may pass on children and lovers who are more weak than children  it may serve perhaps to amuse the hearts of your daughter and henry fitzorton  it may hoodwink your neighbors  and so much i expected from the measure  but you and i who know the world ought to throw out of our experienced minds such infantile and such frivolous credulities the practiced and politic sir guise ought to know that his proffered hand was received with precisely the same degree of sincerity with which it was tendered to have rejected it would have been as unwise in old fitzorton as in sir guise not to have presented it but this done  both parties judging naturally should put themselves in preparation for war the very instant peace was talked of ask your own heart my friend whether its hate has diminished or its hope of revenge has ceased since you extended the hand of fictitious amity and held out the olive branch   sir guise o miles my heart rankles with more deadly poisons and my pretended treaty of friendship was as you know but the more securely to give that blow which your sublimer genius and wisdom told me would be most effectually struck when my hated foes were off their guard my seeming to smile upon them was but as the gleam of the dogstar darting upon flowers after the blight has lodged a worm within the bud   miles true our only apprehension is  since those foes are alike diligent  lest they should have the start of us the tender mrs tempest has dispatched me on the wing of affection to communicate the information i have given you that your speedy assassination is intended since nothing short of your death can pacify sir armine fitzorton or his inveterate son john these are their words for the insult sustained the sense of which notwithstanding a pretended patched up reconciliation has been brooding in their minds ever since they have their plots as wily and as wellconcerted as our own   sir guise ready to expire with fear bloodyminded villains haste my friend to prevent them i may this night be murdered in my bed and who knows but henry and caroline or even charles may be concerned in the plot it is always the wisest way to suspect every body ungrateful wretches while i have been thus generously sacrificing to them  at least such it must have appeared to them    miles sir guise i need not at this time of day enter into professions of attachment to you my friendship toward you is as unquestionable as mrs tempests love we would both live or die for you you have had proof of it and if you should which heaven forbid fall a victim to the secret and deeplaid machinations of your enemies  if you should be destined to breathe your last    sir guise inconceivably agitated talk not of breathing my last but hasten to prevent it save my life and gratify me with complete vengeance on the execrable villains who are now plotting my destruction and there is nothing within the purchase of my fortune that shall not be yours in reward of the deed   miles the intention at the castle i understand to be this  jenny atwood who is there protected as an instrument against you is to be an evidence of your disgrace which is to be of the most public kind your cowardice your falsehood thus they vilify you your receiving a blow your abuse of your late lady your avarice to your son your cruelty to your daughter your seduction of jane your criminal intercourse with mrs tempest this is their vile language your oppression of your neighbors and your assumed change of character and conduct which they pretend to see through  all these are forming into one mass first to effect your disgrace    sir guise gloriously disregarding mere loss of character but my life  my life valentine   miles first to effect your disgrace i say and then  but indeed their purpose is too horrible  i know not how to divulge it   having wrought the baronet to this the proper pitch of curiosity expectation and terror mr miles paused  when seeing sir guise in a disposition to believe every thing and to dread what he believed he exclaimed but there is some satisfaction in the thought that unless we all become victims at the same time you shall not my dear friend  no you shall not die unrevenged  sir guise answered i tell you i will not die  i will sooner leave the abbey  i will sooner fly from the hated face of man  of you and tempest and all the world  fly from me and tempest you cannot shall not cries miles for her love and my friendship shall follow you to the uttermost ends of the earth  ah my good friend were we all united by ties as sacred as they are strong were we all of one family and our fates and fortunes run together what could hurt us i should defy the powers of hell confederated then to molest you but while we are thus divided    i see your wishes answered the baronet  your longdesired happiness shall be granted  i here pledge myself that my hand shall be tempests and my daughters yours  if you will in this instance rescue me from the designs of the accursed fitzortons and effect my revenge upon them without hazard to my person  it is enough said miles i know you are a man of honor and the instant i have informed mrs tempest of her happiness  you know how it will rejoice her tender soul which doats on you  those measures shall be taken  indeed i had concerted them previously without other inducement than pure disinterested friendship  which will complete your triumph and the defeat of your enemies at one and the same instant meantime as our double marriage cannot you know take place immediately it might be wrong to let the idea go abroad to any part of your own family till the impending danger to your precious life is over and then my dear father  for i may now call you by that tender name  we may shape the intelligence according to events indeed i am ambitious to deserve the honor of an alliance with sir guise stuart by saving his life before i receive the bright reward the promise of which should i even die myself in preserving you i shall think a full atonement for though i have not like that puny lover the sensitive henry fitzorton been playing at the game of declaration i have an affection which  an affection which  but your dear life my future parent is in danger  and this is no time to talk sentimentally about my passion  so if you will consider of these little articles of family affection which i have drawn up supposing the family convention between us to take place  and just put your name thereto i will clap the saddle on my horse to convey the glad tidings to mrs tempest  and return with such plans and powers of putting them into execution as shall rid you of all your fears meantime you will intimate nothing of what has past to your family but wait my return in assured expectation that my life shall be the guarantee of yours  alas sir guise continued miles taking the baronet by the hand what would have been the event had not my incessant vigilance and secret intelligence traced the hellish plot now forming against you at the castle i am sorry to say henry is almost the ringleader your own son is not without a hand in the conspiracy and in less than eightandforty hours your death  your concerted murder    eightandforty hours mercy defend me  cries the baronet  your death i say within that time would have been as certain as will now be your preservation  at the end of this sentence sir guise leaped on the neck of miles with the most extravagant demonstrations of joy  called him and tempest his only friends protectors and preservers  swore they only should be his future heirs his present asocociates  declared he longed for the hour which should give to one the claims of a wife and to the other those of a son  and protested he only waited till the forms of mourning for lady stuart were past personally to make a graceful offer he then opened the paper which miles had given glanced his eye hastily over the contents which he approved  caught up a pen and signed his name  called in dennison and another domestic as witnesses telling them it was a mere deed of trust  dismissed them the instant they had made their signatures and thus bound himself to obligations the nature of which he scarcely knew being under terrors which would have induced him to sign away the globe  and again hugging miles to his bosom and calling him his best friend urged him not to spare horseflesh to greet tempest with the most lavish epithets of fondness and to return with the utmost speed adding as miles departed that he should not dare to take food or rest till he again embraced his dear valentine  so the dastard now called a man whom he had long feared and despised and such was the message he sent by that man to a woman who was both his aversion and his dread  miles had not left the room more than a minute when he reentered saying as upon recollection that in his zeal to accomplish the baronets safety he had forgot all other matters especially to intimate that as the design of counterplotting the fitzortons would be attended with considerable expense   i understand you said sir guise taking out some bankers checks and scribbling at random you will pass the house get these cashed and should more be wanted i have always some running cash with my country banker  we are wasting time said miles pocketing the drafts god bless you expect me soon be silent and be safe  chapter xxxix but great as were the motives already assigned for this invention of plots and intended counterplots to work upon the fears of sir guise  the inventor and his fair associate mrs tempest were influenced by other inducements more potent than all the advantages they had hopes of deriving in the issue from the operation of those fears and the wellconnected fable on which they were founded  the primary wheels in this grand machine were the lust of revenge and a lust yet more fordid more violent which the widow and her valentine bore toward the clares and fitzortons  mr clare had been the first to intimate to his friend fitzorton that there was something more wicked though better disguised in the disposition of miles than that of the baronet  adding that he had heard a story of his being drummed out of a regiment somewhere in ireland for malpractices  amongst which it hangs in my memory said mr clare  that theft and perjury were not the most atrocious  this happening to be communicated to sir armine in the presence of one david otley a domestic of mr clares and a shrewd fellow but to whom mr clare was somewhat attached the caution reached by this medium the ear of mr miles  john fitzorton had been at some pains to trace this rumor not only in compliance with mr clares suspicions but in confirmation of his own which had secretly fastened upon this man even when he had the privileges of a visitor at the castle in common with sir guise who introduced him  john soon profited of those opportunities which his military connexions gave him and made a report at the castle not covertly but consistent with the intrepid decision of his character  one day when the same david otley was waiting at the back of his masters chair and when indeed sir guise himself  it being prior to the public breach  was at sir armines table  it is matter of astonishment to me said john who happened to be the only person of his family then present that a fellow who has every vice in human nature but cowardice  and that single exception proceeding only from a fearless constitutional impudence  should gain the protection of any person of credit  then turning to sir guise he added if on your return to the abbey you should meet with a friend of yours who answers to this character do me the honor sir to tell him what i have said and farther should his being in possession of the single quality i have alluded to namely his insolent courage be thought a counterbalance for the stain of every baseness by the use and exercise you may have for it sir guise i have only to desire in the name of my family that the gentleman who may be so gifted from this moment for evermore may forbear coming to the castle  and i think i may venture to add or the manorhouse  it is unnecessary to observe that this pointed message was carried at the time to the party concerned  indeed lest any thing should be lost in its journey from the castle to the abbey it was kindly taken to the latter mansion by two persons  sir guise faithfully related it the very same night to mr valentine miles and david otley took it in his budget of castle and manorhouse intelligence the next morning  a natural consequence arising from this inhibition was of course cutting the acquaintance of mr miles but another very natural consequence of course also took place between the truly brave john fitzorton and the truly audacious valentine miles  no sooner was the latter in possession of the favorable sentiments borne him by the former than he sent in turn a scarce less civil message to john who instantly observed the contents without so much as uttering a syllable to any of the family save and except to true george then his domestic  miles had contrived to get the baronet to accompany him to the place of rendezvous without letting him know the design  accordingly the parties met at the dawn of the third day from the communication of johns opinion  at the sight of john whose very countenance was a rebuke to cowardice sir guise involuntarily drew back a few paces and the view of the pistols a brace of which both antagonists took out of their pockets at the same time made him so expert at the science of tergiversation that he had got several yards in his way home exclaiming miles had betrayed him  before the said miles perceived he had taken fright  valentine however who wanted him as a witness of that prowess which might be one day of service in his own cause soon brought him back asserting that  he was in no danger  and the duellists prepared for action  john condescended only to say sternly fellow i am admitting you to an undeserved honor  then settling their distance and taking aim almost in the same instant john discharged his shot and received that of miles without any injury to either  johns ball however whizzed so near to the body of sir guise who had shifted about that the good baronet again took to his heels and george after him leaving the field of battle solely to the combatants  johns next ball took effect in the neck of his adversary who dropping on the ground john demanded if he was satisfied with his being still of opinion he was a scoundrel  and upon being answered by valentine that he was satisfied for the present  john left him to the care of true george who by this time returned without the fearful game of which he had been in chase  john now walked home saying to true george when you have conveyed that fellow to the abbey return to me at the castle and do not inform any of my family i have disgraced either them or myself by such a contest i charge you  and as for you sir added he addressing miles as george lifted him from the ground  if you live and are again as impudent as you are infamous i may be tempted to confer on you the dignity of a second leaden token of my esteem for your virtues and if you die public honors ought to be adjudged me for being the author of that inestimable blessing to the community your invaluable death  although neither john who was too much ashamed of his exploit nor true george who was too faithful to his trust revealed this transaction to any other person at home or abroad  and perhaps both had long since thrown it from their memories as unworthy of preservation  the whole business was still smarting in the recollection of miles who  although he did not think proper to call john to a second account nor to assign it amongst his motives for taking part in the vengeance of sir guise  had been inwardly consuming with the most implacable hatred to the whole family ever since  he had indeed long watched his occasion  had assiduously though secretly fomented every cause and effect of hatred in the baronet  and was almost in despair of an opportunity falling out suitable to his design when at length he came to the knowledge of circumstances which will presently be no secret to the reader and which if well managed he did not doubt would produce a rich harvest of events favorable to his love his avarice and his vengeance  the fabrication of the welltimed story of the assassination of sir guise was simply a necessary prelude to the bringing this about and as to the degree of probability of the tale he was the less careful to construct it as he had often perceived that when the baronets terrors were once excited by a sudden shock none of his faculties were sufficiently at his command to reflect how the history hung together or how the parts were in harmony with the whole  on the contrary every sense seemed to take the alarm at the moment he heard of a possible danger and like an affrighted family running from a house at the cry of fire every passion of his soul but that of fear left his bosom  now in accounting for the hatred which the widow tempest bore to the house of fitzorton we fear we must be under the disagreeable necessity of telling yet another family secret and one which a more prudent biographer would conceal but the truth that guides our pen demands the discovery and the human nature to which our history is dedicated must plead excuse for whatever offenses the developement of mysteries behind her curtain may bring to light  chapter xl henry became acquainted with mrs tempest without knowing any thing of her attachment to valentine miles or her connection with sir guise stuart  the time was critical  it was during henrys visit in london to a female relation and his first interview happened at a very remarkable moment  it was in truth in the evening of the day on which with his accustomed punctuality and ardour he had dispatched a large packet of everlasting love and constancy to his dear caroline under cover to the trusty dennison  the soft duty of his heart discharged he went to the theater full of the tenderest vows the fondest ideas but having made in company with some young friends larger libations to the purple god of the grape or rather to the health of his beloved than his reason could bear though his passion seemed to augment at every glass  he happened to walk we had almost written stagger into a box where the widow was then smiling at mr congreves pleasant comedy of love for love seeing a place to the left vacant and near a beautiful lady the right side being occupied by another female who appeared to be in the character of a foil rather than of a rival brilliant  he made one of those bows which were sure to procure him a gracious reception and perceiving his welcome insured by the brilliants sitting closer to the foil in order to make more room for him  he took possession of the seat  rather as an effect of high youth and high spirits animated by love and wine than a spirit of gallantry he entered at once into some glowing remarks on the scene which was then representing  the lady being one of those females who follow first impressions and have the talent of being desperately in love at a glance contrived to forget in the space of half an hour that sir guise stuart for it was his widow tempest had any claims for money or her valentine miles for love  or indeed that mr congreve had any wit or that her muse companion required any more of her attention than if she had been part of the bench she sat on  or in short that there was any body but the enchanting young stranger at her side in the creation  she presently gave the youth such manifest and manifold proofs of her so thinking by certain little tendernesses innuendoes languishing looks and gentle pressures every one of which  though they were perfectly new to him  being altogether in a different style from the attentions of the chaste and charming caroline  it was impossible for him not to comprehend their meaning and before the couples in the comedy were brought tegether in the last act an union of a different kind was settled in the ladys mind and ratified in her eyes which seemed to insist on the consent of the young gentleman  in a word the widow thought her new object  and indeed she decided rightly  one of the handsomest and most elegant young men she had ever seen  and agreeably to her firstsight system was by the time the first act of the farce was over in love with him to distraction  it is probable she heard not a sentence of act the second though it was upon a subject congenial to her feelings so entirely was she engrossed by her new conqueror at the conclusion common gallantry required he should see her safe out of the house and put her and her still dumb companion into their carriage  to which as he was handing them the widow said even as she set her foot on the step i hope sir i shall have the honor to set you down in return for your civility  which offer being accompanied by certain invisible signs and tokens as potent as the secrets of freemasonry or the ancient art of palmistry  henry got into the coach and seated himself on the same side without attending to the other lady quite so much as the forms of politeness might seem to prescribe  henry new to the town thought it right in point of etiquette to see the lady home before he took the liberty of using her carriage which was therefore driven to a very handsome house in grosvenor square where alighting to hand the ladies out it is certainly possible that henry might have taken leave of his ladies had not the sprightly widow sportingly exclaimed with certain accompaniments having still hold of his arm we may as well make it the romance of a night sir if you are not better engaged  for you must know i dreamed of an adventure of this sort and am just in the humor to have my dream out  what say you priscilla  turning to her companion  i should like it of all things replied the lady  henry was not in a disposition to be rude so the widow informed the coachman she should have no farther occasion for the carriage and the trio of choice spirits tripped into the house  voluptuous elegance now began its fascination  a collation was soon served up after which the servants disappeared the most costly wines circulated for neither the widow nor her companion was unknown to the jolly god and either of them would have taken off her bottle with more ease than olivia clare or caroline stuart or any such puny whipster of the sex could have managed her first and half sipped her second glass  indeed our fair seducers were frequent votaries at the court of comus insomuch that mrs tempest might have represented and in truth often did represent upon the stage of life the part of euphrosyne and her associate had as often done equal justice to the character of the principal bacchante  it is with reluctance we tell the reader that henry was not so much alarmed at finding himself in such company as was miltons lady when she discovered the danger of her situation  yet the situation was but too similar with respect to the surrounding magic  mrs tempest was in all senses of the character a siren  her voice though neither sweet nor tender either like that of olivia or caroline was yet seductively harmonious  her eyes though possessing neither the modest luster of olivias nor the appealing softness of carolines darted such intolerable fire through her long dark eyelashes that a less ardent gazer than henry might have been scorched by their burning beams  she was somewhat under the size of olivia and by the same proportion above that of caroline  she wanted the chaste dignity that gave command to the one and was utterly destitute of the interesting graces shifting with every attitude that adorned the other  but she had to boast a symmetry of shape a certain voluptuous roundness of limbs a contour of visage and an alluring government of countenance so entirely the reverse of both that while their features were formed to instruct the beholder that real beauty love and virtue were the same  those of the widow were calculated to excite suddenly a train of impetuous emotions formed to seduce from the youthful bosom all its heavenly guards and lure the gazer to indulge in the fatal contrast  all the lineaments of her face offered the most infallible marks of passion unrestrained an inordinate love of pleasure and a total disdain of the decent laws by which passion and pleasure and more especially in women ought to be regulated  her lips were in exact correspondence with her eyes and as constantly employed in expressing the same emotions and the regularity and color of her teeth could only yield to the beauty of her arms and bosom which were in the highest perfection of female loveliness but were displayed or shaded with a studied attention that denoted she was at once proud and conscious of their attraction  the then extreme youth of henry the novelty of the situation the combining enchantments and the state of the poor lads head will we hope mitigate his offense should we own as own we must that he was far from being a mere neutral listener or looker on during the hilarities of the evening  he looked at the widow indeed with a timid admiration and as she sung several couplets from the l allegro henrys manly and pathetic voice which the reader has already heard celebrated joined in the chorus with a spirit that showed he had been gradually enchanted out of himself  here is a health to those that we love cries the widow filling the glass while she sung  here is a health to those that love us answered her companion in the same style putting the bottle which contained some excellent champaigne to henry who then for the first time probably since the intoxication began blushed and sighed as at the remembrance of caroline  this however though noticed by the piercing eyes of the widow was construed rather into growing passion for herself than tenderness for another  with renewed fervency therefore she proceeded with the song increasing in animation as she went on  and when they came to the following line which the widow trilled with uncommon melody o my love love thou me she cast an enflaming and decided look at henry and her redundant hair dropped from its slight bondage and covered her with its luxurious mantle  the heart of henry must have been made of impenetrable stuff indeed had he at such a time in such a place and at such an opportunity affected not to understand the drift of such a question breathed in harmony through the lips of beauty  the companion on some pretense or other withdrew and the very few remains of modesty which had been reluctantly confined in the room before followed her or rather flew blushingly out of the apartment the moment the door opened and seemed to wish for an asylum in carolines or olivias bosom  mrs tempest and henry were now together and very few moments more might have completed the triumph of youthful folly and infidelity had not henrys good angel in the imaged form of caroline herself interposed  and that pure image was brought forward even by mrs tempest herself  come one more brimmer to the woman of your heart said mrs tempest replenishing her own and then henrys glass this one bumper more thou enchanting stranger who  without my knowledge of or desire to know thy name family fortune or aught but thy enchanting self  have turned a moment of time into an age of love  she quoted theatrically various rhapsodies from the old dramatic poets and then seizing henrys hand every artery of which trembled she pressed it to her lips exclaiming ah dear unknown tell me who she is  what is her name  whose health am i to drink  who is my too happy rival  for to suppose  to flatter myself i have the bliss to find the heart of such a loveinspiring fellow unengaged  and still at liberty to devote itself to this throbbing breast    she thought proper to hesitate and imitate bashful difficulty  then went on   to dare even hope that i meet such a treasure undisposed of is a bliss too great too mighty  no twas too presumptuous and yet to think this hand those lips that form this panting heart anothers  o it would destroy me  by my soul it would  after a trembling pause she cried you are silent  you blush  your lips turn pale  and good heavens  ah what do i see there are tears in your eyes  accursed fortune  perhaps perhaps you love  confusion perhaps  no you are not  surely you are not married  but if you are    curse as the sweet poet says  curse on all laws but those which love has made  love free as air at sight of human ties spreads its light wing and in a moment flies chapter xli having finished her poetical justifications which have been many a pretty libertines and tripping ladys apology she observed henry extremely troubled  what can be the matter with you  yes i know my fate  it is not the fetters of wedlock only i have to contend with  these might be broken  these i could snap asunder  but you are bound in the chains of love  almighty love  and i  wretched woman  but i am resolved to know all  here since you cannot speak the cruel word write  write the dreaded name  write on the back of this letter and with my pencil  there  who am i to hate  curse  exterminate  mark the detested name   detested name reiterated henry oh she is an angel and her precious name would be profaned were i to breathe it now with these unfaithful lips to those polluted ones which have tempted me to injure her   polluted lips in her turn reechoed the widow springing up and disdainfully withdrawing her hand from henrys   polluted lips  have a care sir  you do not perhaps know that as i can dote to distraction so can i abhor to madness  yes and both with equal speed  polluted lips  they have seldom been rewarded for their partiality by such an epithet  she took the room three or four times backwards and forwards in a violent passion sometimes throwing herself down into a chair sometimes tossing by henry without deigning to mark her rage except through the flashes of her indignant eyes  from which shot now as intense flames of fury as had a few moments before darted burning beams of desire  her whole person was rendered terrifying and might perhaps have alarmed henry though by no means apt to be appalled had not another object more fraught with terrors than an hundred thousand angry men or even women with an equal number of armed troops in their train fastened upon his attention namely the sight of the address of that letter which the widow had produced for the purpose of his penciling her rivals name and which the said widow had hurled in disdain upon the sofa where henry and she had before been seated  this superscription opened on henrys eyes the following discoveries  first that he had entangled himself almost past redemption in an affair of gallantry with the mistress of his beloved carolines father and secondly that it was directed to the said fathers mistress in the wellknown handwriting of sir guise stuart  merciful heaven exclaimed henry  what do i see  is it possible madam you should be mrs tempest  and what then sir demanded the widow snatching the letter from henry and throwing it into the fire with a dreadful execration   that mrs tempest continued henry of whom i have heard so much  whom sir guise stu   and who then are you questioned the widow stopping him in the middle of the name  are you that enemy of mine his detested son whose hate i have long felt but whose person i have never yet    no madam replied henry interrupting in his turn  i am not so great so just so honorable a man as that noble that distinguished youth whom i now blush to call my friend  but unworthy as i am i bless heaven for this timely discovery  this miraculous escape  henry caught up his hat and without considering the lateness of the hour or any thing else but what he had mentioned hurried to the door  escape  escape  insolent  impudent  raved forth mrs tempest running after him and pulling him back  confusion to my soul  if you provoke me  whosoever you are were you the father who gave me life    henry struggled in her grasp  and a violent rapping at the street door made him step a few paces back  the lady exclaimed still keeping her hold and perfectly agonized with rage shaking henry while she spoke  god be thanked  that is either valentine or sir guise  now sir will my triumph be complete  as she said this a noise was heard upon the stairs and presently the former of the abovementioned persons made his appearance  he had come to town as the reader may remember post haste on the business of jane atwood arriving with sir guise in the middle of the night and having left the baronet in janes lodgings which had been provided by miles  he miles had made up his excuse for visiting the widow at so unseasonable an hour as at that time he observed some etiquette with her  at the sight of henry whom he had seen more than once at the abbey and whose passion for caroline he had heard from sir guise he started as at that of an apparition  mr henry fitzorton exclaimed he  who  henry fitzorton cried the widow  no wonder then these unheard of outrages have been heaped on me  and i have not the smallest doubt but that one wickedness would have led to another till it had ended in my death  oh valentine  sure heaven sent you at this moment to my rescue  could you conceive what i have endured from this till now unknown wretch  your heart would bleed for me  she then related the foregore scene so as exactly to reverse the several actual circumstances observing with an admirable accuracy of transposition that he had rudely seated himself in the same box at the playhouse  watched her out  thrust himself into her coach  ran up stairs as soon as they got home  forced poor priscilla her companion out of the room  locked the door  swore that he would destroy the first person who offered to approach  and on casting his eye upon a letter she had received from her dear dear sir guise whose handwriting he knew he slandered both him and valentine with a volley of execrations  and was proceeding to every thing shocking when her good stars brought her friend valentine to her aid  twas surely providence etc etc etc  as soon as she had finished this speech which the gentleman whom she addressed believed as much of as she did herself  yet the former thought it might be most productive to give it credit  valentine went into another room observing he should return in a moment  the widow then sallied up to henry and in a malicious whisper accompanied by a sarcastic sneer her arms akimbo demanded whether he thought another miracle would happen to befriend his escape from the vengeance of her injured friend  henry disdained to make her any reply and indeed before he could have done so miles returned with his pistols at the sight of which mrs tempest affecting to be alarmed flung herself on her knees and interceded for the life of henry  then by a gentle whisper suggested to miles that if the outrage were well managed it would be worth more to them both than a million of such lives  this intercession wrought so on the tender heart of miles that all would have gone off for the moment with a gentle reprimand or menace had not henry  who felt the fitzorton blood rush in boiling torrents through his veins walked toward valentine and snapping his fingers in his face observed loftily that the trick was too stale and that as he was too infamous a wretch to be met on a level by a man of honor whose family had justly banished him from their presence he should be warranted to treat him in the only way such a scoundrel was entitled to if he did not let him pass out of the private brothel which sir guise and himself kept between them  i have concealed your vile secret which has been long communicated to me by the injured charles only out of delicacy to my angel  i will no more sully her pure name by breathing it in a pest house  but if an accent respecting the shameful company into which i have been trepanned by that vicious and artful woman is mentioned either in my hearing or in that of any person dear to me and it should reach me i will set fire to a train that shall destroy you both  so be warned  it was with great difficulty miles now held the arms of mrs tempest who maddened with rage shame and disappointment  miles was himself scarce less inflamed but certain ideas rose in his mind suddenly that induced him to let henry go unmolested out of the room and also to hold the widow by main force till the street door was shut even to the hazard of valentines own face which received several lusty blows  but when henry was fairly off it did not take either much pains or time to convince the lady that though her whole story was well put together he knew it had not one syllable of truth in it and that even had it been as veritable as it was false it would be better for all parties to hush up the affair at present  till we provoke the stripling farther he will keep our secret for the sake of his own and the bringing upon us the fury of charles and of the d  d fitzortons  and in consequence of our illtimed resentment arousing that nest of hornets the magistrates  would ruin the fruit of those plans which a little discretion will mature  and as to sir guise himself added miles archly  it would be as impossible to persuade him as me or indeed yourself that a young fellow should come here and drink champaigne or burgundy  which i perceive by these telltale bottles has been the case  without your consent unless he committed a rape upon the key of your cellar also  no  no  let us be merry and wise my dear widow leave the event of this business with me  i have a memory and mind very faithful to my resentments and depend upon it when opportunity favors though it should be the length of the siege of troy before it arrives i shall cherish the freshest recollection of whatever has been done or said in this business even down to the saucy snap of his fingers in my face which his hearts dearest blood shall one day pay for  no matter  leave the thoughts of revenge to me  when time is ripe do you assist the deed and depend on it we shall both be satisfied  this consideration pacified her and as miles knew sir guise was safely disposed of in the apartments of the deluded jane atwood for the night he entered into the explanations he thought fit to make the widow for his untimely visit and the amiable pair retired after the bustles of the night to the consolation of each others faithful arms  but though this happy couple reconciled by mutual deception were satisfied with each other they were by no means so with henry  for notwithstanding the happy turn which the widow gave to the affair at the time and her incessant assurances since so often as it was mentioned it was beyond the reach of policy casuistry or the most solemn oaths to make valentine believe there had not been some previous intercourse between henry and herself and that he caught them only in some quarrel of love which would have ended in the usual way had not his coming at the moment made it expedient for her to pretend violence outrage and displeasure  and the idea did not a little aggravate the hate he bore to the fitzortons who appeared at every turn the bane of his purposes  indeed john and henry were now alike detestable to him especially as at this time the person of mrs tempest  though for reasons good he consented to divide her with sir guise  was not then indifferent to him for he had only begun to plot alienating the affections of the recently seduced jane from the baronet  and as to mrs tempest herself the sudden gust of love  or by whatever other name the reader thinks it ought to be called for henry was presently succeeded by as sudden an aversion when she found that no less than three penitently tender letters and one madly accusing epistle which she caused to be clandestinely delivered to him by the means of david otley produced not one word of reply  the caution and dread of consequences however suggested by miles restrained her from public and avowed revenge but the thirst of vengeance kept raging within and threatened one day to burst upon his head meantime she availed herself of more than one occasion to do him secret mischief by way of giving earnest of her future designs  the anonymous letters to john and his father respecting caroline were from this ladys pen  and had she known at the time his situation with olivia that would probably have been the subject of a third epistle  why she did not since that do him this kindness also is yet in our confidence and also the farther proof in her instance how great truth there is in that celebrated distich of the poet   heaven has no plague like love to hatred turned nor hell a fury like a woman scorned in regard to henry candid reader his error and his repentance are both before you  his trespass and his temptations have been delineated  we are writing certain parts of the history of human nature the inconsistencies of which we must again repeat it is our office rather to describe than account for  the foregoing scene has nothing irreconcilable with the frail though interesting subject of our book the human heart and it is to be wished that every young man who began an adventure of this kind as imprudently might finish it as amiably as henry fitzorton  to suppose that this his approach to infidelity will recommend him to the virtuous reader would be insulting but to imagine he has lost that virtuous readers good will for his first and last indiscretion of this kind would be to suspect that the reader has either great ignorance of human nature or great hypocrisy  there seems to us no other alternative  leaving therefore the point to be settled by the only power which can settle it the readers conscience we shall return to the place from whence we have digressed  chapter xlii about the time that the disastrous henry left the abbey the impatient olivia bent her steps toward that venerable mansion  and never perhaps was an evening walk undertaken by two persons in situations of mind and with reflections more opposite henry impelled by despair and driven by irremediable necessity from the presence of his dear but deeply distressed caroline literally felt that he dragged at each remove the lengthening chain every step hurried him farther from the object of his affections while olivia animated by hope was by every step brought nearer to him whom she loved with unspeakable tenderness and whom she fondly believed she was about to make the happiest of mankind  they met about the mid way of the memorable grand avenue and the sudden sight of each other inspired very distinct emotions  henry wished for the velocity of thought to escape so unseasonable a rencontre and olivia sighed for the speed of light to reach his hand  yet both were alike embarrassed the one by trembling joy the other by variety of sorrow  by an involuntary impulse henry receded a few paces with the degree of rapidity that olivia advanced the wings of fear are even more rapid than those of love  but henry soon recovered himself and his steps and by one of those hazards which have all the air of design and yet are common enough in life olivia and henry joined each other immediately parallel to the place where the first avowal of love had been made by henry to caroline  a circumstance we trust in the full recollection of the reader  anxious to know carolines reply to the request stated in the letter which had already produced so much mischief in the abbey family olivia was covered with blushes and hesitating almost to a stammer alluded to the subject most likely to increase henrys confusion  what would i give said she to have been a sylph or some other spirit to have been present yet unseen at the reading of my hurried but heartfelt letter to caroline  present at it  you present  good heaven exclaimed henry throwing up his hands and eyes  i dare say continued olivia you all thought me  but yet  i hope    her blushes deepened and the faultering of her voice augmented  i hope caroline did not show it  gracious  if she did i should never forgive her yet recovering herself wherefore should i talk thus wherefore attempt to conceal the pride and triumph of my life o henry my dear  dear  henry grant me a portion of your eloquence that i may express what i feel at the thought of calling henry  i know not what i would say  i only know that i am the most honored and blessed of human beings  and that it is his goodness love and constancy have made me so  her eyes were directed to those of henry as her artless heart thus poured itself forth to her now almost husband for in his late absence the two fathers had at last fixed the eventful day of those nuptials which had a thousand times come into the sport and seriousness of the family conversation but lady fitzorton had communicated it in form to olivia a few minutes before she set out to meet henry  the eyes of henry were now cast a different way  and they were filled with tears  ah hope and glory of my life exclaimed olivia  wherefore do you weep if those tears like mine proceed not from excess of tenderness  excess of felicity  the earth bars not such a wretch as olivia  they do  the almighty searcher of hearts knows  they do proceed said henry passionately from tenderness  that omnipotent witness be praised ejaculated olivia and yet methinks i would not have such drops as these flow from my henrys heart even though they spring from joy  archangels might have sanctioned the movement with which olivia now laid her cheek to that of henry and dried up his tears alas the fountain was full and streamed afresh  yonder is an arboring tree with a bench round it  i see it through the underwood said olivia gently drawing henry toward the place  let us rest awhile continued she for i have something  very  very dear to impart to my henry  henry suffered himself to be led passively on when reaching the bench he sat down olivia placing herself by his side  i protest said olivia resuming her cheerfulness that henry might catch the gaiety this spot seems formed for tender hearts  does it not henry  one would imagine these bowering hawthorns and these oerarching shades branching from this romantic oak had been the scene of some gentle assignation in days of chivalry  every word she spoke though designed to convey more than the roses fragrance to his sense was sharper than a thorn pressing into his heart his disappointments were all brought close under his very eye and wherever he turned memory presented some bleeding image of former felicity untimely destroyed even in the spot which was at once the place of its birth and burial  he turned his head as to conceal his agitations when those initials of carolines name which his own hand had carved in the rind of the oak met his view and the words o my only life and love burst spontaneously from his heart the name of caroline which was about to follow this passionate exclamation quivered and died on his lips yet wholly subdued by a situation so affecting he sunk down on olivias shoulder and he had only strength enough to sigh out this  this  is too much  olivia naturally applied to herself the abovementioned tender expression so characteristc of henrys habits and so congenial to the rahpsody of her own heart and she supposed  as how indeed could she imagine otherwise  he was melted by that overwhelming sensibility which might well be excited in a disposition like his by the avowal she had made of boundless returns of her affection and ah in what language but your own cried she chastely but fondly caressing him her own lovely eyes repaying him with largest interest every tear  oh in what language but henrys can i answer such tenderness  my only life my only love yes added she exalting her voice without diminishing its sweetness that divinity to whom my beloved had just appealed in testimony of his own faith can tell how truly my love and life are devoted to him alone  henry raised himself up as if to rectify the misconstruction which had been put on an expression that olivia had so naturally appropriated but the sudden appearance of little fitz and in the ensuing moment the sound of a voice exclaiming there is the dog  depend upon it his friends are not far off  pointed his attention to other objects  chapter xliii henry and olivia without expressing their surprise to each other hasted through the opening in the bushes to explore the cause when they observed sir armine and lady fitzorton coming up the avenue and within a few paces of them  olivia who had caught up little fitz in silent rapture ran down the avenue to meet them and in a whisper assured lady fitzorton that henry was the best creature in the world and had made her the happiest  with all his ardours you know my dear madam said she he is not a man of professions  more delicately trusting to actions than words in attestation of his feelings  a conduct i have often vainly attempted to imitate and which i have admired even when i could have quarrelled with him for it but had you heard the endearing expressions he just uttered accompanied by his tears and witnessed by his lovedeclaring eyes  o heaven  indeed  indeed  i am the happiest  and he is the best of human beings  during the display of this delusion which those who admire olivia will wish might end with her life henry was advancing but with steps that little justified olivias description on an occasion which would have carried him  had he been indeed her lover  with a speed and impatience like her own  indeed he seemed at first undetermined whether to make his escape by rushing into the woods or to join the family party perceiving however the latter were moving toward him he thought it would be impossible to recede and after assuring his stars that he now defied their utmost malice and should resign himself to their malignant power without any farther resistance he somewhat quickened his pace like a man giving himself up despairingly to the worst that could happen notwithstanding this he saluted his parents with those graces of filial duty which the sight of them always enkindled and which even disappointed love of whose pangs they were in great measure the cause could not extinguish  the sight however of little fitz whom he had not before seemed to notice had nearly overset his plan of nonresistance would it not be best for me dearest madam to step home with that spaniel said he to his mother i dare say he watched the opening of the abbey gate to follow me  henry held out his arm to receive him from olivia who sportingly said she was sure he came again on a message to her from his fair mistress for there was more than ordinary accident in the dogs returning so soon and at such a moment they might depend on it and she would therefore give him a fair chance either to go or stay  she gently patted him and set him down observing that she would use no bribery to detain nor any chiding to dismiss him let him follow his own unbiassed inclinations said olivia if he goes toward the abbey i declare i will not say a word to call him back but if he attends any of us uncalled i shall  yes you may laugh at my superstition as much as you please  but i shall think there is more in it than common chance  and expect a welcome for him at the castle till i can have an opportunity to return him to his lovely owner in person  there  now for it  he is now to do as he likes say nothing but let us walk on and leave him to himself  little fitz was no sooner set upon the ground than he paid his compliments first to henry then to the rest of the company and bounding along the avenue in the direct line toward the castle seemed to confirm the prepossession of olivia who now roundly reasserted nothing should persuade her there was not more in it than even the philosophy of john had he been present could find out  sir armine who had attended rather to the history of his sons face than to what had been said about the dog caught the eye of henry and overruled whatever farther arguments or objections he might have been disposed to make so the whole groupe went together to the castle at first they walked arm in arm in a row but soon after they divided two and two  olivia and lady fitzorton sir armine and henry this arrangement was again altered by design or accident for sir armine proposed that his wife and olivia should make the best of their way home and that he and henry would take a poetical saunter and follow at leisure averring that he wished to discuss with him a knotty point  the emphasis with which he pronounced these words and the smile that accompanied them was so well understood by her ladyship that she pleasantly exclaimed walking away with olivia at the same time pray my dear daughter let us leave these poetic philosophers to settle their knotty points by themselves while you and i whispered she to olivia who crimsoned at the remark go and prepare some other knots that shall prove too hard for both their worships olivia turned back thrice on pretense of seeing whether little fitz preferred the male or the female division of the party but possibly for a more affectionate reason the sagacious and political little animal however seemed to keep like james fitzorton the midway between them and so continued to hold well with both parties  a line of conduct which has been faithfully followed by much greater politicians  we would forbear to insert these minutiae were we not assured that the real great events in life are as some one has profoundly observed produced by a nice train of little circumstances  for example this apparenly trifling matter of filing off the family groupe into divisions led to an incident of as great importance to henry and perhaps to our readers as any hitherto recorded in this history  end of vol ii
