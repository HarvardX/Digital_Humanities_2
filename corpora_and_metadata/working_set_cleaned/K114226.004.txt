the history of benignus chap lxviii i thought mr draper the true standard for imitation and resolved to copy his manner but for the blood of me i could not hit him off the air of his walk was my first object there was sometimes a trip sometimes a swagger and sometimes a kind of carefornothing saunter in his motions that in him were becoming but at secondhand exhibited a drollery truly laughable the trip had well nigh tilted me upon my nose the swagger made me strike the arm of a lady to the great injury of her ruffle for which i had like to have been rewarded with a broken head by a gentleman who for ought i know might be her husband and in trying to catch the saunter i only succeeded in the carefornothing part of the business which conducted me into a kennel that conveniently ran by the side of the pavement from which i had deviated this unsuccessful mimicry gave such pleasure to the most polished character of the age that he very plentifully wept with laughter and when i was making the effort to swing my cane with a suitable carelessness by which i chuckd it against the chin of a chairman who damned me for a saucy rascal and ran away with my property it was too much to bear and he supported himself against a doorpost from dropping down dead in the street a victim to risibility piqued a little at this i proposed phlebotomy and offered to send for a surgeon but draper perceiving a crowd beginning to cluster for it is incredible how few moments are necessary to collect a mob in london he got the better of his convulsion and asking my pardon walk forward i forgave him in expression but the insult and the inhospitality sunk deep into my heart and whether it was benevolent in  or not i wished for nothing half so much as an occasion of revenge and this i think was the second instance i detected in myself a propensity to recriminate it will however he considered that i was now launched into the world my villagenotions were wearing off town maxims were succeeding and i am much afraid we shall always be found to lose our amiable simplicity in proportion as we engage ourselves in active scenes and procure that sort of knowledge which arises from such engagements  at all events however i was resolved to decline all imitations for the future and stick to the original uncouth as it might be better thought i to be naturally clownish than affectedly ridiculous and perhaps this wellbred town will soon give me as delicate a polish as the best of them draper it is most likely saw my chagrin and with a flippancy peculiar to himself rallied me upon it oh thou simpleton cried he in a world like this to sacrifice a single moment to the spleen but above all things to let an harmless piece of jocularity make thee grave to laugh mr draper said i you know is exquisite but to be the subject of derision is the agony of the damned pshaw answered draper not amongst friends he who furnishes the most amusement is the most agreeable companion and to show you that i really think so i charge you to have as much laugh out of me as you possibly can and before half the day is over a precious morsel you will find me i promise you look if tom spangle is not crossing the way  the finest lad in the universe benignus you must know him i will introduce you directly with this mr draper skipped over the street with the heel of a mercury caring six pence neither for the soul or body of the poor devil whom he left to scamper after him and nice indeed even to the verge of a miracle was my escape for in attempting to be at the opposite pavement as soon as he i was hemmed in the very middle of the street by a press of coaches on the one hand and a dreadful length of drays on the other while the clash of wheels the thunder of oaths and the smack of whips resounded on all sides at length however i got safe to mr draper to whom i would not complain of my terrors and he instantly put my hand into the soft and white palm of mr tom spangle  never were the exteriors of two people more exactly contrasted than the exteriors of draper and spangle the latter being the sleekest slimmest and most shivering little creature that ever shuddered at a breeze the chin was as smooth as the lips of a lady and the limbs as unsubstantially delicate as those which belong to the greyhounds of italy and the tender proprietor of this person was just stepping into a milliners shop to recruit himself with hungary water we stopped him at the door and i shall give the reader with all possible regard to truth an abstract of the conversation which now passed between mr draper and his friend and so you would not come amongst us yesterday says spangle you lost much of your dearly beloved laugh i can tell you that we had some of the sweetest sport in nature rather fatiguing indeed but the variety rendered it enchanting aye indeed replied draper how did you go on this is no place child answered spangle to enter into the agreeable particulars the next door is a coffeeroom you see  they went into the coffeehouse seated themselves without ceremony placed me in the middle and thus mr spangle without any respect to the company in the room continued his narrative now draper i must tell you that it was a complete day of rattle and ecstasy and if my nerves had not been monstrously in tune i must have absolutely expired of an excess of bliss never spent so exquisite a day in my life and a fast day into the bargain  such a put of a parson but the organ made us amends for we all went to the chapel because you know who always sits in the pew facing the pulpit what a pretty puritan it is lord dazzle drew her eyes from the prayer book more than once lovebook thought to attract her by his voice and so read the psalms louder than the clark sir charles crazy focussd her through an operaglass but jesus george what are all the tricks of arts to the charms of nature  i was only in  a mere undress  and made a conquest in half an hour really cried draper with a very grave face true on my veracity answered spangle about the middle of the litany i made an impression the epistle and gospel set her a trembling the second lesson that you know comes next was something about peter or paul i forgot which marrying and burning and this as i fixed my eyes upon her threw her into a celestial confusion as much as to say that spangle is a divine fellow  at the end of the communion she cried out with great fervor lord have mercy upon us and before orthodox had half done his ditty which was all about the obligations to charity  you know what a jew he is  the smelling bottle was at her nose and in five minutes afterward as i now pursued my advantages her face turned quite red and to my eternal honor and then immortal triumph i drove her fairly out of church the congregation rose to stare the girl held down her head as if she had been doing penance in a white sheet tottered through the aile as if she would sink upon one of the old stone tombs and some of the people methought looked at me as they would say yes yes mr spangle  it is all over with her  she is breeding i suppose for all her piety  he paused and hummed an air and do you think sir said i to spangle there was any thing so superlatively pleasurable in sending a young woman from divine service by dint of stare pleasurable echoed spangle why sir she is modest does that make it more honorable in you to look that modesty out of countenance  certainly said he to triumph over a girl who goes to church four times a week who pretends to such a cursed deal of devotion and has always a  a  a  besides she is uncomeatable how do you know that says draper why answers spangle as soon as old orthodox had mumbelled over his sermon and dismissed us with the peace of god i gave my party the slip and drove to strawbys not to be got though i offered a thousand for her privy purse the jade wanted to fob me off with the first taste of the mercers wife who is to meet colonel sweeps this evening the womans handsome and desirable but strawby has only been after her a fortnight  besides she is really married and i detest adultery it is one of my crying sins you must know draper so then you have no hopes of this religious lady cries mr draper who maintained very serious features during this discourse why yes replied spangle upon the whole i think i have for strawby is to set all wheels to work she is it seems an only child and so is cursedly close attended by her mother luckily the father is dead and the girl looks divinely in mourning here i felt a tear upon my cheek which was not however detected by either of my companions and the amiable mr spangle went on in this manner  chap lxix strawby it seems knows a girl who keeps a young fellow who is very intimate in the family and who is besides in the good graces of the old woman the mother now the scheme is to get this girl to get this man to get this woman as how said draper  my blood ran cold through my veins and my heart lay freezing at my breast  as how replied draper why this kept man you may be sure rejoined spangle wants cash i will meet him at strawbys who will invite him as if by accident then i will take such a liking to him as to be afterward often in his company after this we will go to the church where miss dian dick  a  a  i was going to tell her name but as this gentleman pointing to me is a stranger and as it is an affair of honor he will excuse me so as i was saying i will pretend to be deeply smitten and talk about laying fortune and person at her feet this induces the fellow by this time my fast friend to post away to the mothers house which you know is at the bottom of st jamess street  pish curse my blundering head  but her name is sacred i shall then soon pay a visit in form  then come to your callin asit happens  then to your howdoyou familiars  then alarm the girl into a passion  tattle about settlements  bring a proper attorney with parchments  scheme a short delay  indulge endearment  set out together for an airing  drive about till it is dusk and so then to strawbys  here he snapped his fingers in a kind of victorious flourish over his head  i started up and exclaimed in a stern voice and what then sir  why then sir replied spangle cooly we may possibly take our chocolate in bed the next morning and the night afterward she will be very much at your service what dont you intend to make her your wife then sir said i make her my wife replied the beau in a faint frighted voice  would you have me run my neck into another halter then you are already espoused to the finest woman in the three kingdoms and as much above this dingy diana as cleopatra was to that old crooked crump of a thing in the bar  uttering the comparison loud enough for a woman unhappily deformed to hear him as she was pursuing her business mr draper said i if you will favor me with direction to this tailor i will go and find him out for in the company of a man who flies openly in the face of his god and rejoices in the fall of beauty and innocence i can really stay no longer the pale creamy face of mr spangle immediately shifted to a more sanguine hue and he pertly said he did nothing which made him ashamed to face his god and that if i would walk into a more private apartment he would convince me that he was not afraid to face a man looking at the same time at me from head to foot as if he thought me a boy and now came on mr drapers laughing time for sometimes he soothed sometimes encouraged sometimes provoked both yet appeared all along the dispassionate and zealous friend of both i told him that i had nobler reasons than any proceeding from fear for declining to dispute with him if you should change your mind sir replied spangle taking a piece of paper from his pocketbook and penciling his name upon it  i am always found there sir tossing the address to me with an air of disdain and offering to go out nay nay fie gentlemen cried draper interposing dont be grave about trifles let me put your hands together to be sure you have both said a word too much and some people would have a meeting upon it but hang it the girl is not worth duelling for at least drop it for the present and let us have a friendly cup of coffee together  excuse me george says the beau walking away in a flurry i must not have my morals disputed with impunity sir you will hear from me shortly so saying he threw down six pence on the board tossed himself into a sedan twitched the curtains round on all sides and was bobbed off before he had finished the story of felicity and his adventures on a day devoted to fasting and prayer as soon as he was gone draper who had been upon the whole unusually serious now gave way to the fun of his temper and discovered at once his own character and that of spangle in a style equally ludicrous and licentious that fellow sir says he is the strangest mortal upon the face of the earth three or four years ago he was as jolly and hearty a looking man as myself but his passion for women has made him what you see variety and difficulty equally distinguish his amors for he never sees the same woman twice except his wife with whom he never steeps and if any of his objects are obtained without great pains and proportionate charge he takes the first opportunity after possession not only to leave but disgrace her can there said i possibly be such a devil in the form of a man without answering me draper proceeded  chap lxx now you must know i hate difficulty though i have no objection to variety i am in friendship with this coxcomb therefore merely on the score of convenience for as he never repeats his visit to his ladies and ransacks both town and country for such as are the most virtuous and celebrated for the satisfaction of a single hour i always have them  most as soon as himself without  trouble of dangling after them  debauching them so that i have  the enjoyment without a spice of the wickedness and if a man can be good on such easy terms he is a  you know to refuse them because that would be doing the devils  for nothing as to sighting you need be under no apprehensions on that head for i promise you he will not draw his sword to settle much worse words than have passed between you and him he is the greatest coward in europe and between you and i can neither give satisfaction to man or woman though he is constantly in quarrels and has either bought himself off battles or hired people to take up his cause fifty times but come benignus more of this another opportunity we have fueled away above an hour with this fopling and we will now call on my tailor he rose and settled for our chocolate with the crooked woman at the bar and then saying he should return in a minute went into the yard  the reader it is hoped is by this time sufficiently acquainted with me to be certain i did not allow the minute of his absence to pass by without pouring forth the reflections that the transactions of the morning had excited what a pair of precious fellows said i are here a seducer of the modest and a receiver of the seduced one glorying because his impudence drove a lady from her devotions and the other in expectation of enjoying the benefit of the intrigue should it be ultimately successful then the dark plot laid against the virtue of this young lady  the last lovely prop of her widowed mother now mourning the loss of a husband i shudder at the danger which hovers over the relicts of this amiable house  and yet how is the mischief  how is the impending misery to be prevented  chance frequently orders the matter better infinitely better than contrivance perhaps that very stroke which we call chance is in reality the wisdom of preternatural direction and in that case the difference lies only in the word while the meaning is the same as i was deliberating on the means by which poor diana might be rescued from dishonor i put my hand into my pocket to take out my handkerchief in doing which i dropped one of my gloves and in stooping to take it up i saw a pocketbook lying under the table which i found had accidentally been left by spangle when he gave me his address and i was just proceeding with it to the barkeeper with a proper charge to deliver it to the gentleman should he enquire for it when the return of mr draper made me think it better to give it him as a friend who might have an earlier opportunity of delivering it fortunately however as the reader will perceive in the sequel draper had none of that troublesome punctilio about him which would have deterred me from invading the secrets of this private repository on any consideration whatever indeed this gentleman had a strange mixture of heterogeneous qualities in his character the true color of which was not to be ascertained at one sitting and he painted himself in the end much livelier and truer than it was in the power of any other person to depict him the moment he cast his eye on the pocketbook he seized it as a prize and swore it must be one of the greatest curiosities in the world a pocketbook benignus is the man of pleasures companion or a polite directory to all places of fashionable resort as necessary to us my dear boy as our shirts and appropriated to nearly the same use viz to conceal secrets as soon as we have seen skain we will saunter homewards through the mall and enjoy this delightful treat which spangle has unintentionally afforded us we now left the coffeeroom and as we walked along i asked draper if he thought it quite delicate to open the pocketbook there you go answered he that damned delicacy has made all the young men and women mere blushing babies our novels plays and conversations are now conducted with so much refinement nay our very sermons  i should say our moral essays are so confounded delicate that we are for ever talking about it and about it without having the courage to speak out and yet what is all this delicacy but circumlocutory licentiousness honest matter of fact dressed in a veil of gause the disguise seen through with half an eye nay it were no difficult point to prove that the ribaldry of lord rochester is infinitely less pernicious than the description of scenes drawn by those gentry who pique themselves upon their fine feelings bawdry sir candied over by sentiment is swallowed eagerly by the coyest maiden in the world but  oh rude wretch she abominates the writer who says the same thing in a plainer way what would you infer from these remarks mr draper said i i hate argument my dear fellow said draper and so let us make the best of our way to skains and then i will give you an instance of my delicacy with respect to the pocketbook a few minutes smart walking brought us to a street where draper presently rappd at the door of a handsome house and enquired for mr skain and upon being told he was at home we were begged to walk for a moment into a parlour till mr skain could be called this parlour its furniture and the look of the servant bespoke something so much beyond any idea i had conceived of a tailor that i made no scruple of asking draper what apartments in so fashionable a house skain could possibly occupy this was a sweet question for the constitution of my companion who enjoyed once more at my expense the exquisite pleasure of laughing though where the joke lies in laughing at a mans seeming ignorant of what he never had an opportunity of knowing i really cannot tell in the midst of the merriment in came a somebody in a green velvet cap linen nightgown laced waistcoat fill stockings and morocco flippers aye skain how do you do i have brought you a young customer a man of fashion just come to his estate he is my most particular friend and you must be with him tomorrow at mrs darlingtons in cavendish square i should as soon have suspected draper himself to have been a weilder of the goose and sciffars as this identical mr skain who listened to my friends harangue without any thing approaching to that cringe and congee so incidental to the character in the country so far however was he from cringing that he rested his bum against a table with all the important lounge of a nobleman played a sort of tune with his singers upon the side of his gown and stroaked his beard with the other hand till mr draper had finished after which without once dropping his dignity he began  chap lxxi tomorrow sirl god bless your soul my dear mr draper i could not spare five minutes tomorrow for five hundred pounds i have such an ocean of work in hand and all to be done by saturday night that i could dispense with forty hands more than i have already  besides there is lady luss new liveries and lady fades mourning must positively be finished this week i am highly proud of the lonour and shall take a pleasure in serving the gentleman but you know our predicament our customers are all in a hurry and i am so much in the death and marriageway that i can scarce call a moment my own for a mouthful of victuals i am likewise at this instant equipping an heir for this world and an old fellow for the other who by the bye ought to have died seven years ago and the widow is as anxious to put on black to tell her acquaintance she is her own mistress as the heir to get out of his sables and tell the women he is a match for any fortune amongst them if the young gentleman could wait therefore for a few days till  lookee skain answered draper i insist on your being with my friend in the morning he is just from the country and cannot go into public for want of proper clothes well sir replied skain in a more submissive voice if that is the case i will sit up with my men night and day or throw some of the work in hand by  for one can make free with old customers  rather than distress a gentleman and indeed i perceive  here mr skain lifted up my coat by the pocket flap  i perceive the gentleman has been in bad hands he has been as i often say among the butchers of broadcloth and ruiners of raiment  in this facetious strain was our gentlemantaylor proceeding when the parlourdoor opened and enlarged our society by the addition of a person who was announced to be mr thrift the taylors attorney and who had babbled out his business not much in the way of his profession without any regard to strangers the moment he entered to the credit of the trade however i must confess this was one of the rotten limbs and not one of the found members of the law a dirty dark drudging character to whom no man of reputation would entrust his business nor any but creatures like himself become clients well friend skain we have nabbed him at last master dudge is a most indefatigable fellow as sure of his prey as a kite ay aye he has him at last locked up in holborn a fine prospect of a grated window before him seven writs after him  heavy charges mr skain i dont care a farthing for that cries skane in an ecstasy as we have got him in limbo my heart is easy and i shall rest quiet in my bed in limbo he is then i promise you replied thrift and likely to remain there till an act for i know several tradesmen besides you who have bills against him and i now think it my duty as an honest man to acquaint them they may renew their writs and lodge their detainers to be sure replied skain to be sure it behooves every christian to serve another in this case for the good of trade is concerned in these cases and such a fellow should be punished as an example he is a mere bite mr thrift  an arrant bilk though he has an address and i once thought him very much of a gentleman and how came you so soon to change your mind questioned mr draper who seemed resolved to sit out all disputes why as sure as i stand here mr draper i have taken pounds upon pounds of that mans money and for some time he was as punctual as the pendulum deliver a bill and take your cash nay sometimes he would insist upon my writing a receipt in full as soon as the clothes were sent home and more than once i have been obliged to press credit upon him that he might not suppose i was afraid to trust him but for these two years i cannot hear that he has paid any body and yet the fellow tricks out himself and his wife and his three children as gay and gaudy as mr anybodys family my account alone runs pretty high but i have his body for my goods however and i fear cried thrift shrugging up his shoulders that is all you are ever likely to have for i dont think the man has sixpence to save his soul nay i am sure he has not for mr dodge gave me such an excellent account of the manner by which he was nabbd that it is worth your hearing for you must know  stop a moment dear mr thrift till i ring for some chocolate do pray mr draper and you sir said skain pressing me to keep my seat stay i beseech you and hear the story there is nothing in my idea so high as scenes of low life to this speech draper who loved adventures to the bottom of his heart and who seldom interrupted people in the relation of them till all was over answered only by a slight bow and i sat too much amazed to talk considering the whole society as a collection of devils and equally despising the coolness of draper the malignity of skain and the scoundrelism of the scrivener  chap lxxii just as the taylors footman who i can assure the reader was a black with a silver shoulderknot had brought the chocolate on a splendid waiter a fresh tap at the door introduced to us another worthy gentleman under the name of mr dodge a queer quaintlooking little fellow with a fly leer arch visage and a black wig aha cried thrift if here is not little dodge himself mr dodge says skane taking him by the dirty hand with great cordiality i am infinitely indebted to your diligence  i wished in my heart the catchpole had broke his neck for his pains  the gentlemen resumes mr thrift are desirous to know the methods you used to take master sudberry oh cries dodge twill do your heart good to hear it in all the time i have been in office never saw such a go in my life pray begin said skain eagerly quite forgetting that he could not spare five minutes for five hundred pounds  pray begin  dodge  i can hardly tell you for laughing replied this mr dodge holding his sides mat slappim will trugge and i were hunting up a girl in hedge lane who owed some three or four pound to her washer business being bad with her of late as she could not get out becase of illness seeing as how she was a little allow with  consumption and so gemmin refused her  and in looking for this same  sal sandy who should i see with his mouth wide open as if he was a mind to make a meal of the air but the denkal issiognemy of this mr sudberry i tips slappim the ligo and nudges the elbow of trugge as much as to say olio  i have him in view the fellow still kept sucking in the sm as if it was hastypudding and had no spicion of we till the maid opened the door to fetch a pennurth of porter and then we tusseld her against the doorpost and made directly all three together to the garret but the maid by this time specting us cried out to her master lock the door sir lock the door here is a parcel of baillees in the house with that his spouse as i think it was by her running fastened the door and drew the bolt across in a cursed fluster and to make it the more securer for women you know gentlemen are for always overdoing the thing she set the chairs and tables against it now your honors must know that we dare as well be d  d as break a lock though it is law to lift a batch so what does me i but seeing as how the woman belonging to the house was a poor honey i lays me down at the stop of the stairs and threatened to starve them out for you know we are all forced to eat an the devil himself stood at the door all this time sudberry for whom i always had the needful in my pocket said never a word but kept pussing and catching at the breath like a brokenwinded horse for i finds he has your arsemakcack disorder upon him and they say air is the best thing in the world for that mrs sudberry a fine creature as ever you saw gentlemen began to argufy with us touching our going ost the premises and upon my soul talked over the thing in such a moving manner every now and then stopping to sob that if it had not been doing an injury to mr skain here i could have found in my heart to have left um but i am but an humble servant of his majestys and must do my duty according to my conscience this made me go through it we stayed in this manner about four hours till the watchmen went about then as sure as you are alive the woman called out to martin napguard and said robbers and russians were broke in to the house and insisted upon his taking us to the watchhouse lord help her head how little she knows who and who is together robbers maam cried napguard i cannot take them out of the house if it were full  but if you deliver them to me on the outside the door then i can charge them in the kings name and take them away this set us all a laughing pray madam said slappim who is as great a wit as any in england and has as much to say for himself  pray deliver us on the outside the door and then we will all go jollily to prison together to make short of the matter it began to grow late and so hearing as how they were drawing the curtains and preparing for bed without caring for supper i and my companions went to bed too  and where might you sleep pray said mr draper at the stairhead your honor replied the bailiff and a very good lodging too but in the middle of the night sudberry began to grunt worse than ever  the children set up their pipes betweenwhiles for bread and the mother was one time kissing one then the other then chearing up the husband while we got some liquor from next door made the landlady tipsy and was sure of our game in the morning but cuss me if that mrs sudberry is not a match for all the officers in town she is a deep one i promise you  in the morning d  n my eyes gentlemen if she did not fairly bilk us do what we would how was that master dodge said skain a little disappointed  there is a little back room continued dodge about a yard wide with a little peephole of a casement just big enough to heave in a twopenny loaf and a small teakettle into this window she drew her victuals throwing a string to the maid to tie fed her children boiled a little broth in a cann for her husband and threatened to do so till sunday when you know the law  the mores the pity for the nation  does not suffer us to do business  this scheme put us all to our wits end and we now began to be faucy a little hoping to make her husband in a passion and so open the door trugge therefore who has a foul mouth of his own when he pleases talked balderdash to mrs sudberry through the keyhole which she did not answer for indeed she seems a civil spoken woman truly but slappim said sommit to rise the husband at last and without more ado quite forgetting his sickness he burst the door open in an instant with a drawn sword in his hand  an old black one though without a handle and swore he would stab the first man upon earth that should dare to result his wife this was just what we wanted and while i beat off his sword with my stick in this manner  here the bailiff stood on the desensive trugge tripped up his heels behind and slappim gave him a douse on the shoulder  then off we carried him hooting through the streets and you would have died a laughing to have seen us march it was for all the world like a burien slappim and trugge walked with him in their arms for he could not stand and had never a shilling for a coach i strutted as head mourner or rather as parson mrs sudberry came crying after and the three birds whimpering along got fast hold of the mothers gown and sung through the nose in a sorrowful merry manner the dead mans psalm  at the conclusion of this narrative mr dodge twitched his wig stroaked the stock which was tied round the neck that would have disgraced a halter and looked at every spectator for applause as if he had really been doing the most meritorious action upon earth  chap lxxiii there are many occasions where language is extremely inadequate to express our sensations the present was one of them my anxiety as shakespeare has it beggared all description and i was unable to tell my detestation or my pity as soon as dodge had done draper rose from his chair with a sedater set of features than usual and demanded dodges direction which being obtained he ordered skain to send his fellow for a hackneycoach and while it was gone for he assumed a still severer look and addressed the company in this manner do you know now gentlemen that i look upon you as three of the completest scoundrels in the whole world and not a pin to choose as to the rascallity of either is this your combined juggle to torment a fellow creature if you were in my house i would lead you all out by the nose is this the practice of an attorney shame upon you why do i call you an attorney reptiles like you are the men who bring disgrace and dishonor on the profession  you lay yourselves out for every dirty jobb  encourage the trader in his uncompassionate resolutions  involve both debtor and creditor plaintiff and defendant in ruinous and unnecessary contest and are the vile instruments by which men are often engaged in dispute who without your villainous interposition would live harmoniously and neighbourly together  sir answered thrift i am not used to this treatment and i shall be tempted to bring my action if  action rascal replied mr draper begone and take care you dont tempt me to an action that may rob the gallows of its property well well  very fine very fine upon my soul cried thrift trembling and rising pretty usage this for a man of my profession  however it is well i am provided with witnesses pray hold yourselves in readiness gentlemen i shall summon you as evidences of the asfault and so sir your servant i will do you over with a slip of parchment i warrant you as he opened the door dodge made an effort to steal out with him sagaciously presuming that if thrift was a scoundrel he could not himself be thought an honest man but mr draper plucked him back by the skirts and insisted on his taking his share of admonition and you mr mancatcher cried draper by what statute or clause in an act of parliament are you permitted to treat the unfortunate in this barbarous manner what right have you to insult a poor man and his family by your loose jests ribaldry and obscenity who gave you authority to trip up a gentlemans heels and by what license is it that you dare to make a riot and disturbance at any persons door at all much less to continue there like an assassin all night if it had been my case sirrah i would have made no hesitation of shooting you through the head or running you through the body as a thief pursue your infamous avocation openly and fairly but i will be at some little pains to see whether you are to turn housebreaker and knock a man down to get at him  while mr draper was expostulating in this manner dodge played with his hat bit his nails changed color hung his head shook his ears and slunk after thrift in a pitiful and cowardly condition for let this be adopted as a rule that those who exist by promoting the anxiety of others and take the bread out of the mouth of the wretched or are in any other way the ministers of inhumanity and oppression are invariably a mean dastardly set of poltroons afraid to meet the eye of a man or to look but for a single into their own frightful bosoms when dodge disappeared draper addressed himself to the tailor who ever since the discourse began sat leaning his elbow on the table as if he had been stunned for draper being a man of very extensive connections skain who was a mere usurer at the bottom would almost as soon have set his prisoner at liberty as have offended so excellent a customer  as for you skain proceeded draper i blush for you you sir who have realized a fortune by a commerce with people of fortune nay who have by your own confession received obligations from the very man whom you are thus vigilant and industrious to persecute is not half your profit contingent upon credit and are you not so much aware of this as frequently to force that credit upon gentlemen much to their disinclination and still more to their disadvantage but why do i waste time in remonstrances with a fellow whom imposition has enabled to set up a chariot a wretch whose extortions have been the total destruction of many a minor and who is a scandal to the fairdealing tradesman i have done with you sir and i will take care that all my friends shall have done with you too  i desire you will send in my account directly and i will never have the least intercourse with you after it is paid such was now the meanness of this fellow that when mr draper was taking me by the hand and preparing to depart he said if he pleased to continue his custom he would release mr sudberry that you shall not mr tailor said i contemptuously i will assure you come mr draper let us go immediately to the bailiffs puppy cried draper turning upon skain as he was going out mr sudberry would scorn to owe even his liberty to such a wretch  i have already heard enough to convince me he would rot inch by inch in his jail rather than be released by his persecutor benignus i am at your service let us go and prevent this fellow and his precious group of friends from triumphing over the sick and the unhappy drive coachman to dodges lockuphouse holborn bars  chap lxxi among the peculiar pleasures of human life are agreeable surprises this last stroke of conduct so reconciled me to mr draper that i looked at him with transport and again thought him one of the worthiest of men a little eccentric and irregular said i to myself a little out of the common road but not the less kind or hospitable for that the sallies which look most suspicious are probably mere sportiveness the effects of health high spirits heat of blood and an animated fancy sense he has evidently wit is at his command he is preparing to be generous let me then not be too severe upon his vivacity but allow so good a character upon the whole its pleasantries and laugh  we stopped at a house fortified with bars of iron and upon entering it beheld thrift and dodge laying their heads close together where is mr sudberry said mr draper sir answered thrift may i crave two minutes audience of you alone they walked together into a small yard well secured by a roof of beams and this was the conversation of the scrivener  i see sir you are a gentleman who knows something i am sorry for any little warm words we may have exchanged and i ask your pardon to your business sir said mr draper why sir rejoined thrist i find there is a little mistake in this business the officer has acted sir without my assent and so there is a kind of a  a  here a violent noise in the house interrupted the discourse and brought draper back to me to enquire the occasion which happened to be a debate betwixt mr sudberry the prisoner and mr dodge the officer who went in to the said prisoners little room upon his leaving thrift with mr draper the sentiments which now issued from the keyhole of his room were to the following purport  oh inhuman creature to drag me in this situation with all my family after me when you were conscious i had it not in my power nay when three weeks before you came with that vile lawyer to my old lodgings and suffered my poor wife this dear woman to pawn her last gown and almost her last apron to give you civility money that you should not see me besides this have you not arrested me for a false debt nay do you not know in your hearts that mr skain has twice the value of my debt in his hands has he not a picture i gave mrs sudberry on the very morning of our marriage and which she  unknown to me till lately placed as a pledge with him to prevent my being troubled long ago when things began to run wrong with me oh that i had some friend snat  but i may still live to see you severely punished at the very beginning of this discourse thrift was shifting toward the door and upon mention of the wink money he was driving off as fast as he could when draper caught him by the collar while i inspired by an impulse too powerful to be resisted set my back against the door which was none of the slightest and fairly burst it open this violence discovered mrs sudberry and her children weeping on a dirty floor mr sudberry supporting himself against a chair arraigning the villainy of the bailiff and lawyer and the bailiff himself scratching his head and beginning to think  not that he was a greater rascal than ordinary but that he had been a more than ordinary blockhead in not taking the usual care to keep within the letter of the law  interesting however as the scene was it was considerably heightened by the addition of that glorious character mr thrift who unbraced from top to bottom without his periwig which had sorsaken his pate in the scuffle was now drawn in by the intrepid draper to give a splendid finishing to the drama several other prisoners of the place likewise and all the servants even to the continal of the streetdoor which was the trusty mr trugge himself came pearing into the parlour and were vatnisses to the general confusion for my part i ran insensibly to the sinking mrs sudberry while the poor fainting husband encouraged his babies as well as he was able not to be frighted assured them their papa was well that nobody would hurt their mamma and that the stranger men were only playing in sport oh my dear papa  my dear papa give brother and i a piece of bread and butter pray do indeed we will be good and deserve it  indeed we will will not we patty  i litty piece of bren e butte too lisped a little angel still unweaned from the knee i hungy as well as patty a servant girl as yet unhardened by her servitude in the family touched by the innocent prattle ran down into the kitchen and in the confusion brought a luncheon of bread which i seized instantly from her and kneeling down distributed it amongst them pray sir give poor papa and mamma a bit said the eldest i will cried the second offering half to mrs sudberry who was silently thanking god on her knees  no me vil feed my own papa cried the suckling  poor sudberry attempted to kiss the child but wanting strength to kneel fell backwards into my arms yet not so as to hurt himself when the little things had finished their repast and had sipped each a little water which the kindhearted girl likewise provided they wiped their sweet lips each upon its bib kissed me round for my goodness and putting their pretty palms together thanked god for a good dinner  meantime draper was not idle the truth is he had the way now fair before him the bailiff and scrivener saw themselves detected they knew the spirited character of mr draper and they were ready to come into any terms rather than forfeit their honorable calling  in the first place said draper either restore the gentleman his picture or release him in the next repay him the money you extorted from him that you might not see him when you had a writ against his person i have not got the picture your honor said the bailiff and if i should discharge the gemmin without consent of plaintiff i should be fixed with debt and costs as dead as a nail and moreover nor that the gemmin i understand is liable to more things against him than this here and if so be as how there should be fifty retainders in the office one upon the other i must answer em all and that there mr thrift knows well enough else i am sure i would not mind the value of mr skains matter the wipe of my finger as you please sir says draper then i will be bail for this gentleman and my friend shall be the other and we will be answerable for every thing make out the bailbond and look you to the consequence  chap lxxv this proposal coming from a man of fortune and a man acquainted with the world was by no means agreeable either to mr dodge or mr thrift for besides that they dreaded bringing the matter before a court they were equally in fear of the many evidences which now had it in their power to appear against them mr draper however was the last man in the kingdom to be trifled with and indeed was altogether the most universal character i ever knew as he could suit himself with wonderful facility to all circumstances in society and was either remarkable for indolence or industry gaiety or gravity as seemed most agreeable to the cast and constitution of the company  the loquacious humor therefore in which he was in at mrs darlingtons when i set him down as a compound of laugh whim and liberty was only the assumed disposition of the moment which he thought perhaps justly was better adapted to the sprightly hour of breakfast and the liveliness of the ladies whom he visited than the dullest detail of morals or the most formal lecture upon the beauty of holiness and this versatility sat so prodigiously easy upon him and was an art so immediately upon the heel of nature that nothing but the god of nature himself could know it to be imitation  but i can oblige my readers with no idea of this gentleman so well as by comparing him with a person who a little before the time of my retiring from the town and the world began to figure on the stage and to astonish such of my readers therefore who have seen mr garrick command the passions of the soul and assume at will the characters belonging to them those who have beheld him at one hour the pert slippant careless voluble coxcomb at another the injured tender choleric heartbroken king and father those who have seen him on one night represent and to all palpable apprehension be the haughty disdainful designing tyrant and then the generous elegant and manly lover now inviting our admiration at the heroism of youth and now exciting our compassion at the debility of age those in a word who have certainly been in a theater while this gentleman was acting and yet have almost quarrelled with conviction by a violent inclination to dispute either their being in a theater or that the man on the stage was only a clever counterfeit those i say who have been witnesses to the changes of this amazing performer will properly conceive of the infinite variety in the single character of that social proteus mr draper  while i have been letting the reader a little more into the secret of my friends character he will please to suppose messrs thrift and dodge were retired to a corner of the room in deep consultation and that the sudberrys were complimenting first mr draper and then me as if we had been messengers from heaven the middle of the parlour contained the crowd of captive spectators all of whom  a strange mixture of men and women  triumphed extremely in the embarrasment of the jailor and heartily hoped to see both him and the scrivener turned off together at length mr draper said he should wait their deliberations no longer he was in a hurry and ordered him to prepare the bond without any delay this produced another whisper from thrift who taking mr draper gently by the coatbutton and leading him with many cringes to the window asked with all possible submission whether he mr draper knew what he was about do you know my good sir said he do you know what you are liable to by bailing this prisoner the clouds are very heavy over his head and the tempest must light upon you i can have no interest nay i speak against myself for i shall touch if i make out a bailbond for master dodge who between you and me cannot spell his own name without i am at his elbow suppose therefore i was to step to mr skains and intercede for the prisoner whom i pity from the very bottom of my soul and perhaps at my instigation and making use of your name he may be induced to take the debt at so much a week or give him a little time to turn about or  i tell you fellow replied draper he shall have nothing to do with you or skain or any such rascals this is the prisoner show me the warrant that i may know the amount of the debt that young gentleman and myself are his bail and so refuse the matter at your peril  do it this instant or you will oblige me to send for my own attorney who will answer you in a minute perhaps you know mr tullyman of the temple at the name of tullyman thrift shrunk into himself and was silenced then spoke his illustrious compeer mr dodge  well well if his honor chooses for to go for to run all risqueses he must it is none of my affair i gets nothing by prisoners more nor my dues and so mr thrift must even get the bailbond drawn out seeing as how his honor is resolved upon it but his honor i hopes will have no objection for me for to make a bit of an inquiration about his honors charactur seeing as how i never seed his honor before and though no doubt he is a man of fortin and property his honor is a stranger to me and nobody knows nobody in london so if he thinks good for me to send trugge into neighborhood and just ax three or four or half a dozen of the shopkeepers to know who you are and what your honor is i shall be proud to take the bail  while mr dodge was delivering this splendid harangue the blood flushed over mr drapers handsome face and he slourished his cane in his hand in token of no very pleasant preparation and it is highly probable mr dodge would have had a perfect knowledge of this gentlemans character and of the healthy state of his body together with his great skill in the science of castigating a scoundrel had not his friend thrift that moment interposed by declaring that he knew mr draper extremely well and would take his security for a thousand pounds and that if he would only answer for the prisoners appearance at the return of the writ on the subsequent friday he would take the rest upon himself and as he admired a generous action as much as any man would get over the article of omitting to search the office as well as he could  this however was afterward related to me by mr draper for thrift did not for certain reasons choose to utter this speech before a large audience to avoid which piece of ostentation like a man willing to do his generous act in as private a way as he could he once more had recourse to drapers button and led him obsequiously thereby into another room at his return mr draper politely and tenderly informed mr sudberry that he was now at liberty to remove his family into more agreeable apartments and said he had taken the liberty to order one of the fellows to call a coach for that purpose here was another instance where words were mere expletives and so i can only observe that those readers who have the best hearts and sinest heads will have the justest conceptions of the scene which now passed betwixt the benefactor and the benefited meantime thrift whispered over the perils which would probably be avoided by this step and that it would be good law to turn out the prisoner rather than be turned out themselves which it is presumed might be reasonably expected from a public explanation of this mysterious affair mr thrifts whisper was of that kind which on the stage is called a soliloquy  that is one talking as loud to himself as if he was in warm debate with a large society but this was the defect of his voice which could by no management of modulation being naturally harsh heavy and hoarse be brought to the still small whisper or theatrically speaking into the all alone or even half aside for let it likewise be remarked by the bye that the stage talking to ones self is considerably more audible than the half aside when others are on the scene  chap lxxvi the prisoners also now began to sing forth the praises of generosity and enter into various observations one said it was well for some folks that they could find friends in strangers others remarked that some people were lucky and some unlucky ay says a drylooking fellow squinting over a womans shoulder i have been here sixteen months myself and could never get any body to do such a turn for me but then indeed i happen to have a plain woman for my wife here he cocked his eye at mrs sudberry and draper who perfectly understood the insinuation but thought the insinuator in no situation to answer for it only looked a reproach and led the way to the coach which was now driving up to the door i was going to distribute a few guineas amongst the multitude but draper pressed me significantly by the hand and bid me assist mrs and mr sudberry to the carriage declining that agreeable office himself probably to prevent giving umbrage and countenance to the sentiments of the other prisoner as we passed along and were placing the lady and her little ones into the coach the ingenious mr dodge with much simper and civility applied his singers to his hat and his nails to his head for hitherto from polite reasons he thought proper to wear his round beaver which was rimd with a black binding and in a tone betwixt servility and demand thus expressed himself to mr draper i hopes as how your honor will remember me for my goodness and umanity and the like of that seeing as how i had it in my power whether or no to let the gemmin go without paying the money and seeing as how i am still sponsor as well as your honor for his forthcoming as plantiff if your honor should die being as we are all mortable before friday and the gemmin should go off with his body which to be sure by law is none of his property at present and besides furthermore than this ater twentyfour hours i could if it want for my umanity carry prisoner over the water and as likewise i have lost bailmoney and let out gemmin as it were on padrowl and prorogation of honor seeing as life is a lottery and i may or may not clap eyes on him again because hap you know is just as it happens wherefore i hope my jennyrosity will be rewarded  while dodge was delivering these elegant sentiments i was handing in mr sudberry and her sick partner while draper with great gentleness was placing the children as commodiously and closely as possible by the side of their parents which being done and the door fastened mr draper first inquiring whether he might be permitted to do for once as he pleased with the little family directed the coachman to go softly over the stones and stop at the cornerhouse on the left hand side in doverstreet thus was all the umanity and jennyrosity of mr dodge totally lost in air and his last words were quite swallowed up by the less eloquent language of the carriagewheels and the driver a great painter whose forte lay in the pathetic and tender might now have been furnished with exquisite hints for a familypicture never surely were seen a coachful of characters more suited to the pencil mrs sudberry a tall interesting lovely figure was seated betwixt her husband and infants in the eye of poor sudberry himself glistend the drop of gratitude supported on the one hand by his wife on the other by draper one of the babes with a cherubic cheerfulness of countenance was gently playing with the hand of its mother and one was softly stroaking the languid face of the father while the third which was seated on my knee seemed highly delighted with the shewy trinkets that depended from the glittering watchchain which i had purchased of the toyman in this situation in which sudberrys disorder that even a joyful change of events could not remove was the only matter of inquietude we arrived in dover street at the elegant residence of mr draper that gentleman was out in a moment and welcomed his company with such an air of unassuming hospitality that his visitants forgot it was a first salutation and were pleasingly seduced into intimacy ere they had well concluded and completely interchanged the civilities of introduction the apartments of mr draper bespoke at the same instant the taste and temper of the master the furniture was in the highest splendour of fashion without any thing approaching to frippery we were conducted into a dining room in which was exhibited all the prettinesses of an ample fortune but mr drapers behavior was infinitely more engaging than any other object in his room he led the panting sudberry up along the room and seated him on a sopha he pressed him and at length prevailed upon him to swallow a cordial while i and the rest of the sudberrys even to the youngest infant which seemed more attracted by the conduct of the benefactor than by the sinery of the furniture and the flowers in the carpet were under the influence of an enchantment so truly soothing and benevolent that the whole appeared to be rather the delicious vision of a glowing fancy than a real scene in the great drama of modern life  chap lxxvii and yet no urbanity nor any arts of delicate attention from our host could prevent the tear from often gathering in the eye and often falling upon the cheek of the beautiful mrs sudberry the state of her husbands health absorbed every other idea and she could not be restricted even by her politeness from hanging around his neck wiping away the drop which asthmatic agony had collected on his brow and relieving him by every possible mark of an endearment which no sickness could impair nor any human misfortune in any degree abate presently however the cordial had such effect at least so far assisted the tender and restoring assiduities of a beloved wise that he began to breathe with less dissiculty and to seem more capable of enjoying his good fortune mr draper now improved this interval of ease by the charms of his conversation and by that characteristic sprightliness which rendered him so enchantingly agreeable i am now about to do a very rude thing said he my good friends and yet i cannot possibly help it indispensible business from which even the pleasures of society must not seduce me requires my attention i shall not be gone above half an hour my friend benignus will extremely well supply my absence and i will take care to call on mrs darlington and make excuses for you know what misdemeanors benignus before i return nay keep your seats  no polite confusion  no compliment pray now he bowed and withdrew  as sudberry was now much recovered at least as his pain very favorably intermitted his lovely wife happening to sit opposite a pierglass observing something in the reflection which brought an unusual quantity of blood into her face she threw her eye over her children transiently but said nothing i had however some little reason afterward to believe this blush arose from that delicate consciousness which sometimes we feel from a sense of wanting those things which the world considers as the necessary furniture of every person who is admitted into a good apartment namely such a suit of silks and broadcloth linens and laces as correspond with the chairs and tables cushions and carpets plate and china in the said apartment  now it happened as the reader cannot indeed forget that our little family had divested themselves of all superfluous decorations even to the picture of the principal which was wont to grace the arm of the wife but which now was in the possession of mr skain the tailor yet mrs sudberry was still as neat as a clean linengown could make her her infants were habited in slips or robes evidently made by a maternal hand and from the materials of a frugal housewifry that decorates the child with an alteration of that which is no longer suitable to the parent and sudberry was in possession of at least as tolerable a suit of gray as that suit of black which i wore myself and they looked as if fate had prevented my getting newer apparel till i had kept his modest gray in countenance this ingenuous anxiety however was soon over for sudberry got better and better the children played and prattled the sun shot cheerily into the room mrs sudberry smiled and began to think of conversation and draper speedily returned  chap lxxviii by this time preparations were making for a six oclock dinner but as nothing worth setting down in this history happened till the cloth was removed i shall ask the readers leave to set the glasses upon the table and pass briskly on to something more material the human imagination even in its most poetical moment can conceive nothing so highly calculated to give fresh spirit to burgundy as mr drapers various conversation he was the most consistent man in the world amidst the greatest inconsistncies that is he so nicely observed the grand articles of times sealons and circumstances that his character was constantly of a piece with the character of the society then present he was now in company with a married woman a man under singular embarrassments and three little children rising up under the eye of a modest mother and moreover the whole family were under recent obligations to him to support himself in this situation without violating his delicacy one would suppose no easy matter but in point of address he was ease itself he distributed his attention to the wife and husband with so impartial a care that neither could boast a compliment extraordinary or complain of a politeness wanting as the wine slowly circulated for it was not pushed round the table with an outrageous hospitality draper infused balm into the glass by chatting cheerfully upon the prospect of better days i have frequently thought madam said he turning to mrs sudberry that an unfortunate man is amongst the most sacred of human characters the hand of god is more immediately upon him he is marked out for trial and if when temptations have thickened upon him he still preserves his patience and his courage he is indeed an interesting character i do not think mr sudberry any otherwise unfortunate than as he is made so by his illness if i did his situation would be so sanctified in my idea that i should not look at him without awe dont you think him unfortunate answered mrs sudberry not at all replied draper he has enough to make him quite the contrary nay he this moment has in his eye sufficient to create content in the worst condition  mr draper had now gained his point for touching nicely upon the right string he found it in tune sudberry and his lady exchanged looks surveyed the pledges of their tender fidelity and indulged a sigh nor were those tender pledges shut out from their share of attention they were invited to sip some sweet wine by mr draper who desired them to drink according to seniority the voice of a child trained up with a sense of duty and civility is to the ear of a parent the music of the spheres mr and mrs sudberry gazed with a laudable pride on their babes as they paid proper preparatory respects and looked at mr draper as much as to say the little creatures are of our own bringing up  they have no master or mistress but ourselves when each had taken its allowance which mrs sudberry stinted to as small a quantum as might very well be contained in a thimble the eldest maintained her dignity by sitting still at the table and the two other paraded round the room and very critically examined the ornaments not failing to feel and finger every thing in their progress hilarity now presided at our board and as the burgundy exerted its generous power sudberry was so much recovered as to mix in our discourse at this crisis mr draper contrived to increase the general felicity by a welltimed trifling circumstance  and how many years may you two turtles have been married cried he smiling upon his guests eleven years sir answered sudberry and they have flown away as if they had enviously borrowed the wings of the wind eleven minutes they have been by my account rejoined the lady looking at sudberry  oh brave answered draper then i would lay my life every trifle is important and if this corkscrew was the gift of the one it would be dear to the other it would indeed said the husband aye aye replied mr draper trifles light as air are to the tender confirmations strong as proofs of holy writ    and as he was repeating this he drew from his waistcoat pocket a piece of paper which being opened unfolded to our view that very little portrait of precious memory which the reader will remember has already been distinguished in this history take it mrs sudberry said he presenting the bracelet  take the image of your husband which i have rescued from the arm of the ravisher for i do assure you it was in the possession of a lady you must know madam as i passed by the taylors door just now when i was obliged to leave you upon business i dropped in upon the rascal and was determined to tell him a piece of my mind it happened that he opened the door himself and i drew him into a room by his neckcloth which was by no means so pale as his face and so master skain said i to him we are to have the felicity of seeing you tucked up at last you have set up your carriage to a pleasant purpose and for the dignity of your profession i shall make all possible interest that you may be permitted to go by so gented an untaylorly a conveyance to the place of execution for gods sake what do you mean cried the tailor mean sir said i that you have defrauded a gentleman of his property taken in pawns without a license obtained security for your money  overcharged your account  this i added to make the sound more pompous most unwarrantably and not contented with goods have taken body into the bargain the picture mr skain the picture  the teeth of the disastrous tailor chattered most ridiculously and to cut short all trifling i thus went on first taking a certain written paper out of my pocket lookee skain thy hand which was lately laid so heavy on mr sudberry the insulted stranger whose cause i espoused is now turned against thyself this is your writing  this your name the sum is nineteen hundred and twenty pounds  the note is made payable to order  it is long past its date and now in the hands of a resolute and angry man pay it on this demand  or guess the consequence  i was so disgusted mr sudberry at the baseness of this shred of shalloon that i may now tell you the only business i had to leave your good company was to mortify disgrace and punish the scoundrel who had injured you  no bowing and lifting up of hands and eyes prythee it was more a selfish than social undertaking i promise you for if you have my ideas of happiness you will think the highrelished transport of bringing a villain to shame and probing him to the heart by presenting a rowland for his oliver is payment in full for all its delightful consequences even though they should render a whole city happy that this recrimination might be the more glorious and the more triumphant i posted away to my friend spangles  the gentleman you saw this morning benignus and telling him the circumstances but concealing the names i engaged him very easily in my scheme which i could indeed with the same facility have done had i proposed setting fire to the metropolis and beginning the blaze in the bedchamber of his wife  chap lxxix as mr draper pronounced the last sentence mr and mrs sudberry again exchanged glances which the keen eye of our young gentleman perceiving he thus continued his narrative lookee there now did i not tell you so before  did i not insist upon it mr sudberry was not an unfortunate man this very spangle has an immense estate yet is without six pennyworth of understanding  he has a child which he dont care a farthing for and does not suffer it to sit upon his knee lest it should soil his clothes and hates his wife with all his heart which is the happiest family benignus  before i had time to answer this question which mr draper submitted to me mrs sudberry left her seat pressed the picture to her bosom but threw her eyes full of tender fire at the original bestowed a kiss upon every child and then came again blushing beauty to her chair lord benignus resumed draper what poor solitary things we single fellows are but to finish the tailor  spangle i knew had long ago at my intercession lent mr skain the above sum to make up the purchase money of an estate for which the avaricious tailor was then in treaty and though i supposed the fellow could pay the note he gave spangle yet i imagined it would distress him to take him unprovided especially as he took spangle to be an easy man whom he could manage as he pleased spangle was instantly convinced of the infamy of skain though i could have made him as strongly convinced of his being a very honest man for as i observed before to you he is the weakest of all weak creatures while he thinks himself the wisest he gave the note to my care and disposal i left him to his lookingglasses and drove to our friend dodges in company with whom i went to take out a writ and order the bailiff to stand at the corner of a street within call that he might do his duty  mr dodge was on guard in this post of honor during my debate with mr skain who no sooner saw into my drift than he fell upon his knees in great agony and begged for the sake of his family that i would stay a few days till he could borrow the money on his estates earnestly vowing he had not a hundred and fifty guineas in the house and that an improper step would ruin his credit and blow up his character and knock up his trade and shut up his shop for ever the officer sir said i is at hand  an officer exclaimed he with inconceivable testimonies of horror while the hair clearly lifted up his cap which still covered it  an officer  here i am a miserable wretch who has kept house these seventeen years in which time i have arrested more than seventy men and yet never had a writ at my back before the only parchment i ever handled was my measure but you will not be so inhuman as to arrest me mr draper  you will not send a man of property to jail before he can turn round  you will not murder and mangle and massacre my soul and body at once for the sake of revenge which is the devil  i am sure you will not where is the picture i say fellow exclaimed   while i was making this demand the violent roarings and distracted vociferation of skain emptied the aerial apartments and brought in upon me eight ludicrous figures in their shirts in a word madam the journeymen tailors had all left their board which was fixed in the garret and came to see what could possibly occasion such pathetic and piercing exclamations each man in the confusion brought something characteristic in his hand one presented to view the half of a waistcoat another the shoulder and sleeve of a coat  some were armed with implements of offense this grasped a goose  this brandished a tremendous pair of sheers and that wielded a needle i drew my sword a corking pin would have answered the same end and kept them at bay  the tailor in chief was in an agony and when he renewed his ravings he brought down from some private part of the house a female of no very lovely though jolly appearance who sallying up to me with her arms akimbo desired to know what business i had to draw my sword upon her husband  as i knew mr skain always passed for a bachelor and as there was something wonderfully unlike a wife in this lady i was preparing a less gentle reply than she might expect when skain prevented me by rising in a great passion dispatched his trembling groupe to their work and demanded of the lady how in the first place she dared to betray him by leaving her chamber which she was articled to keep and in the second how she had the impudence to call herself his wife  sir said he  this is i find a day a cursed day in which i am every way to be ruined my poor character is to be torn to packthreads  i see it is  but fall when i will let me wipe off at least one damage in my cloth  let me draw up one rent in my reputation this woman is neither more nor less than  he was proceeding to open the domestic budget when the lady to my utter astonishment and without speaking another syllable lifted up a knuckle of herculean sinew and applying it to the left temple of the tailor brought him once more upon the ground now as i contemplated this mighty action which i apprehended would be the last in which our tailor would be engaged i contemplated likewise something else for from the arm which properly belonged to this stupendous knuckle slew in the heat of the battle with vast violence of rebound against my shoulder that identical picture which while she pursued her advantages and was actually proceeding  agreeable to the maxims of war  to plunder the dead  having already one hand in the pocket of the vanquished i caught up with dextrous eagerness and having taken sufficient revenge for the present walked contendedly off and left the lady to the pious office of finishing her work  mr dodge who still maintained his station i discharged telling him i had made up the affair without his assistance and as all this victorious business was done in little more than an hour  for you are to understand i pique myself upon dispatch  i think i have a right to shake mr sudberry by the hand which thus i do most cordially and kiss all the rest of his family  chap lxxx the manner in which mr draper related this story of innocent recrimination  the dignity of the action the miraculous recovery of the bracelet and the pleasant ideas he gave us of the tailor and his lady put the whole society into so happy a humor that few things could at that time have increased the general felicity  for my own part i was the principal figure of still life in the room for being so earnest a listener and observer and the elegant mr draper leaving nothing for me to say or do i sat silent and astonished a mere cipher of curiosity and surprise  the footman now entered presenting a card which requiring an answer mr draper begged permission to withdraw for five minutes to his writingtable and at the same time saying the card concerned me likewise took me out with him and then as he got to the door familiarly said you will get us a cup of coffee mrs sudberry you know i am a person of dispatch and i shall be with you and your good man again in the melting of a lump of sugar so pour away as fast as you will  by this time my adoration was so extreme for draper that it was almost grown on the other side idolatry and as i followed him along the passage that led from the dining room i could have kissed with real reverence the hem of his garment we stopped at the door of an apartment at the back part of the house where taking me by the hand and opening the door he introduced me into a room which was wainscoted with lookingglasses and to a lovely young lady who was entertaining herself at the harpsichord she was dressed in the most interesting dishabille that could possibly be conceived  her face was one of those which discompose the soul and flutters the pulse the moment it is beheld and her glossy hair came sporting down her right shoulder in the most voluptuous abundance she rose nimbly from her seat as we came in and began to chide while draper gave her without any prelude of ceremony a hearty kiss and with an air of negligent superiority led her to a chair and then carelessly drew another and placed it by her and how priscilla cried he tapping her on the check  how could thou be so impatient a simpleton as to send for me  let me see how was it here he took out the card and read  priscillas compliments to mr draper and if he is not more agreeably engaged will be happy to speak with him upon my word miss priscilla a very laconic wellworded card and now mr draper is come what would thou say to him for heavens sake benignus be seated my wife as the tailor says will excuse my introducing a friend even though i did not announce his coming by a card well but priss tell me at once what you want because i have but five minutes to spare pray who is that married lady mr draper cried priscilla in a sly tone you are so merry with lookee priss said draper gravely no taunts no sneers whoever i think proper to introduce into this house are while they are in it people of the first distinction in my eye remember i never suffer reflections nor enter into characters here nay answered the lady i only asked a civil question as mr thomas told me she seemed a very young woman to have such a parcel of children and  oh ho answered draper without the least emotion mr thomas told you did he that is quite a different matter pray benignus shall i trouble you to touch that bell is your instrument in tune priss perhaps you will oblige my friend with a song and suppose you indulge us with  a  oh thomas here thomas entered your year is up tomorrow i think  yes sir said thomas turning pale and priscilla paler still  well then you will put up your luggage with all convenient expedition and here  here  are your wages and a guinea extra for the favor of your moving off to night on my knees i entreat you my dear draper said the lady with the tears in her eyes to  to  as i have a soul to perish sir answered thomas i have done nothing to my knowledge which  prythee go away man i dont accuse you of any thing  but i am in the humor to change said mr draper that is all nay then said the lady and if you come to that so am i sir  are you replied draper with amazing coolness  you know i hold it sinful to baulk ones reasonable inclinations  so my dear pretty priscilla accept this foolish piece of paper he gave her a bankbill i know not of what value accept it as a token and if you should not again alter your mind suppose me now taking my last adieu mr draper again rang the bell and bowing with great civility as he went toward the door went out with as much placidity as he came in we met another servant at the head of the stairs take care kit said mr draper to him that i am no more disturbed and if pricilla wants the chair or any messages you will obey her commands having said this he gave me a gentle slap on the shoulder crying so much for that master brook and went smiling with the air of perfect peace into the diningroom  chap lxxxi of this last transaction i could make neither head nor tail so resolved for the present to plague myself no more about it especially as i found the company in the same agreeable disposition in which we left it but yet the situation of the parties were something varied for mr and mrs sudberry were both sitting upon the sopha sudberry was livelier than ever and his lady met us with so grateful a smile that to have come a moment sooner or later would have methought been a moment out of time strange however as it may seem mrs sudberry had forgot to order the coffee and when draper gently reproached her for being so bad a housewife one of those undescribable blushes painted her cheek and heightened the natural roses of her complexion which the poetical dr done has called eloquent  her pure and eloquent blood spoke in her cheeks and so distinctly wrought that one might almost say her body thought the teatable was however soon furnished at mr drapers summons and mrs sudberrys blush gradually disappeared till it settled only into the bloom which was always smiling on her cheek  mr sudberry who hitherto had said little on account of his disorder which speaking generally increased having as the teaequipage was removing some intention to take his leave began to return the proper testimonies of respect to his benefactor  sir said he bowing to mr draper you have probably saved me from that death in a prison which though i know it cannot long be any where prevented would in such a situation be doubly terrible you have at the same time rescued from distraction this tender creature and from a more sudden poverty these beautiful babes unless you could see my heart you will not be able to conceive its consciousness apologies for having been the means of making a man act like an angel is rather an insult than a compliment what you did i am sure you felt and that feeling while it blesses us rewards you happy indeed are they who are the objects of such benevolence happier only he who is master of the sensation which inspired it in gratitude   here he put his hand on his breast there is much joy  in liberality he looked respectfully at mr draper there is still more and we hold sir the second place of felicity as receivers of benefits that you may hold the first as the person who conferred them  he paused  my stars and garters cried mr draper what a pity it is sudberry you and i are strangers what a deal of sentiment might you save and i see you talk in some pain and upon my soul you give me as much pain to hear you talk if you did but know that i am so sincere a despiser of all formality that i never suffer a slip of buckram even in my coat i heard that you were insulted and for the want of a few scoundrel guineas unable to redress yourself now insult i am so far from bearing myself that i cannot endure it should be insticted on another if you had a purse in your pocket a sword at your side and a cane in your hand if sir providence had thought proper to accoutre you in this manner i should have left you to revenge your own cause and fight your own battles and had you hesitated to do this under such advantages i should have rejoiced to hear that the purse had been taken from you the sword run through your body and the cane laid across your shoulders because for man to fear man in my idea is the last error of idolatry and ten times a greater shame than bowing the knee to baal but i heard you were without arms i heard you were sick married had children and was no sharper because you was a stranger and because you were destitute i assisted you in that assistance i have gratified my darling passions i i have at the time served one gentleman in distress and oh good god of heaven sudberry what an idea  i have punished three scoundrels so prythee now dont pursue the cursed subject of acknowledgment i take it for granted your little affairs at home are in some disorder and therefore i will not prevent your putting them to rights your children too i see begin to rub their eyes and i can conceive bachelor as i am the wishes of you all without any parade therefore get into my coach or if you like it better a hackney coach and tell me in a word what will make matters thoroughly easy till this day fennight when i challenge every one of you to a haunch of venison lookee now what can one do your wife is in tears again  there  there  then  it can be no worse and so for gods sake put this into your pocket and call me when you have done crying  chap lxxxii mr draper was hurrying away when one of the children caught him by the hand and enchantingly cried you be good gentemin and must not leave my dear papa and mamma they only cry for your goodness and cry because they be full of glad not sorry oh my angel replied the mother so we do so we do your poor papa would have died if it had not been for the kindness of that gentlemen  would he answered the child than papa must now live to thank him that is all  i live to thank him too said the second me vil kneel down thus and pray god mighty love him for it lisped out the youngest throwing itself at the same time on the carpet and folding its hands murder and assassination exclaimed draper stamping and drawing his handkerchief over his face  there is no standing this you are resolved to kill me i think in my own house  come hither said i come hither thou beautiful little tyrant  i was going to relieve draper from the embraces of the child when sudberry himself rose and walking as well as his weakness would let him toward mr draper he said well sir we have tortured you sufficiently it is time to give you respite with your permission we will now send for a coach i see perfectly into your character and will not refuse the pleasures it brings me come mrs sudberry let us now wish mr draper good night and leave him with a promise to partake of his venison it is only from the scarcity of good men that makes us awkward when we receive their favors mr draper happens to perform the purposes for which he was born and finds in such performance the same pleasure you do in kissing your children it is in both  the inspiration of nature farewell then sir  indulge your constitation and i rejoice to find its tendencies so favorable to my present circumstances  now said draper you talk to the purpose and if you have now the wisdom to say no more all will be as it ought to be i have done answered sudberry then art thou in my estimation more eloquent than cicero on the subject replied draper  you are both thought i very clever fellows for ought i see to the contrary but what sort of a being i must appear to you i really cannot tell for here have i been witness to a train of actions enough to make a devil catch some spark of the divinity and yet from the first moment to the last i have not done one farthingsworth of good nor one farthings worth of harm this draper carries it all before him and leaves his friend no opportunity to do a tolerable thing with any degree of grace he is the independent substantive and i the scurvy adjective no matter  it may be my turn to stand in a better light tomorrow  at present i am only in shadow  i made these reflections while the coach was sent for and when it came draper handed the family into it with the same politeness he handed them out of the other kissed his hand to them as the driver was wheeling from the door and returned with me into his house  chap lxxxiii is priss at home said mr draper to a servant as he went in no sir answered the servant she ordered thomas to fetch a hackney coach directed susan to pack up her things and ordered the coachman to carry her into piccadilly very well replied draper not at all discomposed get the chariot to the door and bid crimpa come and tie up my hair then turning to me and now my dear benignus let us go and fight it out with the women for mrs darlington notwithstanding our message will give it us i promise you she is the very pink of punctilio you know oh here comes crimpa crimpa draw thy comb through my hair in a moment and while he is doing this excruciating piece of business suppose we amuse ourselves with examining my friend spangles pocket book crimpa is most conveniently stupid and will not comprehend a syllable about the matter here benignus here it is  open and communicate the precious contents  i hesitated to open the lock which draper perceiving took it out of my hands with a sort of contemptuous jerk and saying lock by your leave did the business in a moment and carelessly turning over the leaves thus prefaced his perusal of them  i have already told you benignus my notion of modern delicacy i think we are wrong both in the theory and practice i can be as serious and as merry as any man in europe but then my mirth is frequently excited by the  damn this crimpa how confoundedly he tortures my head  my mirth i was going to observe is often excited by the very object which occasions seriousness is another and this upon my honor not from affectation of singularity but from temper and the mere make of my mind i always follow every agreeable feeling and am directed by one uniform principle of gratification the malicious passions shake a man all to pieces set his pulses a fluttering and every way render him disagreeable to himself the gentle and pacific passions on the contrary diffuse such a fine soothing set of sensations over both soul and body that while one can any way indulge them at whatever expense they afford an elysium so infinitely pleasing that i would purchase them though i should buy gratification ever so extravagantly thus i am the most selfish fellow in the kingdom and curse me if i believe such characters have the least merit in any of their actions your sly hypocritical dogs sink all these kind of things upon you as pure efforts of benevolence but i who hate strutting it in the plume of another assure you it is constitution and downright love of pleasure nay sometimes it is the mere impromptu of the moment  we are sometimes in a disposition to be delighted with opening our purse and sometimes with drawing it avariciously together one object attacks us at the fortunate crisis and we give him every thing he wants another shall perhaps meet us at the corner of the next street equally indigent and yet so far from giving him that which he wants we reproach him for having the impudence to tender his petition prythee go along fellow and dont plague me  i have nothing for thee such our language to the one  yes poor creature  take my pittance let it alleviate the necessities which i perceive press heavily upon thee  thou art welcome to my superfluity and much very much good may it do thee such our sentiments to the other whence these distinctions  whence these partialities why they originate from nature we are miserable as misers or bountiful as angels just as we are in the humor for man is the most whimsical of all creatures now i will lay my life the poor sudberrys  this fellow is neat as imported and does not understand a word of english  are gone away under the fallacious idea of supposing me the most generous man in the world when all i have done would certainly have been avoided had their convenience alone been consulted in making them happy i made myself for but if i must have procured their felicity by the destruction of my own it is a thousand to one if some rascally cringing attachment or other to imperial self did not put in its paltry plea and prevent me from doing a good thing merely because it was a good one  now with respect to this pocketbook it is the property of a coxcomb who has not a dram of feeling in his whole frame one of my great constitutional pleasures is to expose and laugh at such a wretch i am a great man for distinctions if this pocketbook was yours or poor sudberrys it might possibly contain something rational and should therefore for me be sacred from violation but being spangles whom i know better than he knows himself and who never kept a secret since he had tongue enough to tell it  being his my dear benignus why here begins the first chapter of folly  so saying this unaccountable agreeable whimsical mixture of a man began to read the curious register of the month written by the polite pencil of thomas willimot spangle esquire  chap lxxxiv but before i insert or transcribe any passages from this choice collection i must warn the reader if peradventure he should happen to live in the country or never has met the like passages before which in that case is perfectly probable i must warn him not for that reason to shut the book in a passion or spleenishly tear out the leaf on a presumption that the sentiments are unfaithfully transcribed because i can assure him on the veracity of an historian under my very serious circumstances that what is set down in this chapter is an honest copy from the wonderful original  mr draper neglected the cards and letters on each side the pocketbook and took notice only of those pleasant articles which were marked by way of memorandum on the vellum or more properly speaking the asss leaves which lay in the middle of book each page contained the story of a day so that the whole book formed a complete history or connected chain of events  monday am to drive out fanny in my new phaeton at twelve in the morning to pick my teeth at modemaids in tavistockstreet at three  dine at the devil at six  ruin fairfame

sunday shift my patch nearer the left cheekbone eight hairs fell from my eyebrow on my paper as i was writing an invitation to mrs glaze mean to undo her surely twas a judgment orthodox a cursed preacher   here draper after a moments pause tossed the book into the middle of the room and exclaimed as he rose from under the hand of his valet  aye its all alike i see infamous rascal he has not ingenuity enough to support the character of which he is ambitious the narrative of his day is the narrative of his life  pray said i mr draper is all this constitution  did nature ever form such a reptile as spangle art and nature in conjunction answered draper settling his stock at the glass have made a million such and i am glad i have shown you the inside of the fellows brains that you may pity and despise them  curious were the particulars which flew from the pocketbook about the room locks of hair papers of paint letters scissars and toothpicks scattered in confusion crimpa took them up and mr draper put them loose in his pocket as he was going to the chariot solemnly declaring that he would first read them to spangles wife before spangle himself and then stand over the rascal while he directed them in a parcel to the poor devoted diana dickens which it seems was the name of the young lady whom he tormented at the chapel  for says he though i am no enemy to gallantry i am to brutality and such a fellow should never rise to a greater dignity of amor than an affair with a cinderwench  we mounted the carriage and draper sat biting his nails and angrily twisting the glass tassels as if he was the most rigid reformer of the age every now and then vehemently repeating d  nation  i love gallantry but despise brutality  to me the world already wore a new face and contained scenes and characters which a few weeks before i was utterly unconscious of nor let the reader in this place laugh at the ignorance of my youth for thousands are there at this minute in country who arrived to their threescore and tenth year are perfectly unacquainted that so much villainy exists in human nature as i have delineated in less than threescore pages nay such is still the honest simplicity of those at a distance from the metropolis that if at my return to my village i should tell them of an elegant looking lady dead drunk in the streets of a fop who lays the plan of a young womans destruction in a church of a tailor who keeps a mistress a chariot and a black footman with a silver shoulder knot of a parcel of fellows who lay watching for the body of a sick man with a wife and three children like so many many dogs at a door and of a person who is such a miscellany of vice and virtue defect and excellence as mr draper  if i say i were to tell these things  or if happily they are ever perused in print by people who have never mixed among the polished errors of a large city  will they not set me down as an illnatured discontented fellow who have drawn a very unfair as well as a very ugly picture of life such an accusation would redound so much to the honor of the accusers that i cannot find it in my heart to upbraid them to suppose it impossible for any of the species to be so destitute of humanity as i have been and shall still be obliged here and there to represent them is a supposition which argues some innocence in the supposer and whenever the reader thinks i indulge in the gloom of imagination i most heartily wish he may never have the mortification to experience that i have only displayed to his eye the real portrait of human manners  chap lxxxv fine truants indeed said alicia as soon as we entered the parlour well gentlemen cries mrs darlington you have stayed out methinks i have just brought benignus to the door ladies answered mr draper that you might not fear i had quite run away with him it has been a day of adventure and now though i love dearly to hear you make enquiries about the who and the what and the where and the when the wherefore and the why yet i am obliged instantly to deprive myself of this felicity by an engagement which must this instant be fulfilled so i must leave benignus to tell the story  you question and he answer and rob myself of one of the sweetest entertainments in the world you are such a rattle replied the young lady adieu alicia  mrs darlington your most obedient answered draper and was rolling off again in his chariot in a minute  i found the following billet had been sent to me in my absence from my agent  sir i have prepared papers relative to your moneys in the funds with accumulated interests thereupon ready for inspection together with all other matters of trust committed to me by your late guardian i was extremely sorry to hear of the decease of that gentleman and shall be extremely glad to wait upon you in chancerylane the first opportunity meantime am  sir your most humble servant archibald parsons   if happily any person of business should bestow half an hour per week to peruse these books it will not in their opinion redound much to my credit or inspire them with any respectable ideas of my understanding that i continued so long in town without making the least enquiry into my affairs not so much or rather so little as even to call or send more than a single card to the attorney to whose care were entrusted not only the papers of my family but through whose hands my guardian had been used to receive letters from time to time on the very interesting subjects of rise and fall sell out and buy in cent per cent with all that never ending et cetera of prudential and pecuniary policies which so delightfully agitate men of property to all such be it known that i heartily take shame to myself much of this care and circumspection depends on education the college and the counter so oppositely affect the imagination that a few years residence within the cloisters of the one or behind the drawers of the other give not only contrasted modes of thinking but make two people thus differently employed as utterly unlike as if one was born to the customs of france and the other to those of turkey and here i beg leave to add on this head the illustration of a little story taken faithfully from the excellent volume of life  thomas and john were brothers and bred up together to the age of six in the same house discovering till about that time pretty nearly the same dispositions but the father soon after designing one for the church and one for the counting house thomas was entered a member at one of the universities and john was situated with a trader in the city they were both industrious lads and made a very promising progress at the end of about seven years and not before such was their application they met on a visit to their father who resided in the country and in this visit they soon evinced the wonderful force of practice and habit on the human constitution the mason who is said to have carried a brick in his pocket as a signal of his trade was not a more certain testimony than those ensigns of office which our young gentlemen held out to every acquaintance their very gait and discourse was become professional thomas who had been used to saunter through the venerable walks of his college or slumber beneath a spreading oak with a book by his side had acquired from thence an indolent method of walking and yet was as starch solemn and perpendicular as if he had been long treading in the seemly steps o one of the faithful while john on the contrary in spite of a name which gives methinks the dullest idea of any christian appellation in our language had as dispatchful a pair of heels hands and eyes as if he had been serving his time amongst the expresses or was runner to a banker their dress was likewise ex officio thomas was generally habited in a suit of raven gray with stockings corresponding and buckles though silver of so modest and unpretending a pattern that they utterly discarded all the vagaries of the mode yet were they like every other part of him prig prim prue and parsonly much against its natural inclination his hair was tortured into one large semicircular curl besprent with a little powder rather in patches than regularly and formed a methodical arch from the top of one shoulder to the other his stock was girded stiff in its buckle and his coat though it had never been much tormented by the brush was by no means out of form for thomas indeed had so erect a back that it would not be easy for his apparel to set in wrinkles  now john who resided with an eminent merchant and had always been accustomed to visit the change precisely at one oclock prided himself not a little upon a deshabille in dress the rather he used to say as it distinguished him from the mere mechanical put who had a bobwig for the morning and a bag for the evening he therefore rejected a smug ness which he considered as below himself and critically marked the external difference betwixt the mere drudge of trade and the gentleman of business to accomplish this latter character he wore suitable raiment his coat or rather frock had a lining of silk was cut exactly to the mode and had a genteel proportion of powder springled between the shoulders just where the careless club of his hair loosely tied with a ribbon depended his waistcoat was frequently scarlet or crimson with a very broad binding of figured lace the more fashionable in his opinion when the nap was gone and it was about half worn out his breeches were always of black silk so much the better if the strap of his kneebuckle hung accidentally as it were a little loose of white silk were his stockings one of which was generally suffered to wrinkle about the knee or the instep his cravat half dirty also was of white sarsnet edged with a narrow lace and tied in a negligent bunch under his chin and to crown the whole his hat was laced with gold and worn elegantly oblique thomas paid his compliments of duty to his father with the most classical accuracy and deliberation articulating and marking by emphasis every word he hoped his esteemed parent enjoyed the beatitude of health amid the salutiferous gales of the country observed that the ancients and poets or vates which meant the same thing were all lord and eloquent in praise of rural life as could be evidenced by reference to their respective writings and then proceeded to quotation and lastly he said he expected to pass a very joyful month in the house and country where he was born as it would revive in his mind every idea of juvenility and make him as it were live over again those days which were devoted to the pastimes of puerility the garrulity of the suipling and the simplicity of early existence when as mr lock says he might be assimulated in other words compared or to stoop still lower in phrase likened to a sheet of white paper  this salutation differed wonderfully from the salutation of john who catching his father carelessly by the hand and bowing rapidly at the same time said he was glad to see him wear so well remarked that the storid cheek was a curiosity on the other side of st pauls but that business was better than a fine complexion and then archly squinting at thomas said that he perceived study was as sore a spoiler of the skin as lombard street he then saluted his sisters which thomas had neglected to do and sat happily down without ceremony their old acquaintance in the parish scarce knew either and what is still stranger they scarce knew each each other those who used to agree in every thing could now agree in nothing indeed they held scarce a single tenet maxine or sentiment in any sort similar and before they had been a fortnight together each began to entertain a thorough contempt for the others understanding  curse that thomas would john often say  what a queer piece of clasped calfskin it is for ever muzzing over a musty book and yet he drawls like a parish clerk bless me exclaimed frequently mr thomas what a prosane avaricious yet extravagant being is brother john fond of gaudy exterior ornament yet a mere sloven in mente a casket as i may say a plated casket without a jewel and for ever talking of his commodities and bales and centums ducks struck lame in metropolitan alleys and the lord knows what besides i much wish having about me as in duty bound all fraternal feelings he may turn out a stationary laudable conscientious character for indeed i cannot but suspect the lads capacity  the men of business saw in john all the shrewdness acuteness slyness cleverness and all other nesses that promised the man of wealth the men of letters discovered in thomas all the sobriety steadiness and learning which denoted an able divine the friends of john thought slightly of thomas while the friends of thomas thought slightly of john and they soon thought so very flightly of one another that at the end of the month which had been chiefly employed in debate each choosing to support his system they departed in high disdain thomas to the task of contemplation to cicero and cambridge and john wishing cambridge might be consumed to gainful mornings and gay evenings to the dexterity of trade and the traffic of lombardstreet  and yet each brother made a respectable character tom sigured in the pulpit and john was an alderman to this story written for the satisfaction of my mercantile readers may be added its moral viz that their friend benignus might be a very good kind of a man aye and even possessed no mean share of common sense that sense which i knew they weigh against all the genius and scholarship in the world although he slayed several weeks in london after the death of his guardian without paying a visit to the only person who could give him any intelligence as to the security and true state of the needful  chap lxxxvi i had never seen this mr parsons but once in my whole life and that was in my infancy when he took the advantage of a vacation to pass the recess which that allowed him till the next term at my guardians who from long intimacy had so implicit an opinion of his integrity that he committed to his charge those matters which respected the twelve thousand pounds at interest however in some measure to reconcile my unpardonable remissness i can assure my readers of trading complexions that i sat down as soon as i had related the heads of my days adventures to mrs darlington and her niece leaving out the mysterious scene with draper and priscilla to write an answer to and propose a meeting of business with mr parsons the very next day in the mean time i was not a little anxious to hear about my friend benjamin and his uncle for strange as it seems alicia had not yet mentioned either of them mr abrahams however soon after relieved my suspense by sending a note containing these truly characteristic words  abrahams sends compts to  benignus esquire  received his favor  is overwhelmed with gratitude for same  this is sent  per benjamin who as in duty bound by ditto favor will make acknowledgments  abrahams begs a line from  benignus esquire by item bearer  from my office seven oclock almost half past  square ann dom just as i was stepping out to make enquiries mr benjamin the item bearer presented this laconic card and continuing to mend of his bruizes had so spruced and tighted himself up that he really looked quite interesting and the delicate languor which pain and consinement had thrown over his features only served to render them more soft and pleasing as i knew this card was totally designed for private perusal i read it transiently and putting it into my pocket told benjamin i should take an opportunity to observe the contents and that it required no other answer i saw that the poor fellows eyes and heart were full and that he felt the irksomeness of a situation in the presence of his ladies which permitted no explanations the quicksighted alicia perceived his embarrassment and perhaps imputed it to a very different cause from the real one be that as it will she reddened and whitened several times and as the lad went sighing out of the room she affected to hem and cough violently and said she believed some filthy fly had got into her throat notwithstanding the obstruction of the fly however there was something in the confusion of benjamin at this short interview whence she derived such agreeable thoughts that she rose into greater gaiety than i had ever seen her indulge sprightly as she was and this was the evening in which she discovered more of her character and occasioned by that discovery a more grave incident than might be expected from a subject begun with so much good humor  now i have observed that it is customary with biographers to relate revolutions of all sorts with some little previous ceremony and as a very great domestic change of affairs depends on the circumstances now going to be related i shall even conform to the method of my predecesfors and communicate this important event in a separate chapter  chap lxxxvii it is an observation of the great plato or of some other famous philosopher that if a man of perfect benevolence and virtue should come upon earth he would be cheated imprisoned scourged and crucified and upon the whole more scurvily treated than if he was the slyest hypocrite that ever imposed upon poor simplicity now though i am very far from thinking i have any pretensions to the perfect benevolence of which this author speaks yet without vanity i may be allowed to possess sufficient to entitle me to as large a portion of abuse and illtreatment as if i had been one of the best men breathing in the beginning of this narrative the reader was told the design of visiting london since my arrival there hitherto it so happened that i rather observed the manners of men than made any formal researches after happiness the reader is as yet only presented with the principal adventures of a very few weeks and as i did not retire from society till the thirtyseventh year of my age am now relating the transactions which happened so early as in my sixteenth year and was engaged in the great scene of life all that tedious interval containing the enterprises of almost twenty years he may be alarmed into the dread of never getting to the end of my book let him not be alarmed it is not very probable that i shall live long enough to write myself out nor is it intended to trouble him with a recapitulation of all the misfortunes and indignities which brought me here for that would indeed be an endless labor the principal passages only will be related and whoever is in possession of them whoever is the first traveller after my decease will find the manuscript parted into so many divisions that if he be a skilful editor he will publish to the world only just as much at a time and just such a quantity upon the whole as he deems most interesting and most instructive for whoever reads any part thereof merely as a book of amusement will by no means promote the great moral end with which a man now languishing in a forest undertakes it thus much by way of introduction to the future parts of my history which henceforward will exhibit scenes and circumstances of a far darker color and more intricate imposition  mrs darlingtons niece was a great scribbler and though her passion for benjamin and her struggles to subdue that passion had made her of late take little delight in her customary amusements yet now that she conceived some flattering hopes from the confusion of that young fellow that she had kindled a flame in his breast without having betrayed the fire in her own for to some such circumstance as this i impute her present high spirits she began again to indulge her favorite pleasures of penwomanship and soon after the lad had left the room told me she was overhead and ears in debt and was now going to pay all off at once and then asked me if i did not love letterwriting i told her in reply that i loved reading and composition passionately but that i had as yet few correspondents and therefore few occasions to write letters oh gracious and gemini answered this voluble girl now that is to me altogether amazing  of all things in the world i love writing next to that i love talking and next to that riding round the parks oh my stars and garters and blue ribbons what a rapture there is in sending and receiving long letters when you go into the country benignus you shall positively send to me every post you shall indeed here she took out her pocketbook let me see penciling the letter b  b b b where are you b  turning over the leaves oh here it is monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday saturday and so forth reading very fast debtor creditor et cetera where benignus shall i find a place for you i am afraid there is no vacancy  stay stay monday  she now began again monday  miss flarriet miss scribble mrs muzzlethought and mr moral post comes in at three tuesday sir billy scrawlblot lady lovequill lady sarah duntaxit and olivia splitsense post at seven in the evening wednesday mr rigmeroll dr marphrase parson prolix curate quick and miss merrythought thursday friday saturday answers to ditto  seventeen letters in arrears no no room i see at present cousin my hands you see are quite full not a single moment unoccupied and yet not a packet dispatched since you came to town  as soon as she thought proper to stop i expressed my concern that she could not sind a corner for me to which she briskly answered nay benignus dont be uneasy for if you will pardon my sometimes sending away the post without a letter for you and will accept of a scrawl just as i can steal time from my old engagements  i say in that case i will joyfully enroll you in the catalogue what think you of this may i set you down upon these familiar terms by all means i accept them very thankfully said i there then cries she writing i have set you down as a nowandthen friend  lookee here you are benignus the occasionalist but goodbye for half an hour continued she looking at her watch the post is come in and i must go and see what it has brought me for i expect to be well huffed by every creature that writes to me my aunt knows i never was half so idle in my life well your servant i shall be down with you at supper adieu aunt farewell occasionalist  this conversation was run off as rapidly as the tongue could possibly roll it on the ear and at the end of it she tripped out of the room and slew as expeditiously up stairs as if she really had the whole business of the nation to settle by eleven oclock that night  chap lxxxviii heaven be praised said mrs darlington smiling that my little chattering magpie of a niece is gone did you ever hear any body when she is once set in for it talk so much in your life benignus she is very agreeable madam said i oh she is a noisy thing cries mrs darlington but now she has taken to one of her writing sits again the house will be a little still for we shall seldom see her now but at meals she is perfectly rivetted to the desk when once she begins how much do you think that little slut squanders yearly cousin in paper pens and sealingwax besides the postage of letters why madam answered i as my cousin is a very great writer and so ample a circle of correspondents i should suppose she may exhaust in this innocent way five or six shillings a week speak louder child said the old lady twirling up her ear i had forgot her deafness and to make amends for that forgetfulness repeated what i had before said as loud as i reason ably could but even this effort did not answer for mrs darlington said you need not shout neither cousin i am not absolutely deaf to the noise of a cannon  the medium my dear betwixt a bawl and a whisper is the point five or six shillings five or six and twenty benignus i stared truth says she or i am not a woman as i had no reason to dispute this matter i gave her credit for her one pound five the certainty of her sex and observed that the sum to be sure was not very trifling but that there was no accounting for propensities now it was the great misfortune of this lady to hear so very little of what was said in conversation that she often made sad work with ones expressions and sometimes by catching up one word and losing another the meaning of the whole sentiment would frequently appear so impertinent and offensive that there was no bearing it unnoticed whenever this happened the good woman supposing the person speaking taking an unfair advantage of her infirmity would lose all sort of patience and without any regard to persons fall into the most violent paroxysms of fury and was never known perfectly to forgive the person whom she imagined so to have insulted her i had no sooner got to the unlucky word propensity of which she only heard the middle syllable pence upon which i happened to lodge the emphasis than imagining i disputed her veracity the color of confusion and anger bespread her face and she began in the following manner pence sir pence as plain as i could speak i told you shillings what do you mean by pence methinks it is too early for you sir who are just come into my house to invade the laws of hospitality insult my misfortune and dispute my veracity but infirmity is always the butt of boys  always laughed at and always contradicted yet i heard you sir be assured yes and i can repeat every thing you said too you said i must not take account of a few pence i would have you to know sir i am not a mercenary woman i love my niece as well as ever parent loved a daughter nor did i wish to abridge her amusements i spoke only for the sake of conversation in a harmless chitchat way but i shall learn to hold my tongue when i am before some persons i shall take care what i say for the future depend upon it sir i shall pence indeed fie upon it fie upon it what in the very first month to behave rudely to me i could not have imagined it cousin i could not have imagined it  when mrs darlington had brought her speech to a conclusion she drew herself up into a heap waved herself up and down in her chair in the true seesaw of distress flung her apron over her face began to stamp with an angry vehemence and seemed to mourn heavily that a relation could be so cruel to turn pounds into pence and play upon her misfortune because he supposed she was deaf which she violently declared she was not i did and said every thing i could to exculpate myself from the charge of either playing upon her misfortune or disputing her veracity protesting that she misunderstood me and that i hoped she would ever find me above the incivilities and cruelties she was hastily led to attribute to me my apologies were vain she insisted upon it that what she did hear was a flat contradiction of what she had asserted and that she did not doubt what she did not hear was downright abuse seeing her in this temper i thought it best to leave her to herself and accordingly rose to go into another room till the storm was blown over but this prudent design made her ten times worse than ever and in her idea so aggravated the offense that she got up with great disdain and tossing herself out of the room said there was no occasion for my withdrawing in the midst of her misery to convince her that her company was disagreeable for as i thought proper to be her guest she knew the laws of politeness as well as some folks those of good manners and should rather turn herself out of the house than her visitor  being left alone i gave way to the pique which her last words had occasioned and thinking myself ill used caught up my hat and without taking leave of a single creature or speaking a word to any one opened the great door myself and sallied into the square  and is there not then said i walking along the pavement is there not one consistent character am i never to meet with a single being regular in its conduct and established in its principles are all mankind thus variable shall i never find a person tomorrow like what i found him to day of all women at first sight mrs darlington appeared the best natured and the best bred mr draper seemed the most foppish and effeminate of men the female who saluted me in the coach the most affable of girls mr skain the most obsequious of tailors mr abrahams the most accomplished of stewards alicia the happiest of nieces and spangle the most courageous of coxcombs and yet every one of them have changed their characters and at a second view are the very reverse what they appeared at first fronti nulla fides sure enough as abrahams says why i shall begin to believe by and by there is not a consistent character  not a semper eadem upon earth and not be very wide of the truth neither answers a voice from behind which on turning round i observed came from a gentleman walking pretty near me this induced me to quit reflections for the present and to enquire of this person which was the way to doverstreet intending to trespass for a night or two till i could otherwise accommodate myself upon my friend draper the gentleman answered with great curtesy but with extreme quickness of speech that we were at no great distance from doverstreet and that although it was the contrary road from that he was pursuing yet that he would very readily step back with me through the squares and set me right i thanked him for his offer and turning back for i had gone utterly out of the way we walked sociably and nimbly together you have apartments in doverstreet i presume sir questioned the gentleman i have a friend resides there sir replied i with whom i am going to pass the night but being very lately come to london and but a poor recollector of streets i am not yet sufficient master of the many intricate turnings of the town nor i neither i will assure you sir resumed the gentleman who have been fourteen years a housekeeper in it the labyrinths of london i can tell you are not easily found out and a man may pass his whole life here and mix in all its bustle yet in many respects be a stranger still just as he said this a sudden shower began to pelt us pretty smartly ods bobs cries the gentleman i dont know how you may like this sort of amusement but i had much rather be soaking the inside than the outside and if you should not happen to be in haste i know of a little snug place hard by where we might take a friendly sneaker together and pursue our walk as soon as the shower is over there was something about the stranger i liked and agreeing cheerfully to his proposal and observing that my time was my own he rubbed his hands pleasurably together and slapping his hat ran briskly through the rain till he came to the middle of the street and entered what is known by the name of an eatinghouse  chap lxxxix the gentleman desiring a private room the waiter showed us into a little box up one pair of stairs and with innumerable bends of the body stood attending our commands it is too soon to eat whispered my guide to me but these houses always expect us to call for something and therefore suppose we order a vealcutlet a pork steak or a muttonchop or any little thing upon earth please yourself sir replied i nothing comes amiss to me well then bring us waiter a dish of cutlets a couple of small basins of bouillie and a sallad perhaps though sir you love tarts yes i know you youngsters have a sweet tooth harkee waiter add a few tarts and jellies and let us have it immediately on the table in two minutes gemmin cried the waiter and skipped out of the room like a flash of lightning when he was gone if you would choose any little changes or additions say so cries the caterer ods so laying his singer on the belly i forgot this is the most celebrated house in england for sausages  they dress them sir to a nicety aye aye i know they will be quite a treat up flies the waiter  the gentleman my friend continues my obliging provider has a fancy to taste mrs broylers sausages  she is celebrated for them you know so you will  very sorry gemmin interrupts the waiter cannot oblige you but mr maunge had the last pound of sausages for his supper  have some of the finest cold venison pasty which was ordered for a company which did not come that ever was tasted venison pasty exclaims the gentleman again rubbing his hands with a most vehement friction  better and better still we are in luck young gentleman hey up with the pasty timothy this moment  in the toss of a pancake replied the waiter and clattered down stairs to provide it ods fish rejoins the gentleman what heads we have nothing to drink now what is your liquor sir  we must have a decent quantum of liquor because that is what is chiefly depended upon eat a mouthful and drink ten that is the landlords maxim and what i am going to tell you will sound odd but i assure you this little nut shell of a place affords as good madeira as ever was laid to lip and for porter  fronti nulla fides as you very justly observe this unpromising hut furnishes the best of every thing and who would think it hey suppose then sir answered i we have a bottle of that madeira and a pot of that porter  with a toast and a sprinkle of the nutmeg in the latter hey asks the gentleman you are a very sensible lad and know what is what i can see that upon this he ran to the door and ordered the liquors to be brought immediately this was presently done and the supper which the gentleman relished surprizingly observing that as the hostess was his friend she would think he was displeased if he sent the things down without tasting was soon over for my friend was as brisk at cating as walking and talking indeed every thing he did or said was abrupt and precipitate he was characterised by a keen eye small features smart turn of the countenance and a little round undersized person dressed in a plain suit of light blue neither absolutely good nor absolutely good for nothing a pert sort of flippancy marked his face and were i not afraid of hazarding improper language i should say there was loquacity in his looks he had all the lively sense of mr draper but without any of his elegance yet his sentiments were so agreeably selfsufficient that prattle seldom trespassed so little upon patience after he had poured in almost all the porter and three fourths of the madeira for i declined more than a glass of each he became all jig and jollity was as fanciful in his attitudes and movements as a frenchman sung catches with astonishing humor and rung the changes of convivial sentiment so facetiously sometimes playing a tune with his knuckles upon the table and sometimes showing off mathematical tricks with the glasses that i could have listened and laughed with him till the morning  chap xc the watchman calling eleven oclock as he passed by our window made me look as if i thought it time to be going which the gentleman perceiving threw up the fash and damning the watchman for a talkative scoundrel bade him not disturb the neighborhood but keep his knowledge to himself nay sir says i it is not in the power of such a telltale to make me put on my gloves while i am in such company i feel no inclination to move i assure you so far from it that i am almost ready to apply to you the compliment which eve paid to her husband with thee conversing i forget all time all seasons and their change   say you so sir answers the gentleman then ring for another bottle for to tell you the truth i like your company full as well as you love mine and must draw one more cork to our better acquaintance the cork was soon drawn and a bumper drank on both sides while our hands were as cordially shaken as if we had been rocked in the same cradle and were now reviving the intimacies of youth to me cries my companion all seasons are equal i can with equal facility sleep in the day and rise in the night or vice versa i never had the headache in my life nor ever took a dose of physic since i became liable to distemper once or twice a year indeed i buy a few bottles full of stuff from my apothecary because he is a worthy man and i wish to be in his books  but as for swallowing any of it  pardon me in that particular no sir i toss them for the most part into the thames and at the end of about three doses thus demolished my apothecary supposing them to have been taken the next time he meets me can see they have done their duty and with a very solemn phiz assures me i look fifty pound better since i began to take his medicines while i charmed with the cheat perfectly agree with him and to carry on the jest hint to him a suspicion that i verily believe he has saved my life if you would live upon any terms with your friends sir and they have any thing queer about them agreeably deceive them and they are yours for ever but is that quite so honest sir said i pho answers the stranger it is that pious fraud so universally recommended by the learned one illtimed truth will ruin a friendship of twenty years growth but a million of pleasant deceptions will only make a man love you a million times the better i have tried all ways and i tell you there is but this one upon earth that will do so drink about  as my friend seemed to be so thoroughly skilled in the arts of life i was willing to gain something from his experience and briefly recounting to him the heads of my history and concluded by asking his opinion of my conduct and pursuit with regard to your conduct says he frankly i think it is the conduct of a very young fellow and with regard to your pursuit i think it is the pursuit of every man breathing but i confess you are hunting for it in a new way ha ha ha droll enough upon my soul well my boy  be  benignus that i think is your name and a very proper name too  here is to your success with all my heart here is wishing you may find what you are in search of off went a fresh bumper and as it was upon a particular occasion away flew the glass over his head i did not quite so well relish his laugh though i made an awkward effort to join in it and then with a glibness and volubility beyond draper himself he continued the conversation  chap xci and so my dear benignus thou art seriously and bona fide running up and down the world after happiness hic labor hoc opus est oh puerility oh inexperience prythee give up the expensive pursuit of traveling after such matters and learn all that it was ever in the power of human nature to teach you with respect to a knowledge of mankind in two words know thyself for in that knowledge is included and exhausted every variety and every novelty under the sun men waste the flower of youth in turning over books going from place to place hearing what other people say and gaping at what other people do measuring earth and seas wasting their fortunes perplexing their heads and blinding their eyes and then sitting themselves impudently down in an elbow chair exclaim with all the pomp of ignorance that they have seen and that they know the world dear bought and farfetched in good truth one might accommodate ones self sir with six times the intelligence without stepping over ones own threshold turn the eye in wards inwards  your health my good friend close argument is of a dry nature  turn i say the eye inwards instead of outward instead of looking into the world look into your own heart and there you will find the universe epitomized  how sir said i is it possible i can acquire as much experience from  prythee dont put me out answered the gentleman i have read and stared opened my eyes and opened my mouth and asked advice and taken my own way as much as any man for above a dozen years was i as the poet says an idle gazer on the light of heaven and i might perhaps have been an idle gazer still if i had not found out that it was all vexation of spirit one book told me one thing which i saw absolutely contradicted in another and the friends whom today i consulted were of quite a different opinion the next morning so at last sir i even gave up the hope of wisdom in mere despair sold off all my books avoided the company of my friends and in despite of authors and all their works took the liberty like a freeborn englishman to think for myself are books then useless in your opinion sir said i a little eagerly i have not said rejoined the stranger that they are but a page of ones own heart is more worth my dear boy than a folio of dull printed elaborate compositions  of such things as are now daily vomited from the overcharged press volumes generally expatiate upon facts that the genius of old flaccus would have compressed and that without crouding the sense in a single leaf now as to making the grand tour in search of happiness i never heard of a more sleeveless errand why i tell you again aye and i will maintain it all which is done or said in the whole world is written on the tablet of a single heart every thing human has been at one time or other transacted within ourselves indeed said i sir  yes resumed he and i will prove it as soon as i have drank this glass of madeira at one moment we act the tyrant at another the slave now we are inclined to profusion then without rhyme or reason shift to parsimony you talk of sudden alterations and think that mrs darlington and that mr draper you mentioned singular characters why what do you mean by singularity i know of no such thing it is a mere expletive a sound without sense i alexander green like the rest of my fellow harlequins your name is green sir said i is it pshaw answered my friend peevishly was there ever such a damned question  when a man is digging into the very bowels of fact  for i spurn philosophy to interrupt him in the utmost pith with a base interrogatory about his name  what does it signify whether you call a man green red white or yellow  sir let me finish my remarks and i will be all colors in the rainbow at your service i begged my angry friend to proceed which after tossing off another brimmer and shaking me by the hand in token of perfect forgiveness he did  chap xcii i my dear benignus  bytheby what a cursed classical name you have got  oh fie answered i do you who have just been upbraiding me for taking notice of names  do you  ha ha ha that is the very thing rejoined green why i was just going to tell you that man was the most laughable contradiction of all gods animals i am as you are a compound of every thing exempli gratia i have played the proteus fifty times a day i have risen from my bed in a morning with so pitiful and rascally a sentiment that i grudged myself the muffin at my breakfast and charged my servant on peril of losing her place not to butter it on both sides the tea has scarce had time to strengthen in the pot when this dirty idea has been turned out of my head by some sprightlier fit which as it brightened the prospect rendered me more sociable and then i have been in a humor to bless every body about me perhaps in the next hour i meet in my walk some cross adventure or pick up in my way some cursed reflection and so its all over with me again thus out of sorts i hurry home to enjoy the great prerogative of a housekeeper to wit the pleasure of revenging myself upon my family in this case my servants not only know my knock but the state of the temper when that knock is given unhappy his fate who opens the door woe to the cat dog wife or child which stands in my way while i am under this malignant influence presently sir fatigue gives me up to drowsiness  i sleep it off and sometimes to the great joy of my domestics awake in the best disposition imaginable by and by a tender sensation seizes me i weep as i relieve the woe of the wretched sympathy melts me into tears and immediately afterward the tickling of a feather convulses me with laughter and thus in the short compass of twentyfour hours i experience twentyfour changes in my constitution examine yourself young gentleman and then as sure as this bottle is almost at the bottom you will find the case your own were you never at one time prompted to the most petulant animosities yet at another so peacefully humoured or else so lazily disposed that you would put up with the severest injury rather than be at the trouble or pain of resenting it now indolence now passion now one whimsy now another first freak then spleen now one thing then another in fine and to bring my discourse and my liquor which you see runs clear as amber to the last drop at once to a conclusion the prevailing maggot of the minute carries all before it and now sir what think you of taking a farewell glass and pledging an innocent draught of something in the spirituous way to our next meeting a sup of nantz is a very fine thing to settle the stomach for the night i feel myself a little sickish and so prythee my dear boy press your thumb upon the bell  the discourse arguments method and gestures of this mr green were so infinitely out of the common road that i could not for some time make him any other answer to his last request than by the silent assent of doing with dumb surprise as he bid me in obedience to the summons though with much less agility than before the waiter came winking into the room with his waistcoat unbuttoned and his napkin tied round his head brisk cried mr green bring up a noggin of nantz and before you venture to attack the stairs my good lad prythee rub thy eyes a little for the sake of thy nose for at present thou art really walking in thy sleep this observation green accompanied with so awakening a slap on the shoulder of mr brisk that it provoked the poor fellow to inform us it was past three oclock that all the company were gone out of the house that he had a most violent tooth ach and had been obliged to bind up his jaws and to lull it by a little nap aye  aye poor fellow cries green then bring up two noggins of nantz and apply one to thy own tooth my little brish brisk held his hand to his cheek nodded thanks and descended into the cellar  chap xciii with a very large portion of remark shrewdness novelty and sheer humor there was a mixture of meaness vulgarity and low life about mr green that unapt as i was to develope characters at that time i did not set him down as a man of fashion as all excellence is comparative and as we can only compare one known object with another i measured this gentleman with mr draper who in spite of his queernesses was still my standard aster the most impartial survey green shrunk exceedingly he wanted not only the prepossessing advantages of mr drapers person but his ease his address his unaffectedness and his deportment yet was green the archest drollest dryest fellow in the universe and soon after he had tossed off the nantz took affectionately hold of my hand and spoke as follows  you are a very young fellow i see benignus i met you or rather overtook you in the street and accosted you as you was thinking aloud i offered to show you the way you had lost i invited you to go with me to a public house you did so and for any thing you could tell to the contrary i might have carried you to a brothel stripped you naked and either turned you adrift or cut your throat we are both strangers what might have been the consequence of your credulity nay dont turn pale you are fallen into good hands the only inconvenience you will ever experience from meeting with me is the necessity you will be under to pay the bill for to tell you the truth i am a little out at elbows partly indeed from shaking them too often fortune has lately played me a few of her tricks and i have a few debts of honor on my hands which make it convenient for me to be as little fond of distinction as possible yet i venture forth in the dusk and as it is not yet daylight i shall get home in safety so god bless you my dear boy and when you think of alexander green let it put you in mind of the old maxim  beware of your company  farewell i will send up brisk to take the bill  so far from being offended with the venial trick mr green had put upon me i was truly touched with his situation and when i consisidered how much more fatally he might have taken advantage of my simplicity i thought there was a great share of honesty about him of this i was presently more convinced for upon putting five guineas into his hands as he was going away he laid down three of them upon the table and told me that though he was a gamester he was not a sharper often as those characters were united  luck he said was just now sorely against him and had driven him not for the first time though says he to the want of a meal you have given me sir three meals in one i will keep two guineas because i happen to have a wife and two or three young kids at home and till i turn up trumps again it is like to be a losing game with them two guineas therefore will as she knows how to play her cards as well as any body keep the honors in her hand with regard to butcher and baker and so forth  but i will touch no more not that i pretend to any niceties but as i have drawn you to the verge of the precipice and made you pay decently for showing you the danger i will be damned before i shove you headlong to the bottom and so spoil one of the best things i ever did since i was created and so good night to you  saying this he tied a hankerchief loosely round his neck and again shaking me by the hand ran down stairs leaving me to pass the remainder of the morning where and how i thought proper  chap xciv and yet such was the entertainment mr green had given me that i by no means repented the accident which brought us together even though it prevented me from getting a bed for after i had paid the bill and complimented mr brisk the waiter he informed me i could not have a lodging there if i would give the world for it at the same time telling me that a chambercounsel occupied the first floor bedchamber that his mistress lay in the two pair of stairs that a country curate had taken one of the garrets till saturday the other was engaged by the quarter to four hackney writers who pigged together in the night and scribbled together all at a desk in the day and that the eatingroom and kitchen were full with the cook himself and other servants adding that he did not think there was space besides sufficient for a cat to tuck herself round till the morning but sir says he there is a house not a vast way off where you may rest which is open at all hours on purpose for straggling gentlemen or i can perhaps get your honor a chair which will carry you to your lodgings thinking it either too late or too early to go to drapers i consented to the proposal of the sedan which being called mr brisk ordered the chairman to embox me and convey me with great care to the hummums  this hummums had something to me in the sound i did not like and the terrible image which mr alexander green had drawn before me of strippers and cutthroats so deterred me that i tapped at the window and directed the fellows at all events to convey me to doverstreet and set down at the corner house on the right hand when i arrived there draper so far from being in bed as i expected was sitting alone in his dining room with a book in his hand and the moment he saw me sprang up with his usual vivacity and said he expected me three hours ago as mrs darlington had sent to his house an account of the quarrel some polite concessions and a tender invitation to return there my dear benignus is the ladys card civil enough and as much as you can expect from an old woman but hang it  dont go there to live any more it is not the place for a young fellow here is a monstrous large house  you are a kind of lad that i love and if you dont dislike me there is a bed up stairs which you will accept of i was pleased to receive so obliging a card from my cousin as i by no means wished to break with her and her message took a heavy load from my heart for when passion cools any alienation or estrangement from our friends is a most shocking sensation by the bye says draper who do you think brought the card your old friend benjamin and the poor boy was crying in my house ready to burst himself and begging me upon his knees to press your return to cavendishsquare  i felt and understood the tears of honest benjamin but did not think proper to explain them and now cries draper what the deuce has become of you since you left darlingtons in such a huff you flew off in a tangent of delicacy  your dearly beloved delicacy i find i related to him my adventure at the eatinghouse and there were tears in his eyes when i finished  poor green said he  many a worse character than he might have trepanned you into a more splendid apartment and had less mercy on your simplicity well benignus go to bed and sleep lie down a child and rise a man not ill pleased with having escaped the hummums and found all matters so well at darlingtons i retired to repose and did not long wait the embraces of sleep while draper as i had afterward reason to believe retired to the embraces of a very different nature for priscilla had thought proper to return and draper had sufficient attachment to receive her again in his train  by eight oclock in the morning poor benjamin came of his own accord to mr drapers and upon hearing i was there became so transported with joy that he could not be restrained from running into my chamber and even opening my curtains to satisfy his grateful heart i bring you sir said he the kindest love from both my mistresses and uncle and all the servants from one end to the other hoping you will be so kind as to come home benjamin answered i step down stairs my lad and i will be with you presently as soon as i was dressed i wrote a very civil card to my cousins promising myself frequently the pleasure of waiting on them and acquainting them with the resolution draper and i as two young bachelors had taken to reside together etc then going to benjamin whom i found brushing my hat in the face of the only servant of drapers that was out of bed and he standing idle with a duster in his hand here ben said i carry this with my compliments to your ladies and pray dont forget me to your uncle  when you are at leisure too mr ben i will get you to bring my portmanteau in a hackneycoach as i shall spend a little time at mr drapers and so then sir replies benjamin with a melancholy voice we are not to have you i find i was at some pains to quiet this excellent young fellow as to my continuance in doverstreet but at last effected it by assuring him he would see me at mrs darlingtons agreeable to the promise in my letter almost every day this comforted him exceedingly and just as he was setting off by some means or other the lower buttonhole of my coat caught in a little hook at the bottom of the bannisters in turning to go up stairs and tore a piece completely away now said i my poor old suit of black it is all over with thee constant companions we have been a long time but thy hour is come at last and and we must part i am sure replies benjamin if the coat could speak sir it would be sorry to leave so good a master but your honor has talked about a new suit a long while and if you are not provided with a tailor i can recommend you to a neat workman and one of the tiptop sort prythee send him then said i benjamin for i am so strange a fellow as to let a thing tumble from my back before i go about repairing it and though i am this day to dine with my agent have i nothing fit to put on however send your friend and perhaps he may mend this till he can make another he shall be with you directly sir replies benjamin  he is akin to nancy dennis though between ourselves rather shy of speaking to her because he is above the world as the saying is how is nancy benjamin returned i i wish your friendship for one another may not soften into a tender passion benjamin before you are aware what think you i  i  i will send the tailor to you immediately sir says benjamin blushing and stammering as he gently shut to the door having an hour or two upon my hands and not finding myself in the least drowsy although i had so little rest i sat myself down to mr drapers desk and wrote one letter to mr greaves one to my attorney near my village and one to poor mr blewitt to whom i had already sent a message of the nature of which the reader will be in due time acquainted as he will should i have life to introduce them with a great many other matters of importance for probably there are many persons he meets with in this history with whom
