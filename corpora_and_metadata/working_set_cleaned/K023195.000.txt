the temple of fame  price one shilling  the temple of fame l  cheron inv  saml gribelin junr sculp    the temple of fame a vision  by mr pope  the second edition  london printed for bernard lintott between the two templegates in fleetstreet       advertisement the hint of the following piece was taken from chaucers house of fame the design is in a manner entirely altered the descriptions and most of the particular thoughts my own yet i could not suffer it to be printed without this acknowledgment or think a concealment of this nature the less unfair for being common the reader who would compare this with chaucer may begin with his third book of fame there being nothing in the two first books that answers to their title  the temple of fame in that soft season when descending showers call forth the greens and wake the rising flowers when opening buds salute the welcome day and earth relenting feels the genial ray as balmy sleep had charmed my cares to rest and love it self was banished from my breast what time the morn mysterious visions brings while purer slumber spread their golden wings a train of phantoms in wild order rose and joined this intellectual scene compose i stood methought betwixt earth seas and skies the whole creation open to my eyes in air selfbalancd hung the globe below where mountains rise and circling oceans flow here naked rocks and empty wastes were seen there towry cities and the forests green here sailing ships delight the wandering eyes there trees and intermingld temples rise now a clear sun the shining scene displays the transient landscape now in clouds decays over the wide prospect as i gazed around sudden i heard a wild promiscuous sound like broken thunders that at distance roar or billows murmuring on the hollow shore then gazing up a glorious pile beheld whose towering summit ambient clouds concealed high on a rock of ice the structure lay steep its ascent and slippery was the way the wondrous rock like parian marble shone and seemed to distant sight of solid stone inscriptions here of various names i viewed the greater part by hostile time subdued yet wide was spread their fame in ages past and poets once had promised they should last some fresh engraved appeared of wits renowned i looked again nor could their trace be found critics i saw that others names deface and fix their own with labor in their place their own like others soon their place resigned or disappeared and left the first behind nor was the work impaired by storms alone but felt the approaches of too warm a sun for fame impatient of extremes decays not more by envy than excess of praise yet part no injuries of heaven could feel like crystal faithful to the graving steel the rocks high summit in the temples shade nor heat could melt nor beating storm invade there names inscribed unnumberd ages past from times first birth with time it self shall last these ever new nor subject to decays spread and grow brighter with the length of days so zemblas rocks the beauteous work of frost rise white in air and glitter over the coast pale suns unfelt at distance roll away and on the impassive ice the lightnings play eternal snows the growing mass supply till the bright mountains prop the incumbent sky as atlas fixed each hoary pile appears the gathered winter of a thousand years on this foundation fames high temple stands stupendous pile not reared by mortal hands whatever proud rome or artful greece beheld or elder babylon its frame excelled four faces had the dome and every face of various structure but of equal grace four brazen gates on columns lifted high salute the different quarters of the sky here fabled chiefs in darker ages born or worthies old whom arms or arts adorn who cities raised or tamed a monstrous race the fourfold walls in breathing statues grace heroes in animated marble frown and legislators seem to think in stone westward a sumptuous frontispiece appeared on dorick pillars of white marble reared crowned with an architrave of antique mold and sculpture rising on the roughend gold in shaggy spoils here theseus was beheld and perseus dreadful with minervas shield there great alcides stooping with his toil rests on his club and holds the hesperian spoil here orpheus sings trees moving to the sound start from their roots and form a shade around amphion there the loud creating lyre strikes and beholds a sudden thebes aspire cythaerons echoes answered to his call and half the mountain rolled into a wall there might you see the lengthening spires ascend the domes swell up the widening arches bend the growing towers like exhalations rise and the huge columns heave into the skies the eastern front was glorious to behold with diamond flaming and barbarick gold there ninus shone who spread the assyrian fame and the great founder of the persian name there in long robes the royal magi stand grave zoroaster waves the circling wand the sage chaldaeans robbed in white appeared and brachmans deep in desert woods revered these stopped the moon and called the unbodyd shades to midnight banquets in the glimmering glades made visionary fabrics round them rise and airy specter skim before their eyes of talismans and sigils knew the power and careful watched the planetary hour superior and alone confucius stood who taught that useful science to be good but on the south a long majestic race of aegypts priests the gilded niches grace who measured earth described the starry spheres and traced the long records of lunar years high on his car sesostris struck my view whom sceptered slaves in golden harness drew his hands a bow and pointed javelin hold his giant limbs are armed in scales of gold between the statues obelisks were placed and the learned walls with hieroglyphics graced of gothic structure was the northern side oerwrought with ornaments of barbarous pride there huge colosses rose with trophies crowned and runick characters were engraved around there sat zamolxis with erected eyes and odin here in mimick trances dies there on rude iron columns smeared with blood the horrid forms of scythian heroes stood druids and bards their once loud harps unstrung and youths that died to be by poets sung these and a thousand more of doubtful fame to whom old fables gave a lasting name in ranks adorned the temples outward face the wall in luster and effect like glass which over each object casting various dies enlarges some and others multiplies nor void of emblem was the mystic wall for thus romantic fame increases all the temple shakes the sounding gates unfold wide vaults appear and roofs of fretted gold raised on a thousand pillars wreathed around with lawrelfoliage and with eagles crowned of bright transparent beryl were the walls the freezes gold and gold the capitals as heaven with stars the roof with jewels glows and ever living lamps depend in rows full in the passage of each spacious gate the sage historians in white garments wait engraved over their seats the form of time was found his scythe reversed and both his pinions bound within stood heroes who through loud alarms in bloody fields pursued renown in arms high on a throne with trophies charged i viewed the youth that all things but himself subdued his feet on sceptres and tiaras trod and his horned head expressed the libyan god there caesar graced with both minervas shone caesar the worlds great master and his own unmoved superior still in every state and scarce detested in his countrys fate but chief were those who not for empire fought but with their toils their peoples safety bought high over the rest epaminondas stood timoleon glorious in his brothers blood and scipio savior of the roman state great in his triumphs in retirement great here too the wise and good their honors claim muchsuffring heroes of less noisy fame fair virtues silent train supreme of these here ever shines the godlike socrates here triumphs he whom athens did expel in all things just but when he signed the shell here his abode the martyred phocion claims with agis not the last of spartan names unconquered cato shows the wound he tore and brutus his ill genius meets no more but in the center of the hallowed quire six pompous columns over the rest aspire around the shrine it self of fame they stand hold the chief honors and the fane command high on the first the mighty homer shone eternal adamant composed his throne father of verse in holy fillets dressed his silver beard waved gently over his breast though blind a boldness in his looks appears in years he seemed but not impaired by years the wars of troy were round the pillar seen here fierce tydides wounds the cyprian queen here hector glorious from patroclus fall here dragged in triumph round the trojan wall motion and life did every part inspire bold was the work and proved the masters fire a strong expression most he seemed taffect and here and there disclosed a brave neglect a golden column next in rank appeared on which a shrine of purest gold was reared finished the whole and labored every part with patient touches of unwearied art the mantuan there in sober triumph sat composed his posture and his look sedate on homer still he fixed a reverend eye great without pride in modest majesty in living sculpture on the sides were spread the latian wars and haughty turnus dead eliza stretched upon the funeral pyre aeneas bending with his aged sire troy flamed in burnished gold and over the throne arms and the man in golden ciphers shone four swans sustain a carr of silver bright with heads advanced and pinions stretched for flight here like some furious prophet pindar rode and seemed to labor with the inspiring god across the harp a careless hand he flings and boldly sinks into the sounding strings the figured games of greece the column grace neptune and jove survey the rapid race the youths hang over their chariots as they run the fiery steeds seem starting from the stone the champions in distorted postures threat and all appeared irregularly great here happy horace tuned the ausonian lyre to sweeter sounds and tempered pindars fire pleased with alcaeus manly rage tinfuse the softer spirit of the sapphick muse the polished pillar different sculptures grace a work outlasting monumental brass here smiling loves and bacchanals appear the julian star and great augustus here the doves that round the infant poet spread myrtles and bays hung hovering over his head here in a shrine that cast a dazzling light sat fixed in thought the mighty stagyrite his sacred head a radiant zodiac crowned and various animals his sides surround his piercing eyes erect appear to view superior worlds and look all nature through with equal rays immortal tully shone the roman rostra decked the consuls throne gathering his flowing robe he seemed to stand in act to speak and graceful stretched his hand behind romes genius waits with civick crowns and the great father of his country owns these massy columns in a circle rise over which a pompous dome invades the skies scarce to the top i stretched my aching sight so large it spread and swelled to such a height full in the midst proud fames imperial seat with jewels blazed magnificently great the vivid emralds there revive the eye the flaming rubies show their sanguine dye bright azure rays from lively saphirs stream and lucid amber casts a golden gleam with variouscolourd lights the pavement shone and all on fire appeared the glowing throne the domes high arch reflects the mingled blaze and forms a rainbow of alternate rays when on the goddess first i cast my sight scarce seemed her stature of a cubits height but swelled to larger size the more i gazed till to the roof her towering front she raised with her the temple every moment grew and ampler vistas opened to my view upward the columns shoot the roofs ascend and arches widen and long isles extend such was her form as ancient bards have told wings raise her arms and wings her feet infold a thousand busy tongues the goddess bears and thousand open eyes and thousand listening ears beneath in order ranged the tuneful nine her virgin handmaids still attend the shrine with eyes on fame for ever fixed they sing for fame they raise the voice and tune the string with times first birth began the heavenly lays and last eternal through the length of days around these wonders as i cast a look the trumpet sounded and the temple shook and all the nations summoned at the call from different quarters fill the crowded hall of various tongues the mingled sounds were heard in various garbs promiscuous throngs appeared thick as the bees that with the spring renew their flowery toils and sip the fragrant dew when the winged colonies first tempt the sky over dusky fields and shaded waters fly or settling seize the sweets the blossoms yield and a low murmur runs along the field millions of suppliant crowds the shrine attend and all degrees before the goddess bend the poor the rich the valiant and the sage and boasting youth and narrative old age their pleas were different their request the same for good and bad alike are fond of fame some she disgraced and some with honors crowned unlike successes equal merits found thus her blind sister fickle fortune reigns and undiscerning scatters crowns and chains first at the shrine the learned world appear and to the goddess thus prefer their prayer long have we sought tinstruct and please mankind with studies pale with midnight vigils blind but thanked by few rewarded yet by none we here appeal to thy superior throne on wit and learning the just prize bestow for fame is all we must expect below the goddess heard and bade the muses raise the golden trumpet of eternal praise from pole to pole the winds diffuse the sound that fills the circuit of the world around not all at once as thunder breaks the cloud the notes at first were rather sweet than loud by just degrees they every moment rise fill the wide earth and gain upon the skies at every breath were balmy odours shed which still grew sweeter as they wider spread less fragrant scents the unfolding rose exhales or spices breathing in arabian gales next these the good and just an awful train thus on their knees addressed the sacred fane since living virtue is with envy cursed and the best men are treated like the worst do thou just goddess call our merits forth and give each deed the exact intrinsic worth not with bare justice shall your act be crowned said fame but high above desert renowned let fuller notes the applauding world amaze and the loud clarion labor in your praise this band dismissed behold another crowd preferred the same request and lowly bowed the constant tenor of whose well spent days no less deserved a just return of praise but strait the direful trump of slander sounds through the big dome the doubling thunder bounds loud as the burst of cannon rends the skies the dire report through every region flies in every ear incessant rumors rung and gathering scandals grew on every tongue from the black trumpets rusty concave broke sulphurous flames and clouds of rolling smoke the poisonous vapor blots the purple skies and withers all before it as it flies a troop came next who crowns and armor wore and proud defiance in their looks they bore for thee they cried amidst alarms and strife we sailed in tempests down the stream of life for thee whole nations filled with flames and blood and swam to empire through the purple flood those ills we dared thy inspiration own and all that virtue seemed was done for thee alone ambitious fools the queen replied and frowned be all your acts in dark oblivion crowned there sleep forgot with mighty tyrants gone your statues moulderd and your names unknown a sudden cloud strait snatched them from my sight and each majestic phantom sunk in night then came the smallest tribe i yet had seen plain was their dress and modest was their mein great idol of mankind we neither claim the praise of merit nor aspire to fame but safe in deserts from the applause of men would die unheard of as we lived unseen it is all we beg thee to conceal from sight those acts of goodness which themselves requite o let us still the secret joy partake to follow virtue even for virtues sake and live there men who slight immortal fame who then with incense shall adore our name but mortals know it is still our greatest pride to blaze those virtues which the good would hide rise muses rise add all your tuneful breath these must not sleep in darkness and in death she said in air the trembling music floats and up the winds triumphant swell the notes so soft though high so loud and yet so clear even listening angels leaned from heaven to hear to farthest shores the ambrosial spirit flies sweet to the world and grateful to the skies next these a youthful train their vows expressed with feathers crowned with gay embroidry dressed hither they cried direct your eyes and see the men of pleasure dress and gallantry ours is the place at banquets balls and plays sprightly our nights polite are all our days courts we frequent where it is our pleasing care to pay due visits and address the fair in fact it is true no nymph we could persuade but still in fancy vanquished every maid of unknown dutchesses lewd tales we tell yet would the world believe us all were well the joy let others have and we the name and what we want in pleasure grant in fame the queen assents the trumpet rends the skies and at each blast a ladys honor dies pleased with the strange success vast numbers pressed around the shrine and made the same request what you she cried unlearned in arts to please slaves to your selves and even fatigued with ease who lose a length of undeserving days would you usurp the lovers dearbought praise to just contempt ye vain pretenders fall the peoples fable and the scorn of all strait the black clarion sends a horrid sound loud laughs burst out and bitter scoffs fly round whispers were heard with taunts reviling loud and scornful hisses ran through all the crowd last those who boast of mighty mischiefs done enslave their country or usurp a throne or who their glorys dire foundation laid on sovereigns ruined or on friends betrayed calm thinking villains whom no faith can fix of crooked counsels and dark politics of these a gloomy tribe surround the throne and beg to make the immortal treasons known the trumpet roars long flaky flames expire with sparks that seemed to set the world on fire at the dread sound pale mortals stood aghast and startled nature trembled with the blast this having heard and seen some power unknown strait changed the scene and snatched me from the throne before my view appeared a structure fair its site uncertain if in earth or air with rapid motion turned the mansion round with ceaseless noise the ringing walls resound not less in number were the spacious doors than leaves on trees or sands upon the shores which still unfolded stand by night by day pervious to winds and open every way as flames by nature to the skies ascend as weighty bodies to the center tend as to the sea returning rivers roll and the touched needle trembles to the pole hither as to their proper place arise all various sounds from earth and seas and skies or spoke aloud or whispered in the ear nor ever silence rest or peace is here as on the smooth expanse of crystal lakes the sinking stone at first a circle makes the trembling surface by the motion stirred spreads in a second circle then a third wide and more wide the floating rings advance fill all the watery plain and to the margin dance thus every voice and sound when first they break on neighboring air a soft impression make another ambient circle then they move that in its turn impels the next above through undulating air the sounds are sent and spread over all the fluid element there various news i heard of love and strife of peace and war health sickness death and life of loss and gain of famine and of store of storms at sea and travels on the shore of prodigies and portents seen in air of fires and plagues and stars with blazing hair of turns of fortune changes in the state the falls of favorites projects of the great of old mismanagements taxations new  all neither wholly false nor wholly true above below without within around confused unnumberd multitudes are found who pass repass advance and glide away hosts raised by fear and phantoms of a day astrologers that future fates foreshew projectors quacks and lawyers not a few and priests and partyzealots numerous bands with homeborn lies or tales from foreign lands each talked aloud or in some secret place and wild impatience stard in every face the flying rumors gathered as they rolled scarce any tale was sooner heard than told and all who told it added something new and all who heard it made enlargements too in every ear it spread on every tongue it grew thus flying east and west and north and south news traveled with increase from mouth to mouth so from a spark that kindled first by chance with gathering force the quickening flames advance till to the clouds their curling heads aspire and towers and temples sink in floods of fire when thus ripe lies are to perfection sprung full grown and fit to grace a mortal tongue through thousand vents impatient forth they flow and rush in millions on the world below fame sits aloft and points them out their course their date determines and prescribes their force some to remain and some to perish soon or wane and wax alternate like the moon around a thousand winged wonders fly born by the trumpets blast and scattered through the sky there at one passage often you might survey a lie and truth contending for the way and long twas doubtful both so closely pent which first should issue through the narrow vent at last agreed together out they fly inseparable now the truth and lie the strict companions are for ever joined and this or that unmixed no mortal ever shall find while thus i stood intent to see and hear one came methought and whispered in my ear what could thus high thy rash ambition raise art thou fond youth a candidate for praise it is true said i not void of hopes i came for who so fond as youthful bards of fame but few alas the casual blessing boast so hard to gain so easy to be lost how vain that second life in others breath the estate which wits inherit after death ease health and life for this we must resign unsure the tenure but how vast the fine the great mans curse without the gains endure be envied wretched and be flattered poor all luckless wits our enemies professed and all successful jealous friends at best nor fame i slight nor for her favors call she comes unlooked for if she comes at all but if the purchase costs so dear a price as soothing folly or exalting vice oh if the muse must flatter lawless sway and follow still where fortune leads the way or if no basis bear my rising name but the fallen ruins of anothers fame then teach me heaven to scorn the guilty bays drive from my breast that wretched lust of praise unblemished let me live or die unknown oh grant an honest fame or grant me none notes some modern critics from a pretended refinement of taste have declared themselves unable to relish allegorical poems it is not easy to penetrate into the meaning of this criticism for if fable be allowed one of the chief beauties or as aristotle calls it the very soul of poetry it is hard to comprehend how that fable should be the less valuable for having a moral the ancients constantly made use of allegories my lord bacon has composed an express treatise in proof of this entitled the wisdom of the ancients where the reader may see several particular fictions exemplified and explained with great clearness judgment and learning the incidents indeed by which the allegory is conveyed must be varied according to the different genius or manners of different times and they should never be spun too long or too much clogged with trivial circumstances or little particularities we find an uncommon charm in truth when it is conveyed by this sideway to our understanding and it is observable that even in the most ignorant ages this way of writing has found reception almost all the poems in the old provencal had this turn and from these it was that petrarch took the idea of his poetry we have his trionfi in this kind and boccace pursued in the same track soon after chaucer introduced it here whose romaunt of the rose court of love flower and the leaf house of fame and some others of his writings are masterpieces of this sort in epick poetry it is true too nice and exact a pursuit of the allegory is justly esteemed a fault and chaucer had the discernment to avoid it in his knights tale which was an attempt toward an epick poem ariosto with less judgment gave entirely into it in his orlando which though carried to an excess had yet so much reputation in italy that tasso who reduced heroic poetry to the juster standard of the ancients was forced to prefix to his work a scrupulous explanation of the allegory of it to which the fable itself could scarce have directed his readers our countryman spencer followed whose poem is almost entirely allegorical and imitates the manner of ariosto rather than that of tasso upon the whole one may observe this sort of writing however discontinud of late was in all times so far from being rejected by the best poets that some of them have rather erred by insisting in it too closely and carrying it too far and that to infer from thence that the allegory it self is vicious is a presumptuous contradiction to the judgment and practice of the greatest geniuss both ancient and modern  page ii ver   so zemblas rocks etc  though a short verisimilitude be not required in the descriptions of this visionary and allegorical kind of poetry which admits of every wild object that fancy may present in a dream and where it is sufficient if the moral meaning atone for the improbability yet men are naturally so desirous of truth that a reader is generally pleased in such a case with some excuse or allusion that seems to reconcile the description to probability and nature the simile here is of that sort and renders it not wholly unlikely that a rock of ice should remain for ever by mentioning something like it in the northern regions agreeing with the accounts of our modern travelers  p    ver   four faces had the dome etc  the temple is described to be square the four fronts with open gates facing the different quarters of the world as an intimation that all nations of the earth may alike be

page    ver   egypts priests etc  the learning of the old egyptian priests consisted for the most part in geometry and astronomy they also preserved the history of their nation their greatest hero upon record is sesostris whose actions and conquests may be seen at large in diodorus etc he is said to have caused the kings he vanquished to draw him in his chariot the posture of his statue in

inspirations from whence he dictated his laws he is said to have been the inventor of the runic characters  page    ver   druids and bards etc  these were the priests and poets of those people so celebrated for their savage virtue those heroic barbarians accounted it a dishonor to die in their beds and rushed on to certain death in the prospect of an afterlife and for the glory of a song from

on which they are raised are adorned with sculptures taken from the most striking subjects of their works which are so executed as that the sculpture bears a resemblance in its manner and character to the manner and character of their writings  page    ver    four swans sustain etc  pindar being seated in a chariot alludes to the chariotraces he celebrated in the grecian games the swans are the emblems of the ode as their soaring posture intimates the sublimity and activity of his genius neptune presided over the isthmian and jupiter over the olympian games  page    ver    pleased with
