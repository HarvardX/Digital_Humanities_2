and not to find her   tulippa oh sir your new fangled passions impatient   amaranthus the paper gone sure it has reached the beauteous hand i wish   tulippa perhaps not   amaranthus having conveyed this faint but honest picture of my heart    tulippa and a pretty one it is truly   amaranthus i shall henceforth be able to address her with more confidence   tulippa confidence enough no doubt  i must indulge my swelling spleen and show myself  so thoughtful swain   amaranthus ha my tulippa here   tulippa your tulippa   amaranthus yes my tulippa that is to be  i hope   tulippa flattering hope like flattering swains carries much deceit with it   amaranthus what agitates my lovely fair why swim her eyes with tears why flies the bloom from off those cheeks where dimpled beauty always fits   tulippa because my heart so much detests falsehood that even my features must speak truth   amaranthus you speak in riddles and cloud me with astonishment   tulippa haste from these honest plains to cities haste where doublefacd hypocrisy is found in every class where virtue and constancy are laughed out of countenance and love is nothing but a name   amaranthus these plains indeed i will fly if my tulippa proves unkind but why should i be exiled from that rural simplicity and all my soul admires   tulippa false swain think on the bitter fruit i plucked from yonder bough and repeat that question if you can   amaranthus fruit if the produce of my poor brain deserves that name i hope though it cannot boast the richness of genius it may claim the flavor of sincerity   tulippa sincerity  verna    amaranthus what of her  verna  i know she is esteemed fair but    tulippa i know thee false without a but  so traitor farewell forever  song forever farewell love hears its own knell your falsehood has tolled it aloud yet why should i grieve at what may relieve to be free from a traitor i am proud exit   amaranthus falsehood traitor verna what a game of confusion what cross purposes  that falsehood which i suppose has waverd her own heart she would artfully charge upon mine  song that women will change i have been told but never experienced before what glitters is not always gold i have loved but i will do so no more tulippa has met with some swain of carriage more pleasing than me to lose her must furnish some pain yet perhaps it is as well i am free    enter hyema a fine young fellow i protest  and wonderfully good they say  how active and firm he treads  such a husband would be charmingly comfortable to a person of my years and circumstances  but i suppose he is for some flirting young minx  who knows all youth are not fools and properly talked to he may comply  i will try however for as they say a faint heart never won a fair lady so a bashful face can never gain a brisk husband  fair smile the spring upon you master amaranthus   amaranthus good morrow mother   hyema mother nay young swain though daylight and i have been long acquainted not long enough for that neither but you are a handsome sensible young man and should have all imaginable liberty  i protest i speak as i think  i need not tell you that autumn is a much richer and kindlier season than spring   amaranthus it may be so   hyema may be it so i have passed the flirting and am just entering into the sober sensible time of life  do you never think of matrimony master amaranthus   amaranthus truly i have thought of it till i began to fear entering upon so dangerous a connection   hyema very true it is a dangerous state indeed but not with a prudent partner  lackaday you seem mighty uneasy  a good wife would certainly comfort you  methinks you and i would make a very happy couple   amaranthus how match with you   hyema me why not shepherd  you will be safe from any dishonor to your family my virtue will guard against that  then i will be as loving and constant as a turtle dove   amaranthus ay stick like a blister no doubt   hyema then i will be as merry as a jay and make life one entire holiday  difference of a few years is an idle a very idle distinction   amaranthus how this beldam increases my perplexity   song hyema you might marry a girl in the bloom of her youth not more frolic and frisky than i and then for my person i think it forsooth not unworthy a young shepherds eye allow me the hearing to tell a plain truth though not quite so young i have got a colts tooth those who boast of the roses which bloom in each cheek and skin often likend to snow in virtue and housewifery often are to seek a terrible matter you know then object not to years you may trust me insooth no female ever dies without a colts tooth     amaranthus sure nothing can be more painful especially in my state of mind than a forward fulsome amorous old woman   hyema well young swain and what say you good offers dont come often when they do to refuse them is standing in ones own light  sir gregory greybeard examiner and licencer of marriages for this district sits

other reason to think so   ninny oh yes for my eyes have glistend ever fince i saw you like dry whitings in a dark night and when you turned the corner just now my heart began to dance a hornpipe

ninny may i hope   enter amaranthus  aside tulippa did you ever make love to any body before   amaranthus what this wretch her gallant   ninny oh yes to one  but lackaday she is no more to be compared

with many near relations among people of fashion   amaranthus i hope when this charming match takes place you will now and then lend that gingling cap to your lady it will add much to her charms   tulippa wonderfully smart   ninny she is handsome enough without  but now you talk of that master amaranthus if every fool was to wear such a cap would not it cause rare trade for bellmakers  i cannot help laughing to think how many great folks who seldom say more than aye or no would then make a very considerable noise  how many pulpits would then ring almost as loud as the church steeple and how many physicians would toll the knell of those patients they had killed   enter hyema hyema so so i have overtaken you at last its almost sir gregorys sitting time and i would not miss the day for any
