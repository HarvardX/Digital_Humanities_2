a general history of quadrupeds  the figures engraved on wood by t bewick    newcastle upon tyne printed by and for s hodgson r beilby and t bewick newcastle sold by them by g g j and j robinson and c dilly london    0  advertisement in disposing the order of the following work we have not thought it necessary to confine ourselves strictly within the rules prescribed by systematic writers on this part of natural history as it was not so much the object of our plan to lay down a methodical arrangement of the various tribes of fourfooted animals as to give a clear and concise account of the nature habits and disposition of each accompanied with more accurate representations than have hitherto appeared in any work of this kind our disregard of system however has not prevented us from attending to the great divisions of quadrupeds so obviously marked out by the hand of nature and so clearly distinguished that the most careless observer cannot avoid being forcibly struck with an agreement of parts in the outward appearance of the different individuals of which each consists  the intermediate stations however have not been always so clearly defined these are frequently occupied by characters so dubious that naturalists have not always agreed in ascribing to each its proper place of this kind are the elephant the hippopotamus the rhinoceros the cameleopard the badger the beaver the hedgehog the sloth the jerboa etc which bear in themselves characteristics so peculiar that they might seem to constitute distinct genera and so conspicuous that they cannot easily be overlooked nor forgotten in the general group  we have endeavored to lay before our readers a particular account of the animals with which our own country is abundantly stored especially of those which so materially contribute to the strength the wealth and the happiness of this kingdom of these the horse the cow and the sheep claim the first place and in treating of these we have noticed the improvements which an enlarged system of agriculture supported by a noble spirit of generous emulation has introduced into all parts of the country  it may perhaps be thought necessary to offer some apology for the evident want of proportion observable in the sizes of the different animals a defect to which every work of this kind must in some measure be liable in adverting to this we found that at whatever point between the elep and the mouse the scale were  a great and unavoidable deficiency would be the consequence we were therefore obliged to relinquish a plan which so far from being

    a general history of quadrupeds the horse the various excellencies of this noble animal the grandeur of his stature the elegance and proportion of his parts the beautiful smoothness of his skin the variety and gracefulness of his motions and above all his usefulness entitle him to a precedence in the history of the brute creation  there are few parts of the known world where the horse is not produced but if we would see him in the enjoyment of his native freedom unsubdued by the restraints man has imposed upon him we must look for him in the wild and extensive plains of africa and arabia where he ranges without control in a state of entire independency in those immense tracts the wild horses may be seen feeding together in droves of four or five hundred one of them always acting as sentinel to give notice of approaching danger this he does by a kind of snorting noise upon which they all fly off with astonishing rapidity the wild horses of arabia are esteemed the most beautiful in the world they are of a brown color their mane and tail of black tufted hair very short they are smaller than the tame ones are very active and of great swiftness the most usual method of taking them is with traps concealed in the sand by which they are entangled and caught  it is probable there were once wild horses in europe which have long since been brought under subjection those found in america were originally of the spanish breed sent thither upon its first discovery which have since become wild and spread themselves over various parts of that vast continent they are generally small not exceeding fourteen hands high with thick heads and clumsy joints their ears and necks are longer than those of the english horses they are easily tamed and if by accident they are set at liberty they seldom become wild again but know their master and may be easily caught by him  the horse in his domestic state is generous docile spirited and yet obedient adapted to the various purposes of pleasure and convenience he is equally serviceable in the draught the field or the race  there is scarcely an arabian how poor soever in other respects but is possessed of his horse which he considers as an invaluable treasure having no other house but a tent to dwell in the arabian and his horse live upon the most equal terms his wife and family his mare and her foal are often seen lying indiscriminately together whilst the little children frequently climb without fear upon the body of the inoffensive animal which permits them to play with and caress it without injury the arabs never beat their horses they speak to and seem to hold friendly intercourse with them they never whip them and seldom but in cases of necessity make use of the spur their agility in leaping is very great and if the rider happen to fall they are so traceable as to stand still in the midst of the most rapid career the arabian horses are of a middle size in general less than those of this country easy and graceful in their motions and rather inclined to leanness  it is worthy of remark that there instead of crossing the breed the arabs take every precaution to keep it pure and unmixed they preserve with the greatest care and for an amazing length of time the races of their horses  those of the first kind are called nobles being of a pure and ancient race purer than milk they have likewise two other kinds which have been degraded by common alliances and sell at inferior prices  from arabia the race of horses has probably extended into barbary and other parts of africa those being considered as next to the arabian horses in swiftness and beauty though they are still smaller the spanish genette is also held in great estimation like the former they are small but beautiful and extremely swift the horses of india and many parts of china are extremely small and vicious one of these was some years ago brought into this country as a present to the queen which was very little larger than some mastiffs measuring only nine hands in height  in great britain the breed of horses seems to be as mixed as that of its inhabitants by great attention to the improvement of this noble animal by a judicious mixture of several kinds and by superior skill in management the english racehorse the following account of the prizes won by some of our capital racehorses wi show the importance of that breed in england where such vast sums frequently depend on the issue of their contests  bay malton by sampson the property of the late marquis of rockingham in seven prizes won the amazing sum of   00l at york he run four miles in seven minutes and fortythree and an half second which was seven and an half seconds less time than was ever  before over the same course  ca a famous horse bred by george bows esquire of gibside won the first kings plate run for at newcastle upon tyne besides which he won five kings plates and near 000l in sundry prizes  ca wel known by the name of lying childers the property of the duke of dvonshire was allowed by sportsmen to be the  horse that ever was bred in the world he started at newmarket several times against the best horses of his time and was never beaten he won in different prizes to the amount of nearly  000l and was afterward reserved as a stallion  the fire of childers was an arabian sent by a gentleman as a present to his brother in england  dorimant a famous horse belonging to lord ossory won prizes to the amazing amount of      l  little driver by the famous childers won    0l in  0l plates and beat at different times fortyfour running horses which had collectively won two hundred and three prizes  eclipse was allowed to be the fleetest horse that ever ran in england since the time of childers after winning kings plates and other prizes to a great amount he now covers by subscription forty mares at thirty guineas each besides those of his owner  gimcrack won prizes to the amount of above  000l he likewise ran a match in france of twentytwo miles and an half within the hour for a considerable sum  highflyer was accounted the best horse of his time in england the sums he won and received amounted to near  000l though he never started after five years old he was never beat nor ever paid a forfeit  matchem a horse belonging to the late w fenwick esquire besides being a capital racer was particularly remarkable as a stallion and may be truly said to have earned more money than any other horse in the world he was engaged for the latter nine years of his life to cover twentyfive mares at fifty guineas a mare and was uncommonly successful in the celebrity of his progeny having been fire to many of our most famous running horses he was remarkable for being the quietest stallion that ever was known to which perhaps may be attributed his great age being in the thirtythird year of his age when he died  pyrrhus won upwards of    00l  shark won besides a cup value   0gs and eleven hogsheads of claret the amazing sum of    0 gs in plates matches and forfeits  the most extraordinary instance of letness in a trotting pace we remember to have seen recorded was performed on the  th of july      for a wager of thirty guineas by a horse the property of a gentleman of billitersquare london he trotted thirty miles in an hour and twenty minutes though he was allowed by the terms of the bet an hour and an half      is allowed to excel those of the rest of europe or perhaps the whole world for supporting a continuance of violent exertion or what is called in the language of the turf bottom they are superior to the arabian the barb or the persian and for swiftness they will yield the palm to none an ordinary racer is known to go at the rate of a mile in less than two minutes but there have been instances of much greater rapidity the famous horse childers has been known to move eightytwo feet and an half in a second or nearly a mile in a minute he has run round the course at newmarket which is little less than four miles in six minutes and forty seconds  the hunter is a happy combination of the racehorse with others of superior strength but inferior in swiftness and may be considered as the most useful breed of horses in europe geldings of this kind are sent over to the continent where their superior worth is universally acknowledged in great numbers and sold at very high prices to foreigners of the first distinction the mixture of this with others of inferior rank forms an endless variety the different gradations becoming too minute to be discriminated  the blackhorse no other country has produced a breed of horses equal in size and strength to the larger kind of our draught horses the cavalry of england is in general formed of this class of horses but their inutility being experienced in some situations others of a lighter and more active kind have been substituted in a few regiments the fens of lincolnshire generally produce a larger breed than any other part of the kingdom in london there have been instances where a single horse of that kind has drawn for a small space the enormous weight of three tons half of which is known to be their ordinary draught    the common carthorse is inferior to the last in size and strength his form is heavy his motions slow and his aspect without sprightliness he is nevertheless extremely useful and is employed in the business of agriculture and other domestic concerns  till of late years packhorses were employed in the no them counties of england to carry the different manufactures and articles of traffic from one part of the kingdom to another but the improved state of our roads has caused that made of conveyance to be almost entirely  i their journies over trackless moors they  to the e of order and regularity custom  to observe the leading horse which  for his sagacity and steadiness being  gives notice to the rest who follow  without much deviation though sometimes at a considerable distance the following instance will show with what obstinate perseverance they have been known to observe the line of their order  some years ago one of these horses which had been long accustomed to follow his leader by accident or fatigue was thrown into an inferior rank the poor animal as if sensible of his disgrace by the most strenuous exertions at length recovered his usual station which he maintained during the remainder of the journey but on his arrival in the innyard he dropped down dead upon the spot his life falling a sacrifice to his ambition  a species of heroism we must admire even in the brute creation  although the horse is endowed with vast strength and powers he seldom exerts either to the prejudice of his master on the contrary he seems to participate in his pleasure and shares with him in his labors generous and persevering he gives up his whole powers to the service of his master though bold and intrepid he represses the natural vivacity and fire of his temper and not only yields to the hand but seems to consult the inclination of his rider  but it must continue to be matter of regret to every ling mind that these excellent qualities should be often shamefully abused in the most unnecessary exertions and the honest labors of this noble animal thrown away in the ungrateful task of accomplishing the purposes of unfeeling folly or lavished in gratifying the expectations of an intemperate moment    the mule this useful and hardy animal is the offspring of the horse and the ass and being barren furnishes us with an indisputable proof that the two species are perfectly distinct nature has providently stopped the further propagation of these heterogeneous productions to preserve uncontaminated the form of each animal without which regulation the races would in a short time be mixed with each other and every creature losing its original perfection would rapidly degenerate  the common mule is very healthy and will live above thirty years it is found very serviceable in carrying burdens particularly in mountainous and stony places where horses are not so surefooted the size and strength of our breed has lately been much improved by the importation of spanish maleasses and it were much to be wished that the useful qualities of this animal were more attended to for by proper care in its breaking its natural obstinacy would be in a great measure corrected and it might be formed with success for the saddle the draught or the burden  people of the first quality in spain are drawn by mules where fifty or sixty guineas is no uncommon price for one of them nor is it surprising when we consider how far they excel the horse in traveling in a mountainous country the mule being able to tread securely where the former can hardly stand their manner of going down the precipices of the alps the andes etc is very extraordinary and with it we will conclude their history in these passages on one side are steep eminences and on the other frightful abysses and as they generally follow the direction of the mountain the road instead of lying in a level forms at every little distance steep declivities of several hundred yards downward these can only be descended by mules and the animal itself seems sensible of the danger and the caution that is to be used in such descents when they come to the edge of one of these descents they stop without being checked by the rider and if he inadvertently attempt to spur them on they continue immovable they seem all this time ruminating on the danger that lies before them and preparing themselves for the encounter they not only attentively view the road but tremble and snort at the danger having prepared for the descent they place their fore feet in a posture as if they were stopping themselves they then also put their hinder feet together but a little forward as if they were going to lie down in this attitude having taken as it were a survey of the road they slide down with the swiftness of a meteor in the mean time all the rider has to do is to keep himself fast on the saddle without checking the rein for the least motion is sufficient to disorder the equilibrium of the mule in which case they both unavoidably perish but their address in this rapid descent is truly wonderful for in their swiftest motion when they seem to have lost all government of themselves they follow exactly the different windings of the road as if they had previously settled in their minds the route they were to follow and taken every precaution for their safety in this journey the natives place themselves along the sides of the mountains and holding by the roots of the trees animate the beasts with shouts and encourage them to persevere some mules after being long used to these journies acquire a kind of reputation for their safety and skill and their value rises in proportion to their fame    the ass the ass it is probable was originally a native of arabia and other parts of the east the deserts of lybia and numidia and many islands of the archipelago contain vast herds of wild asses which run with such amazing swiftness that even the coursers of the country can hardly overtake them they are chiefly caught by the natives on account of their flesh which is eaten by them and considered as a delicious repast the flesh of the common or tame ass is however drier more tough and disagreeable than that of the horse galen says it is even unwholesome its milk on the contrary is an approved remedy for certain disorders the wild ass is not streaked like the zebra with which it has often been confounded nor is his form so beautiful his figure resembles that of the common ass his color is brighter and he has a white streak extending from his head to his tail  the ass like the horse was originally imported into america by the spaniards where it has run wild and multiplied in a great degree ulloa informs us that in the kingdom of quito they hunt them in the following manner  a number of persons on horseback attended by indians on foot form a large circle in order to drive them into a narrow compass where at full speed they throw a noose over them and having secured them with fetters leave them till the chase is over which frequently lasts for several days they have all the swiftness of horses and neither declivities nor precipices can retard them in their flight when attacked they defend themselves with their heels and mouths with such activity that without slackening their pace they often maim their pursuers  a warm climate is most favorable to the growth of this animal the ass produced in this country is much inferior in size and beauty to those of spain and other warm countries in guinea they are larger and more beautiful than even their horses in persia they have two kinds the one slow and heavy which is made use of for carrying burdens the other nimble smooth and stately used chiefly for the saddle they are managed as horses and like them are taught to amble they generally slit their nostrils to give them more room for breathing many of these are sold as high as forty or fifty pounds  holingshed informs us that in the reign of queen elizabeth there were no asses in this country how soon after they might be introduced is uncertain however they are at present naturalized in this kingdom where their utility becomes daily more universally experienced  the qualities of this animal are so well known as to need no description his gentleness patience and perseverance are without example he is temperate with regard to food and eats contentedly the coarsest and most neglected herbage if he give the preference to any vegetable it is to the plantain for which he will neglect every other herb in the pasture in his water he is singularly nice drinking only from the clearest brooks he is so much afraid of wetting his feet that even when laden he will turn aside to avoid the dirty parts of the road  he is stronger in proportion to his size than the horse but more sluggish stubborn and untractable he is healthier than the horse and of all other quadrupeds is least infested with lice or other vermin which is probably owing to the extreme hardness and dryness of his skin for the same reason perhaps he is less sensitive of the goads of the whip or the stinging of flies  he is three or four years in coming to perfection and lives to the age of twenty or sometimes twentyfive years he sleeps much less than the horse and never lies down for that purpose but when he is much fatigued the sheass goes eleven months with young and seldom produces more than one at a time  the services of this useful creature are too often repaid by hard fare and cruel usage and being generally the property of the poor it partakes of their wants and their distresses whereas by due cultivation and care in its education the ass might be usefully and profitably employed in a variety of domestic purposes and in many cases supply the place of the horse to which only it is second though generally degraded into the most useless and neglected of domestic quadrupeds  the zebra which many authors have mistaken for a wild ass is the most beautiful as well as the wildest most timid and untameable animal in nature being larger than the ass it rather resembles the mule in shape its head is large its ears longer than those of the horse its legs beautifully small and well placed and its body well formed round and fleshy but the beauty of its shape is greatly heightened by the glossy smoothness of its skin and the amazing regularity and elegance of its colors which in the male are white and brown and in the female white and black ranged in alternate stripes over the whole body in a style so beautiful and ornamental that it would at first sight seem rather the effect of art than the genuine production of nature the head is striped with fine bands of black and white which form a center in the forehead the neck is adorned with stripes of the same color running round it the body is beautifully variegated with bands running across the back and ending in points at the belly its thighs its legs its ears and even its tail are all beautifully streaked in the same manner  the zebra inhabits the southern parts of africa where whole herds are seen feeding in those extensive plains that lie toward the cape of good hope however their watchfulness is such that they will suffer nothing to come near them and their swiftness so great that they easily leave their pursuers far behind  such is the beauty of this creature that it seems by nature fitted to gratify the pride and formed for the service of man and it is most probable that time and assiduity alone are wanting to bring it under subjection as it resembles the horse in regard to its form as well as manner of living there can be little doubt but it possesses a similitude of nature and only requires the efforts of an industrious and skilful nation to be added to the number of our useful dependants nevertheless its liberty has hitherto remained uncontrouled and its natural fierceness has as yet resisted every attempt to subdue it those that have been brought to this country have discovered a degree of viciousness that rendered it unsafe to approach them too familiarly but it is by no means to be concluded from hence that they are untameable  they have continued to be wild because they are natives of a country where the wretched inhabitants have no other idea of advantage from the animal creation than as they are good for food paying more regard to that which affords the most delicious repast than to delicacy of coloring or beauty of conformation  quaggas or wild asses an animal hitherto but little known and not much described abound in the same country and have been mistaken for zebras of the female kind but are now known to be a distinct species they live in herds and are said to be extremely swift  of ruminating animals of all animals those that chew the cud are the most harmless and the soonest brought under subjection the great obligations we are under to those of this class render them objects of the highest importance to us we are nourished with their milk we are supported by their flesh and we are clothed and warmed with their fleeces their harmlessness and innocence endear them to us and claim from us that protection their natures seem to require in return for which they supply us with the necessaries and comforts of life  we shall begin with those of the ox kind as claiming the first rank from their size their beauty and usefulness    the common bull and cow of all animals except man the cow seems most extensively propagated it is equally capable of enduring the rigours of heat and cold and is an inhabitant of the frozen as well as the most scorching climates other animals preserve their nature or their form with inflexible perseverance but these in every respect suit themselves to the wants and conveniences of mankind in no animal is there to be met with a greater variety of kinds and in none a more humble and pliant disposition  the climate and pastures of great britain are well adapted to the moderate nature of this animal and we are indebted to the variety and abundance of our wholesome vegetables for the number and excellence of our cattle which range over our hills and enliven our plains a source of inexhaustible wealth  the pride and boast of this happy country  being destitute of the upper foreteeth the cow prefers the high and rich grass in pastures to the short and more delicate herbage the horse generally selects for this reason in our english pastures where the grass is rather high and flourishing than succulent and nutritious the cow thrives admirably and there is no part of europe in which this animal grows larger two oxen bred and fed at howick in the county of northumberland were killed in march      at the age of seven years they measured from the head to the rump nine feet eight inches the height at the shoulder was five feet ten inches and weighed one hundred and seventyeight stone five pounds each  yields more milk nor fattens sooner  it has often been remarked that the horse and sheep impoverish the soil on which they graze whilst the pasture where the cow is fed acquires a finer surface and every year becomes more level and beautiful for the horse selects the grass that is most delicate and tender and being furnished with foreteeth on each jaw nips it close and frequently pulls it up by the roots thereby preventing its future growth and propagation the sheep also though formed like the cow with respect to its teeth only bites the most succulent parts of the herbage these animals therefore cut the fine grass too closely and suffer the high weeds and ranker grass to vegetate undisturbed and overrun the pastures  the age of the cow is known by its horns at the age of four years a ring is formed at their roots and every succeeding year another ring is added thus by allowing three years before their appearance and then reckoning the number of rings the creatures age may be exactly known  the quantity of milk given by the cow is very different some will yield only about six quarts in one day while others give from ten to fifteen and sometimes even twenty the richness of the pasture contributes not a little to its increase there have been instances of cows giving upwards of thirty quarts of milk in one day in such cases there is a necessity for milking them thrice from the milk of some cows twelve or fourteen pounds of butter are made in a week  it has been advanced by some naturalists as a general principle that neither animals nor parts of animals appear to be primarily intended for the use of man but are only capable of a secondary application to his purposes yet it must be allowed that in many instances what they term the secondary use is so manifest and important that it cannot with propriety be supposed to be excluded from the original designs of the allwise creator and it must be allowed that the cow in its faculty of giving in such abundance and with so much ease its milk which forms so rich and nutritive an aliment for the human species is a striking example of this subordination to the interests of mankind for this animal differs in some parts of its organization from most others having a larger and more capacious udder and longer and thicker teats than the largest animal we know it has likewise four teats while all other animals of the same nature have but two it also yields the milk freely to the hand while most animals at least those that do not ruminate in the same manner refuse it except their own young or some adopted animal be allowed to partake  the cow having four teats is a striking peculiarity the number in all other animals bearing some proportion to the number of young ones they bring forth at a time as in the bitch the cat the sow etc  the cow will yield her milk as freely and will continue to give it as long without the aid of the calf as if it were permitted to suck her constantly this is not the case with the ass which it is well known will soon grow dry if her foal be not permitted to suck part of her milk every day  upon the whole it appears that the property of yielding milk without the young one is confined to those kinds of ruminating horned animals which have cloven hoofs four stomachs long intestines are furnished with suet and have no foreteeth in the upper jaw that cows sheep goats and deer are of this kind and no other and that the cow has this property in a more eminent degree than others owing to the capaciousness of her udder and the size and form of her teats  by great industry and attention to their breed and by judicious mixtures with those of other countries our horned cattle are universally allowed to be the finest in europe although such as are purely british are inferior in size to those on many parts of the continent the large species now propagated in most parts of england are either entirely foreign or our own greatly improved by a cross or mixture with the foreign kind the holstein or dutch breed has been introduced with great success and from these the lincolnshire kind derive their size  the lancashire bull the lancashire breed forms a variety of a smaller size with wide spreading horns and straight backs their hair is finely curled and the elegance and regularity of their shape render this the most beautiful race of cattle this kingdom produces farther north they are still smaller and in the highlands of scotland they are very diminutive being not larger than an ass of these large droves are yearly brought out of that country to fatten in the southern parts of the kingdom where they soon greatly improve  the cow seems more liable to changes from its pasture and climate than any other quadruped in the different parts of this narrow island we can trace a wonderful variety of these animals produced by the richness or poverty of the soil in short in every part of the world the cow is found either large or small in proportion to the richness or poverty of its food among the eluth tartars where the pastures are remarkably rich and nourishing the cow grows to such an amazing size that a tall man can scarcely reach the tip of its shoulder in france on the contrary where this animal is stinted in its food and driven from the bed pastures it greatly degenerates  in great britain the ox is the only horned animal that will apply his strength to the service of mankind and in general is more profitable than the horse for the plough or the draught there is scarcely any part of this animal without its use the skin is made into various kinds of leather the hair is mixed with lime for plaistering the bones are made use of as a substitute for ivory and being calcined are used by the refiner as an absorbent to carry off the baser metals in refining silver etc combs and many either articles are made of the horns we are supplied with candles from the tallow and from the feet is procured an oil of great use in preparing and softening leather besides the wellknown benefits derived from butter milk and cheese its blood gall liver and urine have their respective uses in manufactures and medicine  the cow goes nine months with young and seldom produces more than one at a time    wild cattle there was formerly a very singular species of wild cattle in this country which is now nearly extinct numerous herds of them were kept in several parks in england and scotland but have been destroyed by various means and the only breed now remaining in the kingdom is in the park at chillinghamcastle in northumberland  the principal external appearances which distinguish this breed of cattle from all others are the following  their color is invariably white muzzles black the whole of the inside of the ear and about onethird of the outside from the tip downwards red about twenty years since there were a few with black far but the present parkkeeper destroyed them  since which period there has not been one with black ears  horns while with black tips very fine and bent upwards some of the bulls have a thin upright mane about an inch and an half or two inches long  at the first appearance of any person they set off in full gallop and at the distance of two or three hundred yards make a wheel round and come boldly up again tossing their heads in a menacing manner on a sudden they make a full stop at the distance of forty or fifty yards looking wildly at the object of their surprise but upon the least motion being made they all again turn round and fly off with equal speed but not to the same distance forming a shorter circle and again returning with a bolder and more threatening aspect than before they approach much nearer probably within thirty yards when they make another stand and again fly off this they do several times shortening their distance and advancing nearer till they come within ten yards when most people think it prudent to leave them not choosing to provoke them further for there is little doubt but in two or three turns they would make an attack  the made of killing them was perhaps the only modern remains of the grandeur of ancient hunting  on notice being given that a wild bull would be killed on a certain day the inhabitants of the neighborhood came mounted and armed with guns etc sometimes to the amount of an hundred horse and four or five hundred foot who stood upon walls or got into trees while the horsemen rode off the bull from the rest of the herd until he stood at bay when a marksman dismounted and shot at some of these huntings twenty or thirty shots have been fired before he was subdued on such occasions the bleeding victim grew desperately furious from the smarting of his wounds and the shouts of savage joy that were echoing from every side but from the number of accidents that happened this dangerous mode has been little practiced of late years the parkkeeper alone generally shooting them with a rifled gun at one shot  when the cows calve they hide their calves for a week or ten days in some sequestered situation and go and suckle them two or three times a day if any person come near the calves they clap their heads close to the ground and lie like a hare in form to hide themselves this is a proof of their native wildness and is corroborated by the following circumstance that happened to the writer of this narrative who found a hidden calf two days old very lean and very weak  on stroking its head it got up pawed two or three times like an old bull bellowed very loud stepped back a few steps and bolted at his legs with all its force it then began to paw again bellowed stepped back and bolted as before but knowing its intention and stepping aside it missed him fell and was so very weak that it could not rise though it made several efforts but it had done enough the whole herd were alarmed and coming to its rescue obliged him to retire for the dams will allow no person to touch their calves without attacking them with impetuous ferocity  when any one happens to be wounded or is grown weak and feeble through age or sickness the rest of the herd set upon it and gore it to death  the weight of the oxen is generally from forty to fifty stone the four quarters the cows about thirty the beef is finely marbled and of excellent flavor  those at burtonconstable in the county of york were all destroyed by a distemper a few years since they varied slightly from those at chillingham having black ears and muzzles and the tips of their tails of the same color they were also much larger many of them weighing sixty stone probably owing to the richness of the pasturage in holderness but generally attributed to the difference of kind between those with black and with red ears the former of which they studiously endeavored to preserve  the breed which was at drumlanrig in scotland had also black ears    the urus or wild bull is a variety of the ox kind and is chiefly to be met with in the extensive forests of lithuania it grows to a size almost equal to the elephant and is quite black the eyes are red and fiery the horns thick and short and the forehead covered with a quantity of curled hair the neck is short and strong and the skin has an odor of musk the female though not so big as the male exceeds the largest of our bulls in size nevertheless her udder is extremely small upon the whole however this animal which greatly resembles those of the tame kind probably owes its variety to its natural wildness and the richness of the pastures where it is produced    the bison differs from the rest of the ox kind in having a large lump between its shoulders almost as high as that of a camel he has a long shaggy mane which forms a kind of beard under his chin his eyes are fierce his forehead large and his horns extremely wide it is dangerous to pursue him except in forests abounding with trees large enough to conceal the hunters he is generally taken in pits covered with branches of trees and grass on the opposite side of which the hunters tempt the animal to pursue them and the enraged creature running toward them falls into the trap prepared for it and is then overpowered and slain  the bison or the animal with the hump is found in all the southern parts of the world though greatly differing from each other in size and form while the urus or the one without the hump chiefly occupies the temperate and cold climates the former extend throughout the vast continent of india and from mount atlas to the cape of good hope in some parts they are extremely large while in others they are very small such as the zebu or barbary cow  the zebu they are all equally docile and gentle when tamed and are in general covered with fine glossy hair softer and more beautiful than that of the common cow their humps are of different sizes in some weighing from forty to fifty pounds but in others less that part is in general considered as a great delicacy and when dressed has much the appearance and taste of udder  the bisons of madagascar and malabar are of the great kind those of arabia petrea and most parts of africa are of the zebu or small kind  in america especially toward the north the bison is well known they herd together in droves of from one to two hundred on the banks of the missisippi where the inhabitants hunt them their flesh being esteemed good eating they all breed with the tame cow the hump which is only an accidental characteristic gradually declines and in a few generations no vestiges of it remain thus we see whether it be the wild or the tame ox the bonasus or the urus the bison or the zebu by whatever name they are distinguished and though variously classed by naturalists in reality they are the same and however diversified in their appearance and properties are descendants of one common stock of which the most unequivocal proof is that they all mix and breed with each other  the oxen of india are of different sizes and are made use of in traveling as substitutes for horses their common pace is soft instead of a bit a small cord is passed through the cartilage of the nostrils which is tied to a larger cord and serves as a bridle they are saddled like horses and when pushed move very briskly they are likewise used in drawing chariots and carts for the former purpose white oxen are in great esteem and much admired they will perform journies of sixty days at the rate of from twelve to fifteen leagues a day and their traveling pace is generally a trot  in persia there are many oxen entirely white with small blunt horns and humps on their backs they are very strong and carry heavy burdens when about to be loaded they drop down on their knees like the camel and rise when their burdens are properly fastened    the grunting ox the sarluc or grunting cow of siberia from its resemblance to the bison may be considered as belonging to the same species the hair on its body is black except on the front and ridge of the back where it is white it has a mane on the neck and the whole body is covered with very long hair which hangs down below the knees and makes the legs appear short it has a hump on the back the tail resembles that of a horse is white and very bushy it strikes with its head like a goat and is very unruly its distinguishing peculiarity is that it makes a grunting noise like a hog instead of lowing like the ox which in every other instance it greatly resembles  the buffalo though there is the most striking general resemblance between the buffalo and our common ox both in regard to form and nature their habits and propensities being nearly similar are both equally submissive to the yoke and may be employed in the same domestic services yet it is certain from experience that no two animals can in reality be more distinct  the cow refuses to breed with the buffalo while it is known to propagate with the bison to which it bears in point of form a much more distant similitude  the buffalo is found wild in many parts of africa and india but is most common in the countries near the cape of good hope where he is described by sparrman as a fierce cruel and treacherous animal he frequently stands behind trees waiting the coming of some passenger when he rushes out upon him and after having thrown him down tramples him to death with his feet and knees tearing him with his horns and teeth and licking him with his rough tongue till the skin is nearly stripped from the body  the following accurate description we owe to the same author  the length of the buffalo from head to tail is eight feet the height five and a half and the forelegs two feet and a half long from the tip of the muzzle to the horns twentytwo inches his limbs in proportion to his size are much stouter than those of the ox his fetlocks likewise hang nearer the ground the horns are singular both in their form and position the bases of them are thirteen inches broad and only an inch distant from each other having a narrow channel or furrow between them from this furrow the horns assume a spherical form extending over a great part of the head the surface from the base upwards to nearly a third part of them is very rough and full of ts sometimes an inch deep the distance between the points is often above five feet the ears are a foot long somewhat pendent and in a great measure covered and defended by the lower edges of the horns which bend down on each side forming a curve upwards with the points their hair is of a darkbrown color about an inch long harsh and upon those males that are advanced in years straggling and thin especially on each side of the belly which gives them the appearance of being girt with a belt they frequently roll themselves in the mire of which they are very fond the tail is short and tufted at the end the eyes are large and somewhat sunk within their prominent orbits which are almost covered with the bases of the horns overhanging its dangling ears this with a peculiar inclination of the head to one side which is its usual manner produces an aspect at once fierce cunning and tremendous the flesh of the buffalo is coarse rather lean but full of juice of a high but not unpleasant flavor the hide is thick and tough and of great use in making thongs and harness it is so hard as not to be penetrated by a common musketball those made use of for shooting the buffalo are mixed with tin and even they are frequently flattened by the concussion  in italy the buffalo is domesticated and constitutes the riches and food of the poor who employ them for the purposes of agriculture and make butter and cheese from their milk  the female produces but one at a time and continues pregnant twelve months  another striking characteristic difference between the buffalo and the common cow  the common ram the sheep in its present domestic state seems so far removed from a state of nature that it may be deemed a difficult matter to point out its origin climate food and above all the unwearied arts of cultivation contribute to render this animal in a peculiar manner the creature of man to whom it is obliged to trust entirely for its protection and to whose necessities it largely contributes though singularly inoffensive and harmless even to a proverb it does not appear to be that stupid inanimate creature described by buffon devoid of every necessary art of selfpreservation without courage and even deprived of every instinctive faculty we are led to conclude that the sheep of all other animals is the most contemptible and stupid but amidst those numerous flocks which range without control on extensive mountains where they seldom depend upon the aid of the shepherd it will be found to assume a very different character in those situations a ram or a wedder will boldly attack a single dog and often come off victorious but when the danger is more alarming they have recourse to the collected strength of the whole flock on such occasions they draw up into a compact body placing the young and the females in the center while the males take the foremost ranks keeping close by each other thus an armed front is presented on all quarters and cannot easily be attacked without danger of destruction to the assailant in this manner they wait with firmness the approach of the enemy nor does their courage fail them in the moment of attack for when the aggressor advances within a few yards of the line the rams dart upon him with such impetuosity as lays him dead at their feet unless he save himself by flight against the attacks of single dogs or foxes when in this situation they are perfectly secure  a ram regardless of danger will sometimes engage a bull and his forehead being much harder than that of any other animal he seldom fails to conquer for the bull by lowering his head receives the stroke of the ram between his eyes which usually brings him to the ground  in the selection of their food few animals discover greater sagacity than the sheep nor does any domestic animal show more dexterity and cunning in its attempts to elude the vigilance of the shepherd in order to steal such delicacies as are agreeable to its palate besides its hardiness in enduring great severities of weather the natural instinct of the sheep in foreseeing the approach of a storm is no less remarkable in their endeavors to secure themselves under the shelter of some hill whole flocks have frequently been buried for many days under a covering of snow and have afterward been taken out without any material injury thus beautifully described by thompson   often the whirlwinds wing sweeps up the burden of whole wintry plains at one wide wast and over the hapless flocks hid in the hollow of two neighboring hills the billowy tempest whelms    there have been instances where sheep at the approach of a storm have fled for shelter to a neighboring cottage and taken refuge under the same roof with their shepherd  the variety in this creature is so great that scarcely any two countries produce sheep of the same kind there is found a manifest difference in all either in the size the covering the shape or the horns  the woolly sheep is found only in europe and in the temperate provinces of asia when transported into warmer climates it loses its wool and becomes hairy and rough it is likewise less fertile and its flesh no longer retains the same flavor  no country produces finer sheep than great britain their fleeces are large and well adapted to the various purposes of clothing the spanish fleeces are indeed finer but stand in no degree of comparison with those of lincolnshire or warwickshire for weight or utility in edward the thirds time when wool was allowed to be exported it brought   0000l per annum at  l  0s a pack which was a great sum in those days at this time when our woollenmanufactory stands unrivalled by any nation in the world and every method is taken to prevent this valuable commodity from being sent out of the kingdom the annual value of wool shorn in england is estimated at two millions sterling and when manufactured at no less than six millions  like other ruminating animals the sheep wants the upper foreteeth it has eight in the lower jaw two of which drop out and are replaced at two years old four of them art renewed at three years and the remainder at the age of four  the ewe produces one or two lambs at a time and sometimes though rarely three or four bears her young five months and brings forth in the spring the ram lives to the age of about fifteen years and begins to procreate at one when castrated they are called wedders they then grow sooner fat and the flesh becomes finer and better flavoured  there is hardly any part of this animal that is not serviceable to man of the fleece we make our cloths the skin produces leather of which are made gloves parchment and covers for books the entrails are formed into strings for fiddles and other musical instruments likewise coverings for whips its milk affords both butter and cheese and its flesh is a delicate and wholesome food  the following remarks taken from mr cullys observations on live stock will not be unacceptable to many of our readers as they convey a just idea of some of the most noted kinds of sheep at this time in the island he begins with those of lincolnshire which are of a large size bigboned and afford a greater quantity of wool than any other kind owing to the rich fat marshes on which they feed but their flesh is coarse leaner and not so finely flavoured as that of smaller sheep the same breed extends with some variations through most of the midland counties of england but the largest breed of sheep in this island is to be met with on the banks of the tees which runs through a rich and fertile country dividing the two counties of yorkshire and durham this kind differs from the preceding in their wool not being so long and heavy their legs are longer but finer boned and support a thicker firmer carcass their flesh is likewise much fatter and finer grained these sheep weigh from twentyfive to fortyfive pounds per quarter some have been fed to fifty pounds and one in particular was killed which weighed sixtytwo pounds ten ounces per quarter avoirdupois  a circumstance never before heard of in this island the ewes of this breed generally bring forth two lambs each season sometimes three four and even five as an instance of extraordinary fecundity it deserves to be mentioned that one of these ewes at the age of two years brought forth four lambs at one time the next season five both within eleven months the dorsetshire breed is likewise remarkably prolific the ewes being capable of bringing forth twice a year it is from these that the tables of our nobility and gentry are supplied with early lamb at christmas or sooner if required great numbers of those early victims to luxury are yearly sent to the london markets where they are sold at the enormous price of  0s  d or perhaps   s per quarter  the manner of rearing the lambs is curious they are imprisoned in little dark cabins the ewes are fed with oilcakes hay corn turnips cabbages or any other food which the season of the year affords these are given them in a field contiguous to the apartments where the lambs are kept and at proper intervals the nurses are brought in to give suck to their young ones while the attendants at the same time make their lodgings perfectly clean and litter them with fresh draw great attention is paid to this as much of the success of rearing these unseasonable productions depends upon warmth and cleanliness  the dorsetshire sheep are mostly whitefaced their legs are long and small and great numbers of them have no wool upon their bellies which gives them an uncouth appearance they produce a small quantity of wool but of a good quality from which our fine wiltshire cloths are made the mutton of these sheep is very sweet and well flavoured the variations of this breed are spread through most of the southern counties but the true kind is only to be found in dorsetshire and wiltshire there is a breed not unlike this in norfolk and suffolk but they are all gray or blackfaced  the northwest part of yorkshire with all that mountainous tract of country running toward lancashire southward and to fort william northward is occupied by a hardy blackfaced wildlooking tribe generally called short sheep which differ from our other breeds not only in the darkness of their complexions and horns but principally in the coarse shaggy wool which they produce not much unlike the hair growing upon a waterspaniel their eyes have a very sharp and wild cast they run with astonishing agility and seem quite adapted to the heathy mountains they inhabit their flesh is peculiarly fine and high flavoured the three great fairs for these sheep where amazing numbers of them are sold every year are stagshawbank in northumberland brough in westmorland and linton in scotland  there is likewise a breed of sheep inhabiting the same country as the former but peculiarly distinguished from them by long thin bodies white legs white faces and by having no horns their wool is fine and thickly planted  the sheep in the low parts of northumberland are of a mixed breed between the long kind the tees water and the lincolnshire the mug or muff kind was formerly common in that county they were so called from their wool growing round their heads into their very eyes so as almost to prevent them from seeing this breed is now nearly exploded being considered by every breeder of experience as unprofitable from their thriving slowly and being very tender  in the northern districts of scotland and in many of the islands there is a breed of sheep which differs from the others in the smallness of their size many of them when fed weighing no more than six seven or eight pounds per quarter they have dun faces without horns and their wool which is very fine is variously mixed and streaked with black brown and red  to these various and numerous tribes of this useful animal we must add that by the persevering industry and attention of mr bakewell of dishley in leicestershire our breed of sheep has been greatly improved and he has been followed by many eminent breeders with nearly equal success  it seems to be generally agreed that in sheep as well as in all other animals there is a certain symmetry or proportion of parts which is best adapted to the size of each particular animal all those of each kind that exceed or fall short of this pitch are more or less disproportioned according to the size they attain to and in the degree they are advanced beyond this line of perfection we find them less active weaker and always less able to endure hardship thus by selecting the handsomest and best proportioned of their kinds the judicious breeder has gradually arrived at a degree of perfection in improving this animal unknown at any former period  the leicestershire breed the superior qualities of the leicestershire breed are that they will feed quickly fat at almost any age even on indifferent pastures and carry the greatest quantity of mutton upon the smallest bone their carcases are round have remarkably broad backs and short legs and to show the immense weight to which they may be fed we give the measurement of a ram of mr bakewells mentioned by young in his eastern tour  at three years old his girt was five feet ten inches height two feet five inches breadth over his shoulders one foot eleven inches and an half breadth over his ribs one foot ten inches and an half breadth over his hips one foot nine inches and an half  this breed is now become so eminent and so much ought after that mr bakewell has this year      let out rams for one season only for from fifty to as high as four hundred guineas each and we hope in a little time to see it become more general as it is a maxim which every farmer can easily comprehend that whatever breed the same quantity of pasture goes farthest toward feeding fat is certainly the most desirable  this valuable breed has also found its way into northumberland mess donkin and co of hexham brewery have procured a large stock of both ewes and rams from one of the latter the preceding cut was drawn mess culley of fenton and mr thompson of lilburn have also by a mixture of this with other kinds improved their breeds of sheep to the astonishment of the neighboring farmers and graziers who are now fully convinced of its great superiority  we are favored by mr culley with the following account of a wedder of his breed fed at fenton in northumberland and killed at alnwick in october      when four years old  his dimensions were as follow  girt four feet eight inches and an half breadth over his shoulders one foot three inches over his middle one foot seven inches and a quarter across the breast from the inside of one foreleg to the inside of the other nine inches  at the dividing of the quarters through the ribs it measured seven inches and oneeighth of solid fat cut straight through without any slope and his mutton was of the most beautiful bright color but in nothing was he so remarkable as in the smallness of his bones the proprietor of this sheep laments that he had not the offals exactly weighed by offals we would be understood to mean not only the tallow but the head pluck and pelt with the blood and entrails because it is now well known that this breed of sheep has a greater quantity of mutton in proportion to their offals than any other kind we know of and is consequently cheaper to the consumer    the drawing from which the preceding cut was taken was made by mr bailey of chillingham soon after the sheep had been shorn    the dunky or dwarf sheep another variety of the sheep kind deserves to be noticed for the singular and grotesque formation of its features the wool growing round its head forms a kind of hood or ruff before which stand its short erect ears the uncommon protrusion of its under jaw considerably before the upper by which the foreteeth are left exposed and the shortness of the nose which lies under its high projecting forehead altogether give it the appearance of deformity and make a striking contrast to most animals of the sheep kind the ram from which the drawing was made came from abroad with two ewes as a present to a gentleman in the county of northumberland they are very small and have no horns  in lincolnshire there is a small kind mentioned by mr culley under the name of dunkie which is supposed to be the same with this    the tartarian sheep the sheep of which the annexed cut is an accurate representation seem to differ from every other which we remember to have seen described a pair of them was brought to this country by way of russia from the borders of tartary they are rather larger than the english sheep the color of the male is roan or lightbrown mixed with white that of the female black and white their ears are pendulous and instead of a tail they have a large protuberance of fat behind which covers the rump when the drawing was made they had just been shorn at other times the wool is so long and thick that their form cannot be well distinguished  the african or guinea sheep is found in most of the tropical climates they are large strong and swift with coarse hairy fleeces short horns pendulous ears have a kind of dewlap under the chin and though domesticated seem to approach nearest to a state of nature  the manyhorned sheep the iceland sheep as well as those of muscovy and the coldest climates of the norths resemble our own in the form of the body but differ in the number of their horns having generally four and sometimes eight growing from the forehead their wool is long smooth and hairy they are of a darkbrown color and under the outward coat of hair which drops off at stated periods there is an internal covering resembling fur which is fine short and soft  the quantity produced by each sheep is about four pounds  the broadtailed sheep common in persia barbary syria and egypt are remarkable chiefly for their large and heavy tails which grow a foot broad and so long that the shepherds are obliged to put boards with small wheels under them to keep them from galling the flesh of these tails is esteemed a great delicacy it is of a substance between fat and marrow and eaten with the lean of the mutton they generally weigh from twenty to fifty pounds each  the sheep bred on the mountains of thibet produce wool of extraordinary length and fineness of which is made the indian shawl frequently sold in this country for fifty pounds or upwards  the walachian sheep in walachia they have sheep with curious spiral horns standing upright in the form of a screw long shaggy fleeces and in size and form nearly resembling ours they are also found in the island of crete and in many of the islands of the archipelago this is said to be the strepsicheros of the ancients    the mouflon or musmon which by some authors has been classed with the sheep and by others has been referred to the goat kind may not improperly be considered as standing in a middle place and forming the link between each for it is curious to observe that nature in all her variations proceeds by slow and almost insensible degrees scarcely drawing a firm and distinguishing line between any two races of animals that are essentially different and yet in many respects nearly allied to each other in all transitions from one kind to the other there is to be found a middle race that seems to partake of the nature of both and that can precisely be referred to neither thus it is hard to discover where the sheep kind ends or the goat begins the musmon therefore which is neither sheep nor goat has many marks of both and forms the link between the two kinds though covered with hair it bears a strong similitude to the ram its eyes are placed near the horns and its ears are shorter than those of the goat its horns resemble those of the ram in being of a yellow color and a triangular shape they likewise bend backward behind the ears in some they grow to an amazing size measuring above two yards long they often maintain furious battles with each other in which their horns are frequently broken off the general color of the hair is reddishbrown the inside of the thighs and belly is white tinctured with yellow the muzzle and inside of the ears are of a whitish color tinctured with yellow the other parts of the sace are of a brownishgrey  the musmon is found in the wild and uncultivated parts of greece sardinia corsica and in the deserts of tartary where it maintains itself by force or swiftness against the attacks of all rapacious animals  it has been known to breed with the sheep and from that circumstance is supposed by m buffon and others to be the primitive race the female of this species is rather less than the male and her horns never grow to that prodigious size  those of kamtschatka are so strong that ten men can scarcely hold one and the horns are so large that young foxes often shelter themselves in the hollow of such as fall off by accident they grow to the size of a young stag propagate in autumn and bring forth one young at a time though sometimes two    the common goat this lively playful and capricious creature occupies the next step in the great scale of nature and though inferior to the sheep in value in various instances bears a strong affinity to that useful animal the goat and the sheep will propagate together the hegoat copulates with the ewe and the ram with the shegoat the offspring likewise is prolific  the goat is a much more hardy animal than the sheep and is in every respect more fitted for a life of liberty it is not easily confined to a flock but chooses its own pasture straying wherever its appetite or inclination leads it chiefly delights in wild and mountainous regions climbing the loftiest rocks and standing secure on the verge of inaccessible and dangerous precipices although as ray observes one would hardly suppose that their feet were adapted to such perilous achievements yet upon a nearer inspection the wonder ceases and we find that nature has provided them with hoofs well calculated for the purpose of climbing being made hollow underneath with sharp edges like the inside of a spoon which prevents them from sliding off these rocky eminences  the goat is an animal easily sustained and is chiefly therefore the property of those who inhabit wild and uncultivated regions where it finds an ample supply of food from the spontaneous productions of nature in situations inaccessible to other creatures it delights rather on the heathy mountains or the shrubby rock than the fields cultivated by human industry its favorite food is the tops of the boughs or the tender bark of young trees it bears a warm climate better than the sheep and frequently sleeps exposed to the hottest rays of the sun  the milk of the goat is sweet nourishing and medicinal being found highly beneficial in consumptive cases it is not so apt to curdle upon the stomach as that of the cow from the shrubs and heath on which it feeds the milk of the goat acquires a flavor and wildness of taste very different from that of either the sheep or cow and is highly pleasing to such as have accustomed themselves to its use it is made into whey for those whose digestion is too weak to bear it in its primitive state several places in the north of england and the mountainous parts of scotland are much resorted to for the purpose of drinking the milk of the goat and its effects have been generally salutary in vitiated and debilitated habits  in many parts of ireland and in the highlands of scotland their goats make the chief possessions of the inhabitants and in most of the mountainous parts of europe supply the natives with many of the necessaries of life they lie upon beds made of their skins which are soft clean and wholesome they live upon their milk and oat bread they convert part of it into butter and some into cheese the flesh of the kid which they do not allow themselves to taste is considered by the city epicure as a great rarity and when properly prepared is esteemed by some as little inferior to venison  the goat produces generally two young at a time sometimes three rarely four in warmer climates it is more prolific and produces four or five at once though the breed is found to degenerate the male is capable of propagating at one year old and the female at seven months but the fruits of a generation so premature are generally weak and defective their best time is at the age of two years or eighteen months at least the goat is a shortlived animal full of ardour but soon enervated his appetite for the female is excessive so that one buck is sufficient for one hundred and fifty females    the ibex if we believe m buffon is the stock from whence our domestic goat is descended being very similar to it in the shape of its body but diering considerably in the size of is horns which are much larger they are bent backward and full of knots and every year the creature lives it is asserted one is added to the number of them some of these horns have been found at least two yards long the head of the ibex is small adorned with a large dusky beard and has a thick coat of hair of a tawny color mixed with ash a streak of black runs along the top of its back the belly and thighs are of a delicate fawn color  the ibex inhabits the highest alps of the grisons country and the vallais and is also found in crete they are very wild and difficult to be shot as they always keep on the highest points of the rocks the chase of them is attended with great danger being very strong they often turn upon the incautious huntsman and tumble him down the precipice unless he have time to lie down and let the animal pass over him they bring forth one young at a time seldom two and are said not to be longlived  the chamois goat the chamois though a wild animal is very easily tamed and docile and to be found only in rocky and mountainous places it is about the size of a domestic goat and resembles one in many respects it is most agreeably lively and active beyond expression the hair is short like that of the do in spring it is of an ash color in autumn a dun color inclining to black and in winter of a blackish brown this animal is found in great plenty in the mountains of dauphiny of piedmont savoy switzerland and germany they are peaceful gentle creatures and live in society with each other they are found in flocks of from four to fourscore and even an hundred dispersed upon the crags of the mountains the large males are seen feeding detached from the rest except in rutting time when they approach the females and drive away the young the time of their coupling is from the beginning of november to the end of october and they bring forth in april and march the young keep with the dam for about five months and sometimes longer if the hunters and the wolves do not separate them it is asserted that they live between twenty and thirty years their flesh is good to eat and they are found to have ten or twelve pounds of suet which far surpasses that of the goat in hardness and goodness the chamois has scarce any cry as most animals are known to have if it has any it is a kind of feeble bleat by which the parent calls its young but in cases of danger and when it is to warn the rest of the flock it uses an hissing noise which is heard at a great distance for it is to be observed that this creature is extremely vigilant and has an eye the quickest and most piercing in nature its smell also is not less distinguishing when it sees its enemy distinctly it stops for a moment and then if the person be near in an instant after it flies off in the same manner by its smell it can discover a man at half a league distance and gives the earliest notice upon any alarm therefore or any apprehensions of danger the chamois begins his hissing rote with such force that the rocks and the forests recho to the sound the first hiss continues as long as the time of one inspiration in the beginning it is very sharp and deeper toward the close the animal having after this first alarm reposed a moment again looks round and perceiving the reality of i fears continues to hiss by intervals until it has spread the alarm to a very great distance during this time it seems in the most violent agitation it strikes the ground with its foresoo and sometimes with both it bounds from rock to rock it turns and looks round it runs to the edge of the precipice and still perceiving the enemy flies with all its speed the hissing of the male is much louder and sharper than that of the female it is performed through the nose and is properly no more than a very strong breath driven violently through a small aperture  the chamois feeds upon the best herbage and chooses the most delicate parts of the plants the flowers and the tender buds it is not less delicate with regard to several aromatic herbs which grow upon the sides of the mountains it drinks but very little while it feeds upon the succulent herbage and chews the cud in the intervals of feeding  this animal is greatly admired for the beauty of its eyes which are round and sparkling and which mark the warmth of its constitution its head is furnished with two small horns of about half a foot long of a beautiful black and rising from the forehead almost betwixt the eyes these contrary to what is found in other animals instead of going backwards or sideways stand forward and bend a little backward at their extremities ending in a very sharp point the ears are placed in a very elegant manner near the horns and there are two stripes of black on each side of the face the rest being of a whitish yellow which never changes the horns of the female are less and not so much bent the natives have been known to bleed cattle with them  these animals are so much incommoded by heat that they are never found in summer except in the caverns of rocks amidst fragments of unmelted ice under the shade of high and spreading trees or of rough and hanging precipices that face the north and which keep off entirely the rays of the sun they go to pasture both morning and evening and seldom during the heat of the day they run along the rocks with great ease and seeming indifference and leap from one to another so that no dogs are able to pursue them there is nothing more extraordinary than to see them climbing and desending precipices that to all other quadrupeds are inaccessible they always mount or descend in an oblique direction and throw themselves down a rock of thirty feet and light with great security upon some excrescence or fragment on the side of the precipice which is just large enough to place their feet upon they strike the rock however in their descent with their feet three or four times to stop the velocity of their motion and when they have got upon the base below they at once seem fixed and secure in fact to see them jump in this manner they seem rather to have wings than legs certain it is that their legs are formed for this arduous employment the hinder being rather longer than the former and bending in such a manner that when they descend upon them they break the force of the fall  during the rigours of winter the chamois sleeps in the thicker forests and feeds upon the shrubs and the buds of the pine tree it sometimes turns up the snow with its foot to look for herbage and where it is green makes a delicious repast the more craggy and uneven the forest the more this animal is pleased with the abode which thus adds to its security  the hunting the chamois is very laborious and extremely difficult the most usual way is to hide behind the clefts of the rocks and shoot them some also pursue this animal as they do the stag by placing proper persons at all the passages of a glade or valley and then sending in others to rouse the game dogs are quite useless in this chase as they rather alarm than overtake nor is it without danger even to the men for it often happens that when the animal finds itself overpressed it drives at the hunter with its head and often tumbles him down the neighboring precipice this animal cannot go upon ice when smooth but if there be the least inequalities on its surface it then bounds along in security and quickly evades all pursuit  the skin of the chamois was once famous when tanned for its softness and warmth at present however since the art of tanning has been brought to greater perfection the leather called shammoy is made also from those of the tame goat the sheep and the deer    the goat of angora is well known for its long hair which is thick glossy of a dazzling whiteness and so fine that cloths as beautiful as silk known among us by the name of camblets are made of it its ears are long and pendulous the male is furnished with horns curiously twisted which proceed horizontally from each side of the head forming a screw those of the female are shorter and encircle the ear somewhat like those of the common ram they inhabit the rocky mountains of pontus where they experience a considerable degree of cold and might thrive in britain as well as in their native country the same might be said of the goat of thibet so famous for the fineness of its wool it lives in a climate colder than ours in winter and might probably be transplanted with success  in portugal there is a breed of fine large goats remarkable for yielding a great quantity of milk a gallon and a half per day these if introduced into our navy might be of infinite service in long voyages  experiments of this kind would certainly be attended with many great advantages and it were much to be wished that the great and opulent would employ some portion of their time and affluence in procuring from distant countries such useful animals as would propagate in our island and are yet unknown in it by this mean many of our lofty mountains might contribute to support a variety of useful creatures that would at the same time beautify the most barren and rugged parts of our country  the syrian goat which m button makes a variety of the goat of angora differs from ours in nothing more than the length of its ears which are pendulous and from one to two feet long they are often troublesome to the creature in feeding for which reason the owners are sometimes obliged to cut one of them off their horns are short and black they are very numerous in the neighborhood of aleppo and supply the inhabitants with milk which they prefer to that of the cow or the buffalo  these are the principal varieties of the goat kind of which there are others of less note such as the african goat or buck of juda which is much smaller than the domestic kind being not much larger than a hare extremely fat and its flesh well tasted the horns are short smooth and turn a little forward it is common in guinea angola and all along the coast of africa  in america there are goats of a small kind not much larger than a kid with long hair the horns which are short and thick bend downwards so close to the head as almost to penetrate the skull these are in every respect similar to the dwarf goat found in africa and according to buffon have been sent from that country  it is certain that before the discovery of america by the spaniards the goat and every other domestic animal were unknown there    the gazelles or antelopes are a numerous and beautiful race of animals inhabiting the hottest parts of the globe they are classed by systematic writers with the goat kind and like them have hollow horns which they never cast in other respects they greatly resemble the deer especially in the elegance of their form and the swiftness of their motions they are of a restless and timid disposition remarkably agile and most of their boundings so light and elastic as to strike the spectators with astonishment of all animals the gazelle has the most beautiful eye to which the eastern poets have made frequent allusions in describing those of their favorite beauties  the distinguishing marks of this tribe of animals in which they differ both from the goat and deer are principally these  their horns are different being annulated or ringed round and at the same time marked with longitudinal depressions or surrows running from the base to the point besides the extreme beauty and meekness of its aspect the gazelle is more delicately and finely limbed than the roebuck its hair is finer and more glossy its swiftness is so great that the greyhound the fleetest of dogs is unequal to the course and the sportsman is obliged to call in the aid of the falcon which being trained to the work seizes on the animal and impedes its motion so as to enable the dogs to overtake it in india and persia a sort of leopard is sometimes made use of in the chase which takes its prey by the greatness of its springs but should he fail in his first essay the game escapes  some species of the antelope form herds of two or three thousand while others keep in small troops of five or six they for the most part live in hilly countries though some inhabit plains they often browse like the goat and feed on the tender shoots of young trees which give their flesh an excellent flavor  there are many varieties of this animal some of them but little known or described we shall begin with  the blaawbok or blue goat which mr pennant places next to the goat from the length of its hair and form of its horns the color of this creature is a fine blue resembling velvet but when dead it is said to change to a bluish gray its belly is white and beneath each eye it has a large white mark its tail is seven inches in length with long hairs at the end its horns incline backward forming a curve and threefourths of their length are decorated with twentyfour rings the uppermost quarter is smooth and runs tapering to a point it inhabits the hottest parts of africa  sparrman describes one which he saw at the cape of good hope and calls it a blaawbok    the bontibok or pied goat is likewise an inhabitant of the same country as well as the plains and woods of senegal where large herds of them are to be seen this animal is remarkable for having a white band running along each of its sides crossed by two others from the back to the belly disposed somewhat like a harness from whence it is called the harnessed antelope on the rump it has three white lines pointing downwards on each side its thighs are spotted with white the color of the body is a deep tawny and beneath each eye there is a white spot its horns are straight nine inches long pointing backwards with two spiral ribs it is called by m buffon the guib great flocks of them are found in the plains and woods of the country of poder in africa    the boschbok or wood goat we are indebted to the indefatigable labors of dr sparrman for an accurate description of this rare animal which is found in the country about the cape of good hope and is the only one among the african gazelles that can be properly said to live in the woods and groves from whence it derives its name  the horns of this animal are black somewhat more than ten inches long and have three sides wreathed in a spiral direction toward the top at the bottom they are rough in consequence of a number of wavy rings which however are not elevated much above the surface at the top they are round sharppointed and in that part as smooth as if they had been polished their position is almost in the same line with the forehead inclining a little forwards and by means of the twist they make recede from each other toward the middle they are there three inches and a half distant at the base they are only one inch  the wood goat is somewhat more than two feet and a half high of a darkbrown color in some parts bordering upon black on each cheekbone there are two large round white spots another still larger occupies the fore part of the neck somewhat below the top of the windpipe and several smaller white spots are scattered over the haunches a narrow line of white hair extends from the neck all along the back and tail but is not easily distinguished being hid by the length of the darkbrown hairs on the top of the back which are three or four inches long so as to form a kind of mane the hair on the head is very short and fine in other parts of the body it is longer resembling that of goats its tail is not more than a fingers breadth in length covered with long hairs which extend down the hind part of the thighs and buttocks the legs and feet are slender the fetlock joints are likewise small the nose and under lip which are white are decorated with black whiskers about an inch long  as this creature runs but slowly he is sometimes caught with dogs when he finds there is no other resource he boldly puts himself into a posture of defense and when going to butt kneels down and in that position fells his life at a very dear rate killing and goring some of the best and most spirited hounds its horns which are its chief defense sometimes prove its bane by entangling it in the bushes to avoid this it carries its nose horizontally and straight forward while it runs so that they lie directly on its neck the female which is without horns on that account runs more freely through the forests and does not suffer herself so easily to be hunted out of the woods having there as well as on the plains much greater security against the dogs in her swiftness than the male has in his horns especially as she is not so bulky and heavy as the male her breast is said to be very plump but the flesh of this animal is not very tender  the springbok the white antelope which is supposed to be the same with the pygarg mentioned in the book of numbers is an inhabitant of the cape of good hope where it is called the springbok and is to be seen in herds of several thousands covering the plains as far as the eye can reach sparrman says that having shot at a large herd of them they formed a line and immediately made a circular movement as if to surround him but afterward flew off in different directions  the height of this beautiful creature is two feet and a half and from the ears to the tail somewhat above three feet the tail is rather less than a foot long the length of the ears is six inches and a half that of the horns measuring them along their curvatures nine inches and their distance at the base where they are nearly three inches thick is one inch they gradually widen from thence to the distance of five inches from each other when they turn inwards so that at the tip they are not above three inches and a half asunder they are of a deep black color annulated above half way up toward the top they are quite smooth and end in a sharp point  the predominant color of this animal is brown or a lightrust color the posterior moiety of the ridge of the back is white which color is continued over and round the anus the inside of the haunches the belly and the fore legs excepting a narrow stripe of brown in the front of each the head is white except a darkbrown list on each side of the breadth of an inch which passes from the corner of the mouth over the eyes to the horns a stripe an inch and a half broad of the same deep umber color extends from the shoulders to the haunches forming thus a boundary between the snowy whiteness of the belly and the rusty color of the sides the tail at least the lower part of it is not thicker than a goosequill the under side is quite bare but toward the tip there are a few darkbrown hairs from one to two inches and a half long the ears are of an ash color tipped on the edges with fine lightgrey hairs the eyebrows and whiskers are black the hair in general is fine and short but the dark fine which borders upon the white consists of longer hairs and in some measure serves to cover the dazzling whiteness of the creatures back the purity of which seems to be by this means preserved for on certain occasions the animal is able to expand these hairs to the breadth of eight or nine inches particularly on taking a high leap which it never fails to do when it is pursued and then it is no less pleasant than curious to see the whole herd jumping over each others heads to the height of two yards and sometimes higher some of them will take three or four high leaps successively in this situation they seem to be suspended in the air and look over their shoulders at their pursuers at the same time showing the white part of their backs in a most beautiful manner  when hunted these animals suffer themselves soon to be dispersed and when the whole flock has got to some distance they will all make a stand and turn round to look at their pursuers at the same time expanding the white hairs on their backs  the springboks are so extremely swift as to require a good horse to overtake them although they are sometimes bold enough to allow a sportsman either on foot or on horseback to come within gunshot of them  their flesh is very palatable and has a more juicy and delicate taste than that of the other gazelles    the elkantelope is likewise an inhabitant of the cape as well as the greatest part of india and is one of the larger kinds of gazelles has straight horns two feet in length of a darkbrown color marked with two prominent spiral ribs running near twothirds of their length but smooth toward the ends which are turned a little inwards the forehead is flat and broad at the top but about the eyes becomes narrow it has a forelock standing erect the length of the whole forehead its nose is sharp and its breast is covered with a loose skin  this animal is of an ash color inclining a little toward blue has a thin upright mane quite black which extends from the nape of its neck along the top of the back and has likewise a tuft of black hair at the end of the tail  the elkantelopes live chiefly in plains and valleys and when hunted always run if possible against the wind they are not very swift and being in general fat especially the males which are always the largest and fattest in the herd are soon tired the hunter generally endeavors to get to the windward of the animal which when he has accomplished he takes an opportunity of throwing himself from his horse and instantly shoots the flying game at this practice the dutch colonists at the cape are so expert as seldom to fail  sparrman in his account of this animal says there have been many instances where keen sportsmen as well for their own pleasure as convenience have hunted elkantelopes and other gazelles for many miles together from the open plains and driven them to their own doors before they thought it worth while to shoot them  the female has horns like the male but smaller they are used by the hottentots for tobaccopipes    the hartbeest is the most common of all the larger gazelles known in any part of africa  the following accurate description is taken from sparrman to whom we are indebted for the best accounts of such of these rare animals as are to be met with near the cape  the height of this animal is somewhat above four feet the horns are from six to nine inches long very strong and black almost close at the base diverging upwards and at the top bending backwards in an horizontal direction almost to the tips which turn a little downwards they are embossed with about eighteen rings of an irregular form the general color of the hartbeest is that of cinnamon the front of the head is marked with black as is likewise the fore part of the legs the hind part of the haunch is covered with a wide black streak which reaches down to the knee a narrow stripe of black begins behind each ear and runs all along the ridge of the neck a darkbrown oval spot extends over the back terminating just above the tail which is slender something like that of an ass and is covered with strong black hairs about six inches long there is a pore about an inch below the eye from which a matter is distilled somewhat like earwax which the hottentots carefully preserve as a rare and excellent medicine  this animal is supposed to be the bubalus of the ancients is the cervine antelope of mr pennant and the bubale of m buffon  the hair of the hartbeest is very fine and its long ears are covered with white hair on the inside it has only eight teeth in the lower jaw none in the upper the legs are rather slender with small fetlocks and hoofs  the large head and high forehead together with the assinine ears and tail of the hartbeest render it one of the least handsome of the whole tribe of antelopes its pace when at full speed appears like a heavy gallop notwithstanding which it runs as fast as any of the large antelopes when it has once got ahead of its pursuers it is very apt to turn round and stare them full in the face its flesh is fine rather dry but yet of an agreeably high flavor  the koedoe or striped antelope is a beautiful tall gazelle inhabiting the cape of good hope has long slender shanks is larger though not so clumsy as the elkantelope its horns are smooth twisted spirally with a prominent edge or rib following the wreaths they are three feet nine inches long of a palebrown color close at the base and at the points round and sharp the color of this animal is a rusty brown along the ridge of the back there is a white stripe mixed with brown from this are eight or nine white stripes pointing downwards the forehead and the fore part of the nose are brown a white stripe runs from the corner of each eye and meets just above the nose upon each checkbone there are two small white spots the inner edges of the ears are covered with white hair and the upper part of the neck is adorned with a brown mane an inch long beneath the neck from the throat to the breast are some long hairs hanging down the breast and belly are gray the tail is two feet long brown above white beneath and black at the end  the koedoe though a tall and slender animal is not so swift as many of the gazelle kind and is easily overtaken by the hounds on these occasions the males defend themselves with great spirit with their horns and will come to close quarters with the dogs but the females having no horns are obliged to depend on their speed  another of the larger kind of gazelles to be found at the cape is  the gemsebok which is called by mr pennant the egyptian antelope and by m buffon the pasan  the horns are straight slender of a black color about three feet long with above twenty rings reaching half way to the points which are smooth and taper it is of an ash color inclining to red the belly legs and face are white a black line extends from the neck to the loins the tail is about two feet long terminated with black hairs  this animal is famous for a concretion in its stomach or intestines called the oriental bezoar which was well known in former times for its great virtue in expelling poison in the human frame and was sold at enormous prices its value increasing in proportion to its size there was a time when a stone of four ounces sold in europe for above  00 l at present however its estimation and price are greatly decreased the virtues which ignorance and inexperience attributed to it are now found no longer to exist and this oncecelebrated medicine is now only consumed in countries where the knowledge of nature has been but little advanced  similar concretions are likewise found in a variety of animals of the gazelle and goat kind even apes serpents and hogs are said to have their bezoars in short there is scarcely an animal except of the carnivorous kind that does not produce some of these concretions in the stomach intestines kidneys and even the heart  these are the principal animals of the gazelle kind described by dr sparrman in his voyage to the cape of good hope he mentions a variety of others that are to be met with there of which he gives us little but their names  the reebok is a gregarious animal two feet in height of an ash color somewhat resembling that of a hare but a little more inclining to red the belly and anus are white the tail short the horns are black and straight very similar to those of the gemsebok but barely a foot long very taper and sharppointed they are used by the hottentots as awls or bodkins for boring holes in making their shoes or cloaks the flesh of this animal is dry and accounted worse to eat than that of any other gazelle  the riet reebok is twice as big as the lastmentioned animal is monogamous or keeps in pairs and generally lies concealed among the reeds and marshy places and resembles the reebok  the grysbok or guinea antelope of mr pennant and grimme of m buffon is of a greyish or ash color with large black ears and a black spot round the eyes straight black horns slender and sharppointed not three inches long slightly annulated at the base its height is about eighteen inches and is most elegantly formed beneath each eye is a cavity that contains a strongscented oily liquor which smells something like musk and when exposed to the air becomes hard and black  the klipspringer is of a lightred color inclining to yellow intermixed with black streaks the tips and edges of its ears are black it runs with great swiftness and makes large bounds even on the steepest precipices and in the most rocky places where it cannot easily be caught with hounds  the gnu to these we may add the gnu the hottentot name for a singular animal which with respect to its form is between the horse and the ox it is about the size of a common galloway the length of it being somewhat above five feet and the height rather more than four  this animal is of a darkbrown color the tail and mane of a lightgrey the shag on the chin and breast and the stiff hairs which stand erect on the forehead and upper part of the face are black the curvature of the horns is singular and the animal is represented in the cut in the attitude of butting to give an idea of their form and position  the legs of the gnu are small its hair is very fine and it has a cavity beneath each eye like most of the antelope kind  the steenbok or red antelope of mr pennant and nagor of buffon is found in senegal and at the cape of good hope  its whole body is of a palered color it is as large as a roebuck its horns which do not exceed six inches in length are almost smooth and bend a little forward its ears are five inches long and it has a white spot over each eye  the nanguer or swift antelope is likewise a native of africa and is found in senegal  it is three feet and a half in length and two and a half high the horns are black and round eight inches in length and what is singular bend forward at the points its general color is tawny belly and thighs white it has likewise a white spot under the neck is a very handsome animal and easily tamed its swiftness is compared to that of the wind    the common antelope the antelope properly so called abounds in barbary and in all the northern parts of africa  it is somewhat less than the fallowdeer its horns are about sixteen inches long surrounded with prominent rings almost to the top where they are twelve inches distant from point to point the horns of the antelope are remarkable for a beautiful double flexion which gives them the appearance of the lyre of the ancients the color of the hair on the back is brown mixed with red the belly and inside of the thighs white and the tail short  the gazelle of africa or the barbary antelope is likewise common in all the northern part of africa in syria and mesopotamia and seems to be a variety of the lastmentioned animal which it strongly resembles only the two colors on the back are separated from each other by a strong dusky line and on each knee there is a tuft of hair  the kevel is a native of senegal and in color and marks very much resembles the preceding animal but is rather less and its horns instead of being round are flatted on their sides and the rings more numerous  the corin or spotted antelope is still less than the two former animals its horns are likewise smaller being only six inches long and almost smooth the annular prominencies being scarcely discernible on each knee is a tuft of hair some of these animals are irregularly spotted with white  the koba is remarkable for the form of its horns which are almost close at the base bending out toward the middle where they form a curve inwards and again fly off at the points which bend backward they are seventeen inches long surrounded with fifteen rings the ends are smooth and sharp  the kob differs from the former animal only in being less  they are both inhabitants of senegal  the chevrotain and meminna the chevrotain or little guinea deer is the smallest of all the antelope kind the least of all clovenfooted quadrupeds and we may add the most beautiful  its legs at the smallest part are not much thicker than a tobaccopipe it is not more than seven inches in height and about twelve from the point of the nose to the insertion of the tail its ears are broad and its horns which are straight and scarcely two inches long are black and shining as jet the color of the hair is a reddishbrown in some a beautiful yellow very short and glossy  these elegant little creatures are natives of senegal and the hottest parts of africa they are likewise found in india and in many of the islands belonging to that vast continent  in ceylon there is an animal of this kind called meminna which is not larger than a hare but perfectly resembling a fallowdeer  it is of a gray color the sides and haunches are spotted and barred with white its ears are long and open and its tail short  none of these small animals can subsist but in a warm climate they are so extremely delicate that it is with the utmost difficulty they can be brought alive into europe where they soon perish they are gentle familiar most beautifully formed and their agility is such that they will bound over a wall twelve feet high in guinea they are called guevei the female has no horns  we shall conclude our account of this numerous race with  the scythian antelope or saiga which is the only one of the species that is to be found in europe  the form of its body resembles the domestic goat but its horns are those of an antelope being marked by very prominent rings with furrows between they are a foot long the ends smooth of a paleyellow color almost transparent  the male is covered with rough hair like the hegoat and has a strong scent the female is smoother hornless and timid the general color is a dirty white  when they are attacked by wolves or dogs the males stand round the females forming a circle with their heads toward the enemy in which posture they defend their charge  their common pace is a trot when they go faster it is by leaps and are swifter than roebucks when they feed they are obliged to go backward owing to the length of the upper lip which they lift up  their skin is soft and excellent for gloves belts etc  they are found in flocks from six to ten thousand on the banks of the tanais and boristhenes  the young are easily tamed and will readily return to their master when turned out on the desert  the nylghau this animal is a native of the interior parts of india  it seems to be of a middle nature between the cow and the deer and carries the appearance of both in its form in size it is as much smaller than the one as it is larger than the other its body horns and tail are not unlike those of a bull and the head neck and legs are very like those of a deer the color in general is ash or gray from a mixture of black hairs and white all along the ridge or edge of the neck the hair is blacker longer and more erect making a short thin and upright mane reaching down to the hump its horns are seven inches long six inches round at the root tapering by degrees and terminate in a blunt point the ears are large and beautiful seven inches in length and spread to a considerable breadth near their end they are white on the edge and on the inside except where two black bands mark the hollow of the ear with a zebralike variety the height of this animal at the shoulder is four feet one inch behind the loins it only measures four feet  the female differs considerably from the male both in height and thickness being much smaller in shape and color very much resembling a deer and has no horns she has four nipples and is supposed to go nine months with young she commonly has one at a birth but sometimes two  several of this species were brought to this country in the year      which continued to breed annually for some years after  dr hunter who had one of them in his custody for some time describes it as a harmless and gentle animal that is seemed pleased with every kind of familiarity always licked the hand that either stroaked or fed it and never once attempted to use its horns offensively it seemed to have much dependence on its organs of smell and snuffed keenly whenever any person came in sight it did so likewise when food or drink was brought to it and would not taste the bread which was offered if the hand that presented it happened to smell of turpentine  its manner of fighting is very particular and is thus described  two of the males at lord clives being put into an enclosure were observed while they were at some distance from each other to prepare for the attack by falling down upon their knees they then shuffled toward each other keeping still upon their knees and at the distance of a few yards they made a spring and darted against each other with great force  the following anecdote will serve to show that during the rutting season these animals are fierce and vicious and not to be depended upon  a laboring man without knowing that the animal was near him went up to the outside of the enclosure the nylghau with the quickness of lightning darted against the woodwork with such violence that he broke it to pieces and broke off one of his horns close to the root the death of the animal which happened soon after was supposed to be owing to the injury he sustained by the blow  bernier says that it is the favorite amusement of the mogul emperor to hunt the nylghau and that he kills them in such numbers as to distribute quarters of them to all his omrahs which shows that they are esteemed good and delicious food  the nylghau is frequently brought from the interior parts of asia as a rare and valuable present to the nabobs and other great men at our settlements in india  it remains to be considered whether this rare animal might not be propagated with success in this country that it will breed here is evident from experience and if it should prove docile enough to be easily trained to labor its great swiftness and considerable strength might be applied to the most valuable purposes    the musk there have been various accounts given of this animal by naturalists and travelers by whom it seems to have been taken notice of more for the perfume which it produces than for the information of the curious enquirer into its nature and qualities for we are still at a loss what rank to assign it among the various tribes of quadrupeds it has no horns and whether it ruminates or not is uncertain but by its wanting the foreteeth in the upper jaw we are led to suppose that it belongs either to the goat or the deer kind and have therefore given it a place after the gazelles relying upon those characteristic marks which are known and leaving it to future historians who may be possessed of better means of information to ascertain its genuine character  the musk of thibet resembles the roebuck in form it is somewhat above two feet in height at the shoulder the hind legs are longer than the fore legs being two feet nine inches high from the top of the haunches in length it is three feet six inches from the head to the tail the head is above half a foot long its upper jaw is much larger than the lower and on each side of it there is a slender tusk near two inches long which hangs down bending inwards like a hook and very sharp on the inner edge its lower jaw contains eight small cutting teeth and in each jaw there are six grinders its ears are long small and erect like those of a rabbit the hair on the whole body is long and rough marked with small waves from top to bottom the color is a rustybrown under the belly and tail it is white on each side of the lower jaw there is a tuft of thick hair about an inch long its hoofs are deeply cloven slender and black the spurious hoofs are likewise very long its tail is not more than two inches in length and hid in the hair  the use it makes of its tusks is not well known the most probable is that of hooking up roots out of the ground and catching at small twigs and branches of trees upon which it feeds  the female has no tusks is less than the male and has two small teats  the musk is found in the kingdom of thibet in several of the chinese provinces about the lake baikal and near the rivers jenisan and argun from lat  0 to    but seldom so far south except driven by great falls of snow to seek for food in more temperate climates it is naturally a timid animal and endowed with a quick sense of hearing its solitary haunts are usually mountains covered with pines where it avoids mankind and when pursued flies to the highest and most inaccessible summits  the perfume produced by this animal which is so well known in the fashionable circles and of late so much used in the practice of physic needs little description it is found in a bag or tumor nearly of the size of a hens egg on the belly of the male only these bags the hunters cut off and tie them up for sale many thousands of which are sent over annually to europe besides what are consumed in different parts of the east to account for this great consumption it is supposed that the musk is frequently adulterated and mixed with the blood of the animal it comes to us from china tonquin bengal and muscovy but that of thibet is reckoned the best and sells at a much higher price  the flesh of the males especially in the rutting season is much infected with the flavor of the musk but is nevertheless eaten by the russians and tartars    the giraffe or cameleopard this animal the existence of which has frequently been called in question is a native of the wild and unfrequented deserts of ethiopia and other interior parts of africa where it leads a solitary life far from the habitations of men for whose use it is rendered unfit by the enormous disproportion of its parts it has hitherto been regarded chiefly as an object of curiosity and may lead us to admire the wonderful productions of that creative power which has filled the earth with life in such a boundless variety of forms  the height of this extraordinary animal from the crown of the head to the ground is seventeen feet while at the rump it only measures nine feet the neck alone is seven feet long and the length from the extremity of the tail to the end of the nose is twentytwo feet the fore and hind legs are nearly of an equal height but the shoulders are of such a length as to make its back incline like the roof of a house its neck is slender and elegant adorned on the upper side with a short mane its head is nearly similar to that of a stag having two horns six inches long covered with hair with tufts at the end like bristles on the middle of the forehead stands a protuberance about two inches high resembling a third horn its ears are long and its eyes large and beautiful  the color of this animal is a dirty white interspersed with large spots of yellow over the whole body it is a timid and gentle creature but not swift from the great length of its fore legs it is obliged to divide them to a great distance when it grazes which it does with great difficulty it lives chiefly by browsing on the leaves and tender branches of trees it lies on its belly and has hard protuberances on its breast and thighs like the camel its tail is long slender and covered with strong hairs its feet resemble those of an ox it has no teeth in the upper jaw and is a ruminating animal its pace is a kind of gallop  this animal was known to the romans in early times by whom its history has been handed down to succeeding ages in some of their most celebrated works of sculpture it was exhibited in their games among other rare and uncommon animals and is finely and justly described by oppian    the elk this animal is the largest and most formidable of all the deer kind it is a native of both the old and the new continent being known in europe by the name of the elk and in america by that of the moosedeer it is sometimes taken in the forests of russia and germany though rarely to be seen on account of its extreme wildness it likewise inhabits norway sweden poland and tartary as far as the north of china it is common in canada and in all the northern parts of america where it is called by the french the original  the elk has been variously described by naturalists and travelers by some it is said to be twelve feet high whilst others with greater appearance of probability describe it as being not much higher than a horse it is however a matter of doubt to which a greater degree of credibility should be given  from a variety of elks horns preserved in the cabinets of the curious some of which are of a most enormous size there is every reason to conclude that the animal which bore them must have been of a proportionable bulk and strength  those who speak of the gigantic moose say their horns are six feet long and measure from tip to tip above ten feet the beams of the horns are short from which they spread out into large and broad palms one side of which is plain but on the outside are several sharp snags or shoots  the european elk grows to the height of seven or eight feet and in length from the end of the muzzle to the insertion of the tail measures ten feet the head is two feet long the neck on which is a short upright mane of a lightbrown color is much shorter its eye is small and from the lower corner of it there is a deep slit common to all the deer kind as well as most of the gazelles the ears are upwards of a foot in length very broad and somewhat slouching the nostrils are wide and the upper lip which is square and has a deep furrow in the middle hangs greatly over the lower from whence it was imagined by the ancients that this creature could not graze without going backward the withers are very high the hind legs much shorter than the fore legs and the hoofs deeply cloven from a small excrescence under the throat hangs a long tuft of coarse black hair the tail is very short dusky above and white beneath the hair is long and rough like a bear and of a hoary brown color not much differing from that of the ass  the pace of the elk is a high shambling trot but it goes with great swiftness  formerly these animals were made use of in sweden to draw sledges but as they were frequently accessory to the escape of such as had been guilty of murders or other great crimes this use of them was prohibited under great penalties  in passing through thick woods these animals carry their heads horizontally to prevent their horns being entangled in the branches  the elks are timid inoffensive animals except when wounded or during the rutting season when the males become very furious and at that time will swim from isle to isle in pursuit of the females they strike with both horns and hoofs and possess such agility and strength of limbs that with a single blow of the fore feet they will kill a wolf or a dog or even break a tree  their flesh is extremely sweet and nourishing the indians say they can travel farther after eating heartily of the flesh of the elk than any other animal food their tongues are excellent but the nose is esteemed the greatest delicacy in all canada the skin makes excellent buff leather and is strong soft and light the indians make their snowshoes and likewise form their canoes with it the hair on the neck withers and hams of a fullgrown elk from its great length and elasticity is well adapted to the purpose of making matrasses and saddles  the methods of hunting these animals in canada are curious  the first and most simple is before the lakes or rivers are frozen multitudes of the natives assemble in their canoes with which they form a vast crescent each horn touching the shore whilst another party on the shore surround an extensive tract they are attended by dogs which they let loose and press toward the water with loud cries the animals alarmed by the noise fly before the hunters and plunge into the lake where they are killed by the people in the canoes with lances and clubs  another method requires a greater degree of preparation and art  the hunters enclose a large space with stakes and branches of trees forming two sides of a triangle the bottom opens into a second enclosure which is fast on all sides at the opening are hung numbers of snares made of the slips of raw hides they assemble as before in great troops and with all kinds of hideous noises drive into the enclosure not only the moose but various other kinds of deer with which that country abounds some in forcing their way through the narrow pass are caught in the snares by the neck or horns whilst those which escape these meet their fate from the arrows of the hunters directed at them from all quarters  they are likewise frequently killed with the gun when they are first discovered they squat with their hind parts and make water at which instant the sportsman fires if he miss the moose sets off in a most rapid trot making like the reindeer a prodigious rattling with its hoofs and running twenty or thirty miles before it stops or takes the water the usual time for this diversion is in winter the animal can run with ease upon the firm surface of the snow but the hunters avoid entering on the chase till the heat of the sun is strong enough to melt the frozen crust with which it is covered and render it soft enough to impede the flight of the moose which sinks up to the shoulders flounders and gets on with great difficulty the sportsman pursues in his broadrackets or snowshoes and makes a ready prey of the distressed animal  as weak against the mountainheaps they push their beating breast in vain and piteous bray he lays them quivering on the ensanguind snows and with loud shouts rejoicing bears them home the female is less than the male and has no horns they are in season in the autumn and bring forth in april sometimes one but generally two young ones at a time which arrive at their full growth in six years  the reindeer this extraordinary animal is a native of the icy regions of the north where by a wise and bountiful dispensation which diffuses the common goods of nature over every part of the habitable globe it abounds and is made subservient to the wants of a hardy race of men inhabiting the countries near the pole who would find it impossible to subsist among their snowy mountains without the aid of this most useful creature  in more temperate regions men are indebted to the unbounded liberality of nature for a great variety of valuable creatures to serve to nourish and to cloth them to the poor laplander the reindeer alone supplies the place of the horse the cow the sheep the goat etc and from it he derives the only comforts that tend to soften the severity of his situation in that most inhospitable climate  the reindeer of lapland are of two kinds  the wild and the tame the former are larger stronger and more hardy than the latter for which reason the tame females in the proper season are often sent out into the woods where they meet with wild males and return home impregnated by them the breed from this mixture is stronger and better adapted for drawing the sledge to which the laplanders accustom them at an early age  the sledge they are yoked to it by a collar from which a trace is brought under the belly between the legs and fastened to the fore part of the sledge these carriages are extremely light and covered at the bottom with the skin of the reindeer the person who sits in it guides the animal with a cord fastened to its horns he drives it with a goad and encourages it with his voice those of the wild breed though by far the strongest often prove refractory and not only refuse to obey their master but turn against him and strike so furiously with their feet that his only resource is to cover himself with his sledge upon which the enraged animal vents its fury the tame animal on the contrary is patient active and willing  when hard pushed the reindeer will trot the distance of sixty miles without stopping but in such exertions the poor obedient creature fatigues itself so exceedingly that its master is frequently obliged to kill it immediately to prevent a lingering death that would ensue in general they can go about thirty miles without stopping and that without any great or dangerous efforts  this mode of traveling can be performed only in the winter season when the face of the country is covered with snow and although the conveyance is speedy it is inconvenient dangerous and troublesome  as the reindeer constitutes the sole riches of the laplander it may well be supposed that a constant attention to preserve and secure it forms the chief employment of his life it is no uncommon thing for one person to possess above five hundred in a single herd  as soon as summer appears which forms but a short interval from the most piercing cold the laplander who had fed his reindeer upon the lower grounds during the winter drives them up to the mountains leaving the woody country and the low pastures which at that season are in a state truly deplorable myriads of insects bred by the heat of the sun in the woods and fens with which this country abounds are all upon the wing the whole atmosphere swarms with life every place and every creature is infested the natives are obliged to cover their faces with a mixture of pitch and milk to shield them from these minute invaders which are drawn in with the breath and enter the nostrils and even the eyes but they are chiefly enemies to the reindeer the horns of that animal being then tender and covered with a skin which renders them extremely sensitive a cloud of these insects settle upon them and drive the poor animal almost to distraction in this extremity there is no resource but flight the herdsmen drive their flocks from the plains to the summits of the mountains whither the foe cannot follow them there they will continue the whole day with little or no food rather than venture down into the lower parts where they have no defense against their unceasing persecutors  besides the gnat the gadfly is a common pest to these animals in the autumn this insect deposits its eggs in their skin where the worms burrow and wound it in several places and often prove fatal to the poor animal the moment a single fly is seen the whole herd is in motion they know their enemy and endeavor to avoid it by tossing up their heads and running among each other but all this too often proves ineffectual  every morning and evening during the summer the herdsman returns to the cottage with his deer to be milked where a large fire of moss is prepared for the purpose of filling the place with smoke to drive off the gnats and keep the deer quiet whilst milking  the quantity of milk given by one female in a day is about a pint it is thinner than that of a cow but sweeter and more nourishing  the female begins to breed at the age of two years is in season the latter end of september goes with young eight months and generally brings forth two at a time  the fondness of the dam for her young is very remarkable they follow her two or three years but do not acquire their full strength until four it is at this age that they are trained to labor and they continue serviceable four or five years they never live above fifteen or sixteen years  at eight or nine years old the laplanders kill them for their skins and their flesh of the former they make garments which are warm and cover them from head to foot they also serve them for beds they spread them on each side of the fire upon the leaves of trees and in this manner lie both soft and warm the latter affords a constant supply of good and wholesome food which in the winter when all other kinds of provisions fail is their chief subsistence the tongue of the reindeer is considered as a great delicacy and when dried great numbers of them are sold into other countries the sinews serve for thread with which the laplanders make their clothes shoes and other necessaries and when covered with the hair serve them for ropes  innumerable are the uses the comforts and advantages which the poor inhabitants of this dreary climate derive from this animal we cannot sum them up better than in the beautiful language of the poet  their reindeer form their riches these their tent their robes their beds and all their homely wealth supply their wholesome fare and cheerful cups obsequious at their call the docile tribe yield to the sled their necks and whirl them swift over hill and dale heaped into one expanse of marbled snow as far as eye can sweep with a blue crust of ice unbounded glazed   the horns of the reindeer are large and slender bending forward with brow antlers which are broad and palmated a pair in our possession are in length two feet eight inches and from tip to tip two feet five inches they weigh nine pounds the projecting brow antler is fourteen inches long one foot broad and serrated at the end it should seem both from its situation and form an excellent instrument to remove the snow under which its favorite moss lies both sexes have horns those of the female are less and have fewer branches  we are happy in being able to give an accurate representation of this singular creature the drawing was taken from one in the possession of sir h g liddell bart which he brought over from lapland with four others in      the height at the shoulder was three feet three inches the hair on the body was of a darkbrown color and on the neck brown mixed with white a large tuft of hair of a dirtywhite color hung down from the throat near its chest and it had a large white spot on the inside of each hind leg close by the joint its head was long and fine and round each eye was a large black space its horns were covered with a fine down like velvet the hoofs of this animal are large broad and deeply cloven they spread cut to a great breadth on the ground and when the animal is in motion make a crackling noise by being drawn up forcibly together  not many attempts have been made to draw the reindeer from its native mountains and transport it to milder climes and of these few have succeeded naturalists from thence have concluded that it cannot exist but amidst ice and snow m buffon regrets the impossibility of procuring the animal alive and says that when transported to another climate it soon dies m regnard mentions some that were brought to dantzick where being unable to endure the heat of the climate they all perished queen christina of sweden procured five and twenty which she purposed sending to oliver cromwell they were brought as far as stockholm but the laplanders who attended them refusing to come to england fifteen of the number were killed by the wolves and the remaining ten did not long survive the climate being considered as too warm  to those brought over by sir h g liddell five more were added the year following they produced young ones and gave promising hopes of thriving in this country but by accident or mismanagement the stock is now in      reduced to a single female with young the disorder of which most of them died was similar to what is called the rot in sheep and is generally attributed to the too great richness of the grass whereon they fed nor can we wonder at the failure of this spirited enterprise when we consider that it is the sole employment of the laplander to attend and herd his reindeer to drive them in the summer time to the summits of the mountains to the sides of clear lakes and streams and to lead them where they can find the most proper food want of knowledge or attention to minute particulars is sufficient to overturn the bestlaid plans  there is however little doubt but this animal will live without the lapland lichen to which perhaps it only has recourse because there is in those latitudes no other sustenance during the winter it is also in england free from its mortal enemy  the gadfly but as the desire of possessing this animal has hitherto been excited only by curiosity it is not likely that much attention will be paid to it in a country like this abounding with such variety of useful quadrupeds  the reindeer is wild in america where it is called the caribou it is found in spitzbergen and greenland and is very common in the most northern parts of europe and in asia as far as kamtschatka where some of the richest of the natives keep herds of ten or twenty thousand in number  in the neighborhood of hudsons bay there are great herds of wild reindeer columns of eight or ten thousand are seen annually passing from north to south in the months of march and april in that season the muskatoes are very troublesome and oblige them to quit the woods and seek refreshment on the shore and open country  great numbers of beasts of prey follow the herds the wolves single out the stragglers detach them from the flock and hunt them down the foxes attend at a distance to pick up the offals left by the former  in autumn the deer with the fawns bred during the summer remigrate northward    the stag or red deer is the most beautiful animal of the deer kind the elegance of his form the lightness of his motions the flexibility of his limbs his bold branching horns which are annually renewed his grandeur strength and swiftness give him a decided preeminence over every other inhabitant of the forest  the age of the stag is known by its horns  the first year exhibits only a short protuberance which is covered with a hairy skin the next year the horns are straight and single the third year produces two antlers the fourth three the fifth four and when arrived at the sixth year the antlers amount to six or seven on each side but the number is not always certain  the stag begins to shed his horns the latter end of february or the beginning of march soon after the old horn is fallen off a soft tumor begins to appear which is soon covered with a down like velvet this tumor every day buds forth like the graft of a tree and rising by degrees shoots out the antlers on each side the skin continues to cover it for some time and is furnished with blood vessels which supply the growing horns with nourishment and occasion the furrows observable in them when that covering is stripped off the impression is deeper at the bottom where the vessels are larger and diminishes toward the point where they are as smooth and solid as ivory when the horns are at their full growth they acquire strength and solidity and the velvet covering or skin with its blood vessels dries up and begins to fall off which the animal endeavors to hasten by rubbing its antlers against the trees and in this manner the whole head gradually acquires its complete hardness expansion and beauty  soon after the stags have polished their horns which is not completed till july or august they quit the thickets and return to the forests they cry with a loud and tremulous note and fly from place to place in search of the females with extreme ardour their necks swell they strike with their horns against trees and other obstacles and become extremely furious  at this season when two stags meet their contests are often desperate and terminate in the defeat or flight of one of them while the other remains in possession of his mistress and the field till another rival approaches that he is also obliged to attack and repel  during this time which usually lasts about three weeks the stag is frequently seen by the sides of rivers and pools of water where he can quench his thirst as well as cool his ardour he swims with great ease and strength and it is said will even venture out to sea allured by the hinds and swim from one island to another though at a considerable distance  the hinds go with young eight months and a few days and seldom produce more than one young called a fawn they bring forth in may or the beginning of june and conceal their young with great care in the most obscure retreats they will even expose themselves to the fury of the hounds and suffer all the terrors of the chase in order to draw off the dogs from their hiding place the hind is also very bold in the protection of her offspring and defends it with great courage against her numerous and rapacious enemies the wild cat the dog and even the wolf are frequently obliged to give way to her upon these occasions but what appears to be strangely unnatural the stag himself is frequently one of her most dangerous foes and would destroy the young fawn if not prevented by the maternal care of the hind in concealing from his observation the place of its retreat  the calf never quits the dam during the whole summer and in winter the stags and hinds of all ages keep together in herds which are more or less numerous according to the mildness or rigor of the season they separate in the spring the hinds retire to bring forth while none but the young ones remain together  stags are gregarious animals and fond of grazing in company it is danger or necessity alone that separates them  the usual color of the stag in england is red in other countries it is generally brown or yellow his eye is peculiarly beautiful soft and sparkling his hearing is quick and his sense of smelling acute when listening he raises his head erects his ears and seems attentive to every noise which he can hear at a great distance when he approaches a thicket he stops to look round him on all sides and attentively surveys every object near him if the cunning animal perceive nothing to alarm him he moves slowly forward but on the least appearance of danger he flies off with the rapidity of the wind he appears to listen with great tranquillity and delight to the sound of the shepherds pipe which the hunters sometimes make use of to allure the poor animal to his destruction  the stag eats slowly and is nice in the choice of his pasture when his stomach is full he lies down to chew the cud at leisure this however seems to be attended with greater exertions than in the ox or the sheep for the grass is not returned from the first stomach without violent straining owing to the great length of his neck and the narrowness of the passage this effort is made by a kind of hiccup which continues during the time of his ruminating  the voice of the stag is stronger and more quivering as he advances in age in the rutting season it is even terrible that of the hind is not so loud and is seldom heard but when excited by apprehension for herself or her young  the stag has been said to be an uncommonly longlived animal but later observations have fully confuted this unfounded opinion it is a generally received maxim that animals live seven times the number of years that bring them to perfection thus the stag being five or six years in arriving at maturity lives seven times that number or from thirtyfive to forty years  the following fact recorded in history will serve to show that the stag is possessed of an extraordinary share of courage when his personal safety is concerned  some years ago william duke of cumberland caused a tiger and a stag to be enclosed in the same area and the stag made so bold a defense that the tiger was at length obliged to give up  the hunting of the stag has been held in all ages as a diversion of the noblest kind and former times bear witness of the great exploits performed on these occasions in our island large tracts of land were set apart for this purpose villages and sacred edifices were wantonly thrown down and converted into one wide waste that the tyrant of the day might have room to pursue his favorite diversion in the time of william rufus and henry the first it was less criminal to destroy one of the human species than a beast of chase happily for us these wideextended scenes of desolation and oppression have been gradually contracted useful arts agriculture and commerce have extensively spread themselves over the naked land and these superior beasts of the chase have given way to other animals more useful to the community  in the present cultivated state of this country therefore the stag is almost unknown in its wild state the few that remain are kept in parks among the fallowdeer and distinguished by the name of red deer its viciousness during the rutting season and the badness of its flesh which is poor and illflavoured have occasioned almost the extinction of the species some few are yet to be found in the forests that border on cornwall and devonshire on most of the large mountains of ireland and in the highlands of scotland where dr johnson describes them as not exceeding the fallowdeer in size and their flesh of equal flavor the red deer of this kingdom are nearly of the same size and color without much variety in other parts of the world they differ in form and size as well as in their horns and the color of their bodies  the corsican stag is very small not exceeding half the height of ours his body is short and thick his hair of a darkbrown color and his legs short    the axis or ganges stag is an inhabitant of those immense plains of india watered by the river ganges  m buffon considers it as a variety or shade between the stag and the fallowdeer it is of the size of the latter but its horns are round like those of the stag and it has no brow antlers his whole body is marked with white spots elegantly disposed and distinct from each other the belly inside of the thighs and legs are white along the back there are two rows of spots parallel to each other those on the other parts of the body are irregular the head and neck are gray and the tail which is red above and white beneath is as long as that of the fallowdeer  the continent of america abounds with stags and other animals of the deer kind in great variety in some parts of that vast country the inhabitants have domesticated them and live chiefly upon the milk and cheese with which they supply them  thus we find that the same animal which in some parts contributes only to the amusement of man may in others be brought to supply his necessities the stores of nature are various and abundant it is industry alone that draws them out to supply our wants and contribute to our comforts  the fallowdeer the principal difference between the stag and the fallowdeer seems to be in their size and in the form of their horns  the latter being much smaller than the former and its horns instead of being round like those of the stag are broad and palmated and better garnished with antlers and when the horns are very strong they are sometimes terminated by small palms the tail is also much longer than that of the stag and its hair is brighter in other respects they nearly resemble each other  the horns of the fallowdeer are shed annually like those of the stag but they fall off later and are renewed nearly at the same time their rutting season arrives fifteen days or three weeks after that of the stag the males then bellow frequently but with a low and interrupted voice they are not so furious at this season as the stag nor exhaust themselves by any uncommon ardour they never leave their pasture in quest of the females but generally fight with each other till one buck becomes master of the field  they associate in herds which sometimes divide into two parties and maintain obstinate battles for the possession of some favorite part of the park each party has its leader which is always the oldest and strongest of the flock in this manner they attack in regular order of battle they fight with courage and mutually support each other they retire they rally and seldom give up after one defeat the combat is frequently renewed for several days together till after several defeats the weaker party is obliged to give way and leave the conquerors in possession of the object of their contention  the fallowdeer is easily tamed feeds upon a variety of things which the stag refuses and preserves its condition nearly the same through the whole year although its flesh is esteemed much finer at particular seasons  they are capable of procreation in their second year and like the stag are fond of variety  the female goes with young eight months and produces one sometimes two and rarely three at a time they arrive at perfection at the age of three years and live till about twenty  we have in england two varieties of the fallowdeer which are said to be of foreign origin the beautiful spotted kind supposed to have been brought from bengal and the deepbrown sort now common in this country these last were introduced by king james the first out of norway where having observed their hardiness in bearing the cold of that severe climate he brought some of them into scotland and from thence transported them into his chases of enfield and epping since that time they have multiplied exceedingly in many parts of this kingdom which is now become famous for venison of superior fatness and flavor to that of any other country in the world  the fallowdeer with some variation is found in almost every country of europe those of spain are as large as stags but darker their necks are also more slender and their tails which are longer than those of ours are black above and white beneath  in guiana a country of southamerica according to labat there are deer without horns smaller than those of europe but resembling them in every other particular they are very lively light and excessively timid of a reddish color with sharp piercing eyes and short tails when pursued they fly into places of difficult access the natives frequently stand and watch for them in narrow paths and as soon as the game appears within reach shoot them unperceived their flesh is considered as a great delicacy and the hunter is well rewarded for his trouble  the roebuck was formerly common in many parts of england and wales but at present is only to be found in the highlands of scotland  the roe is the smallest of all the deer kind being only three feet four inches long and somewhat more than two feet in height the horns are from eight to nine inches long upright round and divided into three branches the body is covered with long hair the lower part of each hair is ash color near the end is a narrow bar of black and the point is yellow the hairs on the face are black tipped with ash color the ears are long their insides of a paleyellow and covered with long hair the spaces bordering on the eyes and mouth are black the chest belly legs and the inside of the thighs are of a yellowishwhite the rump is of a pure white and the tail very short  the form of the roebuck is elegant and its motions light and easy it bounds seemingly without effort and runs with great swiftness when hunted it endeavors to elude its pursuers by the most subtle artifices it repeatedly returns upon its former steps till by various windings it has entirely confounded the scent the cunning animal then by a sudden spring bounds to one side and lying close down upon its belly permits the hounds to pass by without offering to stir  these animals do not keep together in herds like other deer but live in separate families the fire the dam and the young ones associate together and seldom mix with others  their rutting season continues but fifteen days  from the latter end of october till about the middle of november during this period they will not suffer the fawns to remain with them the buck obliges them to retire in order that the dam and her succeeding progeny may remain undisturbed  the female goes with young five months and a half and brings forth about the end of april or beginning of may on these occasions she separates from the male and conceals herself in the thickest and most retired part of the woods she generally produces two fawns at a time sometimes three in ten or twelve days these are able to follow their dam when threatened with danger she hides them in a thicket and to preserve them offers herself to be chased notwithstanding her care she is frequently robbed of her young numbers of fawns are found out and taken alive by the peasants and many more are worried by dogs foxes and other carnivorous animals by these continual depredations this beautiful creature is daily becoming more scarce and in many countries where once it was common the race is now wholly extinct  when about eight or nine months old their horns begin to appear in the form of two knobs the first year they are without antlers they shed their horns the latter end of autumn and renew them in the winter in which they differ from the stag whose horns fall off in the spring and are renewed in summer  the life of the roebuck seldom exceeds twelve or fifteen years  they are very delicate in the choice of their food and require a large tract of country suited to the wildness of their nature which can never be thoroughly subdued no arts can teach them to be familiar with their keeper nor in any degree attached to him they are easily terrified and in their attempts to escape will run with such force against the walls of their enclosure as sometimes to disable themselves they are likewise subject to capricious fits of fierceness and on these occasions will strike furiously with their horns and feet at the object of their dislike  some years ago one of these animals after being hunted out of scotland through cumberland and various parts of the north of england at last took refuge in the woody recesses bordering upon the banks of the tyne between prudhoe castle and wylam it was frequently seen and hunted but no dogs were equal to its speed it frequently crossed the river and either by swiftness or artifice eluded all its pursuers it happened during the rigor of a severe winter that being pursued it crossed the river upon the ice with some difficulty and being much strained by its violent exertions was taken alive it was kept for some weeks in the house and being again turned out all its cunning and activity were gone it seemed to have forgotten the places of its former retreat and after running some time it lay down in the midst of a brook where it was killed by the dogs  the flesh of the roebuck is fine and well tasted that of the male after the age of two years is hard the flesh of the females though farther advanced in years is more tender when very young it is loose and soft but at the age of eighteen months is in its highest state of perfection  in america this animal is much more common than in europe  in louisiana it is very large the inhabitants live chiefly upon its flesh which is good and well flavoured    the camel possesses the various qualities of the horse the cow and the sheep and is to the arabian in a great measure what those useful creatures are to us its milk is rich and nourishing and being mixed with water makes a wholesome and refreshing beverage much used by the arabs in their journies the flesh of young camels is also an excellent and wholesome food their hair or sleece which falls off entirely in the spring is superior to that of any other domestic animal and is made into very fine stuffs for clothes coverings tents and other furniture  possessed of his camel the arabian has nothing either to want or to fear in one day he can perform a journey of fifty leagues into the desert where he is safe from every enemy for without the aid of this useful animal no person could pursue him amidst sandy deserts where there is neither verdure to refresh nor shade to shelter  where nothing presents itself to the eye but one uniform void naked and solitary  the arabian regards the camel as the most precious gift of heaven by the assistance of which he is enabled to subsist in those frightful intervals of nature which serve him for an asylum and secure his independence but it is not to the plundering arab alone that the services of this useful quadruped are confined  in turkey persia barbary and egypt every article of merchandise is carried by camels merchants and travelers unite together and form themselves into numerous bodies called caravans to prevent the insults of the arabs one of these caravans frequently consists of many thousands the camels being always more numerous than the men each camel is loaded in proportion to his strength at the command of their conductor they lie down on their belly with their legs folded under them and in this posture receive their burden as soon as they are loaded they rise of their own accord and will not suffer any greater weight to be imposed upon them than they can bear with ease when overloaded they set up the most piteous cries till part of the burden be taken off the large camels generally carry a thousand or twelve hundred pounds weight and the smallest from six to seven hundred as the route is often seven or eight hundred leagues their motions and journies are regulated they walk only and in that pace travel ten or twelve leagues each day every night they are unloaded and allowed to pasture upon such herbage as they can find thistles nettles wormwood and the other hard and prickly vegetables which the sandy deserts of arabia produce the camel often prefers to more delicate herbage but the peculiar and distinguishing characteristic of the camel is its faculty of abstaining from water for a greater length of time than any other animal for which nature has made a wonderful provision in giving it besides the four stomachs which it has in common with other ruminating animals a fifth bag serving as a reservoir for water where it remains without corrupting or mixing with the other aliments when the animal is pressed with thirst and has occasion for water to macerate its food while ruminating he makes part of it pass into his stomach by a simple contraction of certain muscles by this singular structure the camel can take a prodigious quantity of water at one draught and is enabled to pass several days without drinking leo africanus says fifteen they can discover water by their smell at half a leagues distance and after a long abstinence will hasten toward it long before their drivers perceive where it lies the feet of the camel are peculiarly adapted to the sandy soil on which he treads on moist or slippery ground he cannot well support himself his hind legs being apt to spread out so wide as to endanger his being disabled  many attempts have been made to introduce this serviceable animal into other countries but as yet none have succeeded the race seems to be confined to certain districts where their utility has been known for ages  though a native of warm climates the camel dreads those which are excessively hot it can neither subsist in the burning heat of the torrid zone nor in the milder air of the temperate it seems to be an original native of arabia for in that country they are not only more numerous but thrive better than in any other part of the world  there are two varieties of this animal which have been distinguished previous to all historical record that which is called the bactrian camel has two hunches on its back and is found chiefly in turkey and the countries of the levant while  the arabian camel or dromedary with only one hunch on its back is common in arabia and all the northern parts of africa from the mediterranean sea to the river niger and is infinitely more numerous and more generally diffused than the camel it is also much swifter and is therefore generally employed on business which requires dispatch  in arabia they are trained for running matches and in many places for carrying couriers who can go above a hundred miles a day on them and that for nine or ten days together over burning deserts uninhabitable by any living creature they require neither whip nor spur to quicken their pace but go freely if gently treated and are much enlivened by singing or the sound of the pipe which gives them fresh spirits to pursue their journey  they are mild and gentle creatures at all times except when they are in heat at that period they are seized with a sort of madness they eat little and will sometimes attempt to bite their masters so that it is not safe to approach them  the camel arrives at its full strength at the age of six years and lives forty or fifty  the females are not usually put to labor but are allowed to pasture and breed at full liberty their time of gestation is near twelve months and they generally bring forth one at a birth  the lama is the camel of peru and chili and before the conquest of those countries by the spaniards was the only beast of burden known to the indians  its disposition is mild gentle and tractable  before the introduction of mules these animals were used by the natives to plow the land and now serve to carry burdens they march slowly and seldom accomplish journies of more than four or five leagues a day but what they want in speed is made up by perseverance and industry they travel long journies in countries impassable to most other animals they are very surefooted and are much employed in transporting the rich ores dug out of the mines of potosi over the rugged hills and narrow paths of the andes bolivar remarks that in his time three hundred thousand of these animals were constantly employed in this work they lie down to be loaded and when weary no blows can excite them to quicken their pace  they neither defend themselves with their feet nor their teeth when angry they have no other method of revenging injuries but by spitting they can throw out their saliva to the distance of ten paces and if it fall on the skin it raises an itching accompanied with a slight inflammation  their flesh is eaten and said to be as good as mutton  like the camel they have the faculty of abstaining long from water sometimes four or five days and like that animals their food is coarse and trifling they are neither allowed corn nor hay green herbage of which they eat very moderately being sufficient for their nourishment  the wild lamas called guanacos are stronger and more active than the domestic kind they live in herds and inhabit the highest regions of the cordelieres they run with great swiftness in places of difficult access where dogs cannot easily follow them the most usual way of killing them is with the gun they are hunted for the sake of their flesh and their hair of the latter the indians make cloth  the lamas vary in color some of them are white others black and others of a mixed color  white gray and russet dispersed in spots in shape they resemble the camel without the dorsal hunch this animal has a wellshaped head rather small and has some resemblance to that of the goat and sheep fine black eyes and a long neck bending much and very protuberant near its junction with the body its ears are four inches long its feet are cloven like those of the ox they are armed behind with a spur by which the animal is enabled to support itself on rugged and difficult ground the height of the lama is about four feet and its length from the neck to the tail six feet  the pacos very much resembles the lama in figure but is much smaller its body is covered with very fine long wool of the color of dried roses or a dull purple the belly is white they live in vast herds and inhabit the most elevated parts of the highest mountains where they endure the utmost rigor of frost and snow they are exceedingly swift and so timid that it is very difficult to come near them  the manner of taking them is singular the indians tie cords with small pieces of wool or cloth hanging from them across the narrow passes of the mountains about three or four feet from the ground they then drive a herd of these animals toward them and they are so terrified by the flutter of the rags that they dare not pass but huddle together and suffer themselves to be killed in great numbers  their wool is a valuable article of commerce and is made into gloves stockings bedcloaths carpets etc  the pacos are domesticated and like the lamas are employed in carrying burdens but cannot bear more than from fifty to seventyfive pounds and are still more subject to capricious fits of obstinacy when once they lie down with their load no blows can provoke them to rise  the great advantages to be derived from the wool of these creatures induced the spaniards to attempt their introduction into europe some of them were brought over to spain but by not sufficiently attending to the necessity of placing them in airy situations to which they had always been accustomed the experiment proved unsuccessful  the hog kind animals of the hog kind seem to possess a middle nature between those that live upon grass and such as are carnivorous and unite in themselves most of those distinctions which are peculiar to each class like the one they are rapacious and fond of blood and do not ruminate like the other they are clovenhoofed live chiefly on vegetables and seldom seek after animal food except when urged by necessity    the wild boar which is the original of all the varieties to be found in this creature is much smaller than those of the domestic kind and does not like them vary in color but is invariably of a brinded or darkgrey inclining to black his snout is longer than that of the tame hog and his ears are short round and black he is armed with formidable tusks in each jaw which serve him for the double purpose of annoying his enemy or procuring his food which is chiefly roots and vegetables some of their tusks are almost a foot long those in the upper jaw bend upwards in a circular form and are exceedingly sharp at the points those of the under jaw are always most to be dreaded for with them the animal defends himself and frequently gives mortal wounds  wild boars are not gregarious but while young live together in families and frequently unite their forces against the wolves or other beasts of prey when likely to be attacked they call to each other with a very loud and fierce note the strongest face the danger and form themselves into a ring the weakest falling into the center in this position few beasts dare venture to engage them but leave them to pursue a less dangerous chase  when the wild boar is arrived at a state of maturity he walks the forest alone and fearless at that time he dreads no single foe nor will he turn out of his way even for man himself he offends no animal at the same time he is furnished with arms which render him a terror to the fiercest  the hunting of the wild boar is a dangerous but common amusement of the great in those countries where it is to be found the dogs chiefly used for this sport are of a slow and heavy kind when the boar is roused he goes slowly forward not much afraid nor very far before his pursuers he frequently turns round stops till the hounds come up and offers to attack them after keeping each other at bay for a while the boar again goes slowly forward and the dogs renew the pursuit in this manner the chase is continued till the boar is quite tired and refuses to go any farther the dogs then attempt to close in upon him from behind and in this attack the young ones being generally the most forward frequently lose their lives the old seasoned dogs keep the animal at bay until the hunters come up who kill him with their spears    the common hog is of all other domestic quadrupeds the most filthy and impure its form is clumsy and disgusting and its appetite gluttonous and excessive in no instance has nature more conspicuously shown her economy than in this race of animals whose stomachs are fitted to receive nutriment from a variety of things that would be otherwise wasted the refuse of the field the garden the barn and the kitchen affords them a luxurious repast  useless during life and only valuable when deprived of it this animal has sometimes been compared to a miser whose hoarded treasures are of little value till death has deprived them of their rapacious owner  the parts of this animal are finely adapted to its mode of living nature has given it a form more prone than that of other animals its neck is strong and brawny its snout is long and callous well calculated for the purpose of turning up the earth for roots of different kinds on which it principally feeds especially in its wild state and it has a quick sense of smelling by which it is enabled to trace out its food it is naturally stupid inactive and drowsy much inclined to increase in fat which is disposed in a different manner from that of other animals and forms a thick and regular coat between the flesh and the skin it is restless at a change of weather and during certain high winds is so agitated as to run violently screaming horribly at the same time it appears to foresee the approach of bad weather as it previously carries straw in its mouth to its sty prepares a bed and seems endeavoring to hide itself from the impending storm  linnaeus observes that the flesh of the hog is a wholesome food for those that use much exercise but bad for such as lead a sedentary life it is of universal use and makes in various ways a constant article in the elegancies of the table it is of great importance to this country as a commercial nation for it takes salt better than any other kind and consequently is capable of being preserved longer it is therefore of great use in ships and makes a principal part of the provisions of the british navy  the domestic sow brings forth twice a year and produces from ten to twenty at a litter she goes four months with young and brings forth in the fifth at that time she must be carefully watched to prevent her from devouring her young still greater attention is necessary to keep off the male as he would destroy the whole litter  the most numerous breed of hogs in this island is that generally known by the name of the berkshire pigs now spread through almost every part of england and some parts of scotland they are in general of a reddishbrown color with black spots upon them have large ears hanging over their eyes are shortlegged smallboned and are readily made fat some of these have been fed to an almost incredible size mr culley in his treatise on live stock gives an account of one that was killed at congleton in cheshire which measured from the nose to the end of the tail three yards eight inches in height it was four feet and a half and weighed after it was killed eightysix stones eleven pounds avoirdupoise  the chinese or black breed are now very common in england they are smaller have shorter legs and their flesh is whiter and sweeter than the common kind  the hog species though very numerous and diffused over europe asia and africa did not exist in america till transported thither by the spaniards in many places they have multiplied exceedingly and become wild they resemble the domestic hog but their bodies are shorter and their snout and skin thicker    the african wild boar or wood swine lives in a wild uncultivated state in the hottest parts of africa it is a very vicious animal and quick in all its motions it is as dangerous to attack one of them as a lion for though much smaller it rushes upon a man as swift as an arrow and throwing him down before he has time to strike with his javelin breaks his legs and at the same instant rips up his belly  it has four tusks two very large ones proceed from the upper jaw and turn upwards like a horn  in length nine inches and full five inches round at the base the two other tusks which come from the lower jaw project but three inches from the mouth these tusks the animal makes use of as the dreadful instruments of his vengeance he will attack a man on horseback if he should venture to come too near him and first breaking the horses legs kills both him and his rider  sparrman describes it as being of a bright yellow color like the domestic kind its nose is broad flat and of a horny hardness its head is very large in proportion to the size of its body underneath each eye it has a great lobe or wattle lying almost horizontally broad flat rounded at the end and placed so as to intercept the view of any thing immediately beneath the animal the ears are large and sharppointed lined on the inside with long whitish hairs its tail is slender and flat when the animal is pursued it always holds it quite erect  they live in holes under ground the avenues to which are exceedingly narrow the natives seldom dare attack them in their retreats as there is always danger of their rushing out unawares when pursued with their young ones it is no uncommon thing to see them take them up in their mouths and run with them in that manner at a great rate  from the shortness of their necks they frequently fall on their knees to feed and change this posture to that of standing with the greatest ease  the flesh of this animal is good and very much resembles that of the common hog    the peccary or mexican hog inhabits the hottest parts of southamerica where the species is very numerous herds consisting of two or three hundred are sometimes to be seen together  it is a very fierce animal and will fight stoutly with beasts of prey when attacked by them the jaguar or american leopard is its mortal enemy and frequently loses its life in engaging a number of these animals they assist each other surround their enemies and often come off victorious  they live chiefly in mountainous places and are not fond of wallowing in the mire like the common hog they feed on fruits roots and feeds they likewise eat serpents toads and lizards and are very dexterous in first taking off the skins with their fore feet and teeth  the peccary in appearance resembles the hog though somewhat smaller its body is covered with strong bristles which when the creature is irritated rise up like the prickles of a hedgehog and are nearly as strong they are of a dusky color with alternate rings of white across the shoulders to the breast there is a band of white its head is short and thick it has two tusks in each jaw its ears are small and erect and instead of a tail it has a small fleshy protuberance which does not cover its posteriors it differs most essentially from the hog as well as every other animal in having a small orifice on the lower part of the back from whence a thin watery humor of a most disagreeable smell flows very copiously in the philosophical transactions dr tyson has described this orifice very minutely as well as some other peculiarities in the conformation of its stomach and intestines  this animal like the hog is very prolific the young ones follow the mother till they are able to provide for themselves if taken at first they are easily tamed and soon lose all their natural ferocity but can never be brought to discover any signs of attachment to those that feed them they do no mischief and may be allowed to run about at pleasure they seldom stray far from home but return of their own accord  when angry they grunt like the hog but much stronger and harsher and when suddenly alarmed make a sharp noise with their breath and erect their bristles  the flesh of the peccary though drier and leaner than that of our hog is by no means disagreeable and may be greatly improved by castration when killed the dorsel gland must be immediately cut off if this operation be deferred for the space of half an hour the flesh becomes utterly unfit to be eaten  although the european hog is common in america and in many parts has become wild the peccary has never been known to breed with it they frequently go together and feed in the same woods but hitherto no intermediate breed has been known to arise from their intercourse  m de la board describes two kinds of this animal  one smaller than the other he relates that being one day engaged with some others in hunting a drove of peccaries they were surrounded by them and obliged to take refuge upon a piece of rock and notwithstanding they kept up a constant fire among them the creatures did not retire till a great number of them were slain  the babiroussa though classed by naturalists with the hog kind differs from animals of that species in a variety of particulars its legs are longer and its body more slender it is covered with short hair as soft as wool and of a darkgrey color mixed with red its ears are short and pointed its tail is long tufted at the end and often twisted its most distinguishing characteristic consists in four large tusks the two stoutest of which proceed like those of the wild boar from the under jaw pointing upwards and standing near eight inches out of the sockets the two others rise up like horns on the outside of the upper jaw just above the nose and extend in a curve above the eyes almost touching the forehead and are twelve inches in length these tusks are of the most beautiful ivory but not so hard as those of the elephant  this animal abounds in several of the islands of the east indies particularly buero a small isle near amboyna  though formidable in appearance it is easily tamed and its flesh is well tasted it lives on leaves of trees and other vegetables its scent is exquisite it can discover the approach of dogs at a distance when closely pursued it plunges into the sea swims and dives with great facility from one island to another and by that means frequently escapes from its pursuers  these animals live in herds and when any number of them are together their odor is so strong that the dogs can scent them at a considerable distance when attacked they growl frightfully and defend themselves with their under tusks the upper ones are only serviceable to them in taking their repose which they do like the elephant by hooking them on the branches of trees    the longnosed tapiir is the hippopotamus of the new world and has by some authors been mistaken for that animal it inhabits the woods and rivers on the eastern side of southamerica from the isthmus of darien to the river of the amazons it is a melancholy animal sleeps during the day and goes out in the night in search of food lives on grass sugarcanes and fruits if disturbed it takes to the water swims with great ease or plunges to the bottom and like the hippopotamus walks there as on dry ground  it is about the size of a small cow its nose is long and slender and extends far beyond the lower jaw forming a kind of proboscis which it can contract or extend at pleasure each jaw is furnished with ten cutting teeth and as many grinders its ears are small and erect its body formed like that of a hog its back arched legs short and hoofs of which it has four upon each foot small black and hollow its tail is very small its hair short and of a duskybrown color  the tapiir is a mild and timid animal declines all hostilities and flies from every appearance of danger its skin of which the indians make bucklers is very thick and when dried is so hard as to resist the impression of an arrow the natives eat its flesh which is said to be very good  the thicknosed tapiir inhabits the same countries with the lastmentioned animal and in disposition and habits seems greatly to resemble it it lives on the banks of great rivers swims and dives remarkably well is very dexterous in catching fish upon which it chiefly subsists it likewise eats grain fruits and sugarcanes feeds mostly in the night and commits great ravages in the gardens they generally keep in large herds and make a horrible noise not much unlike the braying of an ass its flesh is fat and tender but like that of the otter has an oily and fishy taste  this animal which is also called the capibara is about the size of a small hog and by some naturalists has been classed with that animal we have already seen that in disposition and manners it is widely different in other respects its affinity to the hog kind seems to be slight and the characteristic differences many the fore hoofs are divided into four and the hind ones into three its head is large and thick and on the nose there are long whiskers its ears are small and rounded and its eyes large and black there are two large cutting teeth and eight grinders in each jaw and each of these grinders forms on its surface what appears to be three teeth flat at their ends the legs are short the toes long and connected at the bottom with a small web the end of each toe is guarded by a small hoof it has no tail the hair on the body is short rough and of a brown color  this animal is gentle and peaceable easily tamed and will follow those who feed it and treat it kindly  as it runs badly on account of the peculiar construction of its feet its safety consists not in flight nature has provided it with other means of preservation when in danger it plunges into the water dives to a great distance and by that means evades its pursuers    the rhinoceros we are indebted to the labors of many learned and ingenious naturalists for accurate descriptions of this wonderful creature which in size is only exceeded by the elephant and in strength and power is inferior to no other animal bontius says that in the bulk of its body it equals the elephant but is lower only on account of the shortness of its legs  the length of this animal from the extremity of the muzzle to the insertion of the tail is usually twelve feet and the circumference of its body nearly equal to its length its nose is armed with a formidable weapon peculiar to this creature being a very hard and solid horn with which it defends itself from every adversary the tiger will rather attack the elephant whose trunk it can lay hold of than the rhinoceros which it cannot face without danger of having its bowels torn out the body and limbs of the rhinoceros are covered with a skin so hard and impenetrable that he fears neither the claws of the tiger nor the more formidable proboscis of the elephant it will turn the edge of a scimitar and even resist the force of a musketball the skin which is of a blackish color forms itself into large folds at the neck the shoulders and the crupper by which the motion of the head and limbs is facilitated round the neck which is very short are two large folds there is a fold from the shoulders which hangs down upon the fore legs and another from the hind part of the back to the thighs the body is everywhere covered with small tuberosities or knots which are small on the neck and back but larger on the sides the thighs legs and even the feet are full of these incrustations which have been mistaken for scales by some authors they are however only simple indurations of the skin without any uniformity in their figure or regularity in their positions between the folds the skin is penetrable and delicate as soft to the touch as silk and of a lightflesh color the skin of the belly is nearly of the same color and consistency the body of the rhinoceros is long and thick its belly is large and hangs near the ground its legs short round and very strong and its hoofs are divided into three parts each pointing forward the head of this animal is large its ears long and erect and its eyes small sunk and without vivacity the upper lip is long overhangs the lower and is capable of great extension it is so pliable that the rhinoceros can move it from side to side twist it round a stick collect its food or seize with it any thing it would carry to its mouth  the rhinoceros without being ferocious carnivorous or even extremely wild is however totally untractable and rude it seems to be subject to paroxysms of fury which nothing can appease that which emanuel king of portugal sent to the pope in the year      destroyed the vessel in which they were transporting it  like the hog this animal is fond of wallowing in the mire it is a solitary animal loves moist and marshy grounds and seldom quits the banks of rivers  it is found in bengal siam china and other countries of asia in the isles of java sumatra ceylon etc in ethiopia and the country as low as the cape of good hope but in general the species is not numerous and is much less diffused than that of the elephant  the female produces but one at a time and at considerable intervals during the first month the young rhinoceros exceeds not the size of a large dog at the age of two years the horn is not more than an inch long at six years old it is nine or ten inches long and grows to the length of three feet and a half and sometimes four feet the horn is much esteemed by the natives as an antidote against poison as well as a remedy for particular diseases  the rhinoceros feeds on the grossest herbs and prefers thistles and shrubs to soft or delicate pasturage it is fond of the sugarcane and eats all kinds of grain  dr parsons remarks that this animal has an acute and very attentive ear it will listen with a deep and longcontinued attention to any kind of noise and though it be eating lying down or obeying any pressing demands of nature it will raise its head and listen till the noise cease  from the peculiar construction of his eyes the rhinoceros can only see what is immediately before him when he pursues any object he proceeds always in a direct line overturning every obstruction with the horn on his nose he tears up trees raises stones and throws them behind him to a considerable distance  his sense of smelling is so exquisite that the hunters are obliged to avoid being to windward of him they follow him at a distance and watch till he lies down to sleep they then approach with great precaution and discharge their muskets all at once into the lower part of the belly  the rhinoceros is supposed to be the unicorn of holy writ and possesses all the properties ascribed to that animal  rage untameableness great swiftness and immense strength  it was known to the romans in very early times and is handed down to us in some of the works of that celebrated people augustus introduced one into the shows on his triumph over cleopatra  its flesh is eaten and is much relished by the natives of india and africa    the twohorned rhinoceros we have given the figure of this animal from mr sparrman whose authenticity there is every reason to depend upon and who has given a most exact anatomical description of this hitherto undescribed animal of two that were shot he only mentions the size of the smaller of them which was eleven feet and a half long seven feet high and twelve in circumference it was without any folds on the skin which was of an ash color excepting about the groin where it was of a fleshcolors the surface of the skin was scabrous and knotty of a close texture and when dry extremely hard there were no hairs on any part of the body except the edges of the ears and the tip of the tail which were furnished with a few dark bristly hairs about an inch long  the horns of this animal are placed one behind the other in a line with the nose the foremost of them measures about eighteen inches in length and is always the larger of the two it is remarkable that the rhinoceros makes use of the shorter horn only for the purpose of digging up roots which compose great part of its food it being endued with the power of turning the larger horn on one side out of the way the shape of the horns is conical with the tips inclining a little backwards the texture of the lower part is rough and seems as if it consisted of horny fibers the upper part is smooth and plain like those of an ox the feet are round and do not spread much they have three hoofs on each of them which project but little the middle one is the longest the eyes of the rhinoceros are small and sunk into its head in consequence of which it sees indistinctly but its organs of hearing and smelling are very acute at the least noise the creature takes the alarm pricks up its ears and listens with great attention if it happen to catch the scent of any person within a small distance it rushes out with astonishing quickness and it is difficult to avoid the impetuous attack of this powerful animal  it has been generally said of the rhinoceros that its tongue is so hard and rough as to take away the skin and flesh wherever it licks any person that has unfortunately fallen a victim to its fury mr sparrman says however that he thrust his hand into the mouth of one that had just been shot and found the tongue perfectly soft and smooth  from the account of its intestines given us by the same ingenious author we shall just mention the following which will enable our readers to form a more perfect idea of its enormous bulk  the stomach was four feet in length and two in diameter to which was annexed a tube or canal twentyeight feet long and six inches diameter the kidneys were a foot and a half in breadth the heart was a foot and a half long and nearly the same in breadth the liver when measured from right to left was found to be three feet and a half in breadth and two feet and a half deep as it hangs in the animals body when it is in a standing position it had no gallbladder in which it resembles the horse upon opening the stomach the contents of it were found to consist of roots and small branches of trees masticated some of which were as big as the end of a mans finger in the mass there appeared a great quantity of succulent plants as well as some that were harsh and prickly the effluvium arising from this mass was so far from being offensive that it diffused around a very strong and not disagreeable aromatic odor we shall conclude our account of this animal by observing that the cavity which contained the brains was small being barely six inches long and four high and of an oval shape being filled with pease it was found to contain barely one quart a human skull measured at the same time did not require much less than three pints to fill it    the hippopotamus the great difficulties that have always attended a complete investigation of this huge animal have arisen as well from the remoteness of its situation as from its peculiar habits and disposition  though the hippopotamus has been celebrated from the remotest antiquity though the sacred writings mention him under the name of behemoth and though his figure is to be seen engraven on egyptian obelisks and on roman medals yet his history was very imperfectly known to the ancients aristotle says that he has a mane like a horse and hoofs like an ox tusks and tail like a boar that he is of the size of an ass and has the voice of a horse with other things equally absurd  all which pliny has copied and instead of correcting has added to the number of his errors  of the accounts of later writers it is much to be lamented that suitable delineations have not accompanied their accurate descriptions  a general defect by which the study of nature has been much retarded the laborious researches of many learned and ingenious naturalists greatly frustrated and the errors of former times repeatedly copied and multiplied without number  the size of the hippopotamus is nearly equal to that of the elephant it inhabits all the larger rivers of africa from the niger to the cape of good hope but is found in none of the african rivers that run into the mediterranean except the nile and in that part of it only which is in the upper egypt and in the fens and lakes of ethiopia through which that river passes  the head of this animal is enormously large its mouth vastly wide ray says that the upper mandible is moveable like that of a crocodile in each jaw there are four cutting teeth those in the lower jaw point straight forward it has four large tusks the largest which are always in the lower jaw are sometimes above two feet long it is said that the canine teeth are so hard as to emit fire on being struck with steel they are perfectly white and preferable to ivory for making artificial teeth the grinders are square or oblong like those of a man and so large that a single tooth weighs above three pounds the skin is of a dusky color bears a resemblance to that of the rhinoceros but is thicker and is made into whips the tail is near a foot long taper and flatted at the end which is thinly furnished with hairs like bristles its legs are so short that its belly almost touches the ground the hoofs are divided into four parts unconnected by membranes although it is an amphibious animal when alarmed or pursued it takes to the water plunges in and sinks to the bottom where it walks at full ease it often rises to the surface and remains with its head out of the water making a bellowing noise which may be heard at a great distance it feeds during night on the banks of the rivers and sometimes does great damage in the adjacent plantations of rice and other grain it is said likewise that it feeds upon fish but dr sparrman in his account of this animal denies that it seeks any other food than herbs and grass  the hippopotamus is naturally a mild and gentle animal very slow and heavy in its movements upon land but in the water bold and active and when provoked or wounded will rise and attack boats or canoes with great fury dampier says he has known one of these animals sink a boat full of people by biting a hole in the bottom with his great tusks  the method of taking them is by digging pits in the sand in those parts through which the animal passes in his way to the river after he has been feeding  sparrman says that the flesh of the hippopotamus is tender and good that the fat is fine and well tasted and much in request with the colonists at the cape who look upon it as the most wholesome meat that can be eaten the gelatinous part of the feet in particular is accounted a great delicacy the dried tongue of this animal is also considered at the cape as a rare and excellent dish  that author has given an engraving of this animal taken from a young one which he caught at the cape from which ours is copied  the female brings forth one young at a time  scaurus treated the romans with one of these creatures and five crocodiles during his aedileship and exhibited them on a temporary lake augustus produced one in the celebration of his triumph over cleopatra  the elephant of all the creatures that have hitherto been taken into the service of man the elephant is preeminent in the size and strength of his body and inferior to none in sagacity and obedience from time immemorial this animal has been employed either for the purposes of labor of war or of ostentatious parade to increase the grandeur of eastern princes extend their power or enlarge their dominions  the elephant is a native of asia and africa and is not to be found in its natural state either in europe or america from the river senegal to the cape of good hope they are met with in great numbers in this extensive region as they are more numerous than in any other part of the world so are they less fearful of man the savage inhabitants of this dreary country instead of attempting to subdue this powerful animal and render it subservient to their necessities seem desirous only of avoiding its fury  sparrman says that in the country near the cape they are sometimes seen in large herds consisting of many hundreds and thinks it probable that in the more remote and unfrequented parts of that vast country they are still more numerous  they are frequently hunted by the colonists at the cape who are very expert in shooting them and make great advantage of their teeth the largest teeth weigh a hundred and fifty dutch pounds and are sold to the governor for as many guilders so that a man may earn three hundred guilders at one shot it is not therefore to be wondered that a traffic so lucrative should tempt the hunters to run great risks in approaching this animal great care must be taken to steal upon him unperceived if the elephant discovers his enemy near him he rushes out and endeavors to kill him one of these hunters being out upon a plain under the shelter of a few scattered thorn trees thought he should be able to advance near enough to shoot an elephant that was at a little distance from him he was discovered pursued and overtaken by the animal which laid hold of him with his trunk and beat him instantly to death  the height of the elephant at the cape is from twelve to fifteen feet the female is less than the male and her tusks do not grow to such a size  the ears are prodigiously large and marked on the edges with deep incisions they are pendulous except when the animal is irritated at which time he draws them up almost in the form of a purse and points them forward the ear of an elephant shot at the cape was said to reach from the shoulders of a middlesized hottentot to the ground  there are four grinders in each jaw closely united together forming with the jaw bone one hard and compact body one of these grinders sometimes measures nine inches broad and weighs four pounds and a half  the texture of the skin is uneven wrinkled and knotty full of deep fissures nearly resembling the bark of an old oak tree which run in all directions over the surface of it it is of a tawny color inclining to citron in the fissures there are some bristly hairs which are also thinly scattered over the body  the legs of this creature resemble massy columns of fifteen or eighteen inches diameter and from five to six feet high  the foot is short and divided into five toes covered with the skin so as not to be visible to each toe there is affixed a nail or hoof of a horny substance  the most remarkable feature of the elephant is his trunk or proboscis which is composed of membranes nerves and muscles it is both an organ of feeling and of motion the animal cannot only move and bend it but can contract lengthen and turn it in every direction the extremity of the trunk terminates in a protuberance which stretches out on the upper side in the form of a finger and possesses in a great degree the niceness and dexterity of that useful member it is equally flexible and as capable of laying hold of objects as the fingers of a man he lifts from the ground the smallest piece of money he selects herbs and flowers and picks them up one by one he unties the knots of ropes opens and shuts gates etc with his trunk he grasps any body which it is applied to so firmly that no force can tear it from his gripe  of all the instruments which nature has so liberally bestowed on her most favorite productions the trunk of the elephant is perhaps the most complete and the most admirable ray says it is divided into three partitions or chambers two of which run in spiral directions and the other in a right line it is eight feet long in an elephant of fourteen feet high and five feet in circumference at the thickest part the nostrils are situated at the extremity through which it draws in water by a strong suction either for the purpose of quenching its thirst or of washing and cooling itself which it frequently does by taking up a large quantity part of which it carries to its mouth and drinks and by elevating the trunk allows the remainder to run over every part of its body  roots herbs leaves and tender wood are the ordinary food of the elephant it likewise eats grains and fruit but will not eat flesh nor fish when one of them discovers a plentiful pasture he calls to the others and invites them to eat with him as they require a great quantity of forage they frequently change their pasture and do incredible damage whenever they happen to stray on cultivated ground from the weight of their bodies and the size of their feet they destroy much more than they use for food one of them will eat one hundred and fifty pounds of grass in a day so that a troop of these animals lays a whole country waste in a short time the indians and negroes use every artifice to prevent the approach of these unwelcome visitants making loud noises and kindling fires round their habitations but in spite of all their precautions the elephants often break through their fences destroy their whole harvest and overturn their huts it is not easy to separate them they generally act in concert whether they attack march or fly  the ordinary walk of the elephant is not quicker than that of a horse but when pushed he assumes a kind of ambling pace which in fleetness is equal to a gallop he goes forward with ease and celerity but it is with great difficulty that he turns himself round and that not without taking a pretty large circuit it is generally in narrow and hollow places that the negroes attack him and cut off his tail which they value above every other part of his body  he swims well and is of great use in carrying great quantities of baggage over large rivers when swimming he raises his long trunk above the surface of the water for the sake of respiration every other part of his body being below in this manner several of these animals swim together and steer their course without danger of running foul of each other  the elephant when tamed is gentle obedient and docile patient of labor it submits to the most toilsome drudgery and so attentive to the commands of its governor that a word or a look is sufficient to stimulate it to the most violent exertions its attachment to its keeper is so great that it caresses him with its trunk and frequently will obey no other master it knows his voice and can distinguish the tone of command of anger or of approbation and regulates its actions accordingly it receives his orders with attention and executes them with eagerness but without precipitation all its motions are orderly and seem to correspond with the dignity of its appearance being grave majestic and cautious it kneels down for the accommodation of those who would mount upon its back and with its pliant trunk even assists them to ascend it suffers itself to be harnessed and seems to have a pleasure in the finery of its trappings it is used in drawing chariots wagons and various kinds of machines one of these animals will perform with ease the work of many horses  the conductor of the elephant is usually mounted on its neck and makes use of a rod of iron sharp at the end and hooked with which he urges the animal forward by pricking its head ears or muzzle but in general a word from the keeper is sufficient to encourage this intelligent creature to proceed on its way or perform the task assigned to it  in india where they were once employed in launching ships one of them was directed to force a large vessel into the water which proving superior to its strength the master in an angry tone cried out take away that lazy beast and bring another in its place the poor animal instantly redoubled its efforts fractured its skull and died upon the spot  the indians from very early periods have employed elephants in their wars porus opposed the passage of alexander over the hydaspes with eightyfive of these animals m de buffon imagines that it was some of the elephants taken by that monarch and afterward transported into greece which were employed by pyrrhus against the romans  since the invention of firearms the elephant has been of little use in deciding the contests of hostile nations for being terrified with the flash of the powder and the report that immediately succeeds they are soon thrown into confusion and then become dangerous to their employers  they are now chiefly used for the purposes of labor or magnificent parade the indian princes in their travels are attended by hundreds of these animals some are employed to convey the ladies which compose the seraglio in latticed cages made for that purpose and covered with branches of trees whilst others transport immense quantities of baggage with which the sovereigns of the east are always accompanied in their marches from one place to another they are likewise made use of as the dreadful instruments of executing condemned criminals  a task which they perform with great dexterity at the word of command they break the limbs of the criminal with their trunks they sometimes trample him to death or impale him on their enormous tusks just as they are directed by their more barbarous keeper  it is a singular circumstance in the history of this extraordinary animal that in a state of subjection it is unalterably barren and though it has been reduced under the dominion of man for ages it has never been known to breed  as if it had a proper sense of its degraded condition and obstinately refused to increase the pride and power of its conqueror by propagating a race of slaves it therefore follows that of all the numerous bands of these creatures that are trained to service there is not one that has not been originally wild nor one that has not been forced into a state of subjection to recruit therefore the numbers that are unavoidably consumed by disease accident or age the eastern princes are obliged every year to send into the forests and to use various methods to procure fresh supplies  the manner of taking taming and rendering these animals submissive is curious and well deserves a place in the history of the elephant  in the midst of a forest abounding with elephants a large piece of ground is marked out and surrounded with strong palisades interwoven with branches of trees one end of the enclosure is narrow from which it widens gradually so as to take in a great extent of country several thousand men are employed upon the occasion who place themselves in such a manner as to prevent the wild elephants from making their escape they kindle large fires at certain distances and make a dreadful noise with drums and various kinds of discordant instruments calculated for the purpose of stunning and terrifying the poor animals whilst another party consisting of some thousands with the assistance of tame female elephants trained for the purpose drive the wild elephants slowly toward the great opening of the enclosure the whole train of hunters closing in after them shouting and making a great noise till the elephants are driven by insensible degrees into the narrow part of the enclosure through which there is an opening into a smaller space strongly fenced in and guarded on all sides as soon as one of the elephants enters this strait a strong bar closes the passage from behind and he finds himself completely environed on the top of this narrow passage some of the huntsmen stand with goads in their hands urging the creature forward to the end of the passage where there is an opening just wide enough to let him pass he is now received into the custody of two female elephants who stand on each side of him and press him into the service if he is likely to prove refractory they begin to discipline him with their trunks till he is reduced to obedience and suffers himself to be led to a tree where he is bound by the leg with stout thongs made of untanned elk or buck skin the tame elephants are then led back to the enclosure and the others are made to submit in the same manner they are all suffered to remain fast to the trees for several days attendants are placed by the side of each animal who supply him with food by little and little till he is brought by degrees to be sensible of kindness and caresses and allows himself to be led to the stable in the space of fourteen days his absolute submission is completed during that time he is fed daily with cocoanut leaves and led once a day to the water by the tame ones he becomes accustomed to the voice of his keeper and at last quietly resigns his prodigious powers to the dominion and service of man  the time of gestation in this animal is hitherto but imperfectly known aristotle says it goes two years with young which is the more likely as the season of desire in the male returns but once in three years the female produces one young at a time the young elephants are said to suck with their trunk the breasts of the female are situated between its fore legs  this animal is thirty years in arriving at its full growth and is said to live though in a state of captivity to the age of a hundred and twenty or a hundred and thirty years in a state of unrestrained freedom they are supposed to live much longer  the elephant will drink wine and is fond of spiritous liquors by showing him a vessel filled with arrack he is induced to exert the greatest efforts and perform the most painful tasks in hopes of receiving it as the reward of his labor to disappoint him is dangerous as he seldom fails to be revenged the following instance is given as a fact and deserves to be recorded  an elephant disappointed of its reward out of revenge killed his cornac or governor the poor mans wife who beheld the dreadful scene took her two infants and threw them at the feet of the enraged animal saying since you have slain my husband take my life also as well as that of my children the elephant instantly stopped relented and as if stung with remorse took the eldest boy in its trunk placed him on its neck adopted him for its cornac and would never allow any other person to mount it  this animal seems to know when it is mocked and never fails to retaliate accordingly a painter wished to draw the animal in an unusual attitude with its trunk elevated and its mouth open in order to induce the elephant to exhibit to more advantage a person was employed to throw fruit into its mouth who sometimes deceived it by only making an offer of doing so and retaining at the same time the fruit in his hand enraged at this kind of treatment and as it should seem guessing the painter to be the cause it threw out such a quantity of water from its trunk as spoiled his paper and prevented him from proceeding in his work  we might quote many other facts equally curious and interesting those we have already recited are sufficient to show that the elephant is possessed of instinctive faculties superior to those of any other animal we must at the same time admire the admirable order of that dispensation which to an animal of such unequalled powers has added a disposition so mild and tractable what ravages might we not expect from the prodigious strength of the elephant combined with the fierceness and rapacity of the tiger  we cannot close our account of the elephant without taking some notice of the teeth of that animal which have been so frequently found in a fossil state in various parts of the world some years ago two great grindingteeth and part of the tusk of an elephant were discovered at the depth of fortytwo yards in a lead mine in flintshire lying in a bed of gravel the grinders were almost as perfect as if they had been just taken from the animal the tusk was much decayed and very soft  near the banks of many rivers in siberia large tusks and teeth have been frequently dug up which have been attributed to a creature called the mammouth but they are now universally believed to have belonged to the elephant the molares or grinders are perfectly the same with those of the present race but both they and the tusks are much larger some of the latter have been known to weigh four hundred pounds and grinders of the weight of twentyfour pounds have not unfrequently been discovered one of these was taken from a skeleton of the same head in which the tusks were found and as the ivory of the latter was in every respect the same as that generally known and made use of for the purposes of useful and ornamental works we cannot deny our assent to the opinion of those who suppose them to have been once parts of the animals we have just described  tusks of a prodigious size teeth jawbones thighbones and vertebrae have likewise been frequently found on the banks of the rivet ohio in america five or six feet beneath the surface some of the tusks are near seven feet long one foot nine inches in circumference at the base and one foot near the point they differ from those of the elephant in having a larger twist or spiral curve toward the small end there is a still greater difference in the form of the grinders which are made like those of a carnivorous animal not flat and ribbed transversely on their surface like those of an elephant but furnished with a double row of high and conic projections as if intended to masticate not grind their food  specimens of these teeth and bones are deposited in the british museum that of the royal society and in the cabinet of the late ingenious dr hunter  these fossil bones are also found in peru and in the brazils  as yet the living animal has evaded the search of the curious naturalist it is not improbable that it may exist in some of those remote parts of that vast continent yet impenetrated by europeans    animals of the cat kind we have hitherto been employed in the pleasing task of describing most of those numerous tribes of animals that are more nearly connected with the interests of mankind that serve as the instruments of mans happiness or at least that do not openly oppose him that depend upon his care for their subsistence and in their turn contribute largely to his comfort and support we have taken an ample range among the wilder inhabitants of the forest which though in a more remote degree dependant upon man are nevertheless objects of his attention and pursuit we have followed nature to her most retired recesses and have seen and admired her works under a variety of the most beautiful living forms but our progress has hitherto been unstained with blood  the attention of our readers will now be engaged in a different pursuit the scene must be diversified we come now to a sanguinary and unrelenting tribe  the bold and intrepid enemies of man that disdain to own his power and carry on unceasing hostilities against him  this numerous and ferocious tribe is chiefly distinguished by their sharp and formidable claws which are lodged in a sheath and are capable of being extended or drawn in at pleasure they lead a solitary and a ravenous life and never unite for mutual defense or support like those of the herbivorous kinds they seek their food alone and are frequently enemies to each other though differing greatly in size or in color they are nearly allied to each other in form and disposition being equally fierce rapacious and artful  at the head of this numerous class we shall place  the lion which is eminently distinguished from the rest as well in size and strength as by his large and flowing mane  this animal is produced in every part of africa and the hottest parts of asia it is found in the greatest numbers in the scorched and desolate regions of the torrid zone in the deserts of zaara and biledulgerid and in all the interior parts of the vast continent of africa  in these desert regions from whence mankind are driven by the rigorous heat of the climate this animal reigns sole master its disposition seems to partake of the ardour of its native soil inflamed by the influence of a burning sun its rage is most tremendous and its courage undaunted happily indeed the species is not numerous and is said to be greatly diminished for if we may credit the testimony of those who have traversed these vast deserts the number of lions is not nearly so great as formerly mr shaw observes that the romans carried more lions from lybia in one year for their public spectacles than could be found in all that country at this time it is likewise remarked that in turkey persia and the indies lions are not now so frequently met with as in former times  it is observed of this animal that its courage diminishes and its caution and timidity are greater in proportion as it approaches the habitations of the human race being acquainted with man and the power of his arms it loses its natural fortitude to such a degree as to be terrified at the sound of his voice it has been known to fly even before women and children who were found sufficient to drive it away from its lurking places in the neighborhood of their villages  this alteration in the lions disposition sufficiently shows that it will admit of a certain degree of education and it is a wellknown fact that the keepers of wild beasts frequently play with this animal pull out his tongue hold him by the teeth and even chastise him without cause the animal seems to bear all with a sullen kind of composure and rarely retaliates this unmerited treatment it is dangerous however to provoke him too far or to depend upon his temper with too great security labat tells us of a gentleman who kept a lion in his chamber and employed a servant to attend it who as is usual mixed his blows with caresses this illjudged association continued for some time one morning the gentleman was awakened by an unusual noise in his room and drawing his curtains he perceived it to proceed from the lion which was growling over the body of the unhappy man whom it had just killed and had separated his head from his body the terror and confusion of the gentleman may be easily conceived he flew out of the room and with the assistance of some people had the animal secured from doing further mischief  as the passions of this animal are strong and its appetites vehement we ought not to presume that the impressions of education will always be sufficiently powerful it must be dangerous therefore to suffer it to remain too long without food or to persist in irritating or abusing it  however numberless accounts assure us that the anger of the lion is noble its courage magnanimous and its temper susceptible of grateful impressions it has been often seen to despise weak and contemptible enemies and even to pardon their insults when it was in its power to punish them it has been known to spare the life of an animal that was thrown to be devoured by it to live in habits of perfect cordiality with it to share its subsistence and even to give it a preference where its portion of food was scanty  the form of the lion is strikingly bold and majestic his large and shaggy mane which he can erect at pleasure surrounding his awful front his huge eyebrows his round and fiery eye balls which upon the least irritation seem to glow with peculiar luster together with the formidable appearance of his teeth exhibit a picture of terrific grandeur which no words can describe  the length of the largest lion is between eight and nine feet the tail about four feet and its height about four feet and a half the female is about onefourth part less and wants the mane  as the lion advances in years its mane grows longer and thicker the hair on the rest of the body is short and smooth of a tawny color but whitish on the belly  the roaring of the lion is loud and dreadful when heard in the night it resembles distant thunder its cry of anger is much louder and shorter  the lion seldom attacks any animal openly except when compelled by extreme hunger in that case no danger deters him but as most animals endeavor to avoid him he is obliged to have recourse to artifice and take his prey by surprise for this purpose he crouches on his belly in some thicket where he waits till his prey approaches and then with one prodigious spring he leaps upon it at the distance of fifteen or twenty feet and generally seizes it at the first bound if he miss his object he gives up the pursuit and turning back toward the place of his ambush he measures the ground step by step and again lies in wait for another opportunity the lurkingplace of the lion is generally chosen near a spring or by the side of a river where he frequently has an opportunity of catching such animals at come to quench their thirst  there are however instances where the lion deviates from his usual method of taking his prey of which the following related by sparrman is remarkable  a hottentot perceiving that he was followed by a lion and concluding that the animal only waited the approach of night to make him his prey began to consider the best method of providing for his safety which he at length effected in the following singular manner  observing a piece of broken ground with a precipitate descent on one side he sat down by the edge of it and found to his great joy that the lion also made a halt and kept at the same distance as before as soon as it grew dark the hottentot sliding gently forward let himself down a little below the edge of the hill and held up his cloak and hat upon his stick making at the same time a gentle motion with it the lion in the mean while came creeping softly toward him like a cat and mistaking the skin cloak for the man himself made a spring and fell headlong down the precipice by which means the poor hottentot was safely delivered from his insidious enemy  that the lion does not always kill whatever animal happens to be in his power has already been observed and this peculiarity in the temper of this creature is remarkably obvious with regard to the human species of this there have been many instances at st catherine crees church leadenhallstreet london provision is made under the will of sir john gager who was lord mayor in the year      for a sermon to be annually preached on the   th of november in commemoration of his happy deliverance from a lion which he met in a desert as he was traveling in the turkish dominions and suffered him to pass unmolested the minister is to have  0s for the sermon the clerk  s  d and the sexton  s the sum of  l   s  d is likewise to be distributed among the necessitous inhabitants pursuant to the will of sir john  sparrman among several instances of the same nature mentions a person who though he was thrown down by a lion and wounded by it in several places was after all generously left with his life  the strength of this animal is great one of them was observed to seize a heifer which it carried off in its mouth with ease and leaped over a ditch with her without much apparent difficulty  at the cape of good hope the lion is frequently hunted by the colonists in the day time and upon an open plain twelve or sixteen dogs will easily get the better of a large lion as the lion is not remarkably swift the dogs soon come pretty near him when with a sullen kind of magnanimity he turns round and waits for the attack shaking his mane and roaring with a short and sharp tone the hounds surround him and rushing upon him all at once soon tear him to pieces it is said that he has seldom time to make more than two or three strokes with his paws each of which is attended with the death of one of his assailants  the lioness goes with young five months and brings forth three or four at a time the young ones are about the size of a large pug dog harmless pretty and playful they continue at the teat twelve months and are above five years in coming to perfection  the lion is a longlived animal although naturalists have differed greatly as to the precise period of its existence buffon limits it to twenty or twentytwo years at most it is however certain that it lives much beyond that time the great lion called pompey which died in the year    0 was known to have been in the tower above seventy years and one brought from the river gambia died there not long ago at the age of sixtythree  several of these animals have been bred in the tower so that the time of their gestation the number they produce and the time of their arriving at perfection are all pretty well known  the attachment of the lioness to her young is remarkably strong for their support she is more ferocious than the lion himself makes her incursions with greater boldness destroys without distinction every animal that falls in her way and carries it reeking to her cubs she usually brings forth in the most retired and inaccessible places and when afraid of her retreat being discovered endeavors to hide her track by brushing the ground with her tail when much disturbed or alarmed she will sometimes transport her young from one place to another in her mouth and if obstructed in her course will defend them to the last extremity  the flesh of the lion is said to have a strong disagreeable flavor yet it is frequently eaten by the negroes the skin which was formerly a robe of distinction for heroes is now made use of by those people as a mantle or a bed they also preserve the grease which is of a penetrating nature and is used in medicine  the representation we have given was drawn from a remarkably fine one exhibited at newcastle in the year      it was then young exceedingly healthful active and in full condition    the tiger is the most rapacious and destructive of all carnivorous animals fierce without provocation and cruel without necessity its thirst for blood is insatiable though glutted with slaughter it continues its carnage nor ever gives up so long as a single object remains in its sight flocks and herds fall indiscriminate victims to its fury it fears neither the sight nor the opposition of man whom it frequently makes its prey and it is even said to prefer human flesh to that of any other animal  the tiger is peculiar to asia and is found as far north as china and chinese tartary it inhabits mount ararat and hyrcania of old famous for its wild beasts the greatest numbers are met with in india and its islands they are the scourge of the country they lurk among the bushes by the sides of rivers and almost depopulate many places  they seldom pursue their prey but bound upon it from the place of their ambush with an elasticity and from a distance scarcely credible  it is highly probable that from this circumstance the tiger may derive its name which in the armenian language signifies an arrow to the flight of which this creature may very properly be compared in the quickness and agility of its bounds  the strength of this animal is so great that when it has killed an animal whether it be a horse a buffalo or a deer it carries it off with such ease that it seems no impediment to its flight if it be undisturbed it plunges its head into the body of the animal up to its very eyes as if to satiate itself with blood  the tiger is perhaps the only animal whose ferocity can never be subdued neither gentleness nor constraint has any effect in softening its temper it does not seem sensible of the attention of its keeper and would equally tear the hand that feeds with that by which it is chastised  notwithstanding the cruelty of this creatures disposition a sudden check has sometimes had a good effect in preventing its meditated attack some ladies and gentlemen being on a party of pleasure under a shade of trees on the banks of a river in bengal were suddenly surprised at seeing a tiger ready to make its fatal spring one of the ladies with amazing presence of mind laid hold of an umbrella and unfurling it directly in the animals face it instantly retired  another party had not the same good fortune a tiger darted among them whilst they were at dinner seized on a gentleman and carried him off in the sight of his disconsolate companions  they attack all kinds of animals even the lion and furious combats have frequently been maintained between them in which both have perished father tachard gives an account of a battle between a tiger and two elephants at siam of which he was an eyewitness the heads and part of the trunks of the elephants were defended from the claws of the tiger by a covering made for the purpose they were placed in the midst of a large enclosure one of them was suffered to approach the tiger which was confined by cords and received two or three heavy blows from the trunk of the elephant upon its back which beat it to the ground where it lay for some time as if it were dead but though this attack had a good deal abated its fury it was no sooner untied than with a horrible roar it made a spring at the elephants trunk which that animal dexterously avoided by drawing it up and receiving the tiger on its tusks threw it up into the air the two elephants were then allowed to come up and after giving it several heavy blows would undoubtedly have killed it if an end had not been put to the combat  under such restraints and disadvantages we cannot wonder that the issue was unfavourable to the tiger we may however judge of its exceedingly great strength and fierceness  that after being disabled by the first attack of the elephant whilst it was held by its cords it would venture to continue such an unequal engagement  we are happy in being able to present our curious readers with an engraving of this rare animal drawn from the life from a tiger that was exhibited at newcastle in      and was generally allowed to be one of the finest creatures of its kind ever seen in england the beautiful bars of black with which every part of its body was streaked are accurately copied the color of the ground was yellow deeper on the back and softening by degrees toward the belly where it was white as were also the throat and insides of the legs a white space spotted with black surrounded each eye and on each cheek a stripe of the same color extended from the ears to the throat it was nearly the same height as the lion and was of the largest species of the tiger which is called the royal tiger the smallest of them is not above two feet high said to be extremely cunning and delights in human flesh the second kind is about three feet high and is fond of deer wild hogs etc which it frequently takes by the sides of rivers as they come down to quench their thirst  the skin of this animal is much esteemed all over the east particularly in china the mandarins cover their seats of justice with it and during the winter use it for cushions and pillows  we have now described the two great heads of this mischievous family which are eminently distinguished from the rest in size strength and color the three succeeding species have been frequently confounded with each other and although there is some difference in their size and in the disposition of their spots yet these have been so indiscriminately defined as to make it difficult to form a true criterion so as accurately to distinguish each species strikingly similar in the form of their bodies in the beauty of their skins as well as in their dispositions and habits which seem to be equally formed for rapine and cruelty there is great room to conjecture that commixture may be one great cause of producing the slight differences observable in these creatures if we regard the figure and diversity of the spots we shall find many varieties not taken notice of by naturalists if we be led to judge by the size we shall find an almost imperceptible gradation from the cat to the tiger it would be vain therefore to make as many varieties in these animals as we see differences in spots or stature it will be sufficient to point out the most general distinctions    the panther is next in size to the tiger and has by many naturalists been mistaken for that animal  its hair is short and smooth and instead of being streaked like the tiger is beautifully marked on the back sides and flanks with black spots disposed in circles from four to five in each with a single spot in the center on the face breast and legs the spots are single the color of the body on the back and sides is yellow deep on the back and paler toward the belly which is white its ears are short and pointed its eye is restless and its whole aspect fierce and cruel  it is an untameable animal and inhabits africa from barbary to the remotest parts of guinea  its manner of taking its prey is the same with that of the tiger always by surprise either lurking in thickets or creeping on its belly till it comes within reach when pressed with hunger it attacks every living creature without distinction but happily prefers the flesh of brutes to that of mankind it will even climb up trees in pursuit of monkies and lesser animals so that nothing is secure from its attacks  the panther is about the size of a large mastiff dog but its legs are not quite so long its voice is strong and hoarse and it growls continually  the ancients were well acquainted with these animals the romans drew prodigious numbers from the deserts of africa for their public shows sufficient one might suppose to have entirely exhausted them scaurus exhibited an hundred and fifty of them at one time pompey four hundred and ten and augustus four hundred and twenty they probably thinned the coasts of mauritania of these animals but they still swarm in the southern parts of guinea  in china there is a most beautiful animal of this kind called louchu the skin of which sells for six pounds sterling  an animal of this species is likewise found in asiatic tartary called there the babr it is seven feet long extremely rapacious and very destructive of horses and camels its skin is very fine and valued in russia at one pound sterling    the leopard the very trifling difference between this and the lastmentioned animal gives reason to suppose that it consists chiefly in the name it inhabits the same countries and in some places goes by the same name being called the panther of senegal where it is chiefly found it is mentioned by ray as the female panther is rather smaller than that animal its length from nose to tail is about four feet the color of the body is a more lively yellow and the spots with which it is diversified are smaller and closer than those of the panther  the interior parts of africa abound with these animals from whence they come down in great numbers and make dreadful havoc among the numerous herds that cover the plains of the lower guinea when beasts of chase fail they spare no living creature  the negroes take them in pitfalls slightly covered at the top and baited with flesh their chief inducement for pursuing them is their flesh which they eat and is said to be white as veal and well tasted the negresses make collars of their teeth and wear them as charms to which they attribute certain virtues  the skins of these animals are brought to europe where they are greatly esteemed  in india there is a species of this animal about the size of a large greyhound with a small head and short ears its face chin and throat of a palebrown color inclining to yellow the body is of a light tawnybrown marked with small round black spots scattered over the back sides head and legs the inside of the legs plain the hair on the top of the neck is longer than the rest the belly white the tail very long marked on the upper side with large black spots and the hair on the under side is very long  this is the animal mentioned in our account of the antelope which is made use of in india for hunting that and other beasts of the chase  it is carried in a small kind of wagon chained and hoodwinked till it approaches the herd when it is unchained and suffered to pursue the game it begins by creeping along with its belly close to the ground stopping and concealing itself till it get an advantageous situation it then darts on its prey with great agility frequently making five or six amazing bounds if it should not succeed in its first effort it gives up the point for that time and readily returns to its master    the ounce is smaller than the leopard being three feet and a half long from the nose to the tail very strong longbacked and shortlegged the hair is long and of a lightgrey color tinged with yellow lighter on the breast and belly the head is marked with small round spots behind each ear there is a large black spot the back is beautifully varied with a number of oval figures formed by small spots almost touching each other the spots on the sides are more irregular those on the legs and thighs small and thinly dispersed the tail is full of hair irregularly marked with large black spots and upwards of three feet long  this animal is common in barbary persia and china is much more gentle than the leopard and like the hunting leopard is trained to the chase it is often used in hunting antelopes and even hares instead of being conveyed in a wagon it is carried on the crupper of the horse is as much under command as a setting dog returns at a call and jumps up behind its master  the scent of the ounce is not so fine as that of the dog it neither follows animals by their foot nor is it able to overtake them in a continued chase it hunts solely by the eye and makes only a few springs at its prey it is so nimble as to clear a ditch or a wall of many feet it often climbs trees to watch animals that are passing and suddenly darts upon them  it is supposed to be the lesser panther of oppian and the panthera of pliny  the jaguar is the most formidable animal of the new continent rather larger than the panther with hair of a brighttawny color the top of the back is marked with long stripes of black the sides beautifully variegated with irregular oblong spots open in the middle the tail not so long as that of the ounce irregularly marked with large black spots  it is found in the hottest parts of southamerica is a very fierce animal and when pressed with hunger will sometimes venture to seize a man  the indians are much afraid of it and think it prefers them to the white inhabitants who perhaps are better prepared to repel its attacks  in traveling through the deserts of guiana they light great fires in the night of which these animals are much afraid  they howl dreadfully their cry which is expressive of the two monosyllables  hou hou is somewhat plaintive grave and strong like that of an ox  the anteater though it has no teeth to defend itself with is the most cruel enemy the jaguar has to encounter as soon as the jaguar attacks this little animal it lies down on its back and with its long claws seizes and suffocates him  the couguar inhabits the continent of america and is called by some the puma or american lion but differs so much from that noble animal as not to admit of any degree of comparison  its head is small it has no mane its length from nose to tail is five feet three inches the tail two feet long the predominant color of this animal is a lively red mixed with black especially on the back where it is darkest its chin throat and all the inferior parts of its body are whitish its legs are long claws white the outer claw of the fore feet much longer than the others  it is found in many parts of north america from canada to florida it is also common in guiana brazil and mexico  this animal is fierce and ravenous in the extreme and will swim rivers to attack cattle even in their enclosures in north america its fury seems to be subdued by the rigor of the climate for it will fly from a dog in company with its master and take shelter by running up a tree  it is very destructive to domestic animals particularly to hogs it preys also upon the moose and other deer lies lurking upon the branch of a tree till some of these animals pass underneath when it drops down upon one of them and never quits its hold till it has drunk its blood it will even attack beasts of prey in the museum of the royal society is preserved the skin of one of these animals which was shot just as it had seized a wolf  when it is satisfied with eating it conceals the rest of the carcass covering it carefully with leaves  it purrs like a cat and sometimes howls dreadfully  the fur is soft and is used by the indians for a winter habit when dressed it is made into gloves and shoes the flesh is white and by the natives reckoned very good  the couguar when brought into captivity is almost as gentle as the domestic cat allows itself to be caressed and will permit boys to mount on its back  it is sometimes called the poltron tiger  the black tiger this animal seems to be only a variety of the former differing chiefly in the color which is dusky sometimes spotted with black but generally plain the throat belly and inside of the legs are of a paleash color the upper lip white covered with long whiskers above each eye it has very long hairs and at the corner of the mouth a black spot its paws are white and its ears sharp and pointed  this animal grows to the size of a heifer of a year old and has great strength in its limbs  it inhabits brazil and guiana is a cruel and fierce animal much dreaded by the indians but fortunately the species is not numerous  m de la board in his description of these animals says that they frequent the seashore and eat the eggs deposited there by the turtles they likewise eat caimans or alligators lizards and fishes and sometimes the buds and tender leaves of the indian fig they are excellent swimmers in order to catch the alligator they lie down on their belly at the edge of the river strike the water to make a noise and as soon as the alligator raises its head above the water dart their claws into its eyes and drag it on shore  the ocelot of all spotted animals the skin of the male ocelot is the most beautiful and the most elegantly variegated its general color is that of a brighttawny a black stripe extends along the top of the back from head to tail its forehead is spotted with black as are also its legs its shoulders sides and rump are beautifully marbled with long stripes of black forming oval figures filled in the middle with small black spots its tail is irregularly marked with large spots and black at the end  the ocelot very much resembles the common cat in the form of its body although it is a great deal larger buffon makes its height two feet and a half and about four feet in length  the colors of the female are not so vivid as those of the male nor the marks so beautifully formed  the ocelot is a native of southamerica inhabits mexico and brazil is a very voracious animal but timid and seldom attacks men it is afraid of dogs and when pursued flies to the woods  this creature lives chiefly in the mountains where it conceals itself amongst the leaves of trees from whence it darts upon such animals as come within its reach it sometimes extends itself along the boughs as if it were dead till the monkies tempted by their natural curiosity approach within reach of its paws when it seizes and kills them  it is said to prefer the blood of animals to their flesh it must therefore destroy great numbers as instead of satisfying its hunger by devouring them it only quenches its thirst by drinking their blood  the ocelot is not easy to be tamed and retains its original wildness in a state of captivity nothing can soften the natural ferocity of its disposition nor calm the restlessness of its motions for this reason it is always kept in a cage  one of these animals shown at newcastle in      although extremely old exhibited great marks of ferocity it was kept closely confined and would not admit of being caressed by its keeper in the same manner as the lion but growled constantly and always appeared in motion  a male and female ocelot were brought to france some years ago which had been taken when very young at the age of three months they became so strong and fierce as to kill a bitch that was given them for a nurse when a live cat was thrown to them they sucked its blood but would not taste its flesh the male seemed to have a great superiority over the female as he never allowed her to partake till his own appetite was satisfied  the female ocelot like all the larger animals of the cat kind produces a small number at a time the two above mentioned were the only young ones found with the mother which was killed at the time they were taken and makes it probable that they bring forth only that number  the margay is another beautiful animal of the spotted kind and known in many phces by the name of the tiger cat  the ground color of the body is tawny the face is striped with black the body is marked with stripes and large spots of black the breast and insides of the legs are white spotted with black the tail is long marked with alternate spots of black tawny and gray  the margay is smaller than the ocelot and about the size of the wild cat which it resembles in disposition and habit living on small animals birds etc it is very wild and untameable and cannot easily be brought under subjection  its colors vary though they are generally such as have been described  it is common in guiana brazil and various parts of southamerica  it is called the cayenne cat and is not so frequent in temperate as in warm climates  in taking a survey of this beautiful race of animals we are unavoidably led to observe that much remains for the laborious researches of the natural historian before a complete account can be made out of the various kinds of which it is composed several species are frequently found in the east indies in the woods near the cape of good hope and in the continent of america but in general these have been so negligently or so injudiciously mentioned as to render it impossible to form a perfect description of them  a good history of these animals is one of the many desiderata of the naturalist but when we consider the great distance which most of this ferocious tribe observe in their separation from mankind and the dangers that must be encountered in approaching their solitary habitations we are obliged to lament that this desirable object is not likely to be soon accomplished    the serval this beautiful animal inhabits the mountainous parts of india and is called by the natives of malabar the marapute  it is larger than the wild cat its general color is a paleyellow white on the breast and belly variegated with round spots which are equally distributed over every part of its body its eyes are extremely brilliant and have a wild piercing look its whiskers are long and stiff its tail short and its feet are armed with long hooked claws  this creature is seldom to be seen upon the ground but lives chiefly in trees where it makes its nest and breeds its young it feeds on young birds and leaps with great agility from tree to tree it is extremely fierce but avoids mankind unless provoked when it darts furiously upon the offender and tears and bites nearly in the same manner as the panther  sparrman mentions an animal of this kind found at the cape of good hope which he calls the tiger cat and supposes to be the same with the serval the same author mentions another animal of this kind called at the cape the wild red cat the skin of which is supposed by the natives to possess great medicinal powers and give ease to persons afflicted with the gout lumbago and pains in the joints the hairy side must be worn next the part affected the fur of this animal is very fine and soft and probably there are many other skins which if applied with an equal degree of good faith might have the same salutary effects  the color of the upper part of this creature is of a very brightred toward the sides it is mixed with white and gray the belly is white the upper part of the ears which have tufts of hair on their tips is darkbrown sprinkled with gray the body of this animal is long and about two feet in height  the wild cat the history of this animal is so intimately connected with that of the common or domestic kind that we shall include our account of both under one general head and describe them as constituting the same species  the domestic cat if suffered to escape into the woods becomes wild and lives on small birds and such other game as it can find there it likewise breeds with the wild one it is no uncommon thing for females of the tame species to quit their houses during the time they are in season go in quest of male wild cats and return home to the same habitations impregnated by them it is by this means that some of our domestic cats so perfectly resemble those of the wild breed  the hair of the wild cat is soft and fine of a paleyellow color mixed with gray a dusky list runs along the middle of the back from head to tail the sides are streaked with gray pointing from the back downwards the tail is thick and marked with alternate bars of black and white it is larger and stronger than the tame cat and its fur much longer  this animal inhabits the most mountainous and woody parts of this island living in trees and hunting for birds and small animals such as rabbits hares rats mice moles etc it frequently makes great havoc among poultry will even kill young lambs kids and fawns and is the fiercest and most destructive beast of prey in this kingdom  it is taken either in traps or by shooting there is frequently danger in the latter mode for if it be only slightly wounded it will attack the person who has injured it and in that case is not easily repelled  wild cats are found with very little variety in almost every climate they existed in america before its discovery by the europeans one of them was brought to columbus which was of the ordinary size of a brownishgrey color with a long tail  they are common in many places of asia and africa sparrman gives a description of one which he shot at the cape which was in every respect similar to those of this country it was of a gray color and measured from the nose to the tail nearly twentytwo inches the tail was thirteen inches long its height was about a foot and a half its intestines were full of moles and rats  some wild cats have been taken in this kingdom of a most enormous size we recollect one having been killed in the county of cumberland which measured from its nose to the end of its tail upwards of five feet  the province of chorazan in persia is particularly famous for a most beautiful cat about the size of the tame one of a fine gray color without any mixture and as soft and shining as silk it is darker on the back softening by degrees toward the breast and belly where it is almost white the tail is long and covered with hair five or six inches in length the animal frequently turns it upon its back like a squirrel the point of it resembling a plume of feathers  the cat of angora differs greatly from the wild cat in having much longer hair especially about the neck where it forms a fine ruff and gives the creature a lionlike appearance some of these are of a silvery whiteness and silky texture others are of a dun color mixed with yellow    the domestic cat may be said to be only a variety of the wild cat the principal difference being in its size which is less and instead of being uniformly the same is distinguished by an infinite variety of shades and coloring  to describe an animal so well known might seem a superfluous task we shall only therefore select such of its peculiarities as are least obvious and may have escaped the notice of inattentive observers  it is generally remarked that cats can see in the dark but though this is not absolutely the case yet it is certain that they can see with much less light than most other animals owing to the peculiar structure of their eyes the pupils of which are capable of being contracted or dilated in proportion to the degree of light by which they are affected the pupil of the cat during the day is perpetually contracted and it is with difficulty that it can see by a strong light but in the twilight the pupil resumes its natural roundness the animal enjoys perfect vision and takes advantage of this superiority to discover and surprise its prey  the cry of the cat is loud piercing and clamorous and whether expressive of anger or of love is equally violent and hideous its call may be heard at a great distance and is so well known to the whole fraternity that on some occasions several hundred cats have been brought together from different parts invited by the piercing cries of distress from a suffering fellow creature they assemble in crowds and with loud squalls and yells express their horrid sympathies they frequently tear the miserable object to pieces and with the most blind and furious rage fall upon each other killing and wounding indiscriminately till there is scarcely one left these terrible conflicts happen only in the night and though very rare instances of very furious ones are well authenticated  the cat is particularly averse to water cold and bad smells it is fond of certain perfumes but is more particularly attracted by the smell of valerian marum and catmint it rubs itself against them and if not prevented from coming at them in a garden where they are planted would infallibly destroy them  the cat brings forth twice and sometimes thrice a year the period of her gestation is fiftyfive or fiftysix days and she generally produces five or six at one litter she conceals her kittens from the male lest he should devour them as he is sometimes inclined and if apprehensive of being disturbed will take them up in her mouth and remove them one by one to a more secure retreat even the female herself contrary to the established law of nature which binds the parent to its offspring by an almost indissoluble tie is sometimes known to eat her own young the moment after she has produced them  though extremely useful in destroying the vermin that infest our houses the cat seems little attached to the persons of those that afford it protection it seems to be under no subjection and acts only for itself all its news are confined to the place where it has been brought up if carried elsewhere it seems lost and bewildered neither caresses nor attention can reconcile it to its new situation and it frequently takes the first opportunity of escaping to its former haunts frequent instances are in our recollection of cats having returned to the place from whence they had been carried though at many miles distance and even across rivers when they could not possibly have any knowledge of the road or situation that would apparently lead them to it  this extraordinary faculty is however possessed in a much greater degree by dogs yet it is in both animals equally wonderful and unaccountable  in the time of hoel the good king of wales who died in the year     laws were made as well to preserve as to fix the different prices of animals among which the cat was included as being at that period of great importance on account of its scarcity and utility the price of a kitten before it could see was fixed at one penny till proof could be given of its having caught a mouse twopence after which it was rated at fourpence which was a great sum in those days when the value of specie was extremely high it was likewise required that it should be perfect in its senses of hearing and seeing should be a good mouser have its claws whole and if a female be a careful nurse if it failed in any of these good qualities the seller was to forfeit to the buyer the third part of its value  if any one should steal or kill the cat that guarded the princes granary he was either to forfeit a milch ewe her fleece and lamb or as much wheat as when poured on the cat suspended by its tail its head touching the floor would form a heap high enough to cover the tip of the former  from hence we may conclude that cats were not originally natives of these islands and from the great care taken to improve and preserve the breed of this prolific creature we may suppose were but little known at that period  whatever credit we may allow to the circumstances of the wellknown story of whittington and his cat it is another proof of the great value set upon this animal in former times    the lynx differs greatly from every animal of the cat kind we have hitherto described its ears are long and erect tufted at the end with long black hairs by which this species of animals is peculiarly distinguished the hair on the body is long and soft of a redash color marked with dusky spots which differ according to the age of the creature sometimes they are scarcely visible its legs and feet are very thick and strong its tail short and black at the extremity its eyes are of a paleyellow color and its aspect softer and less ferocious than that of the panther or the ounce the skin of the male is more spotted than that of the female  the fur of this creature is valuable for its softness and warmth and is imported in great quantities from america and the north of europe the farther north they are taken the whiter they are and the spots more distinct the most elegant of those is called the irbys and is taken near lake balkash in usbec tartary its skin sells in that country for one pound sterling  the color of its hair changes with the climate and the season the winter furs are richer and more beautiful than those taken in summer  the lynx is said to be very longlived is a very destructive animal lives by hunting and pursues its prey to the tops of the highest trees it feeds on weasels ermines squirrels etc which are unable to escape it it watches the approach of the fallowdeer hare and other animals and darts upon them from the branches of trees where it lies concealed seizes the animals by the throat and drinks their blood after which it abandons them and goes in quest of fresh game  its sight is remarkably quick and it sees its prey at a great distance  it often eats no more of a sheep or a goat than the brain the liver and the intestines it will sometimes dig under the doors to gain admission into the sheepfold  when attacked by a dog it lies down on its back strikes desperately with its claws and frequently obliges its assailant to retreat  although the lynx has nothing in common with the wolf it has been distinguished by the name of lupuscervarius or the stagwolf its manner of howling is similar to that of the wolf and when heard at a distance is not easily distinguished from the cry of that animal the epithet cervarius has been added because its skin is variegated with spots like that of a young stag  a variety of this animal is found in the inner parts of the province of new york it is called the bay lynx and is about twice the size of a large cat its hair is short and smooth its general color is a brightbay obscurely marked with dusky spots on its face there are black stripes pointing downward toward the nose on each side of the upper lip it has three rows of small black spots with long whiskers issuing from them each cheek is marked with long black stripes of a circular form proceeding from the corners of the eyes the under part of the body and insides of the legs are white the inside of each fore leg is marked on the upper part with two black bars its tail which is short is marked with bars of a dusky color and at the end with one of a deepblack the tip and under side are white  the lynxes of our days must be very different animals from those which have been described by poets as drawing the chariot of bacchus for beside the impracticability of training these animals to the yoke we find that the lynx is not an inhabitant of india or of any of the warmer countries of asia conquered by that hero it prefers cold to even temperate climates and is common in the forests of the northern parts of europe asia and america  the ancients seem to have given the name of lynx to an animal which existed only in imagination and may be ranked with their other ideal monsters and prodigies  the sphynx the pegasus and the unicorn  its sight was said to penetrate the most opaque bodies and its urine to be converted into a precious stone    the caracal resembles the lynx in size figure and aspect as well as in having its ears tipped with a pencil of black hairs  it differs from the lastmentioned animal in not being spotted its hair is rougher and of a pale reddishbrown its tail is longer and of an uniform color its face is more lengthened its look more fierce and its nature and disposition more savage  this animal is found only in warm climates and is common in persia india barbary and in all the countries inhabited by the lion the panther and the ounce  it is called in persia the syahgush and in the turkish language the karrahkulak both these names signify the cat with black ears  it is said to follow the lion and to feed on the remains which that animal leaves of his prey for which reason it is called among the arabs the lions guide  the caracal is about the size of a fox but much stronger and more ferocious it has been known to attack a hound and instantly tear it to pieces  this animal is extremely difficult to tame but when taken young and reared with great caution it may be trained to the chase  it is used in pursuing the smaller sort of animals in which it is very successful but it is active only in the pursuit of animals that are too feeble for resistance or too timid to exert their powers whenever it meets with one that is superior to it in strength it loses its courage and gives up the chase  it is likewise employed in catching birds such as cranes pelicans peacocks etc which it surprises with singular address when it has seized its prey it holds it fast in its mouth and lies upon it for some time quite motionless  there are some varieties in this animal the face of the nubian caracal is rounder the ears black on the outside interspersed with silvercoloured hairs on the breast belly and insides of the thighs there are small brightyellow spots and it has the mule cross on the withers like most of the barbary caracals  in lybia there are caracals with white ears tufted at the end with thin black hairs they have white tails the extremities of which are surrounded with four black rings and on the hind part of each leg there are four black spots they are smaller than the other caracals not exceeding the size of a domestic cat  we have now gone through all the principal varieties which constitute this numerous race in all of which as has been already observed from the lion to the common cat we may perceive a striking similitude in disposition form and manners this agreement is likewise observable in their internal conformation which is still more exact  in the shortness of their intestines the sharpness and number of their teeth and in the structure of their feet and claws they are all equally carnivorous and tear rather than chew their meat they eat slowly and growl whilst they feed as if afraid of losing their prey they are all cowardly and seldom make an attack but where conquest is certain  animals of this race may be considered as the most formidable enemies of mankind there are others more powerful but their dispositions are milder and they seldom offend till they find themselves injured others are more numerous but they are weaker and find their safety not in opposing but in flying from man these are the only quadrupeds that in any degree make good their ground against him and maintain a kind of divided sway over many fair and fertile tracts that seem in other respects formed for the comfort and convenience of social life    animals of the weasel kind these little active and enterprizing animals are particularly distinguished from other carnivorous kinds by the length and slenderness of their bodies which are admirably adapted to their manner of living and methods of taking their prey they are so small and flexible as to wind like worms into very small crevices and openings whither they easily follow the little animals that serve them for food  all the animals of this kind are furnished with small glands placed near the anus from which an unctuous matter continually exudes the effluvia of it is extremely offensive in the polecat ferret weasel badger etc but in the civet cat martin and pine weasel it is an agreeable perfume they are all equally marked for rapine and cruelty they subsist only by theft and find their chief protection in their minuteness they are all from the shortness of their legs slow in pursuit and make up that deficiency by patience assiduity and cunning  as their prey is precarious they can live a long time without food when they fall in with plenty they immediately kill every thing within their reach before they begin to satisfy their appetite and always suck the blood of every animal they kill before they eat any of its flesh  these are the principal peculiarities common to this kind all the species of which have so striking a resemblance to each other that having seen one we may form a very just idea of all the rest  the most obvious difference consists in their size we shall therefore begin with the smallest of this numerous class and proceed gradually upwards to the largest  the weasel the length of this animal does not exceed seven inches from the nose to the tail which is only two inches and a half long and ends in a point its height is not above two inches and a half so that it is nearly five times as long as it is high  the most prevailing color of the weasel is a pale reddishbrown on the back sides and legs the throat and belly are white beneath the corners of the mouth on each jaw is a spot of brown it has whiskers like a cat its ears are large and have a fold at the lower part that gives them the appearance of being double its eyes are small round and black its teeth are thirtytwo in number and extremely sharp  the weasel is very common and well known in most parts of this country is very destructive to young birds poultry rabbits etc and is a keen devourer of eggs which it sucks with great avidity it will follow a hare which is terrified into a state of absolute imbecility at the sight of this little animal and gives itself up to it without resistance making at the same time the most piteous outcries  the bite of the weasel is generally fatal it seizes its prey near the head and fixes its sharp teeth into a vital part a hare rabbit or any other small animal bit in this manner is never known to recover but lingers for some time and dies the wound is so small that the place where the teeth enter can scarcely be perceived  it is remarkably active and will run up the sides of a wall with such facility that no place is secure from it  this creature is a friend to the farmer and much encouraged by him during winter it frequents his barns outhouses and granaries which it effectually clears of rats and mice it is indeed a more deadly enemy to them than even the cat itself for being more active and slender it pursues them into their holes and kills them after a short resistance it creeps also into pigeon holes and destroys the young ones catches sparrows and all kinds of small birds and when it has brought forth its young it hunts with still greater boldness and avidity  in summer it ventures at a distance from its usual haunts is frequently found by the side of waters near cornmills and is almost sure to follow wherever a swarm of rats has taken possession of any place  the evening is the time when this animal begins its depredations toward the close of the day it may frequently be seen stealing from its hole and creeping about the farmers yard in search of its prey if it enter the place where poultry are kept it seldom attacks the cocks or the old hens but always aims at the young ones it does not eat its prey on the spot where it has killed it but where it is not too large carries it away to its retreat it also breaks and sucks all the eggs it can meet with and not unfrequently kills the hen that attempts to defend them  the weasel is a wild and untractable little animal when kept in a cage for the purpose of amusement or inspection it seems in a continual state of agitation is terrified at the sight of every person that approaches to look at it and hides itself in the wool or hay which is given to it for that purpose  it conveys all its food to its hiding place and will not touch it till it begin to putrefy it passes the greatest part of the day in sleeping and usually employs the night in exercise and eating  the female brings forth in the spring and generally produces four or five at one litter she prepares a bed for them of straw leaves and moss the young are brought forth blind but very soon acquire strength enough to follow their dam and assist in her excursions they will attack serpents waterrats moles fieldmice etc they overrun the meadows and frequently kill the partridges and suck their eggs  the motion of the weasel consists of unequal and precipitant leaps and in climbing a tree it makes a considerable spring of some feet from the ground it jumps in the same manner upon its prey and being extremely limber evades the attempts of much stronger animals to seize it  we are told that an eagle having seized a weasel mounted into the air with it and was soon after observed to be in great distress its little enemy had extricated itself so far as to be able to bite it severely in the throat which presently brought the eagle to the ground and gave the weasel an opportunity of escaping  notwithstanding the wildness of this animals nature there are not wanting instances to prove that it is capable of being thoroughly tamed m buffon who asserted the impossibility of bringing the weasel into any degree of subjection is afterward corrected by a lady who assures him that she had tried the experiment upon a young weasel taken in her garden which soon learned to recognize and lick the hand from which it received its food and became as familiar caressing and frolicsome as a dog or a squirrel  the same author mentions another experiment made by a gentleman who trained a young weasel so completely that the animal followed him wherever he went  the method of taming them is to stroke them gently over the back and to threaten and even to beat them when they bite  these facts may serve to show the possibility of rendering this animal domestic and hold out a useful hint to us that its services might be very great in clearing ships granaries and other places from the vermin with which they are frequently infested for it is very well known that one of these animals will kill more rats and mice than any cat being better able to pursue them into their holes and lurkingplaces  the odor of the weasel is very strong especially in the summer time or when it is irritated or pursued it is then intolerable and may be smelt at some distance  the following circumstance related by buffon will show that this animal has a natural attachment to every thing that is corrupt  a weasel was taken in his neighborhood with three young ones out of the carcass of a wolf that had been hung on a tree by the hind feet the wolf was almost entirely putrefied and the weasel had made a nest of leaves and herbage for her young in the thorax of the putrid carcass    the stoat the difference in shape between this animal and the weasel is so small that they have frequently been described under the same denomination the small stoat being sometimes mistaken for a weasel  the length of the former is about ten inches the tail five inches and a half very hairy and tipped with black at the end the edges of the ears and the ends of the toes are of a yellowishwhite in other respects it perfectly resembles the weasel in color as well as form  in the most northern parts of europe this animal regularly changes its color in winter and becomes perfectly white except the end of the tail which remains invariably black it is then called the ermine and is much sought after for its valuable fur which makes a considerable article of commerce in norway lapland russia and other cold countries where they are found in prodigious numbers they are also very common in kamtschatka and siberia where they are taken in traps baited with flesh the skins are sold in the country for from two to three pounds sterling per hundred  in norway they are either shot with blunt arrows or taken in traps made of two flat stones one being propped up with a stick to which is fastened a baited string and as soon as the animal begins to nibble the stone falls down and crushes it to death  the stoat is likewise found white in the winter time in great britain and is then erroneously called a white weasel its fur however among us is of little value having neither the thickness the closeness nor the whiteness of those which come from siberia  one of these animals that we had in our possession had entirely assumed its winter robe but with a considerable mixture of yellow especially on the top of the head and back  they begin to change from brown to white in november and resume their summer vesture in march  the natural history of this animal is much the same with that of the weasel its food being young birds rabbits mice etc its agility the same and its scent equally fetid    the ferret this animal is only known to us in a kind of domestic state it is originally a native of africa from whence according to strabo it was brought into spain and from its known enmity to the rabbit was made use of to reduce the numbers of them with which that kingdom abounded it has since been employed for the same purpose in various parts of europe but as it is not able to bear the severity of a cold climate it cannot subsist without great care and shelter it is usually kept in a box with wool of which it makes itself a warm bed it sleeps a great part of the day and the moment it awakes seems eager for its food which is commonly bread and milk  the ferret breeds twice a year the female goes six weeks with young some of them devour their offspring as soon as they are brought forth when they immediately come in season again and have three litters which generally consist of five or six but sometimes seven or eight and even nine  it is apt to degenerate in this country and lose in some degree its ferocity warreners are therefore obliged to procure an intercourse between the female and the foumart the produce is a breed of a much darker color than the ferret partaking more of that of the foumart  the length of this animal is about fourteen inches that of the tail five its nose is sharper than that of the weasel or the foumart its ears are round and its eyes red and fiery the color of the whole body is a very paleyellow  the ferret is naturally such an enemy to the rabbit that if a dead rabbit be laid before a young ferret it instantly seizes upon it although it has never seen one before if a living rabbit be presented to it the ferret is still more eager seizes it by the neck winds itself round it and continues to suck its blood till it be satiated  when employed in the business of the warren it must be muzzled that it may not kill the rabbits in their holes but only oblige them to come out that the warrener may catch them in his nets if the ferret be suffered to go in without a muzzle or should disengage itself from it whilst in the hole there is great danger of losing it for after satisfying itself with blood it falls asleep and it is then almost impossible to come at it  the most usual methods of recovering the ferret are by digging it out or smoking the hole if these do not succeed it continues during the summer among the rabbit holes and lives upon the prey it finds there but being unable to endure the cold of the winter is sure to perish  the ferret though easily tamed is soon irritated  its odor is fetid its nature voracious it is tame without attachment and such is its appetite for blood that it has been known to attack and kill children in the cradle  when angry it is apt to bite and the wound is difficult to cure  the madagascar weasel or vansire of m buffon may be referred to this species to which its size and form are strikingly similar it is about fourteen inches in length the hair is of a darkbrown color mixed with black it differs from the ferret in the number of its grinding teeth which amount to twelve whereas in the ferret there are but eight the tail is longer than that of the ferret and better furnished with hair  the same author mentions another animal of this species under the name of the nems which is a native of arabia it resembles our ferret in every thing but the color which is that of a darkbrown mixed with white the belly is of a brightyellow color without any mixture the prevailing color on the head and round the eyes is a clear yellow on the nose cheeks and other parts of the face where the hair is short a tincture of brown more or less prevails and terminates gradually above the eyes the legs are covered with short hair of a deepyellow color on each foot there are four toes and a small one behind the claws are small and black the tail which is more than double the length of that of our ferret is very thick at its origin terminates in a point and is covered with long hair similar to that on the body    the foumart so called from its offensive smell as well as to distinguish it from the martin to which it bears a strong resemblance it is likewise called the polecat or fitchet and is the putois of m buffon and the putorius of ray  the length of this animal is about seventeen inches exclusive of the tail which is six inches long the ears are short broad and tipped with white on their edges it is white about the mouth the rest of the body is for the most part of a deepchocolate color the sides are covered with hairs of two colors the ends being dark like the rest of the body and the middle of a fulltawny color  the shape of this animal like all others of this genus is long and slender the nose sharppointed and the legs short the toes are long and the claws sharp it is in every respect admirably formed for that peculiar mode of life assigned to it by the allwise author of nature  it is a very active and nimble little animal runs very fast and will creep up the sides of walls with great agility in running its belly seems to touch the ground in preparing to jump it arches its back and makes its spring with great force  it is very destructive to poultry pigeons and young game of all kinds it makes great havoc amongst rabbits and its thirst for blood is so great that it kills many more than it can eat one or two of these animals will almost destroy a whole warren  it generally resides in woods or thick brakes where it burrows under ground forming a shallow retreat about two yards in length which commonly ends among the roots of trees  in the winter season this creature frequents houses barns etc feeding on poultry eggs and sometimes milk but it has another mode of procuring subsistence which has hitherto escaped the observation of the naturalist and which though singular we can vouch for the truth of  during a severe storm one of these animals was traced in the snow from the side of a rivulet to its hole at some distance from it as it was observed to have made frequent trips and as other marks were to be seen in the snow which could not easily be accounted for it was thought a matter worthy of more diligent enquiry its hole was accordingly examined the foumart taken and eleven fine eels were discovered to be the fruits of this curious little animals nocturnal excursions the marks in the snow were found to have been made by the motion of the eels in the creatures mouth  from the above curious circumstance we have given a representation of this animal which was drawn from the life in possession of this singular booty  it may be matter of curious investigation for some future naturalist to enquire by what arts this wily animal finds a booty so apparently difficult to attain whether by plunging in and dragging it from its recesses at the bottoms of rivers or in the more secure method of taking advantage of the labors of others and robbing the otter of its stores  in attending to the instinctive faculties of animals there is room for deep and diligent enquiry and though our progress is liable to many interruptions it is a delightful task to follow the workings of nature through all her intricate and curious windings every step we gain is a sufficient reward for our trouble and leads us to admire the wisdom and goodness of that dispensation which furnishes every creature with sufficient and ample powers to administer to all its wants necessities and comforts  the female foumart brings forth in the summer generally five or six at a time she suckles them but a short time and accustoms them early to live upon blood and eggs  though the smell of this animal is rank and disagreeable even to a proverb yet the skin is dressed with the hair on and used as other furs without retaining its offensive odor  the foumart is a very fierce and bold little creature when attacked by a dog it will defend itself with great spirit attack in its turn and fasten upon the nose of its enemy with so keen a bite as frequently to oblige him to desist    the pine weasel or yellowbreasted martin inhabits the north of europe asia and america it is likewise found in great britain but is not numerous there  it lives chiefly in large forests especially where the pine tree abounds of the tops of which it is very fond  north america abounds with these animals prodigious numbers of their skins are annually imported from thence above thirty thousand skins have been brought over from canada in one year and from hudsons bay nearly fifteen thousand in the same time  the principal difference between the pine weasel and the martin is in the color the breast of the former is yellow the color of the body much darker and the fur in general greatly superior in fineness beauty and value  the martin is much more common in this country than the pine weasel  it lives wholly in woods and breeds in the hollows of trees it produces from four to six young ones at a time  this animal is the most beautiful of all the weasel kind its head is small and elegantly formed its eyes are lively and its motions quick and graceful  when taken young it is easily tamed extremely playful and goodhumoured its attachment however is not to be depended upon it readily takes advantage of the first opportunity to regain its liberty and retire to the woods its natural haunts  the food of the martin is much the same with other animals of its kind it makes incessant war with rats mice and other vermin poultry game and small birds are its constant prey it feeds also on grain and is extremely fond of honey  m buffon tells us of one of these animals that he had tamed which he remarks drank frequently it sometimes slept two days successively and at other times would continue awake as long in preparing itself for sleep it folded itself up in a round form and covered its head with its tail when awake its motions were so violent so constant and so troublesome that it was necessary to keep it chained from the flexibility of its body it easily eluded its fetters and after returning once or twice at last absented itself entirely  the martin is about eighteen inches long the tail is te and full of hair especially toward the end which is thick and bushy the ears are broad rounded and open the body is covered with a thick fur of a darkbrown color the head is brown mixed with red the throat and breast are white the belly is of the same color with the back but a little paler the feet are broad and covered on the under side with a thick fur the claws white large and sharp well adapted for climbing trees which in this country are its constant residence  the skin and excrements of this animal have an agreeable musky scent and are entirely free from that rankness which is so disgusting in other animals of this kind its fur is valuable and in high estimation  the sable this little animal so highly esteemed for its skin is a native of the snowy regions of the north being found chiefly in siberia kamtschatka and some of the islands which lie between that country and japan and a few are also found in lapland  the darkest furs are the most valuable a single skin though not above four inches broad is sometimes valued as high as fifteen pounds the sable differs from all other furs in this that the hair turns with equal ease to either side  the sable resembles the martin in form and is about the same size  it lives in holes in the earth by the banks of rivers and under the roots of trees it makes its nest of moss small twigs and grass  the female brings forth in the spring and produces from three to five at one time  sometimes like the martin it forms its nest in the hollow of a tree  this animal is very lively and active and will leap with great agility from tree to tree in pursuit of small birds woodcocks squirrels etc it likewise lives upon rats fishes pine tops and wild fruits  it is affirmed by naturalists that the sable is not averse to the water and from the fineness and closeness of its fur there is great reason to suppose that it is much accustomed to that element from which it also derives a part of its subsistence and as a farther proof that this animal is in some degree amphibious we are told by travelers avrils travels p   0  that it is very numerous in small islands where the hunters go in quest of them  it is mentioned by aristotle as a water animal and is described by him under the name of satherius  the hunting of the sables is chiefly carried on by criminals confined to the desert regions of siberia or by soldiers sent thither for that purpose who generally remain there several years both are obliged to furnish a certain quantity of furs they shoot with a single ball to injure the skin as little as possible they frequently take them in traps or kill them with blunt arrows  as an encouragement to the hunters they are allowed to share among themselves whatever skins they take above the allotted number and this in a few years amounts to a considerable premium  the hunters form themselves into small troops each of which is directed by a leader of their own choosing  the season of hunting is from november to february for at that time the sables are in the highest perfection those caught at any other time of the year are full of short hairs and are sold at inferior prices the best skins are such as have only long hair which is always black and of a glossy brightness old furs do not retain their gloss  both the russians and chinese have a method of dying their furs but the dyed sables are easily discovered having neither the smoothness nor the brightness of the natural hair  the bellies of sables which are sold in pairs are about two fingers in breadth and are tied together in bundles of forty pieces which are sold at from one to two pounds sterling the tails are sold by the hundred from four to eight pounds  there are instances of sables being found of a snowy whiteness but they are rare and bought only as curiosities  the hunters of this animal are frequently obliged to endure the utmost extremity of cold and hunger in the pursuit of their booty they penetrate deep into immense woods where they have no other method of finding their way back but by marking the trees as they advance if this should by any means fail them they are inevitably lost they sometimes trace the sables on the newfallen snow to their holes place their nets at the entrance and wait frequently two or three days before the animal comes out  it has happened by the failure of their provisions that these poor wretches have been reduced to the necessity of tying thin boards tight to their stomachs to prevent the cravings of appetite  such are the hardships our fellow creatures undergo to supply the wants of the vain and luxuriant  an animal similar to the sable is mentioned by mr pennant under the name of the fisher it is found in north america and by the number of its skins imported must be very numerous there nearly six hundred of them having been brought in one season from new york and pensylvania the hair on the body is mostly black the sides brown the ears are broad and round dusky on their outsides and edged with white the face and sides of the neck palebrown mixed with black the feet are very broad and covered with hair even on their soles the tail is full and bushy the length of the animal from nose to tail is twentyeight inches the tail seventeen  the ichneumon this animal in egypt is domestic like the cat and is retained by the natives for the same useful purposes of clearing their houses of rats and mice  with all the strength and agility of the cat it has a more general appetite for carnage it attacks without dread the most deadly serpents and preys on every noxious reptile of the torrid zone which it seizes and kills with great avidity  it is said that when this animal is wounded by a serpent and begins to feel the effect of the poison it immediately has recourse to a certain root which the indians call after its name and assert that it is an antidote for the bite of any venomous reptile  the ichneumon is the most formidable enemy of the crocodile it destroys its eggs which it digs out of the sand where they are laid to hatch by the heat of the sun and kills great numbers of the young crocodiles soon after their production before they are able to reach the water it was for this reason that the ancient egyptians worshipped this animal and ranked the ichneumon amongst those deities that were most propitious to them  these animals in their domestic state are perfectly tame and gentle m dobsonville speaks of one which he reared from a young one it became tamer than a cat was obedient to the call of its master and followed him wherever he went one day he brought a small waterserpent alive being desirous to know how far its instinct would carry it against a being with whom it was hitherto entirely unacquainted its first emotion seemed to be astonishment mixed with anger its hair became erect in an instant it slipped behind the reptile and with remarkable swiftness and agility leaped upon its head seized it and crushed it with its teeth this first essay seemed to have awakened in it its natural appetite for blood which till then had given way to the gentleness of its education it no longer suffered the poultry among which it was brought up to pass unregarded but took the first opportunity when it was alone to strangle them it eat a part of their flesh and drank only the blood of others  these animals are numerous in all the southern regions of asia from egypt to the island of java they are also found in africa in the country about the cape of good hope they frequent the banks of rivers are fond of fish are said to take the water like an otter and will continue in it a considerable time without rising to take breath  the ichneumon varies in size the domestic kind is generally larger than those that are wild and its colors more variegated it is in general about the size of a common cat somewhat longer in the body and shorter in the legs its fur contains tints of white brown fawncolour and a dirty silvergrey which all together form a mixture very agreeable to the eye  its form is like that of the polecat its eyes are small but inflamed and sparkle with a singular vivacity its nose is long and slender its ears small rounded and almost naked its tail is very thick at the base and tapers to a point underneath the tail is an orifice from which a most fetid humor is secreted its claws are long  it darts upon its prey like an arrow and seizes it with inevitable certainty  this creature has a small soft voice somewhat like a murmur and unless struck or irritated never exerts it when it sleeps it folds itself up like a ball and is not easily awaked it frequently sits up like a squirrel and feeds itself with its fore feet catches any thing that is thrown to it and will often feign itself dead till its prey come within its reach  the fossane is rather smaller than the martin its body is slender and covered with hair of an ash color mixed with tawny the sides of the face are black at the hind part of the head there are four black lines extending from thence toward the back and shoulders the tail is long and annulated with black its eye is full round and black which gives it a wild and mischievous aspect  this animal inhabits the island of madagascar guinea cochinchina and the philippine isles it feeds on flesh and fruits but prefers the latter and is peculiarly fond of bananas it is a very fierce animal and not easily tamed  in guinea it is called the berbe and by europeans the winebibber being very greedy of palm wine  when young its flesh is reckoned very good to eat    the skunk this animal which is called the chinche by the natives of brazil is about the size of a common cat its nose is long and slender and extends a considerable way beyond the lower jaw its ears are large short and rounded a white stripe extends from the nose over the forehead and along the back where it is intersected with a small line of black commencing at the tail and extending upwards along the middle of the back its belly and legs are black its hair is long especially on the tail which is thick and bushy  this creature inhabits peru and other parts of southamerica and is remarkable above all the weasel kind for a most intolerable suffocating fetid vapor which it emits from behind when attacked pursued or frightened the stench of this effluvia is insupportable and is the creatures best means of defense  there are three or four varieties of this animal mentioned by m buffon under the name of the stinking polecats all of which possess this wonderful faculty of annoying their enemies from the same quarter  some turn their tail to their pursuers and emit a most horrible stench which keeps both dogs and men at a considerable distance others eject their urine to the distance of about eighteen feet and it is of so virulent a quality as almost to occasion blindness if any of it should happen to fall into the eyes clothes infected with it retain the smell for many days no washing can make them sweet but they must be even buried in fresh soil before they can be thoroughly cleansed dogs that are not properly bred turn back as soon as they perceive the smell those that have been accustomed to it will kill the animal but are obliged to relieve themselves by thrusting their noses into the ground  the stifling or squash which is the second variety of this animal is nearly of the same size with the skunk its hair is long and of a deepbrown color it lives in holes and clefts of rocks where the female brings forth her young it is a native of mexico and feeds on beetles worms and small birds it destroys poultry of which it only eats the brains  when afraid or irritated it voids the same offensive kind of odor which no creature dare venture to approach professor kalm was in danger of being suffocated by one that was pursued into a house where he slept and it affected the cattle so much that they bellowed through pain another which was killed by a maid servant in a cellar so affected her with its stench that she lay ill for several days all the provisions that were in the place were so tainted by the smell as to be utterly unfit for use  another variety of this animal is called the conepate and is perhaps no more than the female of the lastmentioned animal it is somewhat smaller and differs chiefly from the squash in being marked with five parallel white lines which run along its back and sides from head to tail it is a native of north america  when attacked it bristles up its hair throws itself into a round form and emits an odor which no creature can support  the last of this pestiferous family which we shall mention is the zorilla this animal is a native of newspain where it is called the mariputa it is found on the banks of the river oronoque and is perhaps the most beautiful and at the same time the most offensive of all creatures its body is beautifully marked with white stripes upon a black ground running from the head to the middle of the back from whence they are crossed with other white bands which cover the lower part of the back and flanks its tail is long and bushy black as far as the middle and white to its extremity it is an active and mischievous little animal its stench is said to extend to a considerable distance and is so powerful as to overcome even the panther of america which is one of its greatest enemies  notwithstanding this offensive quality in these animals they are frequently tamed and will follow their master like domestic animals they do not emit their odor unless when beaten or irritated they are frequently killed by the native indians who immediately cut away the noxious glands thereby preventing the flesh which is good eating from being infected its taste is said nearly to resemble the flavor of that of a young pig the savage indians make purses of their skins which are held in no estimation by the europeans  the genet is as much distinguished for the agreeable perfume which it yields as those we have just described are for the rankest and most disagreeable odor in nature  the body of the genet is longer than that of the martin its head is long and slender with a sharp muzzle its ears are a little pointed its hair soft smooth and shining of a tawnyred color spotted with black along the ridge of the back there is a kind of mane of long hair which forms a black line from head to tail the spots on the sides are round and distinct those on the back almost close its tail is long and marked with seven or eight rings of black from an orifice beneath its tail it yields a kind of perfume which smells faintly of musk  this creature is found in turkey syria and spain we are told by belon that he saw genets in the houses at constantinople as tame as cats and that they were useful to the inhabitants in destroying rats mice and other vermin  it is a most beautiful cleanly and industrious animal and very active in pursuing its prey its nature is mild and gentle its colors beautifully variegated and its fur valuable upon the whole it seems to be one of those animals that with proper care and attention might become a useful addition to our stock of domestic quadrupeds  the civet is larger than the genet and yields a perfume in much greater quantities and of a stronger quality  though originally a native of the warm climates of africa or asia this creature can live in temperate and even in cold countries but it must be fed with nourishing diet and carefully defended against the severities of the weather numbers of them are kept in holland for the purpose of collecting this valuable perfume the civet procured at amsterdam is more esteemed than that which comes from the levant or india being less adulterated to collect this perfume the animal is put into a cage so narrow that it cannot turn itself the cage is opened at one end and the animal drawn backwards by the tail and securely held by its hind legs a small spoon is then introduced into the pouch which contains the perfume with which it is carefully scraped and the matter put into a vessel properly secured this operation is performed two or three times a week  the quantity of odorous humor depends much on the quality of the nourishment and the appetite of the animal which always produces more in proportion to the goodness of its food boiled flesh eggs rice small animals birds and particularly fish are the kinds of food the civet mostly delights in and these ought to be varied so as to excite its appetite and preserve its health  it requires very little water and though it drinks seldom it discharges its urine frequently it is somewhat remarkable that in this operation the male is not to be distinguished from the female  from this circumstance it has been supposed that this animal was the hyena of the ancients and it is certain that most of the fables related concerning that monster are in a certain way applicable to the civet  the ancients were well acquainted with the pomatum of the civet and ascribed to it certain powers of exciting love for which purpose it still constitutes one of the luxuries of the east  what has been fabulously related concerning the uncertainty of sex in the hyena applies much more strongly to the civet for in the male nothing appears externally but three apertures so perfectly similar to those of the female that it is impossible to distinguish the sex otherwise than by dissection  the perfume of this animal is so strong that it infects every part of its body the hair and the skin are so thoroughly penetrated with it that they retain it long after being taken from the body of the animal if a person be shut up in the same apartment it is almost insupportable and when heated with rage it becomes still more pungent  the civet is naturally savage and somewhat ferocious yet it is easily tamed so as to be handled without danger  the teeth of this creature are strong and sharp but its claws are weak it is an active and nimble animal it leaps like a cat and runs with great swiftness it lives by hunting surprises small animals and birds and like the weasel will sometimes steal into the yard and carry off poultry  its eyes shine in the dark and it is probable that it can see well enough to pursue its prey during the night as it is known to be most active at that time  the civet is very prolific in its native climate but though it lives and produces its perfume in temperate regions it is never known to breed there  its voice is stronger than that of the cat and has some resemblance to the cry of an enraged dog  the zibet is so similar to the civet as to be considered by some authors as only a variety of that animal and it must be allowed that they have many essential relations both in their external and internal structure but they differ from each other by such distinguishing characteristics as entitle them to be regarded as two distinct species the ears of the zibet are larger and more erect and its muzzle is thinner and flatter its body is longer than that of the civet and its tail which is longer is marked with annular spots like that of the genet it has no mane or long hair on the neck and spine and its hair is shorter and softer  the perfume of the zibet is peculiarly violent and piercing beyond that of either the civet or the genet  this odorous liquor is found in a fissure near the organs of generation it is a thick humor of the consistence of pomatum and though very strong it is agreeable even as it issues from the body of the animal  this matter of the zibet must not be confounded with musk which is a sanguineous humor derived from a species of the roebuck or goat without horns see page     and has nothing in common with the zibet but its strong perfume    the suricate or fourtoed weasel is an active and dexterous little animal it is rather less than a rabbit and pretty much resembles the ichneumon both in size and in the color of its hair only it is rougher and its tail is not quite so long its upper jaw is much longer than the lower and very pliant and moveable it has only four toes on each foot in which it differs from all the weasel kind  one of these animals in the possession of m de seve was observed sometimes to walk on its hind legs and frequently to sit upright with its fore feet hanging down on its breast  the suricate is carnivorous and preys on small animals it is fond of fish and still more so of eggs like the squirrel it makes use of its fore paws to convey its victuals to its mouth in drinking it laps like a dog but will not drink water except when it is warm the ordinary drink of that kept by de seve was its own urine though it had a very strong odor it frolicked with the cats and always innocently it was extremely playful and familiar knew its own name and would return at a call what was remarkable it seemed to have an aversion to particular persons whom it would always bite on their approaching it some people were so disagreeable to it that even when restrained it would make use of several artifices to come near enough to bite them and when it could not lay hold of their legs would fly at their shoes or petticoats when discontented it made a noise like the barking of a whelp and when pleased or caressed would utter a sound like the shaking of a rattle  the ratel described by mr pennant under the name of the fizzler is a native of the cape of good hope  it lives chiefly upon honey and is endowed with a wonderful faculty of discovering the secret retreats where the bees deposit their stores about sunset the ratel is particularly attentive in watching the motions of these industrious insects and having observed their route it follows with great care the direction in which they fly it is frequently assisted in discovering its delicious booty by a bird called the honey guide cuculus indicator which is extremely fond both of honey and the eggs of bees and in the pursuit of its food excites the attention of the ratel by a loud grating cry of cherr cherr cherr at the same time flying slowly on toward the place where the swarm of bees have taken up their abode the ratel follows the sound with great attention and having plundered the nest leaves sufficient behind it as a reward for the services of its faithful guide the ratel is well adapted to this purpose as the toughness and thickness of its skin effectually defends it from the stings of the bees on this account it is extremely difficult to kill this animal for its skin is so loosely attached to its body that when seized by a hound it gives way and the animal has an opportunity of turning round and biting its affailant which it frequently does so severely as to oblige him to desist  the ratel according to mr pennant is two feet long from the nose to the tail which is eight inches its legs are short on each foot it has four toes armed with long claws those on the fore feet are above an inch long and very sharp its tongue is rough it has no earlaps the orifice of the ear is wide and surrounded by a callous rim a broad stripe of an ash color extends along the back from the forehead to the tail which is separated from the black hair on the sides and belly by a light gray list running from behind each ear to the tail  it burrows in holes under ground is said to be very fetid and is called the stinking badger by m de la caille    the coati or brazilian weasel this animal has some resemblance to the bear in the length of its hind legs in the form of its feet in the bushiness of its hair and in the structure of its paws but it is small and its tail is long and variegated with different colors its upper jaw is much longer than the lower and very pliant its ears are rounded its hair is smooth soft and glossy of a brightbay color and its breast is whitish  linnaeus describes one of these animals which he kept a considerable time and in vain attempted to bring into subjection it was so obstinate that it would do nothing to which it was disinclined it killed the poultry tore off their heads and sucked their blood it defended itself with great force whenever any person attempted to lay hold of it contrary to its inclination and it stuck fast to the legs of those with whom it was familiar when it wanted to ransack their pockets and carry off any thing that it found in them it had an extreme aversion to hogs bristles and the smallest brush made it desist  its mode of living was very singular it slept from midnight till noon kept awake the rest of the day and uniformly walked about from six in the evening till midnight without the least regard to the weather this is probably the time assigned by nature to this species of animals for procuring their food which consists chiefly of young birds eggs and small animals  this creature inhabits brazil and guiana runs up trees very nimbly eats like a dog and holds its food between its fore legs like the bear the coati stands with ease on its hind feet it is said to gnaw its own tail which it generally carries erect and sweeps it about from side to side  the racoon is very common in the warm regions of america it is found also in the mountains of jamaica from whence great numbers of them frequently descend into the plantations and make great havoc among the sugarcanes of which they are particularly fond the planters consider these animals as their greatest enemies as they frequently do infinite mischief in one nights excursion they have contrived various methods of destroying them yet still they propagate in such numbers that neither traps nor firearms can repel them  the racoon is somewhat less than the badger its head resembles that of a fox but its ears are round and much shorter and its upper jaw very pointed and longer than the lower its eyes which are large are surrounded with two broad patches of black its body is thick and short covered with long hair black at the points and gray underneath its tail is long and bushy and marked with alternate rings of black and white its feet and toes are black  the racoon is a very active and nimble animal its claws which are extremely sharp enable it to climb trees with great facility it moves forward chiefly by bounding and though it proceeds in an oblique direction runs with great swiftness  when tamed it is very goodnatured and sportive but it is almost constantly in motion and as unlucky and inquisitive as a monkey examining every thing with its paws which it makes use of as hands to lay hold of any thing that is given it and to carry its meat to its mouth it sits up to eat is extremely fond of sweet things and strong liquors with which it will get excessively drunk it has all the cunning of the fox is very destructive to poultry but will eat all sorts of fruits grain and roots it has a peculiar method of dipping every thing in water it intends to eat and will seldom taste bread till it be well soaked it opens oysters with astonishing dexterity separates the shells and leaves not a vestige of the fish it does this without looking at the oyster but places it under its hind paws and with its sore feet searches for the weakest part where it fixes its claws forces it open and snatches out the fish it likewise devours all kinds of insects delights in hunting spiders and when at liberty in a garden will eat grasshoppers snails worms etc it is a very cleanly animal and always retires to obey the calls of nature it is familiar and even caressing leaps upon those it is fond of plays sportively and moves about with great agility  this animal is hunted for its skin which is next in value to that of the beaver for making hats  the badger although nature has furnished this animal with formidable weapons of offense and has besides given it strength sufficient to use them with great effect it is notwithstanding a harmless and inoffensive creature and unless attacked employs them only for its support and comfort  this animal retires to the most secret recesses where it digs its hole and forms its habitation under ground  its food consists chiefly of roots fruits grass insects and frogs it is charged with destroying lambs and rabbits but there seems to be no other reason to consider it as a beast of prey than the analogy between its teeth and those of carnivorous animals  few creatures defend themselves better or bite with greater keenness than the badger on that account it is frequently baited with dogs trained for that purpose this inhuman diversion is chiefly confined to the indolent and the vicious who take a cruel pleasure in seeing this harmless animal surrounded by its enemies and defending itself from their attacks which it does with astonishing agility and success its motions are so quick that a dog is frequently desperately wounded in the first moment of assault and obliged to fly the thickness of the badgers skin and the length and coarseness of its hair are an excellent defense against the bites of the dogs its skin is so loose as to resist the impressions of their teeth and give the animal an opportunity of turning itself round and wounding its adversaries in their tenderest parts in this manner this singular creature is able to resist repeated attacks both of men and dogs from all quarters till being overpowered with numbers and enfeebled by many desperate wounds it is at last obliged to submit  the badger is an indolent animal and sleeps much it confines itself to its hole during the whole day and feeds only in the night it is so cleanly as never to defile its habitation with its ordure it breeds only once in a year and brings forth four or five at a time  this animal is not known to exist in warm countries it is an original native of the temperate climates of europe and is found without any variety in spain france italy germany britain poland and sweden  the usual length of the badger is somewhat above two feet exclusive of the tail which is about six inches long its eyes are small and are placed in a black stripe which begins behind the ears and runs tapering toward the nose the throat and legs are black the back sides and tail are of a dirtygrey mixed with black the legs and feet are very short strong and thick each foot consists of five toes those on the fore feet are armed with strong claws well adapted for digging its subterranean habitations  in walking the badger treads on its whole heel like the bear which brings its belly very near the ground  immediately below the tail between that and the anus there is a narrow transverse orifice from whence a white substance of a very fetid smell constantly exudes  the skin of this creature when dressed with the hair on is used for pistol furniture  its flesh is eaten the hind quarters are sometimes made into hams which when cured are not inferior in goodness to the best bacon  the hairs are made into brushes which are used by painters to soften and harmonize their shades they are called sweetening tools    the sand bear we have given the figure of this animal drawn from one kept in the tower of which we have not been able to obtain any further description than its being somewhat less than the badger almost without hair extremely sensible of cold and burrows in the sand from these circumstances as well as from the striking similarity of its figure to that of the badger we are inclined to think it is a variety of that animal mentioned by naturalists under the name of the sow badger  the color of this animal is a yellowishwhite its eyes are small and its head thicker than that of the common badger its legs are short and on each foot there are four toes armed with sharp white claws  m brisson describes a white badger from new york so similar to this that we suspect it to be the same animal  the wolverene or glutton this voracious animal is found in all the countries bordering on the northern ocean both in europe and asia it is likewise common in canada the country about hudsons bay and other parts of north america where it is known by the name of the carcajou  this creature has been variously described by naturalists we have selected the account given by m buffon which was taken from a living animal in his possession its length from the nose to the insertion of the tail was two feet two inches the tail was eight inches long the length of the fore legs was eleven inches and the hind one foot it had five toes on each foot armed with long sharp claws the middle claw of the fore foot was one inch and a half long the muzzle as far as the eyebrows was black its eyes were small and black and its ears short its breast and under jaw were spotted with white the back legs belly and tail were black  during its confinement this animal did not discover any symptoms of great ferocity it eat voraciously and after a full meal covered itself in its cage with straw it eat no bread but would devour more than four pounds of flesh every day which it swallowed greedily almost without chewing  in a state of liberty this creature is said to lead a life of continual rapine it lurks in the branches of trees in order to surprise deer and other animals that pass under them it waits with great patience the arrival of its prey and darts from its hiding place with unerring certainty in this manner it indiscriminately surprises the horse the elk the stag or the reindeer and fixes itself between their shoulders with its teeth and claws  the wild reindeer which are numerous both in lapland and north america frequently fall victims to the glutton when seized by this bloodthirsty animal it is in vain that the wounded deer endeavors to disengage itself from its enemy by rustling among the branches of the trees no force can oblige it to quit its hold it maintains its position and continues to suck the blood of the flying animal till it falls down exhausted with pain and fatigue it then devours the carcass with insatiable voracity and gorges itself with the flesh till it is almost in danger of bursting  the motions of the glutton are slow there are few quadrupeds that cannot escape from it except the beaver which it frequently pursues and overtakes  in america it is called the beavereater  it sometimes lies in wait and surprises those animals coming out of their burrow or breaks into their habitation and kills great numbers of them  the glutton often defeats the labors of the huntsmen by stealing away the sables and other animals that have been caught in their traps and it is sometimes taken in the snares laid for these animals when attacked it makes a strong resistance it will tear the stock from the gun if it should catch hold of it with its teeth or break the trap in pieces in which it is caught notwithstanding its fierceness it is capable of being tamed and of learning several entertaining tricks  it is hunted only for its skin which is very valuable of a most beautiful glossy black which shines with a peculiar luster and reflects the light like damask silk  the skins are sold in siberia at five or six shillings each at jakutsk at twelve and still dearer in kamtschatka where the women dress their hair with its white paws which they esteem a great ornament  the furs of this animal from the north of europe and asia are infinitely finer blacker and more glossy than those of the american kind    the brown bear there are two kinds of this animal  the land and the sea bear these are very different as well in the formation of their bodies as in their habits and dispositions  there are two varieties of the land bear  the brown and the black the former is found in almost every climate the black bear chiefly in the forests of the northern regions of europe and america  the brown bear is sometimes carnivorous and will destroy cattle and eat carrion but its general food is roots fruits and vegetables  it is a savage and solitary animal lives in desert and unfrequented places and chooses its den in the most gloomy and retired parts of the forest or in the most dangerous and inaccessible precipices of unfrequented mountains it retires alone to its den about the end of autumn at which time it is exceedingly fat and lives for several weeks in a state of total inactivity and abstinence from food  during this time the female brings forth her young and suckles them she chooses her retreat for that purpose in the most retired places apart from the male lest he should devour them she makes a warm bed for her young and attends them with unremitting care during four months and in all that time she scarcely allows herself any nourishment she brings forth two and sometimes three young at a time  the cubs are round and shapeless with pointed muzzles but they are not licked into form by the female as pliny and other ancient naturalists supposed at first they do not exceed eight inches in length they are blind during the first four weeks are of a paleyellow color and have scarcely any resemblance of the creature when arrived at maturity  the time of gestation in these animals is about six months and they bring forth in the beginning of january  in the spring the old bears attended by their young come out from their retreats lean and almost famished by their long confinement they then ransack every quarter in search of food they frequently climb trees and devour the fruit in great quantities particularly the dateplumb tree of which they are exceedingly fond they ascend these trees with surprising agility keep themselves firm on the branches with one paw and with the other collect the fruit  the bear is remarkably fond of honey which it will encounter great difficulties to obtain and seeks for with great cunning and avidity  this animal enjoys in a superior degree the senses of hearing smelling and touching  its ears are short and rounded and its eyes small but lively and penetrating and defended by a nictating membrane from the peculiar formation of the internal parts of its nose its sense of smelling is exceedingly exquisite the legs and thighs are strong and muscular it has five toes on each foot and uses its fore foot as a hand although the toes are not separated as in most animals that do so the largest finger is on the outside  the voice of the bear is a deep and surly kind of growl which it frequently exerts without the least cause it is very easily irritated and at that time its resentment is furious and often capriciously exerted  when tamed it appears mild and obedient to its master but it is not to be trusted without the utmost caution it may be taught to walk upright to dance to lay hold of a pole with its paws and perform various tricks to entertain the multitude who are highly pleased to see the awkward measures of this rugged creature which it seems to suit to the sound of an instrument or to the voice of its leader but to give the bear this kind of education it must be taken when young and accustomed early to restraint and discipline an old bear will suffer neither without discovering the most furious resentment neither the voice nor the menaces of his keeper have any effect upon him he equally growls at the hand that is held out to feed as at that which is raised to correct him  the excessive cruelties practiced upon this poor animal in teaching it to walk erect and regulate its motions to the sound of the flagelet are such as make sensibility shudder its eyes are put out and an iron ring being put through the cartilage of the nose to lead it by it is kept from food and beaten till it yield obedience to the will of its savage tutors some of them are taught to perform by setting their feet upon hot iron plates and then playing to them whilst in this uneasy situation  it is truly shocking to every feeling mind to reflect that such cruelties should be exercised upon any part of the brute creation by our fellow men that they should be rewarded by numbers of unthinking people who crowd around them to see the poor animals rude attempts to imitate human actions is not to be wondered at but it is much to be wished that the timely interference of the magistrate would prevent every exhibition of this kind that in england at least we might not be reproached with tolerating practices so disgraceful to humanity  one of these animals presented to the prince of wales a few years ago was kept in the tower by the carelessness of the servant the door of his den was left open and the keepers wife happening to go across the court at the same time the animal flew out seized the woman threw her down and fastened upon her neck which he bit and without offering any further violence lay upon her sucking the blood out of the wound resistance was in vain as it only served to irritate the creature and she must inevitably have perished had not her husband luckily discovered her situation by a sudden blow he obliged the bear to quit his hold and retire to his den which he did with great reluctance and not without making a second attempt to come at the woman who was almost dead through fear and loss of blood it is somewhat remarkable that whenever it happened to see her afterward it growled and made most violent struggles to get out to her  the prince upon hearing of the circumstance ordered the bear to be killed  the bears of america are small and black live entirely upon vegetable food and are particularly fond of maize potatoes honey and milk though pressed with extreme hunger they will not eat animal food  they lodge in the hollow trunks of large trees which they ascend and descend with great ease and agility  the hunters take them by setting fire to their habitations the old one comes out first and is generally slain before she reaches the ground the cubs follow her and are taken alive  the flesh of the young bear is reckoned a great delicacy and the paws of the old one are esteemed as a most exquisite morsel the fat is white and very sweet and the oil is said to be of great use in softening swellings proceeding from sprains  great numbers are killed annually in america for the sake of their skins which form a considerable article of commerce  bears were formerly common in greece the romans brought them from lybia to be exhibited in their public spectacles they are likewise found in china japan and as far as the island of java  the mountains of great tartary produce great numbers of bears perfectly white which do not differ in form from those just mentioned some from the confines of russia are of a mixed color with black and white hairs  the bear was once an inhabitant of this island and was included in the ancient laws and regulations respecting beasts of chase long after their extirpation they were imported for the cruel purpose of baiting them which at that time was a favorite amusement of our ancestors we find it in queen elizabeths days among the various entertainments prepared for her majesty on her visit at kenilworth  the polar or great white bear differs greatly from the preceding in the length of its head and neck and grows to above twice the size some of these animals are thirteen feet long their limbs are of great size and strength their hair long harsh and disagreeable to the touch and of a yellowishwhite color their ears are short and rounded and their teeth large  this animal inhabits only the coldest parts of the globe it has been found above latitude  0 as far as navigators have penetrated northwards these inhospitable regions seem adapted to its sullen nature   there  the shapeless bear with dangling ce all horrid stalks forlorn owpacd and rer as the storms increase he  his bd  the inlement drift and with stern patience scorning weak complaint hardens his heart against assailing want they have been seldom seen farther south than newfoundland and are chiefly met with on the shores of hudsons bay greenland and spitzbergen on one side and those of novazembla on the other they have been sometimes found in the intermediate countries of norway and iceland but such as have appeared in those parts have always been driven thither upon floating sheets of ice so that those countries are only acquainted with them by accident  they are very numerous on the shores of kamtschatka and the following account of the manner of hunting them by the natives of that country is given in captain cooks voyage   the natives generally contrive to reach the ground frequented by the bears about sunset their first business when they arrive there is to look out for their tracks and to attend particularly to the freshest of them always paying a regard to the situation with respect to concealment and taking aim at the animal as it passes by or as it advances or goes from them these tracks are numerous between the woods and the lakes and are often found among the long sedgy grass and brakes on the margin of the water having determined upon a convenient spot for concealment the hunters fix their crutches in the ground on which they rest their irelocks pointing them in a proper direction they afterward kneel or lie down as the circumstances of their situation may require and having their bearspears in readiness by their side wait the arrival of their game  these precautions are extremely necessary on many accounts that the hunters may make sure of their mark for the price of ammunition is so high at kamtschatka that the value of a bear will not purchase more of it than will load a musket four or five times it is much more material on another consideration for if the first shot should not render the animal incapable of pursuit fatal consequences too frequently ensue the enraged beast makes immediately toward the place from whence the sound and smoke issue and furiously attacks his adversaries they have not sufficient time to reload their pieces as the bear is seldom fired at till he comes within the distance of fifteen yards therefore if he should not happen to fall they immediately prepare to receive him upon their spears their safety depending in a great measure on their giving him a mortal stab as he advances toward them should he parry the thrust which these animals are sometimes enabled to do by the strength and agility of their paws and break in upon his opponents the conflict becomes dreadful and it is seldom that the loss of a single life will satisfy the beasts revenge  the business or diversion of bearhunting is particularly dangerous at two seasons of the year in the spring when they first issue from their caves after having subsisted the whole winter as it is here positively asserted solely on sucking their paws and especially if the frost should continue to be severe and the ice in the lakes is not broken up as they cannot then have recourse to their customary and expected food thus becoming exceedingly famished they grow fierce and savage in proportion pursuing the inhabitants by the scent and prwng about at a distance from their usual tracks dart upon them unawars under these circumstances as the natives have no idea of shooting flying or even running or in any manner without resting their piece they often fall a sacrifice to their rapacity  the time of their copulation which is in autumn is the other dangerous season to meet with them  many extraordinary and affecting instances of natural affection in these animals are related by the kamtschadales who from this circumstance derive considerable advantage in hunting they never presume to fire at a young bear if the dam is upon the spot for if the cub should happen to be killed she becomes enraged to an immoderate degree and if she can only obtain a sight of the offender she is sure to be revenged of him or die in the attempt on the other hand if the mother should be shot the cubs continue by her side after she has been a long time dead exhibiting by the most affecting gestures and motions the most poignant affliction the hunters instead of commiserating their distresses embrace these opportunities of destroying them  if the veracity of the kamtschadales is to be depended on the sagacity of the bears is as extraordinary as their natural affection  innumerable are the stories which they relate to this effect one remarkable instance however we cannot avoid mentioning as it is admitted among the natives as a wellattested fact it is the stratagem they put in practice to catch the bareins which run too swift for them to expect success in pursuing them these animals herd together in great numbers and their usual haunts are low grounds at the foot of rocks and precipices where they delight in browsing the bear pursues them by the scent till he obtains a view of them and then advances warily keeping in a situation above them at the same time concealing himself among the rocks as the approaches till he is almost immediately over them and near enough to carry his purpose into execution then with his paws he pushes down large pieces of the rock amongst the herd below if he perceives that he has succeeded in maiming any of the flock he immediately pursues them and according to the injury the poor bareins have received he either proves successful in overtaking them or they escape by the rapidity of their flight  the kamtschadales acknowledge infinite obligations to the bears for all the little progress they have hitherto made as well in the sciences as the polite arts they confess themselves indebted wholly to those animals for all their knowledge in physic and surgery that by observing what herbs they have applied to the wounds they have received and what methods they have pursued when they were languid and out of order they have acquired a knowledge of most of those simples which they have now recourse to either as external or internal applications but the most singular circumstance of all is that they admit the bears to be their dancingmasters though the evidence of our own senses places this matter beyond all dispute for in the beardance of the kamtschadales every gesture and attitude peculiar to that animal was faithfully exhibited all their other dances are similar to this in many particulars and those attitudes are thought to come the nearest to perfection which most resemble the motions of the bear  during summer these animals take up their residence on large islands of ice and frequently pass from one to another they swim well and can go to the distance of six or seven leagues they likewise dive but do not continue long under water  when the pieces of ice are detached by strong winds or currents the bears allow themselves to be carried along with them and as they cannot regain the land or abandon the ice on which they are embarked they often perish in the open sea those which arrive with the ice on the coasts of iceland or norway are almost famished with hunger from the length of their voyage and are extremely voracious  as soon as the natives discover one of them they arm themselves and presently dispatch him  the ferocity of the bear is as remarkable as its attachment to its young a few years since the crew of a boat belonging to a ship in the whalefishery shot at a bear at a short distance and wounded it the animal immediately set up the most dreadful yells and ran along the ice toward the boat before it reached it a second shot was fired at and hit it this served to increase its fury it presently swam to the boat and in attempting to get on board reached its fore foot upon the gunnel but one of the crew having a hatchet cut it off the animal still however continued to swim after them till they arrived at the ship and several shots were fired at it which also took effect but on reaching the ship it immediately ascended the deck and the crew having fled into the shrowds it was pursuing them thither when a shot from one of them laid it dead upon the deck  the flesh of these animals is white and said to taste like mutton the fat is melted for trainoil and that of the feet is used in medicine  the white bear brings forth two young at a time their fondness for their offspring is so great that they will die rather than desert them wounds serve only to make the attachment more violent they embrace their cubs to the last and bemoan them with the most piteous cries  these creatures feed on fish seals and the carcases of whales are fond of human blood and are so fearless as to attack companies of armed men and even to board small vessels allured by the scent of seals flesh they often break into the huts of the greenlanders they sometimes attack the morse with which they have terrible conflicts but the large teeth of that animal give it a decided superiority over the bear which is generally worsted    the striped hyena although naturalists both ancient and modern have described the hyena under different denominations and have ascribed to it properties which it is now known not to possess yet its characters are so singular that it is impossible to mistake them and so peculiar as to distinguish it from every other class of animals in many respects it resembles those of the dog kind has some similitude to the wolf in form and disposition and is about the same size  the hyena has only four toes on each foot in which it differs from almost every other quadruped its head is broad and flat and its muzzle shorter than that of the wolf its fore legs are longer than the hind ones its ears are long pointed and bare and its eyes are remarkably wild sullen and ferocious  there are two varieties of this animal  the one striped and the other spotted the hair of the former is of an ash color marked with long black stripes disposed in waves from the back downward there are others across the legs the hair in general is coarse and rough its tail is short and bushy with pretty long hair sometimes plain and sometimes barred with black immediately underneath the tail and above the anus there is an orifice like that of the badger which opens into a kind of pouch and contains a substance of the consistence of civet but of a rank disagreeable odor this opening may probably have given rise to the error of the ancients who asserted that the hyena was every alternate year male and female its manner of holding its head is somewhat like a dog pursuing a scent with its nose near the ground this position of the head makes the shoulders appear more elevated a bristly mane runs along the top of the back from head to tail which gives it an appearance something like a hog from whence probably it may have derived its name the word huaina being a greek word derived from hus which signifies a sow  such are the most striking distinctions of the hyena which has been pictured by ignorance and timidity under every form that can strike terror into the imagination wonderful powers were ascribed to it by the ancients who believed that it changed its sex that it imitated the human voice and by that means attracted unwary travelers and destroyed them that it had the power of charming the shepherds and as it were rivetting them to the place where they stood many other things equally absurd have been told of this animal but these are sufficient to show that objects of terror and superstition are nearly allied and when once they have taken possession of the human mind the most improbable stories are easily received and credited  this savage and solitary animal resides in the caverns of mountains in the clefts of rocks or in holes and dens which it digs in the earth  its disposition is extremely ferocious and though taken young it never can be tamed  it lives by depredations like the wolf but is stronger and more daring and rapacious it will sometimes attack men and rushes with fury upon all kinds of cattle it follows the flocks ravages the sheepfold and destroys every thing within its reach with the most insatiable voracity  its eyes shine in the dark and it is asserted with some appearance of probability that it can see nearly as well by night as by day  when destitute of other provisions it ransacks the graves and devours putrid human bodies that have been long buried  the voice of the hyena is very peculiar its beginning seems to be somewhat like the moaning of a human voice and the ending like one making a violent effort to vomit  this animal inhabits asiatic turkey syria persia and barbary  the superstitious arabs when they kill one of them carefully bury the head lest it should be applied to magical purposes  the courage of the hyena is equal to its rapacity it will defend itself with great obstinacy against much larger quadrupeds it is not afraid of the lion nor the panther will sometimes attack the ounce and seldom fails to conquer  the spotted hyena is called at the cape of good hope the tigerwolf and is very common in that part of the world  sparrman describes it as a cruel mischievous and formidable animal its horrid yells are to be heard every night whilst it prowls about for its prey and lurks near the farmyards where cattle are kept these are well defended by dogs of which the hyena though larger and stronger is much afraid and will not venture an attack unless pressed by the most urgent necessity neither will it dare to seize upon any of the larger animals such as oxen cows horses etc whilst they make the least appearance of defending themselves or even if they do not betray any symptoms of fear it sometimes endeavors to disperse the cattle by its hideous roaring after which it selects and pursues one of them which it soon disables by a deadly bite and then devours  these animals were formerly so bold as to molest the hottentots in their huts and sometimes carry off their children but since the introduction of firearms those and other wild beasts keep at a greater distance from the habitations of mankind it is a fact however that numbers of these wolves are known to attend almost every dark night about the shambles at the cape where they meet with bones skin and other offals which are left there by the inhabitants who suffer the animals to come unmolested and carry off their refuse and it is somewhat remarkable that they have seldom been known to do any mischief there though fed in the very heart of the town  the howlings of the hyena are dreadful beyond all conception and spread a general alarm they are almost incessant and seem to be the natural consequence of its craving appetite perhaps it may not be going too far to say that nature has kindly impressed this involuntary disposition to yelling upon this animal that every living creature might be upon its guard and secure itself from the attacks of so cruel an enemy  the general color of this animal is a reddishbrown marked with distinct round black spots the hind legs with transverse black bars its head is large and flat above each eye as well as on the lips it has long whiskers a short black mane runs along the top of the back its ears are short and a little pointed its face and the upper part of its head are black    the jackal we beg leave to make our acknowledgments to mr pennant for the drawing of this animal which he was so obliging as to favor us with he assures us it was drawn from the living animal and we doubt not therefore its being a faithful representation  the species of the jackal is diffused with some variety through almost every part of asia and is found in barbary and other parts of africa as far as the cape of good hope although it is one of the most numerous of all the wild animals of the east there is scarcely any less known in europe or more confusedly described by natural historians  these creatures differ in size those of the warmest climates are said to be the largest they are of a reddishbrown color the smaller jackal is about the size of a fox and its color is a brightyellow  in general this animal may be said to partake of a middle nature between the wolf and the dog and to the savage fierceness of the one it adds the impudent familiarity of the other  its cry is a dismal howl mixed with barking it is more noisy in its pursuits than the dog and more voracious than the wolf  jackals go in packs of forty or fifty and hunt like hounds in full cry from evening till morning they destroy the poultry and attack the flocks they roam through the villages and gardens and carry off every thing they can eat they enter stables yards and outhouses and devour skins and every thing that is made of leather such as harnessing boots shoes etc nothing can escape their rapacity they will ransack the repositories of the dead and greedily devour the most putrid bodies for which reason in those countries where they abound the inhabitants are obliged to make the graves of a great depth and secure them with spines to prevent the jackals from raking up the earth with their feet they are said to attend caravans and follow armies in hopes of being furnished with a banquet by disease or battle  they may be considered as the vulture among quadrupeds and like that destructive bird devour every thing indiscriminately that has once had animal life  these animals hide themselves in holes and dens by day and seldom appear abroad till the evening when they fill the air with the most horrid howlings and begin the chase the lion the panther and other beasts of prey that do not follow by the scent take advantage of the general consternation and follow in silence behind till the jackals have hunted down their prey they then devour the fruits of their labors and leave them only the remains of the spoil from whence the jackal has been vulgarly called the lions provider as if those two animals acted in concert and had formed a plan for their mutual support  the jackal frequently pursues the gazelle and is so bold as to follow it even into the midst of a town or village whither that timid animal frequently flies for protection and by that means sometimes escapes for the incessant barking of the jackal alarms the inhabitants who saly out and drive off the pursuer in hopes of being able to secure the game  sparrmans description of those he saw at the cape differs materially from the accounts we have been able to collect from other authors he says they are about three feet in length and their tails little more than a foot long the predominant color is a reddishyellow the legs are of a palegold color under the belly and on the inside of the legs the color inclines to white the nose and ears are of a brighter red the head neck and back are gray the tail is partly gray and partly of an umber color and black at the tip he says it resembles the european fox in form manners and disposition and is not known to assemble in packs for the purpose of hunting neither is its voracity equal to that ascribed to it by other naruralists  it is probable it may have been confounded with the wild dog which is common at the cape and hunts its prey in packs it i very fierce and mischievous and very destructive to the flcks of sheep and goats in those parts there are two kinds of these dogs  the one large and of a reddish cour the other less and browner they are very bold and wander about night and day in search of prey they  a  smwhat like the cry of our common hunds and hunt with  acting perfectly in concert with each other till the game falls a prey to the pack they are said to be always extremely lean and are very ugly  m buffon mentions an animal of the jackal kind by the name of the adive of which he gives a drawing somewhat resembling a small fox it is less than the common jackal and is sometimes tamed and kept in a domestic state    the fox this lively and crafty animal is common to every part of great britain and is so well known as not to require a particular description  m buffon has taken great pains to prove that the dog and the fox will not breed together for this purpose he kept two males and a female for a considerable time and tried to make the males copulate with bitches which they uniformly refused and from thence he concludes that no mixture can take place between the two species but it should be remembered that the foxes were in a state of confinement and of course many circumstances might concur to disgust them and render the experiment  in confirmation of this we need only observe that the same foxes which when at liberty darted on the poultry with their usual eagerness never attempted to touch a single fowl after they were chained and we are told further that a living hen was generally fixed near them for a whole night and though food was kept from them for many hours yet in spite of hunger and opportunity they never forgot that they were chained and disturbed not the hen now if any one should be so hrdy as to assert from this that foxes have a natural  to poultry one may easily conceive how little credit would be given to the conclusion and how much ughter it would  we just mention this to show that  of this kind where nature is thwarted in her  or rstrained in any of her operations are  upon  that the fox and the dg will  is a fact too well known in severl  of the north of england to admit of the smallest doubt it is a common practice in many places to tie up a bitch that is in season where she may be visited by a fox and be impregnated by him the fruits of the connection are sufficiently obvious most if not all the puppies have a strong resemblance to the fox the sharp nose prick ears long body and short legs of the fox evidently point out their origin  these dogs are highly esteemed by farmers and graziers as the most useful kind for driving cattle they bite keenly are extremely active and playful and are very expert at destroying weasels rats and other vermin  the fox sleeps much during the day but the night is its season of activity and the time when it roams about in search of prey  it will eat flesh of any kind but prefers that of hares rabbits poultry and all kinds of birds those that reside near the sea coasts will for want of other food eat crabs shrimps muscles and other shellfish  in france and italy the fox does great damage among the vineyards by feeding on the grapes of which it is extremely fond  it boldly attacks the wild bees and frequently robs them of their stores but not with impunity the whole swarm flies out and fastens upon the invader but he retires only for a few minutes and rids himself of the bees by rolling upon the ground by which means he crushes such as stick to him and then returns to his charge and devours both wax and honey  the cunning of the fox in surprising and securing its prey is equally remarkable when it has acquired more than it can devour its first care is to secure what it has killed which is generally all within its reach it digs holes in different places where it conceals its booty by carefully covering it with earth to prevent a discovery if a flock of poultry have unfortunately fallen victims to its stratagems it will bring them one by one to these hidingplaces where it leaves them till hunger demands fresh supplies  the chase of the fox is a very favorite diversion in this kingdom and is nowhere pursued with such ardour and intrepidity both our dogs and horses are confessedly superior to those of any other country  the instant the fox finds he is pursued he flies toward his hole and finding it stopped which is always carefully done before the chase begins he has recourse to his speed and his cunning for safety he does not double and measure his ground back like the hare but continues his course straight forward before the hounds with great strength and perseverance both dogs and horses particularly the latter have frequently fallen victims to the ardour of the pursuit which has sometimes continued for upwards of fifty miles without the smallest intermission and almost at full speed mr charles turners hounds hunted at ayreyholm near hurworth in the county of durham and found the noted old fox caesar which made an extraordinary chase after a round of four miles he led to smeaton through hornby and appleton then back again to hornby worsetmoor piersburgh limpton craythorn middleton hilton seamer newby marton ormsby then upon hambleton through kirkleathampark upleatham sklton and kton mr turner tired three horses and only three hounds were in pursuit when he thought proper to call them off it bing near  in the evening the chase was upwards of fifty miles  as the scent of the fox is very strong the dogs follow with great alacrity and eagerness and have been known to keep up a continued chase for eight or ten hours together and it is hard to say whether the spirited eagerness of the hounds the ardour of the horses or the enthusiasm of the hunters is most to be admired the fox is the only one of the party which has the plea of necessity on his side and it operates so strongly that he often escapes the utmost efforts of his pursuers and returns to his hole in safety the smell of his urine is so offensive to the dogs that it sometimes proves the means of his escape from them when all his shifts have failed him and he is at last overtaken he then defends himself with great obstinacy and fights in silence till he is torn in pieces by the dogs  there are three varieties of foxes in this island which differ from each other more in form than in color  the greyhound fox is the largest and is chiefly found in the mountainous parts of england and scotland he is likewise the boldest and will attack a wellgrown sheep  his ears are long and erect and his aspect wild  the mastiff fox is rather less but his limbs are more strongly formed  the cur fox is the least but the most common and approaches nearest to the habitations of mankind it lurks about the outhouses of the farmer and carries off all the poultry within its reach  it is remarkably playful and familar when tamed but like all wild animals halfreclaimed will on the least offense bite those it is most familiar with  the eye of the fox is of a lively hazel color very significant and expressive and discovers very sensibly the differnt emotions of love fear or anger by which it may be affected  it seems greatly to admire its bushy tail and frequently amuses itself by endeavoring to catch it as it runs round in cold weather when it lies down it flds it about its head to keep its nose warm  the fox sleeps sound and like the dog lies in a round form when he is only reposing himself he stretches out his hind legs and lies on his belly in this position he spies the birds as they alight on the hedges or places near him and is ready to spring upon such as are within his reach he rarely lies exposed but chooses the cover of some thick brake where he is pretty secure from being surprised  crows magpies and other birds which consider the fox as a common enemy will often give notice of his retreat by the most clamourous notes and frequently follow him a considerable way from tree to tree repeating their outcries  foxes produce but once a year from three to six young ones at a time when the female is pregnant she retires and seldom goes out of her hole where she prepares a bed for her young she comes in season in the winter and young foxes are found in the month of april if she perceive that her habitation is discovered she carries them off one by one to a more secure retreat  the young are brought forth blind like puppies they grow eighteen months or two years and live thirteen or fourteen years  the fox is frequently taken in traps but great caution must be used to deceive this wily animal the trap must be placed in the midst of a field where there is neither hedge nor path near it and so nicely covered with mould that not the least vestige can be seen where it lies about the trap and at a small distance from it in different places a few pieces of cheese or other stronglyscented food must be carelessly scattered then with a sheeps paunch or some other animal substance a trail is made of about a mile in length to the different places where the bait is laid and from thence to the trap the shoes of the person who carries the trail must be likewise well rubbed with the paunch that the fox may not discover his scent he then approaches with more confidence and if the design be well conducted seldom fails of being caught  there are great varieties of this animal apparently produced by the influence of climate those of this country are mostly of a tawnyred mixed with ash color the fore part of the legs is black and the tail tipped with white  in colder countries foxes are of various colors  the black fox is most valuable for its fur which is esteemed in russia superior to that of the finest sable a single skin will sell for four hundred rubles  the cross fox inhabits the coldest parts of europe asia and north america  its fur is very valuable being thicker and softer than the common sort great numbers of skins are imported from canada  it derives its name from a black mark which passes over its back across the shoulders and another along the back to the tail  the corsac fox is common in the deserts beyond the yaick river and seems to be the same animal described by m buffon under the name of the isatis  in summer it is of a paletawny color with a white throat in winter it is gray the tip of the tail is black it is smaller than the common fox and its hair is soft and downy  it lives in holes in the earth and is caught by the kirgiskhaissacs with falcons and greyhounds forty or fifty thousand are taken annually and sold to the russians at the rate of forty copeics about twentypence each  the natives in their traffic use their skins instead of money great numbers are sent into turkey  the arctic fox inhabits the countries bordering on the frozen sea it is found in greenland iceland spitzbergen novazembla and lapland in kamtschatka and the opposite parts of america  it burrows in the ground and makes holes several feet in length at the end of which it forms a nest with moss in greenland and spitzbergen it lives in the clefts of rocks being unable to burrow on account of the frost two or three of them inhabit the same hole  this animal is endowed with all the cunning of the common fox preys on young geese ducks and other waterfowl before they are able to fly likewise on hares wild birds and eggs and in greenland for want of other food it feeds on berries and shellfish in lapland and the north of asia their principal food is the leming or lapland marmot immense shoals of which sometimes cover the face of the country the foxes follow them in their migrations from one place to another and as the return of the marmot is very uncertain and frequently after great intervals of time they are sometimes absent three or four years in pursuit of this their favorite prey  the hair of the arctic fox is of an ash color but changes to white in the winter when it is long soft and somewhat woolly its tail is shorter than that of the common fox and more bushy and its toes are covered with fur on the under part like those of a hare it is smaller and more slender than the european fox its nose is sharp and black and its ears short and almost hid in the fur  it is sometimes taken in traps but its skin being of little value it is not hunted with much eagerness    the wolf all naturalists agree in placing the wolf and the dog in the same class and from the slightest inspection of their outward form only one would be led to conclude the wolf was in every respect a dog in its state of natural freedom the chief difference consists in the form of its head its eyes are fixed in a more oblique position and being of a brightgreen color give it a look of the most savage fierceness its ears are sharp and erect its tail long bushy and bending inwards between its hind legs its body is stronger than that of almost any species of dogs its jaws and teeth larger and its hair coarser and thicker the internal structure of these animals is however very similar the wolf couples in the same manner as the dog and its immediate separation is prevented from the same cause the time of gestation is also nearly the same and from a variety of successful experiments related by the celebrated dr hunter there is no longer any room to doubt that the wolf and the dog will copulate together and produce an intermediate species capable of subsequent propagation  the appetite of the wolf for every kind of animal food is excessively voracious and although nature has furnished it with every requisite for pursuing and conquering its prey it is frequently reduced to the last extremity and sometimes perishes for want of food so great is the general detestation of this destructive creature that all the wild animals endeavor to avoid it and most commonly escape by their superior swiftness  when pressed with hunger from repeated disappointments the wolf becomes ingenious from want and courageous from necessity it then braves every danger and even attacks those animals that are under the protection of man sometimes whole droves of them join in the cruel work of general devastation roam through the villages and attack the sheepfolds they dig the earth under the doors enter with dreadful ferocity and put every living creature to death before they depart the horse is the only tame animal that can defend itself against them all the weaker animals become their prey even man himself upon these occasions frequently falls a victim to their rapacity and it is said that when once they have tasted human blood they always give it the preference  from hence many superstitious stories have been told of the wolf the old saxons believed that it was possessed by some evil spirit and called it the werewolf and the french peasants from the same reason call it the lupgaru  the language of the poet is beautifully descriptive of this creatures insatiable fury  by wintry famine roused from all the tract of horrid mountains which the shining alps and wavy appenine and pyrences branch out stupendous into distant lands cruel as death and hungry as the grave burning for blood bony and ghaunt and grim assembling wolves in raging troops descend and pouring over the country bear along keen as the north wind sweeps the glossy snow all is their prize   the wolf has great strength especially in the muscles of his neck and jaws he can carry a sheep in his mouth and easily run off with it in that manner his bite is cruel and deadly and keener as it meets with less resistance but when opposed he is cautious and circumspect and seldom fights but from necessity he is harder and more robust but not so sensible as the dog he almost incessantly prowls about for prey and of all animals is the most difficult to conquer in the chase his sense of smelling is peculiarly strong he scents the track of animals and follows it with great perseverance the odor of carrion strikes him at the distance of near a league  wolves are capable of bearing want of food for a long time to allay their hunger they will sometimes fill their stomachs with mud they have been known to follow armies and assemble in troops upon the field of battle tear up such bodies as have been carelessly interred and devour them with insatiable avidity  in all ages the wolf has been considered as the most savage enemy of mankind and rewards given for its head various methods have been taken to rid the world of this rapacious invader pitfalls traps and poison have all been employed against him and happily for these islands the whole race has long been extirpated here king edgar attempted to effect it in england by remitting the punishment of certain crimes on producing a number of wolves tongues and in wales the tax of gold and silver was commuted for an annual tribute of wolves heads  some centuries after that these animals increased to such a degree as to become an object of royal attention and great rewards were given for destroying them camden informs us that certain persons held their lands on condition of hunting and destroying the wolves that infested the country whence they were called the wolvehunt in the reign of athelstan wolves abounded so much in yorkshire that a retreat was built at flixton to defend passengers from their attacks  as the ravages of these animals were greatest during winter particularly in january when the cold was severest our saxon ancestors distinguished that month by the title of wolfmoneth they also called an outlaw wolfshed as being out of the protection of the law and as liable to be killed as that destructive beast  they infested ireland many centuries after their extinction in england the last presentment for killing wolves being made in the county of cork about the year    0  these animals abund in the immense forests of germany where the following methods are taken to destroy them  in some very sequestered part of the forest they hang up a large piece of carrion to the branch of a tree having prviously made a train of some miles long leaving small pieces of putrid flesh here and there to allure the wolves to the  they then wait till it is dark and approach the place with great circumspection where they sometimes find two or three wolves assembled leaping up and straining themselves to catch the bait which is placed just within their reach and while the animals are busily employed in this way the hunters being provided with firearms seldom fail to dispatch them  in a convenient place at the foot of a declivity they make a small enclosure of strong pales so high that the wolf having once entered cannot return again an opening is left at the top of the bank and a sheep that has been long dead is the bait to which he is allured by long trains made from different places where he is known to haunt as soon as he arrives at the spot he examines every part of the enclosure and finding no other way to come at the booty he precipitates himself to the bottom and having made a plentiful meal endeavors in vain to reascend his disappointment at not being able to get back is productive of the most dreadful howlings which alarm his enemies and they either take him alive or dispatch him with bludgeons  it is remarkable that when this animal finds there is no possibility of escaping his courage entirely forsakes him and he is for some time so stupefied with fear that he may be killed without offering to resist or taken alive without much danger  wolves are sometimes taken in strong nets into which they are driven by the hunters who surround a large tract of land and with drums horns and other instruments accompanied with loud cries from a large company assembled upon the occasion drive the animals toward the entrance of the nets where they are entangled and killed with clubs and hatchets great care must be taken to secure them at first if they recover from their consternation they easily escape by tearing the net to pieces  wolves are found with some variety in almost every country of the world those of senegal are larger and fiercer than those of europe  in north america they are small of a dark color and may be easily tamed before the introduction of dogs the savages made use of them in hunting the wild animals of the country and they are still employed for the same purpose in the more remote parts of that vast continent they are said to hunt in packs and run down the deer by their scent  the appearance of these animals near the habitations of the indians sometimes indicates that the bison or the deer is at no great distance and when any of those are taken the wolves are rewarded with the offal  catesby affirms that the wolves of that country have mixed with the dogs carried thither by the europeans and produced an intermediate race  in the northern regions there are wolves entirely white and others of a deepblack  in mexico there is a variety of the wolf with a very large head strong jaws and great teeth on the upper lip it has strong bristles not unlike the softer spines of the porcupine of a gray and white color its ears are large and erect its body is ashcolored spotted with black on its sides there are black stripes from the back downward its neck is fat and thick covered with a loose skin marked with a long tawny stroke on the breast is another of the same kind the tail is long and tinged in the middle with tawny the legs and feet are striped with black it inhabits the hot parts of mexico or new spain is equally voracious with the european wolf attacks cattle and sometimes men  there are no wolves farther south on the new continent  the dog the services of this truly valuable creature have been so eminently useful to the domestic interests of men in all ages that to give the history of the dog would be little less than to trace mankind back to their original state of simplicity and freedom to mark the progress of civilization through the various changes of the world and to follow attentively the gradual advancement of that order which placed man at the head of the animal world and gave him a manifest superiority over every part of the brute creation  if we consider for a moment the state of man without the aid of this useful domestic  with what arts shall he oppose the numerous hosts of foes that surround him on all sides seeking every opportunity to encroach upon his possessions to destroy his labors or endanger his personal safety or how shall he bring into subjection such as are necessary for his wellbeing his utmost vigilance will not be sufficient to secure him from the rapacity of the one nor his greatest exertions enable him to overcome the speed of the other to maintain his independence to insure his safety and to provide for his support it was necessary that some one among the animals should be brought over to his assistance whose zeal and fidelity might be depended on and where amidst all the various orders of animated being could one be sound so entirely adapted to this purpose where could one be found so bold so tractable and so obedient as the dog without its assistance how could man have conquered tamed and reduced other animals into slavery how could he have hunted down and destroyed those noxious animals from whose rapacity his life was in continual danger  to confirm the truth of these observations we need only turn our attention to the present condition of those nations which are not yet emerged from a state of barbarism where the uses of the dog are but little known or attended to and we will find that they lead a precarious and wretched life of perpetual warfare with the still more savage inhabitants of the forest with which they are obliged to dispute the possession of their uncultivated fields and divide with them the fruits of their labors  from hence we may conclude that the attention of mankind in the earliest ages would be engaged in training and rendering this animal subservient to the important purposes of domestic utility and the result of this art has been the conquest and peaceable possession of the earth  of all animals the dog seems most susceptible of change and most easily modified by difference of climate food and education not only the figure of his body but his faculties habits and dispositions vary in a surprising manner in the same country one dog differs greatly from another and in different climates the very species seems to be changed nothing appears constant in these animals but their internal conformation which is alike in all in every other respect they are totally dissimilar they vary in size in figure in the length of the nose and shape of the head in the length and direction of the ears and tail in the color and quantity of the hair etc  to enumerate the different kinds or mark the discriminations by which each is distinguished would be a task as fruitless as it would be impossible to account for this wonderful variety or investigate the character of the primitive stock from which they must all have sprung would be equally vain  we have seen in the history of the cow and the sheep that those animals which have been long under the management of man never preserve the stamp of nature in its original purity in wild animals which still enjoy their original freedom from restraint and have the independent choice of food and climate this impression is still faithfully preserved but those which man has subdued transported from climate to climate changed their food habits and manner of living must necessarily have suffered the greatest alterations in their form and as the dog of all other domestic animals is most accustomed to this influence is endowed with dispositions the most docile and obedient is susceptible of every impression and submissive to every restraint we need not wonder that he should be subject to the greatest variety  to an attentive observer of the canine race it is truly wonderful and curious to observe the rapid changes and singular combinations of forms arising from promiscuous intercourse which everywhere present themselves they appear in endless succession and seem more like the effect of whimsical caprice than the regular and uniform production of nature so that in whatever light we consider the various mixtures which at present abound and render every idea of a systematic arrangement dubious and problematical we may fairly presume that the services of the dog would be first required in maintaining and preserving the superiority of man over those animals which were destined for his support  we shall therefore begin with  the shepherds dog this useful animal ever faithful to his charge reigns at the head of the flock where it is better heard and more attended to than even the voice of the shepherd safety order and discipline are the fruits of his vigilance and activity  in those large tracts of land which in many parts of our island are solely appropriated to the feeding of sheep and other cattle this sagacious animal is of the utmost importance immense flocks may be seen continually ranging over those extensive wilds as far as the eye can reach seemingly without control their only guide is the shepherd attended by his faithful dog the constant companion of his toils it receives his commands and is always prompt to execute them it is the watchful guardian of the flock prevents them from straggling keeps them together and conducts them from one part of their pasture to another it will not suffer any strangers to mix with them but carefully keeps off every intruder in driving a number of sheep to any distant part a welltrained dog never fails to confine them to the road watches every avenue that leads from it where he takes his stand threatening every delinquent he pursues the stragglers if any should escape and forces them into order without doing them the least injury if the herdsman be obliged to leave them he depends upon his dog to keep the flock together and as soon as he hears the wellknown signal this faithful creature conducts them to his master though at a considerable distance  there is a very remarkable singularity in the feet of the shepherds dog all of them have one and some two toes more than other dogs though they seem not to be of much use they appear to be destitute of muscles and hang dangling at the hind part of the leg more like an unnatural excrescence than a necessary part of the animal but the adage that nature has made nothing in vain ought to correct our decision on their utility which probably may exist unknown to us  this breed of dogs at present appears to be preserved in the greatest purity in the northern parts of scotland where its aid is highly necessary in managing the numerous herds of sheep bred in those extensive wilds    the cur dog is a trusty and useful servant to the farmer and grazier and although it is not taken notice of by naturalists as a distinct race yet it is now so generally used especially in the north of england and such great attention is paid in breeding it that we cannot help considering it as a permanent kind they are chiefly employed in driving cattle in which way they are extremely useful they are larger stronger and fiercer than the shepherds dog and their hair is smoother and shorter they are mostly of a black and white color their ears are halfpricked and many of them are whelped with short tails which seem as if they had been cut these are called selftailed dogs they bite very keenly and as they always make their attack at the heels the cattle have no defense against them in this way they are more than a match for a bull which they quickly compel to run their sagacity is uncommonly great they know their masters fields and are singularly attentive to the cattle that are in them a good dog watches goes his rounds and if any strange cattle should happen to appear amongst the herd although unbidden he quickly flies at them and with keen bites obliges them to depart  similar to the cur is that which is commonly used in driving cattle to the slaughter and as these dogs have frequently to go long journies great strength as well as swiftness is required for that purpose they are therefore generally of a mixed kind and unite in them the several qualities of the shepherds dog the cur the mastiff and the greyhound thus by a judicious mixture of different kinds the services of the dog are rendered still more various and extensive and the great purposes of domestic utility are more fully answered  the greenland dog the savage aspect and disposition of this dog seem to bear some affinity to the rigours of the climate it inhabits the pomeranian or wolf dog of m buffon the siberian lapland and iceland dogs are somewhat similar to it in the sharpness of their muzzles in their long shaggy hair and bushy curling tails the principal difference is in their size though much larger they all of them have some resemblance to the shepherds dog  most of the greenland dogs are white but some are spotted and some black they may rather be said to howl than bark the greenlanders sometimes eat their flesh they make garments of their skins and use them in drawing sledges to which they yoke them four five and sometimes six together five of these dogs that had escaped with their trappings were found in greenland and brought to this country a few years ago by one of our ships in the fishery   the dogs of kamschatka are commonly black or white they are strong nimble and active and are very useful in drawing sledges the only method of traveling in that dreary country during the winter they travel with great expedition captain king relates that during his stay there a courier with dispatches drawn by them performed a journey of   0 miles in less than four days the sledges are usually drawn by five dogs four of them yoked two and two abreast the foremost acts as a leader to the rest the reins being fastened to a collar round the leading dogs neck are of little use in directing the pack the driver depending chiefly upon their obedience to his voice with which he animates them to proceed great care and attention are consequently used in training up those for leaders which are more valuable according to their steadiness and docility the sum of forty roubles or ten pounds being no unusual price for one of them  the rider has a crooked stick answering the purpose both of whip and reins with which by striking on the snow he regulates the speed of the dogs or stops them at his pleasure when they are inattentive to their duty he often chastises them by throwing it at them he discovers great dexterity in regaining his stick which is the greatest difficulty attending his situation for if he should happen to lose his stick the dogs immediately discover the circumstance and seldom fail to set off at full speed and continue to run till their strength is exhausted or till the carriage is overturned and dashed to pieces or hurried down a precipice  in december      one of these dogs was left by a smuggling vessel near boomer on the coast of northumberland finding himself deserted he began to worry sheep and in that way did so much damage that he became the terror of the country within a circuit of above twenty miles we are assured that when he caught a sheep he bit a hole in its right side and after eating the tallow about the kidneys left it several of them thus lacerated were found alive by the shepherds and being taken proper care of some of them recovered and afterward had lambs  from his delicacy in this respect the destruction he made may in some measure be conceived as it may be supposed that the fat of one sheep in a day would hardly satisfy his hunger the farmers were so much alarmed by his depredations that various means were used for his destruction they frequently pursued him with hounds greyhounds etc but when the dogs came up with him he laid down on his back as if supplicating for mercy and in that position they never hurt him he therefore laid quietly taking his rest till the hunters approached when he made off without being followed by the hounds till they were again excited to the pursuit which always terminated unsuccessfully  and it is worthy of notice that he was one day pursued from howick to upwards of thirty miles distance but returned thither and killed sheep the same evening in march      his constant residence during the day was upon a rock on the heughhill near howick where he had a view of four roads that approached it and after many fruitless attempts he was at last shot there the bull dog is the fiercest of all the dog kind and is probably the most courageous creature in the world it is low in stature but very strong and well built its nose is short and the under jaw projects beyond the upper which gives it a fierce and unpleasing aspect  its courage in attacking the bull is well known its fury i seizing and its invincible obstinacy in maintaining its hold are truly astonishing it always aims at the front and generally fastens upon the lip the tongue the eye or some part of the face where it hangs in spite of every effort of the bull to disengage himself  the uncommon ardour of these dogs in fighting will be best illustrated by the following fact related by an eyewitness which at the same time corroborates in some degree that wonderful account of the dogs of epirus given by elian and quoted by dr goldsmith in his history of the dog  some years ago at a bullbaiting in the north of england when that barbarous custom was very common a young man confident of the courage of his dog laid some trifling wagers that he would at separate times cut off all the four feet of his dog and that after every amputation it would attack the bull the cruel experiment was tried and the dog continued to seize the bull as eagerly as if he had been perfectly whole  of late years this inhuman custom of baiting the bull has been almost entirely laid aside in the north of england and consequently there are now few of this kind of dogs to be seen  as the bull dog always makes his attack without barking it is very dangerous to approach him alone without the greatest precaution  the mastiff is much larger and stronger than the bull dog and seems every way formed for the important trust of guarding and securing the valuable property committed to his care houses gardens yards etc are safe from depredations whilst in his custody confined during the day as soon as the gates are locked he is left to range at full liberty he then goes round the premises examines every part of them and by loud barkings gives notice that he is ready to defend his charge  dr caius in his curious treatise on british dogs tells us that three of these animals were reckoned a match for a bear and four for a lion  we have a curious account recorded in stows annals of an engagement between three mastiffs and a lion in the presence of james the first one of the dogs being put into the den was soon disabled by the lion which took it by the head and neck and dragged it about another dog was then let loose and served in the same manner but the third being put in immediately seized the lion by the lip and held him for a considerable time till being severely torn by his claws the dog was obliged to quit its hold and the lion greatly exhausted in the conflict refused to renew the engagement but taking a sudden leap over the docs fled into the interior part of his den two of the dogs soon died of their wounds the last survived and was taken great care of by the kings son who said he that had fought with the king of beasts hold never after fight with any inferior creature  the mastiffs of great britain were noted in the time of the roman emperors who appointed an officer whose sole business it was to breed and send from hence such as would prove equal to the combats of the amphitheatre  the following anecdote will show that the mastiff conscious of its superior strength knows kow to chastise the impertinence of an inferior  a large dog of this kind belonging to the late m ridley esquire of heatton near newcastle being frequently molested by a mongrel and teazed by its continual barking at last took it up in his mouth by the back and with great composure dropped it over the quay into the river without doing any farther injury to an enemy so much his inferior  there are varieties of this animal some of which are produced by a mixture with the bull dog  the bandog is lighter smaller more active and less powerful than the mastiff its nose is smaller and siner and its hair rougher it is notwithstanding very fierce and employed in the same useful purposes as the mastiff  the dalmatian or coach dog has been erroneously called the danish dog and by m buffon the harrier of bengal but for what reason it is difficult to ascertain as its incapacity of scenting is sufficient to destroy all affinity to any dog employed in the pursuit of the hare  it is very common in this country at present and is frequently kept in genteel houses as an elegant attendant on a carriage to which its attention seems to be solely directed we do not however admire the cruel practice of depriving the poor animal of its ears in order to increase its beauty a practice so general that we do not remember ever to have seen one of these dogs unmutilated in that way  the irish greyhound is the largest of the dog kind and its appearance the most beautiful and majestic  it is only to be found in ireland where it was formerly of great use in clearing that country from wolves it is now extremely rare and is kept rather for show than use being equally unserviceable for hunting either the stag the fox or the hare  some of these dogs are about four feet high perfectly white and are made somewhat like a greyhound but more robust their aspect is mild and their disposition gentle and peaceable their strength is so great that in combat the mastiff or bull dog is far from being equal to them they always seize their antagonists by the back and shake them to death which their great size generally enables them to do with much ease  m buffon supposes the great danish dog to be only a variety of the irish greyhound  next to this in size and strength is  the scottish highland greyhound or wolf dog which was formerly used by the chieftains of that country in their grand hunting parties  one of them which we saw some years ago was a large powerful fiercelooking dog its ears were pendulous and its eyes half hid in the hair its body was strong and muscular and covered with harsh wiry reddish hair mixed with white  the gazehound was somewhat similar to the greyhound and like that animal hunted only by the eye it was formerly in great repute but is now unknown to us it was used in hunting either the fox the hare or the stag it would select from the rest the fattest deer pursue it by the eye and though it should rejoin the herd would infallibly fix upon the same and pursue it till taken    the greyhound m buffon supposes to be the irish greyhound rendered thinner and more delicate by the difference of climate and culture but whatever truth there may be in the fanciful arrangements of that ingenious author there is an evident similarity of form in all of those just mentioned particularly in the depth of the chest in the length of the legs and in the smallness of the muzzle  the greyhound is the sletest of all dogs and can outrun every animal of the chase but as it wants the faculty of scenting it only follows by the eye it was formerly held in such estimation as to be considered the peculiar companion of gentlemen and by the forest laws of king canute it was enacted that no person under that degree should presume to keep a greyhound  the small italian greyhound is not above half the size but perfectly similar in form its shape is exquisitely beautiful and delicate  it is not common in this country the climate being too rigorous for the extreme deliy of its constitution  the lurcher is somewhat shorter than the greyhound and its limbs stronger its body is covered with a rough coat of hair most commonly of a paleyellow color its aspect is sullen and its habits from whence it derives its name are dark and cunning  as this dog possesses the advantage of a fine scent it is often employed in killing hares and rabbits in the night time when taken to the warren it steals out with the utmost precaution watches and scents the rabbits while they are feeding and darts upon them without barking or making the least noise some of them will make incredible havoc in one night and are often so trained as to bring their booty to their master who waits in some convenient place to receive it we have seen a dog and bitch of this kind in the possession of a man who had formerly used them for the purpose above described he declared that he could at that time procure in an evening a many rabbits with them as he could carry home   they are so destructive and have been so often employed in illicit practices that they are now proscribed and the breed is almost extinct  another dog of this family formerly in use but now only known to us by its name is  the tumbler which was so called from its cunning manner of taking rabbits and other game it did not run directly at them but in a careless and inattentive manner tumbled itself about till it came within reach of its prey which it always seized by a sudden spring  the terrier has a most acute smell is generally an attendant on every pack of hounds and is very expert in foring foxes or other gae out of their coverts it is the determined enemy of all the vermin kind such as weasels foumarts badgers rats mice etc it is fierce keen and hardy and in its encounters with the badger sometimes meets with very severe treatment which it sustains with great courage and fortitude and a welltrained veteran dog frequently proves more than a match for that hardbitten animal  there are two kinds of terriers  the one rough shortlegged longbacked very strong and most commonly of a black or yellowish color mixed with white the other is smooth sleek and beautifully formed having a shorter body and more sprightly appearance it is generally of a reddishbrown color or black with tanned legs and is similar to the rough terrier in disposition and faculties but inferior in size strength and fierceness  the beagle of those dogs that are kept for the business of the chase in this country the beagle is the smallest and is only used in hunting the hare although far inferior in point of speed to that animal they follow by the exquisiteness of their scent and trace her footsteps through all her various windings with such exactness and perseverance that they afford most excellent diversion and generally reward the hunters toil with the death of the wearied fugitive their tones are soft and musical and add greatly to the pleasures of the chase  the harrier is nimble and vigorous and pursues the hare with the most impetuous eagerness gives her no time to breathe nor double and the most eager sportsmen generally find it sufficient exercise to keep in with their speed they exert their voices with great cheerfulness and make delightful harmony  a mixed breed between this and the large terrier forms a strong active and hardy hound used in hunting the otter it is rough wirehaired thickquartered longeared and thinshouldered  there is reason to suppose that the beagle and the harrier which only differs from it in being somewhat larger must have been introduced into great britain after the romans became masters of the island as before that period the britons were occupied in clearing their extensive forests of the various wild beasts such as wildboars bears wolves etc with which they abounded and for that purpose larger and stronger dogs than the harrier or the beagle would be required    the fox hound no country in europe can boast of foxhounds equal in swiftness strength or agility to those of britain where the utmost attention is paid to their breeding education and maintenance the climate also seems congenial to their nature for it has been said that when hounds of the english breed have been sent into france or other countries they quickly degenerate and in some degree lose those qualities for which they were originally so admirable in england the attachment to the chase is in some measure considered as a trait in the national character consequently it is not to be wondered at that our dogs and horses should excel all others in that noble diversion this propensity appears to be increasing in the nation and no price seems now thought too great for hounds of known excellence in      mr noels pack was sold to sir wm lowther bart for  000 guineas  the foxhounds generally preferred are tall lightmade but strong and possessed of great courage speed and activity  the habits and faculties of these dogs are so generally known as to render any description unnecessary dogs of the same kind are also trained to the hunting of the stag and other deer the following anecdote affords a proof of their wonderful spirit in supporting a continuity of exertion   some years since a very large stag was turned out of whinfield park in the county of westmoreland and pursued by the hounds of the right hon the earl of thanet till by fatigue or accident the whole pack were thrown out except two staunch and favorite dogs which continued the chase the greatest part of the day the stag returned to the park from whence he set out and as his last effort leapt the wall and expired as soon as he had accomplished it one of the hounds pursued to the wall but being unable to get over it laid down and almost immediately expired the other was also found dead at a small distance  the length of the chase is uncertain but as they were seen at redkirks near annan in scotland distant by the postroad about fortysix miles it is conjectured that the circuitous and uneven course they might be supposed to take would not be less than one hundred and twenty miles to commemorate this fact the horns of the stag which were the largest ever seen in that part of the country were placed on a tree of a most enormous size in the park afterward called the harthorn tree accompanied with this inscription   hercules killed heart ogreece and heart ogreece killed hercules the horns have been since removed and are now at julia bower in the same county    the old english hound is described by whitaker in his history of manchester as the original breed of this island used by the ancient britons in the chase of the larger kinds of game with which their country abounded at that time this valuable hound is distinguished by its great size and strength its body is long its chest deep its ears long and sweeping and the tone of its voice is peculiarly deep and mellow from the particular formation of its organs or from the extraordinary moisture that always adheres to its nose and lips or perhaps from some other unknown cause it is endued with the most exquisite sense of smelling and can often distinguish the scent an hour after the lighter beagles have given it up their slowness also disposes them to receive the directions of the huntsman but as they are able to hunt a cold scent they are too apt to make it so by their want of speed and tedious exactness these dogs were once common in every part of this island and were formerly much larger than at present the breed which has been gradually declining and its size studiously diminished by a mixture of other kinds in order to increase its speed is now almost extinct it seems to have been accurately described by shakespere in the following lines my hounds are bred out of the spartan kind so flewed so sanded and their heads are hung with ears that sweep away the morning dew crookkneed and dewlapd like thessalian bulls slow in pursuit but matched in mouth like bells each under each besides these there is a variety called the kibble hound produced by a mixture of the beagle and the old english  the blood hound was in great request with our ancestors and as it was remarkable for the fineness of its scent it was frequently employed in recovering game that had escaped wounded from the hunter it could follow with great certainty the footsteps of a man to a considerable distance and in barbarous and uncivilized times when the thief or murderer had fled this useful creature would trace him through the most secret and thickest coverts nor would it cease its pursuit till it had taken the felon for this reason there was a law in scotland that whoever denied entrance to one of these dogs in pursuit of stolen goods should be deemed an accessory but as the arm of justice is now extended over every part of the country and there are no secret recesses where villainy may lay concealed these services are no longer necessary in scotland it was distinguished by the name of the sleuth hound  some few of these dogs are still kept in the southern part of the kingdom and are used in the pursuit of deer that have been previously wounded by a shot to draw blood the scent of which enables them to pursue with most unerring steadiness  they are also employed in discovering deerstealers whom they infallibly trace by the blood that issues from the wounds of their victims  the bloodhound is taller than the old english hound most beautifully formed and superior to every other kind in activity speed and sagacity they seldom bark except in the chase and are commonly of a reddish or brown color  somervile thus beautifully describes their mode of pursuing the nightly spoiler  soon the sagacious brute his curling tail flourished in air low bending plies around his busy nose the steaming vapor snuffs inquisitive nor leaves one turf untried till conscious of the recent stains his heart beats quick his snuffling nose his active tail attest his joy then with deepopning mouth that makes the welkin tremble he proclaims the audacious felon foot by foot he marks his winding way while all the listening crowd applaud his reasnings over the watery ford dry sandy heaths and stony barren hills over beaten paths with men and beasts distained unerring he pursues till at the cot arrived and seizing by his guilty throat the catif vile redeems the captive prey so exquisitely delicate his sense   the newfoundland dog the drawing of this dog was taken from a very fine one at eslington in the county of northumberland its dimensions were as follow  from its nose to the end of its tail it measured six feet two inches the length of its tail one foot ten inches from one forefoot right over its shoulders to the other five feet seven inches girt behind the shoulder three feet two inches round its head over its ears two feet round the upper part of its foreleg nine inches and a half it is webfooted can swim extremely fast dive with great ease and bring up any thing from the bottom of the water it is naturally fond of fish and eats raw trouts or other small fish out of the nets  this breed of dogs was originally brought from the country of which they bear the name where their great strength and docility render them extremely useful to the fishers on those coasts who use them in bringing down wood from the interior parts of the country to the seaside three or four of them yoked to a sledge will draw two or three hundred weight of wood piled upon it for several miles with great ease they are not attended with a driver nor any person to guide them but after having delivered their loading they return immediately to the woods where they are accustomed to be fed with dried fish etc  the extraordinary sagacity of these dogs and their attachment to their masters render them highly valuable in particular situations among the innumerable instances wherein they have displayed those faculties the following anecdotes appear to be not unworthy of notice   during a severe storm in the winter of      a ship belonging to newcastle was lost near yarmouth and a newfoundland dog alone escaped to the shore bringing in his mouth the captains pocketbook he landed amidst a number of people that were assembled several of whom in vain endeavored to take it from him the sagacious animal as if sensible of the importance of the charge which in all probability was delivered to him by his perishing master at length leaped fawningly against the breast of a man who had attracted his notice among the crowd and delivered the book to him the dog immediately returned to the place where he had landed and watched with great attention for every thing that came from the wrecked vessel seizing them and endeavoring to bring them to land  the following is another instance of their great docility and strength of observation   a gentleman walking by the side of the river tyne and observing on the opposite side a child fall into the water gave notice to his dog which immediately jumped in swam over and catching hold of the child with its mouth brought it safe to land  the rough water dog this dog from its great attachment to the water may be placed at the head of those that frequent that element it is websooted swims with great ease and is used in hunting ducks and other aquatic birds it is frequently kept on board of vessels for the purpose of taking up birds that are shot and drop into the sea and from its aptness to fetch and carry it is useful in recovering any thing that has fallen overboard  there is a variety of this kind much smaller  they are both remarkable for their long and shaggy coat which frequently incommodes them by growing over their eyes  the large water spaniel this beautiful animal is remarkable for its docile and obedient disposition as well as its attachment to its master it receives instructions with readiness and obeys with uncommon alacrity  its form is elegant its hair beautifully curled or crisped its ears long and its aspect mild and sagacious  it is fond of the water and swims well it is chiefly used in discovering the haunts of wildducks and other water fowl and also in finding birds that have been shot or disabled  it is probably the finder described by caius    the small water spaniel is similar to the other in form habits and disposition and its capacity for receiving instruction is equally good with looks of extreme attention and sensibility it observes the motions of its master and catches the wellknown signal with amazing promptitude  the various tricks which these dogs are sometimes taught to perform seem more like the effect of reasoning powers than of undiscerning instinct    the springer or cocker is lively active and pleasant an unwearied pursuer of its game and very expert in raising woodcocks and snipes from their haunts in woods and marshes through which it ranges with amazing perseverance  of the same kind is that beautiful little dog which in this country is well known under the appellation of king charless dog the favorite and constant companion of that monarch who was generally attended by several of them it is still preserved as an idle but innocent companion  its long ears curled hair and webfeet evidently point out its alliance with the more useful and active kind last mentioned  similar to this but smaller is the pyrame dog it is generally black with reddish legs and above each eye is a spot of the same color  still farther removed we have the shock dog a diminutive creature almost hid in the great quantity of its hair which covers it from head to foot  another variety is the lion dog so called from the shaggy hair which covers the head and all the fore part of the body whilst the hinder part is quite smooth saving a tuft of hair at the end of the tail this species is become extremely rare  the comforter is a most elegant little animal and is generally kept by the ladies as an attendant of the toilette or the drawingroom  from these and a mixture of others proceeds a numberless variety of messets lapdogs waps mongrels and compounds without end    the english setter is a hardy active handsome dog its scent is exquisite and it ranges with great speed and wonderful perseverance its sagacity in discovering the various kinds of game and its caution in approaching them are truly astonishing but as the uses of this valuable dog are so well known we will conclude with the following beautiful quotation from somervile  when autumn smiles allbeauteous in decay and paints each checkered grove with various hue my setter ranges in the newshorn field his nose in air erect from ridge to ridge panting he bounds his quartered ground divides in equal intervals nor careless leaves one inch untried at length the tainted gales his nostrils wide inhale quick joy elates his beating heart which awed by discipline severe he dares not own but cautious creeps lowcowring step by step at last attains his proper distance there he stops at once and points with his instructive nose upon the trembling prey    the spanish pointer is of foreign origin as its name seems to imply but it is now naturalized in this country which has long been famous for dogs of this kind the greatest attention being paid to preserve the breed in its utmost purity  this dog is remarkable for the aptness and facility with which it receives instruction it may be said to be almost selftaught whilst the english pointer requires the greatest care and attention in breaking and training to the sport the spanish pointer however is not so durable and hardy nor so able to undergo the fatigues of an extensive range it is chiefly employed in finding partridges pheasants etc either for the gun or the net  it is said that an english nobleman robert dudley duke of northumberland was the first that broke a settingdog to the net  many of the settingdogs now used by sportsmen are a mixed breed between the english and spanish pointer  the new south wales dog is of a very savage nature it neither barks nor growls but when vexed erects the hairs of its whole body like bristles and appears extremely furious  it is fond of rabbits and chickens which it eagerly devours raw but will not touch dressed meat  its great agility gives it much the advantage over other animals superior in size one of them sent to this country from botanybay was so extremely fierce as to seize on every animal it faw and if not restrained would have run down deer and sheep an ass had also nearly fallen a victim to its fury  the height of this species is rather less than two feet the length two feet and a half the head is formed much like that of a fox the ears short and erect the general color is a palebrown lighter on the belly the feet and inside of the legs white the tail is rather long and bushy somewhat like that of a fox  we have now given a short account of the most conspicuous figures which compose this numerous group and have arranged them in such a manner as to exhibit their several characters with as little confusion as possible  from these which may be considered as the root a numberless and intricate variety of branches shoot out in every direction such a combination of forms and dispositions as no art can discriminate of these we shall just mention as being the most useful the turnspit which is generally longbodied has short crooked legs its tail curled upon its back and is frequently spotted with black upon a bluegrey ground it is peculiar in the color of its eyes the same dog often having the iris of one eye black and the other white  it is a bold vigilant and spirited little dog at present however its services seem but little attended to a more certain method of doing the business of the spit having superseded the labors of this industrious animal  the pug dog in outward appearance is every way formed like the bulldog but much smaller and its tail curled upon its back  it was formerly very common in many parts of england however at present it is rarely to be met with although it has no longer its admirers here mrs piozzi informs us that she saw great numbers at padua in italy and that it still maintains its place in the favor of the fairones of that country  that all these however divided compose one general family is apparent from the facility with which they intermix produce and reproduce in all of them the same attachment to mankind the same pliant and humble disposition submitting with patience to the various indignities to which they are exposed by their dependant situation is eminently observable even those that by accident or neglect have been abandoned and become wild when taken home are easily reclaimed by kindness and attention they quickly become familiar and continue faithfully attached to their masters  multitudes of these are to be found in southamerica which have sprung from those taken thither by the europeans they breed in holes like rabbits are formed somewhat like a greyhound have erect ears are very vigilant and excellent in the chase  thus we find that the attachment of the dog to mankind is spontaneous and when once engaged it seems beyond the power of ill usage to subdue those inherent qualities  to mention some of the more common instances of this creatures sagacity by way of elucidating its general character may not be amiss and amongst these its care in directing the steps of the blind man is not the least worthy of notice there are few who have not seen an unfortunate object of this description led by his dog through the various passages of a populous town to the accustomed place where he fits to supplicate the contributions of passengers it may sometimes be seen to stop at particular houses to receive the morsel from the hand of charity or pick from the ground the money thrown out to relieve him when the day is passed it conducts him home again and gratefully receives as the reward of its services the scanty pittance which poverty and wretchedness can bestow  dogs will sometimes imitate the actions of their masters will open a door that is fastened with a latch or pull a bell where they are desirous of gaining admittance  faber mentions one belonging to a nobleman of the medici family which always attended at its masters table took from him his plates and brought him others and if he wanted wine would carry it to him in a glass placed upon a silver plate which it held in its mouth without spilling the smallest drop the same dog would also hold the stirrups in its teeth whilst its master was mounting his horse  that these animals are capable of mutual attachment is evident from the wellknown story of the dog at st albans which being left by its master at an inn there till he returned from london and being illtreated by a large dog belonging to the house stole privately off and returning again with a friend that was much larger and stronger than itself they both fell upon the aggressor and punished him severely for his cruelty to a stranger  there are several peculiarities common to all animals of the dog kind briefly mentioned by linnaeus with which we shall conclude its history the principal of which are as follow  the dog is carnivorous its stomach digests bones it eats grass for a vomit voids its urine sideways and commonly where other dogs have done so before smells at a stranger scarcely ever sweats but lolls out its tongue when hot remembers injuries done to it is subject to the hydrophobia its sense of hearing very quick when asleep is supposed to dream goes with young sixtythree days and commonly brings forth from four to eight at one time it barks at strange dogs snaps at a stone thrown at it howls at certain musical notes when about to lie down frequently goes round the place fawns at the approach of its master and will not patiently suffer any one to strike him runs before him on a journey often going over the same ground on coming to cross ways stops looks back and waits to observe which of them he takes sits up and begs and when it has committed a theft slinks away with its tail between its legs is an enemy to beggars and illlooking people and attacks them without the least provocation is also said to be sick at the approach of bad weather  we cannot however agree with the learned naturalist when he asserts that the male puppies resemble the dog and the female the bitch or that it is a character common to the whole species that the tail always bends to the left side to these we may add as equally void of foundation a remark of m buffon that a female hound covered with a dog of her own kind has been known to produce a mixed race consisting of hounds and terriers  we barely mention these to show that too much caution cannot be used in forming general characters or systematic arrangements and we leave it to the experience of the most inattentive observer to detect such palpable absurdities    the hare this harmless and inoffensive animal destitute of every means of defense and surrounded on all sides by its enemies would soon be utterly extirpated if nature ever kind and provident had not endowed it with faculties by which it is frequently enabled to evade their pursuit  fearful of every danger and attentive to every alarm the hare is continually upon the watch and being provided with very long ears moveable at pleasure and easily directed to every quarter is warned of the most distant approaches of danger its eyes are large and prominent adapted to receive the rays of light on every side and give notice of more immediate alarms to these may be added its great swiftness by which it soon leaves most of its pursuers far behind  the hind are much longer than the fore legs and are furnished with strong muscles which give the hare a singular advantage in running against a hill and as if sensible of its powers in this respect it is always observed to fly toward rising ground when first started  it is curious to observe how admirably every limb and member of this creature is formed for speed  thus made for escape the hare might be supposed to enjoy a state of tolerable security but as every rapacious creature is its enemy it is seldom permitted to live out its natural term dogs and foxes pursue it by instinct wild cats and weasels of all kinds catch and devour it birds of prey are still more dangerous enemies whilst man far more powerful than all makes use of every artifice to obtain an animal which constitutes one of the numerous delicacies of his table  if we were to enumerate the various stratagems which ingenuity has suggested to circumvent this persecuted creature we would willingly omit the notable achievements and gallant exploits of the chase which to a cool and dispassionate observer seem to demand a nobler game  poor is the triumph over the timid hare another remarkable means of safety to the hare is its color which being similar to the ground where it sits secures it from the sight of its enemies and as a further instance of the care of providence in the preservation of its creatures these as well as some other animals in more northern regions are observed to change their color and become perfectly white during winter which renders them less conspicuous in the snow  some rare instances occur of white hares being met with in great britain  the hare is a very prolific animal and breeds three or four times in the year the females go with young thirty days and generally bring forth three or four at a litter the rutting season begins in february  during the day hares sleep or repose in their seats and seldom remove from them the night is the season when they go about in search of food and they are sure to return to their forms or seats by the same paths which they took in leaving them  it is instinct that directs the jealous hare to choose her soft abode with step reversed she forms the doubling maze then ere the morn peeps through the clouds leaps to her close recess the fur of the hare is of great use in making hats for which purpose many thousands of their skins are annually imported from russia  the hare was reckoned a great delicacy among the romans but was forbidden to the jews and held sacred among the ancient britons who religiously abstained from eating it  we are told that boadicea immediately before her last conflict with the romans let loose a hare she had concealed in her bosom which taking what was deemed a fortunate course was looked upon as a good omen  it is to this day deemed unclean by the mahometans  the hare is found in most parts of the world with very little variety those of north america are rather less than the european frequent marshes and meadows and when pursued take refuge in hollow trees    the alpine hare is gray in summer with a slight mixture of black and tawny its hair is soft its ears shorter and its legs more slender than the common hares  in winter the whole body changes to a snowy whiteness except the tips and edges of the ears which remain black  this animal lives on the highest hills in scotland norway lapland russia and siberia never descends from the mountains nor mixes with the common hare although they abound in the same parts it does not run fast and when pursued often takes shelter in clefts of rocks it is easily tamed is very frolicsome and fond of honey and other sweets it changes its color in september and resumes its gray coat in april  troops of five or six hundred are sometimes seen which migrate toward the south in spring and return in autumn    the rabbit notwithstanding the great similarity between the hare and the rabbit nature has placed an inseparable bar between them in not allowing them to intermix to which they mutually discover the most extreme aversion besides this there is a wide difference in their habits and propensities the rabbit lives in holes in the earth where it brings forth its young and retires from the approach of danger whilst the hare prefers the open fields and trusts to its speed for safety  the fecundity of the rabbit is truly astonishing it breeds seven times in the year and generally produces eight young at a time from which it is calculated that one pair may increase in the course of four years to the amazing number of       0 so that if frequent reductions were not made in various ways there is reason to apprehend they would soon exceed the means of their support and overrun the face of the country but as their increase is great so is the number of their enemies for besides those that are taken for the use of man great numbers are devoured by foxes weasels foumarts and other beasts of prey  in spain they formerly increased to such a degree as to become obnoxious and the inhabitants were obliged to procure ferrets from africa to destroy them  the rabbit is capable of procreating at the age of five or six months the female goes with young about thirty days previous to her bringing forth she makes a bed with down that she pulls off her own coat she never leaves her young but when pressed with hunger and returns as soon as that is allayed which she does with surprising quickness during the time she tends and suckles her young she carefully conceals them from the male lest he should devour them and frequently covers up the mouth of the hole that her retreat may not be discovered  the rabbit lives to the age of eight or nine years and prefers warm and temperate climates  pliny and aristotle mention it as being anciently known only in greece and spain it is now however common in various parts of europe  in sweden and other cold countries it can only be reared in houses  this animal abounds in great britain where its skin forms a very considerable article in the manufacture of hats lincolnshire norfolk and cambridgeshire are most noted for the production of them  the fesh of the rabbit as well as the hare was forbidden to the jews and mahometans    the domestic rabbit is of various colors  white brown black and variegated it is somewhat larger than the wild rabbit but its flesh is not so good being softer and more insipid its food is generally cabbage leaves colewort blades of corn sourdock and other succulent plants but sweet short hay with a little clean oats make the best diet  the rabbit of angora like the goat and sheep of that country is covered with long hair which falls down its side in wavy curls and is of a silky sineness  in russia there is a very remarkable variety of the rabbit having a double skin over the back into which it can withdraw its head it likewise conceals its fore legs in a part which falls down under the throat there are small holes in this loose skin on the back which admit light to the eyes the color of the body is cinereous that of the head and ears is brown  a manuscript account of this animal with a drawing by mr g edwards is preserved in the british museum  the rabbit is not a native of america there are great numbers of them in many of the west india islands which have originated from a stock carried thither from europe  the guineapig or restless cavy this little animal though a native of brazil lives and propagates in temperate and even in cold climates when protected from the inclemency of the seasons  great numbers are kept in a domestic state but for what purpose can hardly be determined they have neither beauty nor utility to recommend them their skins are of little value and their flesh though eatable is far from being good their habits and disposition are equally unpleasant and disgusting void of attachment even to their own offspring they suffer them to be devoured the moment they are brought forth without making the smallest attempt to defend them the males frequently destroy their own young and are so stupid as to allow themselves to be killed by cats without resistance they pass their whole lives in sleeping eating and in the propagation of their species they are by nature gentle and tame they do no mischief but seem to be equally incapable of good  rats are said to avoid the places where they reside  the guineapig is considerably less than the rabbit its upper lip is only half divided it has two cuttingteeth in each jaw large and broad ears its hair is of different colors  white varied with orange and black in irregular patches has no tail is a restless animal feeds on bread grain and vegetables and makes a noise like the grunting of a pig  this creature is capable of breeding at the age of two months produces from four to twelve at one time and the species would be innumerable if many of them were not taken off by various means some are killed by cats others by the males and more both young and old perish by the severity of the climate and want of proper care  the paca or spotted cavy is peculiar to southamerica frequents warm and moist places chiefly by the banks of rivers digs holes in the ground where it secrets itself during the day at night it goes out in quest of food is larger than a hare its body thick round and plump like a young pig and very fat it is covered with short coarse hair of a dusky color beautifully marked with lines of white spots disposed longitudinally its head is round and thick ears broad and eyes large and prominent the end of its nose is broad of a black color and divided like that of the hare the upper jaw projects beyond the under in each are two very long cuttingteeth as yellow as saffron and strong enough to gnaw wood its legs are short and clumsy on each foot are five toes armed with long sharp claws its tail very short  the motions of this animal are heavy and ungraceful it runs seldom and with extreme aukwardness sits frequently upon its posteriors and in that situation smooths and dresses itself with its paws drawing them over its body with the utmost nicety it is a cleanly animal and will not bear the smallest degree of dirtiness in its apartment  in a domestic state this creature is gentle and tractable fond of attention and licks the hand of any one that caresses it when irritated it is apt to bite and discovers a strange aversion to children whom it always pursues its anger is expressed by chattering its teeth and is always preceded by a kind of grunting  it feeds on grain roots fruits and almost every kind of vegetable  in a wild state this animal is caught with difficulty when pursued it takes to the water and escapes by ding and if attacked by dogs makes a vigorous defense  its flesh is esteemed a great delicacy by the natives of brazil  there is reason to suppose that the species might be  naturalized in this country and added to our stock of ueful animals it is not much afraid of cold and  accustomed to burrow in the earth would by that means defend itself against the rigours of our winter  one of this species would furnish as much good meat as seven or eight rabbits  at cayenne there are several varieties of them weighing from fourteen to twenty and even thirty pounds  the agouti or longnosed cavy is about the size of a hare its nose is long upper lip divided skin sleek and shining of a brown color mixed with red tail short legs slender and almost naked has four toes on the fore feet and three on the hind grunts like a pig its appetite is extremely voracious when satiated with food it conceals the remainder sits on its hind legs and feeds itself with its paws it eats fruits roots nuts and almost every kind of vegetable is hunted with dogs runs fast and its motions are like those of a hare its flesh which resembles that of a rabbit is eaten by the inhabitants of southamerica great numbers of them are found in guiana and brazil where they live in woods hedges and hollow trees the female brings forth at all times of the year and produces three four and sometimes five at a time if taken when young the agouti is easily tamed and will go out and return of its own accord it delights in cutting or gnawing every thing with its teeth when irritated the hair of its back rises it strikes the ground with its hind feet and at the same time makes a noise like the grunting of a pig  the akouchi seems to be a variety of the agouti and though somewhat less is nearly of the same form but its tail is longer it inhabits the same countries is of an olive color its flesh is white delicate and has the flavor of a young rabbit is much esteemed by the natives who hunt it with dogs and reckon it among the finest game of south america  the rock cavy is likewise found in brazil is about twelve inches in length the color of the upper part of its body resembles that of the hare its belly is white the upper lip divided the ears short and rounded like those of a rat and has no tail it moves like the hare its fore legs being shorter than the hind it has four toes on the fore feet and only three on the hind its flesh is like that of the rabbit and their manner of living is also very similar  the squirrel this beautiful little animal is equally admirable for the neatness and elegance of its formation as for its liveliness and activity its disposition is gentle and harmless though naturally wild it is soon familiarised to confinement and restraint and though excessively timid it is easily taught to receive with freedom the most familiar caresses from the hand that feeds it it usually lives in woods and makes its nest of moss or dry leaves in the hollows of trees it seldom descends upon the ground but leaps from tree to tree with great agility its food consists of fruits almonds nuts acorns etc of which it accumulates great stores for winter provisions and secures them carefully near its nest in the summer it feeds on buds and young shoots and is particularly fond of the cones of the fir and pine trees the spring is the season of love with squirrels at that time the males pursue the females and exhibit wonderful proofs of agility whilst the latter as if to make trial of the constancy of their lovers seem to avoid them by a variety of entertaining sallies and like true coquets feign an escape by way of enhancing the value of the conquest they bring forth four or five young at a time  the squirrel is of a brightbrown color inclining to red the breast and belly are white the ears are ornamented with long tufts of hair the eyes are large black and lively the fore teeth strong and sharp the fore legs are curiously furnished with long stiff hairs which project on each side like whiskers when it eats it sits erect and uses its fore paws as hands to convey food to its mouth the tail of the squirrel is its greatest ornament and serves as a defense from the cold being large enough to cover the whole body it likewise assists it in taking leaps from one tree to another and we may add a third application of it which would seem altogether improbable if we were not assured of it by linnaeus and other naturalists  in attempting to cross a lake or river the squirrel places itself upon a piece of bark and erecting its tail to catch the wind boldly commits itself to the mercy of the waves the smallest gust of wind is sufficient to overset a whole navy of these little adventurers and in such perilous voyages many hundreds of them are said to perish  of the squirrel there are several varieties some of which are to be found in almost every country but they chiefly abound in northern and temperate climates the hudsonsbay squirrel is smaller than the european it is marked along the middle of the back with a dusky line from head to tail the belly is of a paleash color mttled with black and the tail which is dusky and barred with black is not so long nor so full of hair as the common kind  the gray squirrel is about the size of a young rabbit its ears are short and not tufted at the ends its hair is gray mixed with black on each side there is a red streak which runs lengthways its tail is long and bushy of a gray color variegated with black and white it is common to both continents in sweden and other northern countries it changes its color in the winter it is very numerous in north america and does incredible damage to the plantations great flocks of them descend from the mountains and lay waste the fields of maize by eating the young ears a reward of threepence per head was given for every one that was killed and such numbers were destroyed in one year that pensylvania alone paid in rewards the sum of  000 l of its currency  the gray squirrel makes its nest in hollow trees with moss straw wool etc it lays up stores of provisions in holes made in the ground which it visits occasionally when in want of meat these are often destroyed by swine and sometimes so long covered with snow that the squirrels perish for want of food they are not easily shot but evade the gun with great quickness the moment they see it levelled they are easily tamed and their flesh is esteemed very delicate  the fur of these animals is very valuable and is imported under the name of petitgris  the black squirrel is about the same size and form with the last but its tail is not so long it is generally black with white on the nose ears and end of the tail its disposition and habits are so similar to the gray squirrel that it might be taken for a variety of that kind but it is said to associate in separate troops and is equally numerous  this creature is found in the northern parts of asia north america and mexico in the latter country there is a variety with plain round ears the upper part of the body variegated with black white and brown  it is twice the size of the common squirrel lives under ground where it brings forth its young and lays in its stock of provisions it feeds on maize and is extremely lively gentle and docile it is the coquallin of m buffon  the little ground squirrel is very numerous in the forests of north america as well as the north of asia  it burrows in the ground and makes two entrances to its habitation that if one should be stopped up it may have access by the other its hole is formed with great skill having several branches from the principal passage each of which is terminated by a storehouse in which its winter food is deposited in one is contained acorns in another nuts in a third maize and in another chestnuts which are its favorite food  these animals seldom stir out during winter or so long as their provisions last when those fail they sometimes work their way into places where apples are laid up or into barns where maize is stored and make great havoc during harvest they fill their mouths so full with corn that their cheeks are quite distended and carry it off to their concealed store they give great preference to certain kinds of food and if after filling their mouths with rye they chance to meet with wheat they discharge the former that they may secure the latter  the ground squirrel is marked with a stripe of black which runs along the ridge of the back and on each side a yellow stripe bordered with black its head body and tail are of a reddishbrown breast and belly white its nose and feet of a palered color its eyes full and lively it is very wild bites severely and is tamed with difficulty its skin is of little value    the barbary squirrel is of an ash color inclining to red each side is beautifully marked with two white stripes running lengthways its belly is white its tail bushy and variegated with regular shades of black one beneath the other its eyes are full and black with white orbits it is about the size of the common squirrel  similar to this is the palm squirrel having a paleyellow stripe on the middle of the back and two on each side parallel to it the belly is of the same color the rest of the body black and red closely mixed its tail is long does not lie on its back like that of the squirrel but is carried erect  both these squirrels inhabit barbary and other hot countries  they live chiefly in palm trees from whence the latter has its name  the fat squirrel is found in france and the southern parts of europe its body is covered with soft hair of an ash color its belly whitish its ears thin and naked it is about six inches long and thicker than the common squirrel it dwells chiefly in trees leaps from bough to bough feeds on fruits and acorns and lodges in the hollows of trees it remains in a torpid state during winter and grows very fat  it was considered as a great delicacy among the romans who had places constructed on purpose to keep and feed them in which they called gliraria  the greater dormouse or garden squirrel is rather less than the last mentioned its eyes are surrounded with a large black spot which reaches to the ears its body is of a tawny color its throat and belly white tinged with yellow its tail is long and bushy at the end  it is common in the south of europe infests gardens is particularly fond of peaches and very destructive to all kinds of fruit it lodges in holes in the walls and brings forth five or six young at a time it has a strong odor like a rat and like the fat squirrel remains torpid during the winter    the lesser dormouse is rather larger than the mouse of a tawny red color with a white throat and full black eyes it lives in woods or thick hedges makes its nest with grass dried leaves or moss in the hollow of a tree or the bottom of a thick bush and brings forth three or four young at a time it lays up stores of nuts acorns and beans and retires at the approach of cold weather to its retreat where it rolls itself up in a warm nest made of soft moss etc and remains in a torpid state during the continuance of winter the warmth of a sunny day or a temporary change from cold to heat will sometimes revive it but after taking a little food it soon relapses into its former state    the flying squirrel is peculiarly distinguished by a membranous continuation of the skin of the sides and belly which extends from the fore to the hind feet and assists it greatly in making leaps from one tree to another frequently at the distance of twenty or thirty yards its head is small and round and its upper lip cloven its eyes are full round and black and its ears small and naked  this creature is found in all the northern regions both of the old and new continents it is more numerous in america than in europe is less than the common squirrel lives in trees and sleeps in the day but is extremely active during the night  in the act of leaping the loose skin is stretched out by the feet whereby the surface of the body is augmented the animal becomes lighter in proportion to its bulk the acceleration of its fall is retarded and it appears to sail or fly from one place to another where a number of them are seen at a time leaping they appear like leaves blown off by the wind  there are several kinds differing much in size  in the islands of the east indies there is a variety as large as a hare called the taguan or great flying squirrel which perfectly resembles the other in figure and in the form of its lateral membrane the head is smaller in proportion to the size of the body the color of the skin is darkbrown mixed with white the under part of the body whitish the tail is brown and grows gradually deeper toward the end where it is black the claws are long thin and hooked like those of a cat which enable it to keep hold where it happens to fall it also catches hold with its tail which is long and muscular it is a wild and timid animal its bite is so strong that it can make its escape from a wooden cage with great facility  a variety is found in virginia called by mr pennant the hooded squirrel the lateral membrane beginning at the chin and ears where it forms a kind of hood and extending like that of the former from the fore to the hind legs its body is of a reddish color abe and of a yellowishash beneath it is a rare species not much noticed by naturalists    the marmot has been placed by naturalists in the same class with the hare and the rat kind and on examining its parts we find a partial agreement with both these animals in its nose and lips as well as in the general form of its head it resembles the hare its ears are like those of the rat with which it likewise agrees in the number and form of its teeth and claws in other respects it is no way similar to either of those kinds and it is still farther separated from them by habitudes which seem peculiar to itself and distinguish it from almost every other species of quadrupeds  the marmot inhabits the highest regions of the alps it is likewise found in poland ukraine and chinese tartary is somewhat less than a hare its ears are round and so short that they are almost hid in the fur its tail is short and bushy the hair on the back is of a brownishash color and that on the belly reddish soft and bushy its voice resembles the murmuring of a young puppy when irritated or frightened it makes a whistling noise very loud and piercing to the ear it feeds on insects roots and vegetables but when tamed is remarkably fond of milk and butter it lives in holes formed with great art in the side of a mountain there are two entrances to each and the chamber to which they lead is deep and spacious the bottom is lined with moss and hay of which these provident animals lay in a store during summer and at the approach of winter shut themselves up in their holes by stopping the entrances with earth so effectually that no discovery can be made of the place of their retreat the chamber in which they lodge is large enough to contain a family of from five to a dozen marmots they roll themselves up and being well covered with hay remain in a torpid state insensible to the rigours of the season and perfectly secure from the storm that rages without till the chearing influence of the sun again calls them out to renew their exhausted strength to propagate their kind and provide for their future retreat the torpid state lasts from about michaelmas till april they go in extremely fat but gradually waste and at the end of their long sleep they appear lean and extremely emaciated  the marmot produces once a year and the litter generally consists of three or four  when a number of them are feeding together they place one as a sentinel which makes a whistling noise on the least appearance of interruption and the party immediately betake themselves to their holes the sentinel driving up the rear  the marmot is a very playful animal and is easily tamed it learns to hold a stick to dance and to exhibit various gestures it will obey the voice of its master and like the cat has an antipathy to dogs which it attacks fiercely upon the least irritation it is very apt to gnaw linen or woollen stuffs it often sits upright or walks with ease on its hind feet it eats in the manner of a squirrel and carries its food to its mouth with its fore paws its flesh is sometimes eaten but is always attended with a disagreeable odor  the monax is found in various parts of north america and seems to be the same with the marmot of canada described by m buffon  it is larger than a rabbit and in form and color resembles the musk rat its tail is short and rough its ribs so flexible that it can easily pass through a hole of not more than two inches diameter its eyes are black and prominent its back is of a deepbrown color lighter on the sides and belly and its feet and legs black  like the former it sleeps during winter in holes under the roots of trees and lives on fruits and other vegetables its flesh is good and well tasted  an animal of the same kind is found in the bahama isles but whether it retires to sleep in a climate so mild is not well known    the quebec marmot is rather larger than a rabbit its ears are short and its whole head round its cheeks are of a gray color and its nose black its back is variegated each hair being gray at the bottom black in the middle and white at the tips its belly and legs are of an orange color its toes black and naked and its tail short and rather bushy it inhabits hudsons bay and canada  one of them exhibited in london some years ago was perfectly tame  mr pennant supposes it to be the species called the sifileur by the french of canada    the hamster although the qualities of this animal are sufficiently noxious to render it an object of universal detestation in those countries where it abounds yet when considered with regard to those instincts which conduce to its own preservation and support it well deserves our highest admiration its habitation is curious and constructed with great art it consists of a variety of apartments adapted to various purposes and extremely well fitted both for the comfort and convenience of the inhabitants the first entrance is formed in an oblique direction at the end of which the male sinks a perpendicular hole which he reserves for his own use the female makes several for the accommodation of herself and family that her young during the short time they are allowed to stay with her may have a free passage to the general stores one of the holes is lined with straw and serves as a lodging the others contain provisions of which great quantities are always accumulated during the time of harvest they begin to lay in their stores in august to facilitate the transportation of their food nature has furnished them with two pouches in each cheek into which they cram corn beans or pease till they seem ready to burst and on their return to their holes empty them by pressing their two fore feet against their cheeks the quantity of provision found in these magazines depends on the age or sex of the inhabitants the old hamsters often amass an hundred pounds weight of grain but the young and the females are satisfied with much less at the approach of winter the hamsters retire into their subterraneous abodes the entry to which they shut up with great care there they remain in perfect tranquillity and feed on their provisions till the frost becomes severe when they sink into a torpid state in which they continue till the return of spring during this period if any of the holes be opened the hamster is always found lying upon a bed of soft straw with its head turned under its belly between the two fore legs whilst the hind ones rest upon the muzzle its eyes are shut every member perfectly stiff and sensation so totally suspended that neither respiration nor any other sign of life can be perceived when dissected in this situation the heart may be seen alternately contracting and dilating very slowly the fat appears to be coagulated and the intestines are quite cold during this operation the animal seems to feel very little it sometimes opens its mouth as if it wanted to respire but the lethargy is too strong to admit of its entirely awaking the hamsters copulate about the end of april when the males enter the apartments of the females but remain only a few days if two males happen to meet in the same hole a furious combat ensues which generally terminates in the death of the weaker the females bring forth twice or thrice every year each litter consisting of six or eight in about three weeks the young are driven from their holes and left to provide for themselves their increase is so rapid in some years as to be almost sufficient to occasion a dearth but the ferocity with which they upon all occasions attack and devour each other is so great as to be the happy means of preventing the ill effects of their fecundity it is not only its own species to which the fury of the hamster is directed he attacks and devours every animal without distinction that he is able to conquer and frequently opposes himself to enemies much superior to himself in strength rather than fly he allows himself to be beaten to death if he seize a mans hand he must be killed before he can be made to quit his hold a horse or a dog are equally objects of his rage and wherever he seizes it is with difficulty he can be disengaged  the hamster is about the size of a large waterrat has a short tail almost naked its color on the head and back a reddishbrown not unlike that of a hare its throat is white and it has three white spots on each side its breast and belly are black it is found in various parts of germany poland and ukraine the polecat is its greatest enemy it pursues the hamster into its hole and destroys great numbers mr ray observes that the hair of this animal is so closely united to the skin that it cannot be pulled off without great difficulty on which account it is held in high estimation    the casan is denominated in russia souslik which signifies in that language a beautiful fur it resembles the fieldmouse in figure and in the shortness of its tail it is about the size of a large rat and its skin beautifully marked with small white spots upon a yellowish ground it is found upon the banks of the wolga and in the adjoining provinces as far as austria it burrows in the ground like a rabbit and lays in store of provisions consisting of grain herbs and roots it also feeds on young mice is very fond of salt and is frequently taken on board the barges laden with that commodity  the females bring forth from two to five at one time  the zisel or earless marmot instead of ears has only a small orifice on each side of its head is of a darkgrey color its body long and slender and its tail short it is found in bohemia austria hungary and siberia it forms its hole in the ground with a double entrance and sleeps during the winter in the center of its lodge it lays in a store of corn nuts etc and sits up like a squirrel when it eats it is easily provoked and bites hard its fur is of little value but its flesh is reckoned good eating  in poland and russia there is an animal of this kind called the zemni and by mr pennant the podolian marmot its habits are similar to those of the casan but it is larger stronger and more mischievous the head is thick the body slender and the ears short and round has two cutting teeth in each jaw those of the under jaw much longer than the upper the eyes are small and concealed in the fur like those of the mole its tail is short and of an ash color  the tailless marmot we are favored by mr pennant with the drawing of this animal which has hitherto been undescribed in the form of its body it seems to agree with the description given of the zisel and probably may be a variety of that animal    the leming or lapland marmot this wonderful animal small weak and contemptible in its appearance is nevertheless truly formidable from the numbers which sometimes overspread large tracts of country  derived from a source which no naturalist has hitherto been able to explore and attributed by superstitious ignorance to the generation of the clouds from whence they have been supposed to be poured down in showers of rain these animals appear at very uncertain periods in norway sweden and lapland and like a torrent which nothing can resist their course is marked with ruin and desolation myriads of them march in regular lines about three feet asunder in a southeast direction neither fire nor water stops their progress they go straight forward with the most amazing perseverance they swim across lakes and rivers no opposition impedes them if thousands are destroyed thousands supply their places the void is quickly filled up and their number does not appear diminished they persist in their course in spite of every obstacle and from the time they set out never think of retreating but if prevented from proceeding by any obstacle they either by assiduity surmount it or die in the attempt their march is mostly in the night they rest during the day and devour every root and vegetable they meet with they infect the very herbage and cattle are said to perish that feed upon the grass they have touched  an enemy so numerous and destructive would soon render the countries they pass through utterly uninhabitable did it not fortunately happen that the same rapacity that excites them to lay waste the productions of the earth at last impels them to destroy each other having nothing more to subsist on they are said to separate into two armies which engage with the most deadly hatred and continue fighting and devouring each other till they are all entirely destroyed thousands of them have been found dead and the air infected by their putrid carcases so as to occasion malignant distempers  the leming runs very swiftly although its legs are short and slender it is somewhat less than the rat its head is pointed and in each jaw are two very long cutting teeth with which it bites keenly its ears are short eyes small fore legs shorter than the hind the color of the head and body black and tawny disposed in irregular patches the belly white tinged with yellow  though perfectly disgusting to every other people its flesh is said to be eaten by the laplanders  where these emigrants are collected as was before observed is not certainly known linnaeus says they are produced among the norwegian and lapland alps and pontoppidan supposes that kolens rock which divides nordland from sweden is their native place but wherever they come from none return their course is predestined and they pursue their fate  the rat though small weak and contemptible in its appearance possesses properties that render it a more formidable enemy to mankind and more injurious to the interests of society than even those animals that are endued with the greatest strength and most rapacious dispositions to the one we can oppose united powers and superior arts with regard to the other experience has convinced us that no art can counteract the effects of its amazing fecundity and that force is ineffectually opposed to an enemy possessed of such variety of means to elude it  there are two kinds known in this country  the black rat which was formerly universal here but is now very rarely seen having been almost extirpated by the large brown kind generally distinguished by the name of the norway rat this formidable invader is now universally diffused through the whole country from whence every method has been tried in vain to exterminate it  this species is about nine inches long of a lightbrown color mixed with tawny and ash the throat and belly are of a dirtywhite inclining to gray its feet are naked and of a paleflesh color the tail is as long as the body covered with minute dusky scales thinly interspersed with short hairs  in summer it frequents the banks of rivers ponds and ditches where it lives on frogs fishes and small animals but its rapacity is not confined entirely to these it destroys rabbits poultry young pigeons etc it infests the granary the barn and the storehouse does infinite mischief among corn and fruit of all kinds and not content with satisfying its hunger frequently carries off large quantities to its hiding place  it is a bold and fierce little animal and when closely pursued will turn and fasten on its assailant its bite is keen and the wound it inflicts is painful and difficult to heal owing to the form of its teeth which are long sharp and of an irregular form  the rat is amazingly prolific usually producing from twelve to eighteen at one time their numbers would soon increase beyond all power of restraint were it not for an insatiable appetite that impls them to destroy and devour each other the weaker always fall a prey to the stronger and the large male rat which usually lives by itself is dreaded by those of its own species as their most formidable enemy  it is a singular fact in the history of these animals that the skins of such of them as have been devoured in their holes have frequently been found curiously turned inside out every part being completely inverted even to the ends of the toes how the operation is performed it would be difficult to ascertain but it appears to be effected in some peculiar mode of eating out the contents  besides the numbers that perish in these unnatural conflicts they have many fierce and inveterate enemies that take every occasion to destroy them several kinds of dogs pursue them with great alacrity and eagerly destroy them though they invariably refuse to eat their flesh the cat is also a very formidable enemy but generally finds greater difficulty in the contest the rat makes a vigorous resistance and sometimes effects its escape the weasel is the most dangerous enemy of the rat kind it hunts them with unceasing avidity pursues them into their holes where it soon kills them and sucks their blood mankind have likewise contrived various methods of destroying these bold intruders for that purpose traps are often found ineffectual such being their extreme sagacity that when any are drawn into the snare the others by that means learn to avoid the dangerous allurement notwithstanding the utmost caution may have been used to conceal the design the surest method of killing them is by poison nux vomica ground and mixed with oatmeal with a small proportion of oil of rhodium and musk have been found from experience to be very effectual    the water rat is somewhat smaller than the former its head larger and its nose thicker its eyes are small its ears short scarcely appearing through the hair its teeth are large strong and yellow the hair on its head and body thicker and longer than that of the common rat and chiefly of a darkbrown color mixed with red the belly is gray the tail five inches long covered with short black hairs and the tip with white  the water rat generally frequents the sides of rivers ponds and ditches where it burrows and forms its nest it feeds on frogs small fish and spawn swims and dives remarkably fast and can continue a long time under water    the musk rat of canada is about the size of a young rabbit its head is thick and short resembling that of a water rat its hair soft and glossy beneath the outward hair there is a thick fine down very useful in the manufacture of hats it is of a rddishbrown color its breast and belly ash tinged with red its tail is long and flat covered with scales its eyes are large its ears short and hairy it has two strong cutting teeth in each jaw  those of the under about an inch long but the upper ones are shorter  this animal is a native of canada where it is called the odura  in many respects it very much resembles the beaver both in form and manners it is fond of the water and swims well  at the approach of winter several families associate together they build little huts about two feet in diameter composed of herbs and rushes cemented with clay forming a domelike covering from these are several passages in different directions by which they go out in quest of roots and other food  the hunters take them in the spring by opening the holes and letting in the light suddenly upon them whereby they are so dazzled as to suffer themselves to be easily taken at that time their flesh is tolerably good and is frequently eaten but in the summer it acquires a scent of musk so strong as to render it perfectly unpalatable  the muscovy musk rat is about the size of the common rat its nose is long and slender like that of the shrewmouse it has no external ears and its eyes are very small the tail is compressed sideways and its hind feet are webbed it is of a dusky color the belly of a light ash  it is a native of lapland and russia frequents the banks of rivers feeds on small fishes but is often devoured by pikes and other large fishes to which it communicates so strong a flavor of musk as renders them very unpleasant to the taste  from its tail is extracted a kind of musk very much resembling the genuine sort their skins are frequently laid amongst clothes to preserve them from moths  in lapland it is called the desman    the mouse this wellknown little animal is diffused in great numbers over almost every part of the world it seems a constant attendant on man and is only to be found near his dwelling its enemies are numerous and powerful and its means of resistance weak and inconsiderable its minuteness seems to be its best security and it is saved from utter extinction only by its amazing fecundity  the mouse brings forth several times in the year and generally from six to ten each litter the young are produced without hair and in little more than fifteen days are able to subsist by themselves so that the increase is prodigius aristotle tells us that having shut up in a vessel a mouse big with young and provided plenty of grain for her and her offspring in a short time he found   0 mice all sprung from the same stock  the mouse when viewed without the disgust and apprehension which usually accompany the sight of it is a beautiful little animal its skin is sleek and soft its eyes bright and lively all its limbs are formed with exquisite delicacy and its motions are smart and active some few of this species are of a pure white color but whether they be a permanent kind or only an accidental variety cannot well be determined its appearance is however very beautiful its fine full eyes of a red color form an agreeable contrast with the snowy whiteness of its fur  the longtailed fieldmouse is rather larger than the common mouse and very similar to it in form it is of a yellowishbrown color its belly white and its eyes remarkably large and prominent it is found only in the fields woods and gardens feeds on nuts corn and acorns and lays up great stores for its support during winter it burrows in the earth and generally forms its nest near the root of a tree or thick bush if provisions fail during a storm they devour each other are very prolific and bring nine or ten young at a time  mr pennant mentions a species found in hampshire only two inches and an half long from nose to tail of a fine rust color above and white beneath it appears in great numbers in harvesttime among the sheaves and ricks of corn during the winter it shelters itself under ground where it makes a warm bed of dry grass and leaves its young are brought forth on a nest made between the straws of the standing corn and are generally about eight in number each time  the shorttailed fieldmouse differs from the last in having a thicker head and shorter tail its ears are very short and almost hid in the hair its body is about three inches long and the tail one inch the upper part of the body is of a reddishbrown and the belly a deepash color like the last it frequents the fields and woods but is seldom troublesome in gardens it also lives on the same kinds of food which it hides in holes underground it makes its nest in moist meadows and brings forth seven or eight young at a time  the shrewmouse is smaller than the common mouse being only two inches and a half long from the nose to the tail the nose is long and slender the ears short and the eyes like those of the mole almost concealed in the fur it is of a reddishbrown color the belly white the two upper fore teeth of this animal are singularly constructed and deserve particular notice having a small barb on each side so fine as to be scarcely visible  the shrewmouse frequents old walls and heaps of stones feeds on insects corn and putrid substances and is sometimes seen on dunghills where it roots with its nose like a hog it has so strong and disagreeable a smell that the cat after she has killed refuses to eat it it forms its nest without any visible aperture of dry grass moss etc on the surface of meadows or pastures and is said to breed four or five young at a time  there seems to be an annual mortality of these animals in august numbers of them being found dead in the fields highways etc about that time  the water shrewmouse is larger than the last the upper part of its body is black the throat breast and belly of a lightash color it is rarely to be seen frequents the banks of rivulets and marshy places where it burrows it is very numerous in lincolnshire but was never observed there till about twenty years ago it is called in that country the blind mouse  the dwarf mouse is a native of the cape of good hope where it was first discovered by sparrman it is distinguished from every other species of the genus by four black lines along its back from the head to the tail it is supposed to be the most diminutive quadruped in the world being scarcely two inches in length in the annexed representation it is drawn the natural size and forms a striking contrast with those gigantic animals which inhabit that quarter of the world    the mole this animal destined to seek its food and provide for its subsistence under the surface of the earth is wonderfully adapted by the allwise author of nature to its peculiar mode of living it enjoys the senses of hearing and smelling in a very eminent degree the former gives noti of every approach of danger whilst the latter enables it to find its prey in the midst of darkness and compensates in a great measure for an almost otal want of sight to an animal so circumstanced a larger degree of vision would be attended with manifest inconveniences as well as liable to continual injuries we are told by anatomists that for their better security the eyes of the mole are furnished with muscles by which it has the power of withdrawing or exerting them at pleasure its eyes are extremely small and perfectly hid in the fur but it is probable they are so formed as to admit distinct images of the diminutive objects of its pursuit the form of this creatures body and particularly the construction of its fore feet are admirably adapted to the purpose of making its way in the earth which it does with wonderful facility they are quite naked very broad with large palms almost like a hand five toes on each terminated with strong nails very concave on the under side and in place of a thumb a strong bone under the skin the hind feet very small with five slender toes and a small thumb on the inside whenever it happens to be surprised on the surface of the ground it disappears in an instant and every attempt to prevent its subterraneous retreat would be vain  the mole is mostly found in grounds where the soil is loose and soft and affords the greatest quantity of worms and insects on which it feeds the female brings forth in the spring and generally produces four or five at a time it makes its nest a little below the surface of the ground forming a commodious apartment where it prepares a warm bed of moss and herbage from this there are several passages in different directions to which it can retreat with its young ones in case of danger into these likewise the animal makes excursions in quest of food  in the act of forming its tracks or runs it throws up large heaps of mould which are extremely troublesome and injurious in meadows grasslands and cultivated grounds its destruction is consequently an object of importance to farmers gardeners etc  the skin of the mole is extremely tough its fur short closeset and softer than the finest velvet or perhaps the fur of any other animal it is usually black sometimes spotted with white and sometimes though rarely white it is about six inches in length and its tail one inch  the radiated mole is less than the common mole being not quite four inches long its fur is very close short and fine its nose is very curiously beset with radiated tendrils it is a native of north america feeds on roots and forms subterraneous passages in different directions there is a kind found in siberia with a very short nose and no tail it is of a beautiful green and gold color variable with the light there are some other varieties that differ chiefly in the color of the hair such as the yellow mole of north america which is larger than the european its hair is soft and of a silky gloss that which is found in virginia resembles the common mole it is of a black color mixed with deep purple  it is said that hats peculiarly fine and beautiful have been made of the fur of the mole    the opossum is found in great numbers in various parts of north and southamerica and was supposed by buffon to belong entirely to the new continent we are now however assured that it exists in many of the indian islands several varieties of the opossum kind have been seen also in the newlydiscovered countries in the south seas  the saragoy the murine the saragoy or molucca opossum of mr pennant is about the size of a cat its head is long nose sharp and pointed ears large thin and naked eyes small black and lively having a white spot above each of them its fur is soft long and of a duskyash color its belly white its tail is similar to that of a rat naked and scaly except a small part near the body which is covered with hair its legs are short and its feet or hands not unlike those of a monkey having five toes or fingers on each the thumbs on the hind feet destitute of nails but the peculiar and distinguishing characteristic of the opossum is a pouch or false belly in which the female deposits her young immediately after they are brought forth and nourishes them in it till they are able to provide for themselves  the chevalier daboville whilst in america during the late war in order to be satisfied respecting the time of its gestation manner of bringing forth and suckling its young procured a male and female opossum which he tamed and kept in his chamber till they copulated ten days after he observed a considerable alteration in the size and form of the pouch its aperture being wider than it was before and its orifice thicker from that time it gradually grew closer leaving only a small opening in the middle similar to a navel on the fifteenth day he introduced his finger and found at the bottom of the bag a small round body about the size of a pea the twentyfifth day he could feel a motion under his finger after the young had been a month in the pouch they were plainly to be seen on opening it a little at the end of two months on examining the pouch there appeared to be six young ones all of them attached to the mother by a canal that entered the mouth which if withdrawn could not be replaced but when six weeks old the young opossum could resume it by strong suction the mouth being then large enough to receive the pap which is about two lines in length and the size of the second or third string of a violin the number of the young varies from five to ten or eleven the paps are not disposed in regular order as in other animals but seem as if they were formed in those places where the embryos attach themselves to the mother  the opossum is a slow helpless animal when on the ground but climbs trees with great ease and quickness sometimes conceals itself among the branches and surprises the birds that come within its reach it frequently hangs suspended by its tail and in that situation watches for its prey which it darts upon with great agility  by means of its tail the opossum flings itself from one tree to another it feeds on birds reptiles insects roots leaves and the bark of trees it is easily tamed is neither mischievous nor ferocious but its figure is disagreable and the odor that exhales from its skin rank and disgusting  the murine opossum or marmose of m buffon inhabits the warmest parts of southamerica it resembles the former but is much less its food and manner of living are likewise very similar to it  it brings frth from ten to fourteen young at a time but instead of a bag the female has two longitudinal folds under her blly within which the young are secured when first pruced they are not larger than beans and remain closely attached to the teat till they attain sufficient growth and strength to provide for themselves    the mexican opossum differs little from the preceding either in size or form  it is found in the mountainous parts of newspain lives in trees its tail is useful in twisting round the branches and securing its hold  the young attach themselves to their mother by their hands and tails and upon the least alarm embrace her closely whilst she carries them to the shelter of some neighboring tree    the phalanger or surinam opossum is somewhat larger than a rat its nose is thick ears short and hairy its fur of a reddish color variegated with lightash and yellow the under part of the body yellowishwhite it is distinguished from all those of the opossum kind we have hitherto mentioned in having the first and second toes of the hind feet closely united its claws are large tail long very broad and thick at its junction with the body and naked at the end it inhabits surinam is supposed to be the animal called the canerat very destructive to the sugarcanes    the spotted opossum of new south wales the general color of this animal is black the body spotted with irregular roundish patches of white the ears are large and erect muzzle long pointed and furnished with long slender whiskers both fore and hind legs thinly

tail black a blackish space round each eye long black whiskers five toes on the fore feet and four on the hind with a thumb of two joints placed at the base of the inner toe the toes of the fore feet are long and answer the purpose of a hand the ears are about an inch and a half in length in the upper jaw are six cutting teeth four grinders and two canine teeth in the lower jaw two long cutting teeth like those of a squirrel and four grinders but no canine teeth  the flying opossum of new south wales its nose is pointed its ears large and erect the fur more delicate and of a finer texture than that of the seaotter  is of a beautiful dark color and very glossy mixed with gray the under parts white on each hip is  tancoloured spot the fur is continued to the claws the sailing membrane is the same as that of the gray squirrel but broader in proportion on the fore legs it has five toes with a claw on each on the hind ones four toes and a long thumb which enables the animal to use it as a hand it is remarkable that the three outside claws of the hind feet are not separated like the others  the opossum of van diemens land was discovered by captain cook in january      who describes it as about twice the size of a large rat  it inhabits van diemens land the southern point of newholland      we are favored with a drawing of this beautiful animal taken from a living one in the possession of the reverend mr egerton prebendary of durham by the ingenious mr carfrae  it is a native of new south wales is about eighteen inches long exclusive of the tail which is twelve its head is broad and pointed at the muzzle which is furnished with long whiskers its eyes are full exceedingly prominent and of a fiery redness it has five claws on the fore feet  three on the hind and a thumb two cutting teeth in each jaw the upper projecting beyond the under its manners are similar to those of a squirrel it sits up holds its food in its fore paws with great dexterity and feeds itself when irritated it sits still more erect or throws itself upon its back making a loud and harsh noise it feeds on vegetables small birds etc  the fur of this creature is long soft and very close of a mixed brown or greyish color on the back the under parts of a yellowishwhite its tail is prehensile very broad at the base and tapers to the end it is remarkable in being naked on the under side  the female is furnished with a pouch  the kanguroo is a native of newholland where it was first discovered by sir joseph banks  its head is small and taper ears large and erect upper lip divided the end of the nose black nostrils wide lower jaw shorter than the upper and there are whiskers on both it likewise has strong hairs above and below the eyes its head neck and shoulders are small the lower parts of the body inreasing in thickness to the rump its tail is long very thick near the rump and taper the construction of its fore feet is singular being extremely short and only useful in digging or bringing its food to its mouth it moves altogether on its hind legs making successive bounds of ten or twelve feet with such rapidity as to outstrip the fleetest greyhound it springs from rock to rock and leaps over bushes seven or eight feet high with great ease it has five toes on its fore feet  three on the hind the middle one very long the inner claw is divided down the middle into two parts  the kanguroo rests on its hind legs which are hard black and naked on the under side its fur is short and soft of a reddishash color lighter on the lower parts it is the only quadruped our colonists have yet met with in new south wales that supplies them with animal food  there are two kinds the largest that had been shot weighed about   0lb and measured from the point of the nose to the end of the tail six feet one inch the tail two feet one inch head eight inches fore legs one foot hind legs two feet eight inches circumference of the fore part of the body near the legs one foot one inch and of the hind part three feet the smaller kind seldom exceeds  0lb  this animal is furnished with a pouch similar to that of the opossum in which its young are nursed and shelted    the kanguroorat of new south wales is about the size of a rabbit and in shape resembles the kanguroo both in respect to the shortness of the fore legs and the peculiar construction and use of the hind ones the form of the head is like that of a rat and its body nearly of the same color in the upper jaw it has two long cutting teeth with three short ones on each side of them in the lower jaw two long cutting teeth and three grinders on each side  the female like most of the animals of that country has a pouch like the opossum  it feeds on vegetables burrows in the ground and is very tame and inoffensive  the jerboa this animal remarkable for the singular construction of its legs is found in egypt barbary and palestine  it is somewhat less than a rat its head has a great resemblance to that of a rabbit its eyes are large and full the fore legs are only one inch in length and are used as hands to convey victuals to its mouth the hind legs are naked and very much resemble those of a bird having only three toes on each the middle one longest its tail is much longer than its body and terminated with a black tuft the tip of which is white its hair is long and soft of a reddish color on the back the under parts of the body are white across the thighs there is a large black band in the form of a crescent  the motions of the jerboa are similar to those of the kanguroo it goes forward very nimbly on its hind feet taking leaps of five or six feet from the ground  it is a lively harmless animal lives entirely on vegetables and rrows in the ground like a rabbit  it is the daman israel of the arabs or lamb of israel and is supposed to be the coney of holy writ our rabbit being unknown in palestine it is also the mouse mentioned in isaiah chap lxvi ver     achbar in the original signifying a jerboa  there are some varieties of the jerboa found in siberia tartary and various parts of asia  they differ chiefly in size the largest being about the size of a rat its ears are large pointed and tipped with white the hair on the back is of a tawny color and very soft the belly and under part of the body are white the end of the tail is distinguished by a white feathered tuft an inch long it has five toes on the fore feet three on the hind and about an inch above the last are two long slender toes with nails on each  this creature makes its nest of the finest and most delicate herbage rolls itself up with its head between its thighs and sleeps during the winter without taking any nutriment  when pursued it springs so nimbly that its feet scarcely seem to touch the ground it does not go straight forward but turns here and there till it gains a burrow where it quickly secrets itself in leaping it carries its tail stretched out but in standing or walking carries it in the form of an s the lower part touching the ground  the jerboa is easily tamed is fond of warmth and seems to be sensible of the approach of bad weather by wrapping itself up close in hay  among the mogul tartars this animal is called the alaghtaaga it is supposed to be the twofooted mouse and the egyptian mouse of the ancients which were said to walk on their hind legs  the yellow macauco the ringtailed macauco the yellow macauco has been classed with the weasel tribe by mr pennant in his history of quadrupeds and it seems to bear some general resemblance to that species of animals in the form of its head which is flat and broad its ears are short eyes small bdy long and slender legs and thighs short and thick and it has five straight toes on each foot its fur is short soft and glossy  of a black color mixed with yellow on the back the cheeks inside of the legs and belly yellow along the back from head to tail there is a broad dusky stripe and another on the belly half way from the tail which is nearly as long as its body of a brighttawny color mixed with black and has the same prehensile faculty as those of some kinds of monkeys its length from nose to tail is nineteen inches  one of this species was shown in london some years ago and was said to have been brought from jamaica where it is called a potto it was a very goodnatured and sportive animal would catch hold of any thing with its tail and suspend itself by it  the ringtailed macauco is a very beautiful animal about the size of a cat its body and limbs are long and slender its tail very long and marked with alternate bars of black and white in the conformation of its paws it seems to approach the monkey kind but its nose is long and sharp like that of a fox and its ears are also large and pointed its head and throat are white eyes large and surrounded with black its fur is glossy soft and delicate  of a reddishash color on the back belly white  this creature is found in madagascar and the neighboring isles is very playful but not mischievous when in motion it makes a sort of galloping progress in an oblique direction and carries its tail almost crect but when sitting it is twisted round the body and brought over its head  troops of thirty or forty are sometimes seen together  it is a cleanly animal and when taken young may be easily tamed    the tailless macauco the mongooz the tailless macauco is found in ceylon and bengal lives in woods and feeds on fruits is fond of eggs and small birds which it devours greedily it is a very inactive animal and its motions slow very tenacious of its hold and makes a plaintive noise its head is small and nose pointed each eye is edged with a circle of white which is also surrounded with another of black its body is covered with a short silky fur of a reddishash color the toes naked nails flat except those on the inner toes of the hind feet which are sharp and crooked its length from the nose to the rump is sixteen inches  the mongooz is nearly of the same size as the ringtailed macauco its fur is fine soft and woolly  of a deep brownishash color the eyes are of a beautiful orange color surrounded with black the ears are short cheeks white end of the nose black the tail very long and covered with hair of the same sort and color as the body its hands and feet are naked and of a dusky color its nails except one upon the inner toe of each hind foot are flat  it inhabits madagascar and the isles adjacent sleeps in trees is very playful and goodnatured feeds on fruits is extremely tender and cannot bear any change to a less temperate climate  the loris is a very slender animal and differs greatly from the preceding both in form and manners it is not much larger than a squirrel but its limbs are longer the hind legs greatly exceed the fore in length the thumbs on each foot are more distinct and separate from the toes than those of other macaucos its nose is pointed like that of a dog its forehead high ears round and thin its fur is short and delicately soft of a tawny color on the back  whitish below it has no tail  the loris is a native of ceylon very active lives in trees and feeds on fruit seba says the male climbs the trees and tastes the fruit before he presents it to his mate  the black macauco or vari of m buffon is larger than the mongooz it is a native of madagascar is very fierce and makes a loud noise in the woods but when tamed is gentle and goodnatured its eyes are of a deeporange color round its head the hair is long and stands out like a ruff the general color of this animal is black but some are white spotted with black the feet are black and naked  the tarsier is remarkable for the great length of its hind legs in which it resembles the jerboa has four slender toes and a distinct thumb on each foot its visage is pointed eyes large and prominent ears erect broad and naked its hair is soft and woolly of a deepash color mixed with tawny its length from the nose to the rump is nearly six inches the tail is nine inches long round scaly almost naked like that of a rat and tufted at the end  it is found in some of the remote islands of india especially amboyna    animals of the monkey kind we come now to the description of a numerous race of animals consisting of a greater variety of kinds and making nearer approaches to the human species both in form and action than any other class of quadrupeds  monkies are found only in the warmest parts of the world and chiefly in the torrid zone they abound in the woods of africa from senegal to the cape of good hope and from thence to ethiopia in all parts of india and its isles in the south of china in japan and in southamerica from the isthmus of darien as far as paraguay a species or two are also met with in arabia and the province of barbary  on account of the numbers and different appearances of these animals they have been divided into three classes and described under the following denominations viz  apes or such as have no tails baboons or such as have short tails monkies or such as have long tails  in the ape kind we see the whole external machine strongly impressed with the human likeness and capable of similar exertions they walk upright their posteriors are fleshy their legs are furnished with calves and their hands and feet are nearly like ours  in the baboon we perceive a more distant resemblance of the human form he generally goes upon all four seldom upright but when constrained to it in a state of servitude some of them are as tall as a man they have short tails long faces sunk eyes are extremely disgusting lascivious and possessed of brutal fercenss  the monkey kind are removed still farther and are much less than the former their tails are generally longer than their bodies and although they sit upon their posteriors they always move upon all four  they are a lively active race of animals full of frolic and grimace greatly addicted to thieving and extremely fond of imitating human actions but always with a mischievous intention    the oranoutang or wild man of the woods is the largest of all the ape kind and makes the nearest approach to the human figure one of this kind dissected by dr tyson has been very accurately described by him the principal external differences pointed out by that learned physician consisted in the great length of the arms and shortness of the thighs the thumb is also much smaller and the palm of the hand longer and narrower than in man the form of the feet is very dissimilar the toes being much longer and the large toe placed at a greater distance from the others the forehead is too high the nose flat and the eyes much sunk beside these the anatomist has enumerated a variety of essential differences in the internal conformation of the oranoutang all of which sufficiently evince that though he has the strongest affinity to the human form of any other quadruped yet as buffon elegantly observes the interval which separates the two species is immense the resemblance in figure and organization and the movements of imitation which seem to result from these similarities neither make him approach the nature of man nor elevate him above that of the brute  the oranoutang is found in the interior parts of africa in madagascar borneo and some parts of the east indies it is a solitary animal avoids mankind and lives only in the most desert places the largest of the kind are said to be about six feet high very active strong and intrepid capable of overcoming the strongest man they are likewise exceedingly swift and cannot easily be taken alive they live entirely on fruits and nuts will sometimes attack and kill the negroes who wander in the woods and drive away the elephants that happen to approach too near the place of their residence they sometimes surprise the female negroes and carry them off into the woods where they compel them to stay with them  when taken young however the oranoutang is capable of being tamed and rendered extremely docile one of them shown in london some years ago was taught to sit at table make use of a spoon or fork in eating its victuals and drink wine or other liquors out of a glass it was extremely mild affectionate and goodnatured much attached to its keeper and obedient to his commands its aspect was grave and its disposition melancholy it was young and only two feet four inches high its body was covered with hair of a black color which was much thicker and closer on the back than on the fore part of the body the hands and soles of the feet were naked and of a dusky color  a variety called the pigmy is found in guinea ethiopia and other parts of africa much smaller than the last being not more than a foot and a half in length it is very tractable goodnatured and easily tamed is supposed to have been the pithecos of the ancients it lives in woods and feeds on fruits and insects  troops of them assemble together and defend themselves from the attacks of wild beasts in the desert by throwing a cloud of sand behind them which blinds their pursuers and facilitates their escape    the gibbon is distinguished by the extraordinary length of its arms which reach to the ground when its body is upright and give it a disgusting appearance its face is flat and of a tawny color surrounded with a circle of gray hair which adds to the singularity of its aspect its eyes are large and deep sunk cars round and naked body covered on all parts with black rough hair except its buttocks which are quite naked  it is a mild gentle and tractable animal feeds on fruits leaves and barks of trees is a native of the east indies sumatra and the molucca isles and measures from three to four feet in height  the magot or barbary ape is wilder and more untractable than the others his head is large and his nose prominent he likewise differs from the last in having cheek pouches which he frequently fills with food before he begins to eat the canine teeth are large and strong ears round and somewhat like those of a man the body is covered with hair of a brown color inclining to green lighter on the belly when standing erect upon his hind legs he is generally two feet and a half or three feet high he walks oftener on four than on two feet and when resting supports his body on two prominent callosities situate on his buttocks  the magot is a very common species and is found in most parts of africa from barbary to the cape of good hope  the baboon differs from animals of the ape kind not only in external appearance but also in temper and disposition fierce untractable and libidinous its disposition seems to partake of the hideous and disgusting deformities of its outward figure its body is thick compact and nervous and its strength prodigious neither art nor caresses can render it in any degree docile or obedient it seems to be continually fretting with rage and seeking every opportunity of showing its savage and vicious propensities in a state of captivity it must be kept closely confined and even in that state we have seen one shake the bars of its cage so powerfully with its hands as to excite the utmost terror in the spectators  this animal of which we have given a very faithful rpresentation from the life was about four feet high when standing on its hind legs its head was large  of an amazing strength and thickness its muzzle long and thick eyes small and deep sunk its canine teeth very large and formidable and it had pouches in its cheeks the hair on its head was long and formed a very elegant toupee from its forehead and each side of its face which when angry it erected the hair on the body was uniformly of a light reddishbrown the tail short and darker at the end buttocks red and naked  the baboon inhabits the hottest parts of africa feeds on fruits roots and other vegetables  numerous troops sometimes make their appearance plundering gardens and cultivated grounds they are extremely dexterous in throwing the fruit from one to another and by this means will do incredible damage in a very short time  the female brings forth only one young at a time which she carries in her arms and suckles at her breast notwithstanding its libidinous disposition it will not breed in temperate climates    the great ribbednose baboon this singular creature is no less remarkable for its great size and strength than for the variety of beautiful colors on different parts of its body its nose is marked with broad ribs on each side of a fine violetblue color a vermilion line begins a little above the eyes and running down on each side of the nose which is somewhat similar to that of a hog spreads over the tip of it the insides of the ears are blue which gradually softens to a purple and terminates in vermilion the rump is also of a vermilion color and the beautiful colors on the hips are gradtions from red to blue the hair on the forehead is long turns back and forms a kind of pointed crest its beard is dark at the roots orange at the middle and yellow at the end the back and legs are covered with short hair of a darkbrown color mixed with yellow  the breast and belly with long whitish hair speckled with small dark spots its tail is short and hairy nails flat feet and hands black and naked  one of this kind was exhibited about twelve years ago in the north of england it was five feet high extremely fierce libidinous and strong at the sight of women it discovered marks of the most violent passion and at one time caught hold of a lady who was so incautious as to approach too near it and she was with some difficulty rescued by the interference of the keeper its voice was strong and harsh not unlike the ordinary growl of the lion it generally went upon its four feet unless obliged by its keeper to stand erect its most usual attitude was sitting on its rump with its arms placed before it  this creature inhabits the hotter parts of africa  schreber says it lives on succulent fruits and nuts is fond of eggs will put eight at once into its pouches then take them out one by one break them at the end and swallow the contents  our representation of this animal is done from a drawing in the possession of the rev mr egerton taken from the life by an eminent painter  we suppose the mandrill of buffon to be a variety of this species    the small ribbednose baboon seems to agree in every respect with that described by mr pennant in the first volume of his history of quadrupeds under the name of the mandrill  the annexed cut was done from the living animal in the possession of mr rain surgeon in newcastle  it is about fifteen inches in height its face flat of a fine blue color eyes brighthazel exceedingly brilliant and lively the cheeks marked with small ribs bounded with thick bushy hair of a greenish color beautifully speckled with black which falls back on each side the hair on the forehead is of the same color is very long and runs up to a point on the top of the shoulders the muzzle is broad furnished with short hair thinly scattered on each side  and on the chin there is a short thin beard ending in a point where it is of an orange color the hair on the body is darkbrown mixed with shades of green on the back and fides  the haunches dusky the ears are small naked and pointed the tail short and hairy the buttocks bare and of a red fleshcolors hands and feet naked it has cheek pouches feeds on fruits nuts roots and other vegetables it is lively playful and full of mischievous frolics walks commonly on all four is in continual motion and leaps with astonishing agility  this species is said to come from the coast of guinea  the maimon or pigtailed baboon so termed from its short naked piglike tail is the least of all the baboon kind a gentle mild and tractable animal very lively and frolicsome but has none of that impudent petulance so peculiar to most of its species  its muzzle is large and thick face and ears naked and of a flesh color the hair on the head and back is of a deepolive  palest on the belly it has hazel eyes cheek pouches callosities on the buttocks which are naked and of a red color  it is a native of sumatra and japan  one of this kind was shown in the north in      from which this drawing was made  it is a curious circumstance that not only this but every animal of the baboon and monkey kind we have yet seen have shown a remarkable greediness for tobacco mustard and even snuff which they eat without expressing the smallest inconvenience and always seem extremely desirous for more  the dogfaced baboon is distinguished by a longer tail than the rest of its kind in this respect it seems to bear some affinity to the monkey and has been mentioned under that denomination by several naturalists we may observe here that in tracing the progress of animated nature we are led by the most imperceptible gradations from one kind to another the line of separation seems so faintly drawn that we are frequently at a loss how to fix the boundaries of one class without encroaching upon that of another and notwithstanding the regularity and order which everywhere prevail among the numerous families that inhabit the earth the best and most approved systems of arrangement fall infinitely short of precision they serve indeed to direct us to the general characters which form the distinguishing features of each genus but are very inadequate to discriminate the intermingled shades and nice touches by which all are diversified  the drawing of this animal was taken from one shown in london under the name of the persian savage  its head was large muzzle long and thick eyes small face naked and of an olive color the hair on its forehead separated in the middle and hung down on each side of the face from thence down its back as far as its waist it was long and shaggy of a bluishgrey color freckled with dark spots hair on the lower part of the body short buttocks bare and red  that described by mr pennant which seems to agree with this is represented as very fierce and untractable  it inhabits the hottest parts of africa and asia lives in troops and commits great depredations in gardens and cultivated grounds is above five feet high exceedingly strong vicious and impudent    the ursine baboon is not unlike the last but rather less its nose is long head large ears short forehead high and prominent terminating in a ridge the body thick and strong covered with long dusky hair which gives it the appearance of a young bear its tail half the length of the body buttocks red  this animal is very numerous about the cape of good hope  troops of them assemble together and make expeditions for the sake of plunder in which they observe the utmost precaution to prevent surprise they place a sentinel which upon fight of a man gives a loud yell when the whole troop retreats with the greatest precipitation it is highly entertaining to see the females carrying off their young ones clinging to their backs whilst their pouches are crammed so full of fruit that they seem ready to burst they sometimes form a line and throw the fruit from one to another in order to carry it off the more expeditiously  the wanderou is a native of ceylon and the east indies  its head is thick and long and surrounded with a large quantity of white hair which falls down below the chin forming a monstrous rough shaggy beard the rest of the body is covered with a darkbrown coat almost black  like all animals of this kind it is wild and vicious but when taken young may easily be tamed and appears to be more susceptible of education than other baboons  there are several varieties of this species the bodies of some are black with white beards in others the body is whitish and the beard black some are found entirely white but this species is extremely rare and is said to be stronger and more mischievous than the others  these bearded baboons are much esteemed for the gravity of their appearance and are used by the indians in their ceremonies and shows in which they are said to acquit themselves to the admiration of the spectators  the macaque or harelipped monkey of mr pennant is placed next to the baboons and makes the nearest approach to them in the form of its body which is short and thick its head and muzzle are large its visage ugly naked and wrinkled and its nostrils divided like those of a hare its tail however is long like that of a monkey the color of the hair on the upper part of the body is a greenishash  lighter on the breast and belly  there are several varieties which differ both in size and color  this animal is found in guinea congo and some of the southern parts of africa  they go in troops and do infinite mischief to plantations of millet which they carry off under their arms and in their mouths they are extremely nice and delicate in their choice and by pulling up what does not please them do more damage than by what they really eat  the patas or red monkey is nearly of the same size with the macaque and inhabits the same country its body is however rather longer its face less hideous and its hair more beautiful it is remarkable for the brilliancy of its coat which is of so bright a red as to have the appearance of being painted  there are two varieties of this kind the one is distinguished by a black line above the eyes extending from ear to ear in the other the line is white both have long hair under the chin and round the cheeks which in the first is yellow and in the second white the nose is black the under part of the body of an ash color tinged with yellow  these monkies are very numerous on the banks of the river senegal  they are so curious as sometimes to descend from the tops of trees to the extremities of the branches while boats are passing and seem to observe them with great attention if not disturbed their familarity becomes troublesome they break off branches throw them at the passengers and frequently with so sure an aim as to annoy them not a little but upon being shot at they set up most hideous cries endeavor to revenge themselves by collecting more offensive materials such as stones dirt etc which they throw at the enemy and soon retire  travelers relate that in guinea monkies are frequently seen together in troops of forty or fifty plundering gardens and fields of corn with great boldness one of them stands on a tree listens and looks about on all sides while the rest are busy upon the least appearance of interruption he sets up a loud cry to alarm the party when they immediately fly off with the booty they have collected leaping from tree to tree with prodigious agility  the malbrouck differs little from the last either in disposition or manners  it is a native of bengal is fond of fruits frequently steals into plantations of sugarcanes loads itself with them and if pursued will throw away a part to carry off the remainder with more ease it escapes the pursuit of tigers and other wild beasts by climbing trees and leaping from one to another serpents are the most deadly enemies of this and all the monkey kind they follow them to the highest branches of the trees and frequently surprise them whilst they are sleeping  the chinese bonnet monkey appears to be only a variety of the malbrouck the principal difference consisting in the formers having the hair on its head disposed in the form of a flat bonnet from which its name has been derived it inhabits the same country and lives in the same manner  when fruits and succulent plants fail them these animals are said to eat insects and sometimes watch by the sea side for crabs and other shellfish which they are very dexterous in catching  they are never thoroughly tamed and cannot be trusted without a chain they do not breed when in a state of confinement even in their own country but require to be at perfect freedom in their native woods  the mangabey is distinguished from all other monkies by a very remarkable character its eyelids are naked of a pure white color and round each eye there is a prominent ring the hair on the head and body is of a yellowishbrown color that on the belly white some of them have a broad collar of white hair surrounding their neck and face  they are natives of madagascar  the callitrix or green monkey so called from its beautiful hair which on the upper part of the body and tail is of a fine green color the throat belly and under side of the limbs are of a silvery whiteness the tail is eighteen inches long length of the body thirteen height eight and a half  it is common in the cape de verd islands and the east indies and is also found in mauritania and in the territories of ancient carthge hence it is probable says m buffon that it was known to the greeks and romans and that it was one of those longtailed monkies to which they gave the general name of callitrix  it seems to be the same kind as that mentioned by adanson who relates that the woods of podor along the river niger are full of green apes which from their color are scarcely discernible among the branches of the trees where they live  the animal from which the above was taken is a female in the possession of william hargrave esquire of shawdon  the mustache is a beautiful little animal having a tuft of yellow hair on each cheek and another on the top of the head which is long and upright its face is of a bluish color body of a greenishash breast and belly lighter its length is only one foot that of the tail eighteen inches it is a native of guinea  the talapoin is a native of the east indies where it is suffered to multiply without molestation owing to the religious superstition of the bramis which forbids them to take the life of any kind of animal whatever they are so tame and familiar that numbers of them frequently come into their towns enter the houses and if not prevented help themselves to whatever they meet with that is agreeable to them such as fruits sweetmeats etc  the talapoin is about twelve inches long its head is round ears black and shaped like the human eyes of a brighthazel color with black pupils the hair on the back upper part of the body and limbs of a duskyyellow tinged with green  the belly lighter its tail very long slender and of an olive color  the varied monkey or mona is best known of all the monkey tribe being more frequently brought into europe than any other  it is a native of barbary and other northern parts of africa arabia and persia where it is called the mona from which our general term is derived  this creatures nose is short and thick of a dark lead color and the hair on each side is long the skin on the inside of the thighs is of a paleblue color thinly covered with whitish hairs beard of a greenishyellow the top of the head brightyellow freckled with black back and sides deepbrown with small black freckles outside of the thighs and tail black on each side of the rump cse by the tail is a large white spot this description is taken from the living animal in the possession of robert hedley esquire of newcastle from which the drawing was also taken it was remarkably gentle tame and familiar and seemed to have some attachment to those with whom it was acquainted its length was eighteen inches til about two feet it was fed with bread roasted meat and fruit of all kinds of which it was particularly fond  all the baboons and monkeys we have yet described are furnished with cheekpouches capable of containing food sufficient to supply them for a day or two they also serve as receptacles for whatever they obtain more than supplies their present wants but we have thought it unnecessary to repeat this circumstance in the account of every animal of those kinds  the douc differs from other monkeys in having no callosities on its buttocks which are entirely covered with hair it is also much larger being nearly four feet high when erect its face is short and rather flat furnished on each side with long hairs of a paleyellow color its body is beautifully variegated with differently colored hair round the neck there is a collar of a bluishpurple color the top of the head and body are gray breast and belly yellow arms white below and black above tail white feet black face and ears red lips black and round each eye there is a black ring  it is found in cochinchina and in the island of madagascar where it is called the sifac  m buffon places the douc in the last class of those animals of the monkey kind that belong to the old continent and describes it as forming a shade between them and the monkies of america which he distinguishes by the generic names of sapajous and sagoins  they both of them differ from monkies in having neither cheekpouches nor callosities on their buttocks and they are distinguished from each other by characters peculiar to each the sapajou is furnished with a prehensile tail the under part of which is generally covered with a smooth naked skin the animal can coil it up or extend it at pleasure suspend itself by its extremity on the branches of trees or use it as a hand to lay hold of any thing it wants the tails of all the sagoins on the contrary are longer than those of the sapajous straight flaccid and entirely covered with hair  this difference alone is sufficient to distinguish a sapajou from a sagoin  we now proceed to the history and description of the most remarkable of this numerous race  the ouarine or preacher is the largest of all the american monkies being about the size of a large fox its body is covered with long smooth hair of a shining black color forming a kind of ruff round the animals neck its tail is long and always twisted at the end  great numbers of these monkies inhabit the woods of brazil and guiana and from the noise they make are called howling monkies several of them assemble together and placing themselves in a kind of regular order one of them begins first with a loud tone which may be heard to a great distance the rest soon join in a general chorus the most dissonant and tremendous that can be conceived on a sudden they all stop except the first who finishes singly and the assembly breaks up  these monkies are said to be very fierce and so wild and mischievous that they can neither be conquered nor tamed  they feed on fruits grain herbs and sometimes insects live in trees and leap from bough to ugh with wonderful agility catching hold with their hands and tails as they throw themselves from one branch to another and maintain their hold so firmly that even when shot they remain fixed to the trees where they die  the flesh of the ouarine is good and is not only eaten by the natives but also by the europeans who frequent those parts  the coaita is somewhat less than the ouarine its body and limbs are long and slender hair black and rough tail long and naked on the under side  this animal is found in the neighborhood of carthagena in guiana brazil and peru  great numbers associate together  they seldom appear on the ground but live mostly in trees and feed on fruits when these are not to be had they are said to eat fishes worms and insects are extremely dexterous in catching their prey and make great use of their tails in seizing it  the coaitas are very lively and active  in passing from one tree to another they sometimes form a chain linked to each other by their tails and swing in that manner till the lowest catches hold of a branch and draws up the rest  when fruits are ripe they are generally fat and their flesh is then said to be excellent  there are many varieties of the coaita which differ chiefly in color some are totally black others brown and some have white hair on the under parts of the body  they are called spider monkies by edwards on account of the length and slenderness of their legs and tails  m buffon supposes the exquima to be another variety of this species it is nearly of the same size but its color is variegated the hair on its back is black and yellow its throat and belly white its manner of living is the same with that of the coaita and it inhabits the same countries  both kinds are remarkable in having only four fingers on each hand being quite destitute of the thumb  the sajou or capucin there are two varieties of this species  the brown and the gray which in other respects are perfectly similar their faces are of a flesh color thinly covered with down tails long full of hair on the upper side naked below and prehensile hands black and naked length of the body about twelve inches  these animals inhabit guiana are extremely lively and agile and their constitution seems better adapted to the temperate climates of europe than most of the sapajou kind m buffon mentions a few instances of their having produced in france  the sajous are very capricious in their attachments being fond of particular persons and discovering the greatest aversion to others  the sai or weeper inhabits brazil is very mild docile and timid of a grave and serious aspect has an appearance of weeping and when irritated makes a plaintive noise it is about fourteen inches long the tail longer than the body hair on the back and sides of a deepbrown color mixed with red on the lower parts  there is a variety with white hair on the throat and breast  great numbers of these creatures assemble together particularly in stormy weather and make a great chattering  they live much in trees which bear a podded fruit as large as beans on which they principally feed  the saimiri or orange monkey is a most beautiful animal but so extremely delicate that it cannot well bear to be brought from its own climate to one less warm and temperate  it is about the size of a squirrel its head is round eyes remarkably lively and brilliant ears large hair on the body short and fine of a shining gold color feet orange its tail is very long its prehensile faculty is much weaker than the rest of the sapajous and on that account it may be said to form a shade between them and the sagoins which have long tails entirely covered with hair but of no use in suspending their bodies from the branches of trees or other objects  the saki is sometimes called the foxtailed monkey because its tail like that of the fox is covered with long hair its body is about seventeen inches in length hair long  of a darkbrown color on the back lighter on the under side its face is tawny and covered with a fine short whitish down the forehead and sides of the face are white its hands and feet are black with claws instead of nails  the saki is a native of guiana where it is called the saccawinkee  the tamarin is about the size of a squirrel its face is naked of a swarthy flesh color its upper lip somewhat divided its ears are very large and erect from whence it is called the greateared monkey its hair is soft shaggy and of a black color hands and feet covered with orangecoloured hair very fine and smooth its nails long and crooked tail black and twice the length of its body  the tamarin inhabits the hotter parts of southamerica is a lively pleasant animal easily tamed but so delicate that it cannot bear a removal to a climate less temperate    the ouistiti or cagvi is still smaller than the tamarin its head and body not exceeding seven inches in length its tail is long bushy and like that of the macauco marked with alternate rings of black and ash color its face is naked of a swarthy flesh color ears large and like the human body beautifully marked with dusky ashcolored and reddish bars its nails are sharp and its fingers like those of a squirrel  the ouistiti inhabits brazil feeds on fruits vegetables insects and snails and is fond of fish  mr edwards gives a description of one of these animals accompanied with an excellent figure  he says that one day being at liberty it darted upon a small goldfish that was in a basin which it killed and devoured with avidity and that afterward small eels were given to it of which it seemed at first afraid from their twisting themselves round its neck but that it soon overcame and eat them  he likewise says that the oustiti produced young ones in portugal which at first were extremely ugly having hardly any hair on their bodies they adhered closely to the teats of the mother and when grown a little larger fixed themselves upon her back from whence she could not easily disengage them without rubbing them off against a wall upon these occasions the male always allowed them to mount upon his back to relieve the female  the marikina is by some called the lionape from the quantity of hair which surrounds its face falling backwards like a mane its tail is also somewhat bushy at the end in other respects it bears no affinity whatever to the king of beasts its face is flat and of a dull purple color its hair long bright and silky  from whence it is likewise called the silky monkey it is of a paleyellow color on the body the hair round the face of a brightbay inclining to red its hands and feet are without hair and of the same color as the face its body is ten inches long tail thirteen  this creature is a native of guiana is very gentle and lively and seems to be more hardy than the other sagoins  buffon says that one of them lived at paris several years with no other precaution than keeping it in a warm room during winter    the pinche or redtailed monkey is somewhat larger than the oustiti it is remarkable in having a great quantity of smooth white hair which falls down from the top of its head on each side forming a curious contrast with its face which is black thinly covered with a fine gray down its eyes are black and lively throat black hair on the back and shoulders of a light reddishbrown color breast belly and legs white the tail is long of a red color from the rump to the middle from thence to the end it is black  the pinche inhabits the woods on the banks of the river of amazons is a lively beautiful little animal has a soft whistling voice resembling more the chirping of a bird than the cry of a quadruped  it frequently walks with its long tail over its back    the mico or fair monkey is the last that we shall describe of this numerous race and is the most beautiful of them all its head is small and round face and ears of so lively a vermilion color as to appear the effect of art its body is covered with long hair of a bright silvery whiteness and uncommon elegance tail long and of a shining darkchesnut color  this creature frequents the banks of the river of amazons where it was discovered by m condamine who preserved it alive till almost within sight of the french cst but it died before his arrival  we have now laid before our readers a few of the most noted varieties of this numerous race many others might likewise be added to swell the account but of these little more is known than their names and places of habitation there are probably still more which neither the assiduity of the naturalist nor the curiosity of the traveller has been able to draw from their native woods indeed there is great room to conjecture that the variations of the monkey kind are somewhat like those of the dog continually increasing for it is very obvious that among the smaller kinds of monkies the characteristic differences do not appear to be great however they may vary in size or in color and it is certain that the modes of living faculties and propensities of these animals are strikingly similar so that if we reason from analogy on this subject we may fairly conclude that different kinds of monkies may unite and propagate with the same facility as the goat and the sheep or the almost innumerable kinds of dogs  the greater part of the cuts we have given of the baboons apes and monkies we were fortunate in procuring from living subjects or drawings which might be depended on and it is to be lamented that amongst the numbers that have been published so few should possess that peculiar character so observable in the various members of this imitative tribe which it is wholly impossible to trace from a stuffed skin void of every kind of expression and the muscular parts which should convey the idea of action generally ill supplied or entirely wanting    the porcupine this animal so formidable in its appearance would be much more truly so if it possessed the power erroneously ascribed to it of darting its quills at its enemies and killing them at a distance  though denied the privilege of making offensive war it is sufficiently armed to resist the attacks of animals much more powerful than itself  the largest of the quills are from ten to fifteen inches in length thick in the middle and extremely sharp at the end they all incline backwards but on being the least irritated the animal raises them up mking at the same time a snorting noise between the quills the hair is thin black and bristly the tail is covered with white quills which are short and transparent its legs are short and it has four toes before and five behind  the porcupine is found in india persia and palestine it is likewise common in all parts of africa  the indians hunt it for its quills of which they make a kind of embroidery they also eat its flesh  there are porcupines in a wild state in spain and italy though they are not originally natives of any part of europe their flesh is sometimes exposed in the markets at rome where it is eaten the italian porcupines have shorter quills and a lesser crest than those of asia or africa  the porcupine is an inoffensive animal lives on fruits roots and vegetables sleeps during the day and feeds by night  the female goes seven months and brings forth one young one at a time  the drawing of this animal was made from the life  the brazilian porcupine differs so greatly from the last that it can scarcely be said to bear any relation to it except in its being covered with spines about three inches in length they are white very sharp and have a bar of black near the points the breast belly and lower part of the legs are covered with strong bristly hairs of a brown color its tail is long and slender and almost naked at the end the animal uses it in descending trees by twisting it round the branches  this creature inhabits mexico and brazil lives in woods and feeds on fruits and small birds it preys by night and sleeps in the day it makes a noise like the grunting of a swine and grows very fat  its flesh is white and esteemed good to eat  the coendou of m buffon which he likewise calls the brazilian porcupine inhabits the same countries with the last and its habits and mode of living are similar but in respect to its figure it seems to be a very different animal its ears are short and hid in the hair its head body and upper part of its tail are covered with long soft hair in which are interspersed a number of strong sharp spines its tail is shorter than that of the preceding species and it uses it in the same manner in descending trees frequently suspending itself from the branches  an animal similar to this is found in canada and various parts of north america as high as hudsons bay it is called the urson or canada porcupine  many of the trading indians during their long excursions depend on this creature for a supply of food which they esteem both wholesome and pleasant they also make use of the quills to trim the edges of their deerskin habits so as to look like fringe and stick them in their noses and ears to make holes for their earrings  the hedgehog or urchin destitute of every other means of defense is provided by nature with a spinous armor which secures it from the attacks of all the smaller beasts of prey such as weasels martins polecats etc  when alarmed it immediately collects itself into the form of a ball and presents on all sides a surface covered with sharp points which few animals are hardy enough to engage the more it is harrassed the closer it rolls itself till its fears become an additional means of safety by causing it to void its urine which running over its whole body frequently obliges its enemy to desist disgusted by the smell  there are few dogs that will venture to attack the hedgehog except such as are trained to the sport merely to gratify the cruel pleasure of seeing a harmless animal endure with astonishing patience the most wanton outrages whilst the dogs becoming more enraged at the wounds they receive from its prickles at last oblige it to unfold itself and it then soon falls a victim to their fury  the hedgehog generally resides in small thickets and hedges lives on fruits worms beetles and all kinds of insects conceals itself in the day and feeds during the night it is easily taken for it neither flies nor attempts to defend itself but when touched shrinks into its circular form which it will not easily quit unless thrown into water  the hedgehog in the winter wraps itself up in a warm nest made of moss dried grass and leaves and sleeps out the rigours of that season it is frequently found so completely encircled with herbage on all sides that it resembles a ball of dried leaves when taken out and placed before a fire it soon recovers from its torpid state    the tendrac is about the size of a rat the upper part of its body is covered with spines shorter and smaller than those of the hedgehog which it somewhat resembles but does not roll itself up like that animal the rest of the body is covered with a kind of fine hard hair of a whitish color about the head and nose it has several long hairs like whiskers  an animal of the same kind is mentioned by m buffon under the name of the tanrec which is larger than the last and has fewer bristles they only occupy the top of the head and along the back as far as the shoulders those on the neck are the longest and stand erect the rest of the body is covered with a bristly kind of hair of a yellowish color among which are intermixed some black hairs much longer than the other its nose is long and its ears more apparent than those of the tendrac  both these animals are natives of india  they make a grunting noise and are fond of wallowing in mud like hogs they frequent the banks of rivers can live a long time in the water and are frequently caught in small inlets of the sea they dig holes in the ground where they continue in a kind of torpid state during several months they are generally very fat and the indians eat their flesh though it is reckoned insipid and stringy    the beaver is the most industrious of all animals its labors seem the result of a social compact formed for mutual convenience preservation and support and as in all wellregulated societies a due subordination is necessary for the well ordering and conducting each individual effort to the advantage of the whole so amongst these curious animals we find that in forming their habitations all have their proper part of the work assigned to them that by dividing their labors safety stability and expedition may be the general effect to this purpose a community of two or three hundred assemble together an overseer is appointed whose orders are punctually obeyed and by striking the water smartly with his tail gives the signal where the united force of numbers is necessary to be applied in order to strengthen or support the fabric or at the approach of an enemy to apprize the society of their danger  as soon as a convenient place is chosen for the erection of their building which is generally a level piece of ground with a small rivulet running through it they divide into companies some are employed in cutting down trees of great size which is done by gnawing them with their teeth these they lay across the dam with surprising labor and perseverance or form them into piles which others roll down to the water make holes at the bottom for receiving the ends and placing them upright secure them in that position whilst another party is engaged in collecting twigs interweaving and twisting them with the piles and thereby strengthening the work some collect large quantities of earth stones clay and other solid materials which they dispose of on the upper side of the piles next the stream forming a mound ten or twelve feet thick at the bottom tapering gradually upwards and capable of sustaining a considerable weight of water the length of the dam occasioned by this means is sometimes not less than one hundred feet  having completed the mole their next care is to erect their apartments which are built on piles they are of a circular form and generally consist of three stories about eight feet high above the water the first lies below the level of the dam and is generally full of water the other two are above it the walls are two feet in thickness neatly plaistered with clay on the inside which is arched like an oven and at the top resembles a dome in each house there are two openings  one toward the water to which the animal has always access in case of surprise the other toward the land by which it goes out in quest of food  the number of houses in one of these dams is from ten to twentyfive some of them large enough to contain a family of twenty or thirty beavers each beaver forms its bed of moss and each family lays in its magazine of winter provision which consists of bark and boughs of trees they pile up the latter with great ingenuity and regularity and draw it out to their apartments as their wants require  they are said to be fondest of the sassafras ash and sweet gum  during summer they feed on leaves fruits and sometimes crabs or crayfish but fish is not their favorite food  their time of building is early in the summer in winter they never go farther than to their provision stores and during that season are very fat  they breed once a year and bring forth two or three at a birth  beavers are found chiefly in the northern parts of europe asia and america particularly the latter from whence many thousands of their skins are annually brought into europe in      the hudsons bay company sold     0 beaver skins at one sale  they vary in color the most valuable are black but the general color is a chesnutbrown more or less dark some have been found entirely white others spotted but both these kinds are very rare  the beaver is remarkable for the size and strength of its cutting teeth which enable it to gnaw down trees of great magnitude with ease its ears are short and almost hid in the fur its nose blunt tail broad and flat nearly of an oval form and covered with scales  it serves not only as a rudder to direct its motions in the water but as a most useful instrument for laying on the clay pressing it into the crevices and smoothing the outward covering its fore feet are small and not unlike those of a rat the hind feet are large and strong with membranes between each toe its length from nose to tail is about three feet the tail is eleven inches long and three broad  the castor produced from these animals is found in a liquid state in bags near the anus about the size of an egg when taken off the matter dries and is reducible to a powder which is oily of a sharp bitter taste and a strong disagreeable smell these bags are found indifferently in males and females and were formerly supposed to be the animals testicles which when pursued it was said to bite off and by that means escape with its life    the otter although the otter is not considered by naturalists as wholly amphibious it is nevertheless enabled to remain a considerable time under water and can pursue and take its prey in that element with great facility  the legs are very short but remarkably strong broad and muscular on each foot are five toes connected by strong membranes like those of water fowl the head is broad of an oval form and flat on the upper part the body is long and round and the tail tapers to a point the eyes are brilliant and placed in such a manner that the animal can see every object that is above it which gives it a singular aspect very much resembling an eel or an asp the ears are short and their orifice narrow the fur of the otter is of a deepbrown color with two small light spots on each side of the nose and another under the chin  this animal makes its nest in some retired spot by the side of a lake or river under a bank where it has an easy and secure access to the water to which it immediately flies upon the least alarm and as it swims with great rapidity generally escapes from its pursuers  it destroys great quantities of fish and in pursuit of its prey has been observed commonly to swim against the stream  as soon as the otter has caught a fish it immediately drags it to the shore devours a part as far as the vent and unless pressed by extreme hunger always leaves the remainder and takes to the water in quest of more  otters are generally taken in traps placed near their landing places where they are carefully concealed in the sand  when hunted with dogs the old ones defend themselves with great obstinacy they bite severely and do not readily quit their hold where they have once fastened an old otter will never give up while it has life nor make the least complaint though wounded ever so much by the dogs or even when transfixed with a spear  there are many instances of otters being tamed but in those which have come to our knowledge they were taken when young and accustomed by degrees to obedience and restraint they became so far domesticated as to follow their masters answer to a name and employ their excellent talents at fishing in their service  some years ago james campbell near inverness had a young otter which he brought up and tamed it would follow him wherever he chose and if called on by its name would immediately obey when apprehensive of danger from dogs it sought the protection of its master and would endeavor to fly into his arms for greater security  it was frequently employed in catching fish and would sometimes take eight or ten salmon in a day if not prevented it always made an attempt to break the fish behind the fin next the tail and as soon as one was taken away it immediately dived in pursuit of more when tired it would refuse to fish any longer and was then rewarded with as much fish as it could devour being satisfied with eating it always curled itself round and fell asleep in which state it was generally carried home  the same otter fished as well in the sea as in a river and took great numbers of codlings and other fish  its food was generally fresh fish and sometimes milk  another person who kept a tame otter suffered it to follow him with his dogs it was very useful to him in fishing by going into the water and driving trouts and other fish toward the net  it was remarkable that the dogs though accustomed to the sport were so far from giving it the smallest molestation that they would not even hunt an otter whilst it remained with them on which account the owner was under the necessity of disposing of it  notwithstanding the otters avidity for fish it will not eat it unless it be perfectly fresh when that cannot be procured it is fed with milk or pudding made of oatmeal etc  otters are found in most parts of the world with no great variation  they are common in guiana and frequent the rivers and marshes of that country they are sometimes seen in great numbers together and are so fierce that it is dangerous to come near them they live in holes which they make in the banks of the rivers  the otters of cayenne are very large weighing from ninety to one hundred pounds they frequent the large rivers of that country their cry is loud and may be heard to a great distance they are of a darkbrown color their fur is shorter than that of the beaver and very soft  the small otter found in poland and the north of europe is much less than the common otter and of a duskybrown color its feet are broad webbed and covered with hair its fur is very valuable being next in beauty to that of the sable  this otter is found also in north america where it is called the minx frequents the water and lives on fish is fond of poultry frequently steals into the hen roosts bites off the heads of the fowls and sucks their blood is very fetid and when irritated has a most loathsome smell  its length from nose to tail is twenty inches tail four its fur is of a darkbrown color very glossy and beautiful    the seaotter vast numbers of these animals inhabit the coast of kamtschatka and the numerous islands contiguous to it as well as the opposite coasts of america discovered by the russians they are also found in some of the larger rivers of southamerica  their skins are of great value and have long been considered by the russians as forming a considerable article of their commerce they dispose of them to the chinese at the rate of seventy or a hundred rubles each and receive in return some of their most valuable commodities  the fur of the seaotter is thick and long of a beautiful shining black color but sometimes of a silvery hue the legs are thick and short toes joined by a web the hind feet like those of a seal length from nose to tail four feet two inches tail thirteen flat and pointed at the end  the largest of them weigh from seventy to eighty pounds  the seaotter is remarkably harmless and most affectionately fond of its young it will pine to death for its loss and die on the very spot where it has been taken away before its young can swim it will carry it in its paws and support it in the water laying upon its back  it swims in various positions  on its back sides and even in a perpendicular posture and in the water is very sportive two of them are sometimes seen embracing each other it frequents shallow places abounding with sea weed and feeds on lobsters crabs and other shell fish  it breeds but once a year and produces one young at a time which it suckles and carefully attends almost a year  the flesh of a young otter is reckoned delicate eating and not easily distinguished from that of lamb  the sloth of all animals is the most sluggish and inactive and if we were to judge from outward appearance would seem the most helpless and wretched all its motions seem to be the effect of the most painful exertion which hunger alone is capable of exciting  it lives chiefly in trees and having ascended one with infinite labor and difficulty it remains there till it has entirely stripped it of all its verdure sparing neither fruit blossom nor leaf after which it is said to devour even the bark being unable to descend it throws itself on the ground and continues at the bottom of the tree till hunger again compels it to renew its toils in search of subsistence its motions are accompanied with a most piteous and lamentable cry which is its only defense and secures it from the attacks of beasts of prey which are said to quit it with horror upon hearing its cry  though slow awkward and almost incapable of motion the sloth is strong remarkably tenacious of life and capable of enduring a long abstinence from food we are told of one that having fastened itself by its feet to a pole remained in that situation forty days without the least sustenance  the strength in its legs and feet is so great that having seized any thing it is almost impossible to oblige it to quit its hold the same animal laid hold of a dog that was set loose upon it and held him fast with its feet till he perished with hunger  there are two kinds of sloths which are principally distinguished by the number of their claws the one called the a is about the size of a fox and has three long claws on each foot its legs are clumsy and aukwardly placed and the fore legs being longer than the hind add greatly to the difficulty of its progressive motion its whole body is covered with a rough coat of long hair of a lightishbrown color mixed with white not unlike that of a badger and has a black line down the middle of the back its face is naked and of a dirtywhite color tail short eyes small black and heavy it is found only in southamerica  the unau has only two claws on each foot its head is short and round somewhat like that of a monkey its ears are short and it has no tail it is found in southamerica and also in the island of ceylon  the flesh of both kinds is eaten  they have several stomachs and are said to belong to the tribe of ruminating animals    the anteater there are several animals distinguished by the common name of anteaters which differ greatly in form  they are divided into three classes viz the great the middle and the lesser anteater  the great anteater is nearly four feet in length exclusive of its tail which is two and a half it is remarkable for the great length of its snout which is of a cylindrical form and serves as a sheath to its long and slender tongue which always lies folded double in its mouth and is the chief instrument by which it finds subsistence  this creature is a native of brazil and guiana runs slowly frequently swims over rivers lives wholly on ants which it collects by thrusting its tongue into their holes and having penetrated every part of the nest withdraws it into its mouth loaded with prey  its legs are so strong that few animals can extricate themselves from its gripe it is said to be formidable even to the panthers of america and sometimes fixes itself upon them in such a manner that both of them fall and perish together for its obstinacy is so great that it will not extricate itself from its adversary even after he is dead  the flesh has a strong disagreeable taste but is eaten by the indians  the middle anteater is one foot seven inches from nose to tail it inhabits the same countries and procures its food in the same manner as the last its tail is ten inches long with which it secures its hold in climbing trees by twisting it round the branches  both these animals have four strong claws on the fore feet and five on the hind  the lesser anteater has a sharppointed nose inclining a little downward its ears are small and hid in the fur it has two strong hooked claws on the fore feet the outward one being much the largest and four on the hind feet its fur is long soft and silky  of a yellowishbrown color its length from nose to tail is seven inches and a half tail above eight thick at the base and taper to the end  it inhabits guiana climbs trees in quest of a species of ants which build their nests among the branches  animals of this kind are found in ceylon and the cape of good hope  kolben describes the latter as having long heads and tongues that they feed on ants and are so strong that if they fasten their claws in the ground they cannot easily be pulled away  it is called in ceylon the talgi or antbear  the great manis or pangolin this singular animal is protected from external injury by a coat of mail so strong as to be sufficient to protect it from the attacks of the most powerful animals all the upper parts of its body are closely covered with scales of different sizes which it can erect at pleasure opposing to its adversary a formidable row of offensive weapons which wound while they resist and thus repel the most rapacious invader the tiger the panther or the leopard in vain attempt to force it the moment it perceives the approach of an enemy it rolls itself up like a hedgehog and by that means secures all the weaker parts of its body  this creature is a native of formosa and the indian isles is likewise found in guinea where it feeds on ants which it takes by laying out its long red tongue covered with an unctuous slime across the paths of those insects  it is slow in its motions grows to the length of eight feet including its tail which is four  its flesh is much esteemed for its delicacy but it is difficult to procure as the animal avoids mankind and lives in obscure retreats in woods and marshy places  the phatagin is a variety of this animal but much less being not more than a foot long from head to tail its body is covered with sharppointed scales its throat and belly with hair its legs are short and each foot has four claws it is remarkable for the great length of its tail which in some is above a yard long  it is a native of guinea has been sometimes called the scaly lizard and may be said to be the connecting link in the chain of being between quadrupeds and reptiles  the armadillo is found only in southamerica where there are several varieties of them they are all covered with a strong crust or shell and are distinguished from each other by the number of the flexible bands of which it is composed  it is a harmless inoffensive animal feeds on roots fruits and other vegetables grows very fat and is greatly esteemed for the delicacy of its flesh  the indians hunt it with small dogs trained for that purpose  when surprised it runs to its hole or attempts to make a new one which it does with great expedition having strong claws on its fore feet with which it adheres so firmly to the ground that if it should be caught by the tail whilst making its way into the earth its resistance is so great that it will sometimes leave it in the hands of its pursuers to avoid this the hunter has recourse to artifice and by tickling it with a stick it gives up its hold and suffers itself to be taken alive if no other means of escape be left it rolls itself up within its covering by drawing in its head and legs and bringing its tail round them as a band to connect them more forcibly together in this situation it sometimes escapes by rolling itself over the edge of a precipice and generally falls to the bottom unhurt  the most successful method of catching armadillos is by snares laid for them by the sides of rivers and places where they frequent they all burrow very deep in the ground and seldom stir out except during the night whilst they are in search of food  to give a minute description of the shells or coverings of the armadillos would be extremely difficult as they are all composed of a number of parts differing greatly from each other in the order and disposition of the figures with which they are distinguished but it may be necessary to observe that in general there are two large pieces that cover the shoulders and the rump between which lie the bands which are more or less in number in different kinds these bands are not unlike those in the tail of a lobster and being flexible give way to the motions of the animal  the first we shall mention is  the tatuapara or threebanded armadillo its shell is about twelve inches long with three bands in the middle the crust on the head back and rump is divided into a number of elegant raised figures with five angles or sides its tail is not more than two inches long it has neither cutting nor canine teeth and has fve toes on each foot  the tatou or sixbanded armadillo is about the size of a young pig between the folds of the bands there are a few scattered hairs its tail is long thick at the base and tapers to a point  it is found in brazil and guiana  the tatuette is furnished with eight bands its ears are long and upright eyes small and black it has four toes on the fore feet and five on the hind its length from nose to tail is about ten inches the tail nine  it inhabits brazil and is reckoned more delicious eating than the others  the ninebanded armadillo has a tenth band moveable half way up on each side the shell on the shoulders and rump is marked with hexangular figures the breast and belly are covered with long hairs its tail is long and taper and the whole animal three feet in length  one of this kind was brought to england a few years ago from the musquito shore and lived some time it was fed with raw beef and milk but refused to eat our fruits and grain  the kabassou is furnished with twelve bands is the largest of all the armadillos being almost three feet long from nose to tail the figures on the shoulders are of an oblong form those on the rump hexangular it is seldom eaten  the weaselheaded armadillo so called from the form of its head which is slender has eighteen bands from its shoulder to its tail the shell is marked with square figures on the shoulders those on the legs and thighs are roundish the body is about fifteen inches long tail five  all these animals have the power of drawing themselves up under their shells either for the purpose of repose or safety they are furnished with strong lateral muscles consisting of numberless fibers crossing each other in the form of an x with which they contract themselves so powerfully that the strongest man is scarcely able to force them open the shells of the larger armadillos are much stronger than those of the smaller kinds their flesh is likewise harder and more unfit for the table    the walrus or seahorse there are several animals whose residence is almost constantly in the water and which seem to partake greatly of the nature of fishes that are nevertheless classed by naturalists under the denomination of quadrupeds and being perfectly amphibious living with equal ease in the water as on land may be considered as the last step in the scale of nature by which we are conducted from one great division of the animal world to the other of these the walrus is the most considerable for its size being sometimes found eighteen feet in length and twelve in circumference at the thickest part it is likewise remarkable for two large tusks in the upper jaw which sometimes exceed two feet in length and weigh from three to twenty pounds each  the head of the walrus is round its lips very broad and covered over with thick pellucid bristles its eyes small and red instead of ears it has two small orifices and above the whiskers semicircular nostrils through which it throws out water like the whale but with much less noise its skin is thick and wrinkled and has a thin covering of short brownish hair its legs are short it has five toes on each foot connected by membranes and on each toe a small nail the hind feet are very broad and extended nearly on a line with the body  the walrus is chiefly found in the northern seas great herds of them are sometimes seen together on the sea shore or sleeping on an island of ice when alarmed they instantly throw themselves into the water with great precipitation if wounded they become bold and furious and unite in the defense of each other will attack a boat and endeavor to sink it by striking their great teeth into its sides at the same time bellowing in a most hideous manner  it is hunted for its teeth which are equal to those of the elephant for durability and whiteness  an ordinary walrus is said to yield half a ton of oil equal in goodness to that of the whale  the female produces one or two young at a time which she suckles upon land  in climbing upon the ice the walrus makes use of its teeth as hooks to secure its hold and draw its great unwieldy body after it  it feeds on seaweeds and shellfish which it is said to disengage from the rocks to which they adhere with its tusks  the white bear is its greatest enemy in the combats between these animals the walrus is said to be generally victorious on account of the desperate wounds it inflicts with its teeth  the seal is found with some variety in almost every quarter of the globe in the northern seas of asia europe and america as well as the less frequented regions toward the south pole  its usual length is from five to six feet the body is closely covered with short hair of various colors smooth and shining its tongue is forked at the end it has two canine teeth in each jaw six cutting teeth in the upper and four in the lower it has five toes on each foot furnished with strong sharp claws which enable it to climb the rocks on which it frequently basks  it swims with great strength and swiftness is very playful and sports without fear about ships and boats it feeds on various kinds of fish and is frequently seen near the shore in pursuit of its prey  seals are found in great abundance on the coasts of great britain particularly in the deep recesses and caverns in the northern parts of the island where they resort in the breeding time and continue till the young ones are old enough to go to sea  the time for taking seals is in the month of october or the beginning of november the hunters provided with torches and bludgeons enter the mouths of the caverns about midnight and row in as far as they can where they land and being properly stationed begin by making a great noise which alarms the seals and brings them down from all parts of the cavern in a confused body making frightful shrieks and cries in this hazardous employment great care is necessary on the part of the hunters to avoid the throng which presses down with great impetuosity and bears away every thing that opposes its progress but when the first crowd is past they kill great numbers of young ones which generally straggle behind by striking them on the nose  a young seal yields above eight gallons of oil  when full grown their skins are very valuable and make a beautiful kind of leather much used in making shoes etc  the flesh of the seal is sometimes eaten and that it was formerly admitted to the tables of the great may be seen in the billoffare of a sumptuous entertainment given by archbishop nevil in the reign of edward the fourth  the growth of seals is so amazingly rapid that after nine tides from their birth they are as active as the old ones  the female brings forth her young on the land sits on her hind legs while she suckles them and as soon as they are able carries them to sea learns them to swim and search for food when they become fatigued she places them on her back the young ones know the voice of their mother and attend to her call  the voice of the seal has been compared to the hoarse barking of a dog when young it is clearer and resembles the mewing of a cat  seals are likewise found in the mediterranean and caspian seas in the lake baikal and some of the larger lakes these are smaller than the salt water seals but so fat that they seem almost shapeless  the ursine seal or seabear is much larger than the common seal being eight feet in length and weighing eight hundred pounds  these animals are found among the islands which lie between kamtschatka and america also on the coasts of new zealand staten island new georgia and falklands islands  they lie in thousands on the shore in separate families each consisting of above an hundred one male will sometimes have fifty females which he guards with extreme jealousy they are excessively fat and indolent sometimes scarcely ever moving from the place where they lie for the space of three months during which time the females breed and suckle their young if another approach their station they are roused from their supineness a battle ensues which frequently becomes general and spreads confusion through the whole shore these conflicts are extremely violent and the wounds they receive very deep resembling a cut with a sabre  the attachment of the male to the young is very strong he defends them with great obstinacy and frequently revenges their loss upon the female whom he beats most cruelly whilst she crawls to his feet and seems to deprecate his wrath with the most obsequious gstures  the female generally brings forth one seldom two at a time  they swim with great ease at the rate of about seven miles in an hour when wounded they will seize on a boat carry it along with them and sometimes sink it they can continue a long time under water in climbing rocks they fasten their fore paws and draw themselves up  these and all the seal kind will live a long time after receiving the most dreadful wounds but the most trifling blow on the snout or forehead instantly kills them  the general color of these animals is black they are covered with a coat of long rough hair under which is a soft down of a bay color on the neck of the old ones the hair is erect and a little longer than the rest  the fat and flesh of the old males are very nauseous but those of the females and the young when roasted are said to be as good as the flesh of a sucking pig  addenda the american elk of which we here give a faithful portrait from a living one lately brought from the interior parts of america seems to be a different animal from that generally described under the name of the elk or moosedeer to which it has very little resemblance it seems indeed to belong to a distinct species and is probably the elk or orignal of canada and the northern parts of america  at the age of five years its length was nine feet from the end of the muzzle to the insertion of the tail the head and neck being extended in a line with the body its height at the shoulder four feet six inches length of the head one foot six inches breadth over the forehead seven inches length of the fore legs two feet five inches length of the neck two feet six its ears nine inches and tail three its horns which it had just shed are not palmated like those of the moose they are large and when full grown measure above six feet from tip to tip the antlers are round and pointed at the ends the lowermost antler forms a curve downward over each eye to which it appears a defense its hair was long of a dark dun color on the back and sides on the head and legs darkbrown its eyes full and lively and below each there is a deep slit about two inches in length the use of which we are unable to discover  it was a lively active animal of great strength of body and limbs its hoofs are much smaller than those of the reindeer the division between them less and when the animal is in motion do not make a rattling noise it has no mane but the hair under its neck is longer than that of any other part of the body  we are told by the owner of this very rare and beautiful animal that it does not attain its full growth till twenty years old and that it sheds its horns every third year  wild cattle we have been favored by marmaduke tunstall esquire of wycliffe with the following particulars relative to the wild cattle of this island which it has been generally supposed were only to be found at chillingham in the county of northumberland  they are very numerous at wollaton in nottinghamshire the seat of lord middleton the ears and noses of these are black when fat they weigh from sixty to seventy stone as soon as the calves are dropped they are always taken away and put to a tame cow to be brought up  at gisburne in craven yorkshire the seat of  lister esquire there are some perfectly white except the insides of their ears which are brown without horns very strongboned but not high they have little or no fat within but it is finely interlarded with the flesh they are said to have been brought originally from whalley abbey in lancashire upon its dissolution in the   d of henry viii tradition says they were drawn to gisburne by the power of music  besides these there are great numbers of wild cattle at limehall in cheshire the seat of  leigh esquire they are all white and have red ears  there were formerly great numbers of wild cattle at chartley in staffordshire the seat of earl ferrers but their numbers are now much reduced and the breed almost extinct  these are all the accounts we have been able to collect of this expiring breed which formerly ranged at large in the wild and extensive forests which overspread this kingdom  finis
