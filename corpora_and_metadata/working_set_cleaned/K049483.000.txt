ulysses a tragedy  ulysses a tragedy  as it is acted at the queens theater in the haymarket by her majestys sworn servants  written by n row esquire  stultorum regum and populorum continet astus  rursus quid virtus and quid sapientia possit utile proposuit nobis exemplar ulyssem horat epist bib   epist   london printed for jacob tonson within grays inn gate next grays inn lane   0   to the right honorable sidney lord godolphin lord hightreasurer of england and knight of the most noble order of the garter my lord if those cares in which the service of a great queen and the love of your country have so justly engaged your lordship would allow any leisure to run back and remember those arts and studies which were once the grace and entertainment of your lordships youth i have presumption enough to hope that this tragedy may some time or other find an hour to divert your lordship poetry which was so venerable to former ages as in many places to make a part of their religious worship and every where to be had in the highest honor and esteem has miserably languishd and been despised for want of that favor and protection which it found in the famous augustan age since then it may be asserted without any partiality to the present time it never had a fairer prospect of lifting up its head and returning to its former reputation than now and the best reason can be given for it is that it seems to have a particular hope from and dependence upon your lordship and to expect all just encouragement when those great men who have the power to protect it have so delicate and polite a taste and understanding of its true value the restoring and preserving any part of learning is so generous an action in it self that it naturally falls into your lordships province since every thing that may serve to improve the mind has a right to the patronage of so great and universal a genius for knowledge as your lordships it is indeed a piece of good fortune upon which i cannot help congratulating the present age that there is so great a man at a time when there is so great an occasion for him the divisions which your lordship has healed the temper which you have restored to our councils and that indefatigable care and diligence which you have used in preserving our peace at home are benefits so virtuously and so seasonably conferred upon your country as shall draw the praises of all wise men and the blessings of all good men upon your lordships name and when those unreasonable feuds and animosities which keep faction alive shall be buried in silence and forgotten that great public good shall be universally acknowledged as the happy effect of your lordships most equal temper and right understanding that this glorious end may very suddenly succeed to your lordships candor and generous endeavors after it must be the wish of every good englishman  i am my lord your lordships most obedient humble servant n row  prologue spoken by mr betterton to night in honor of the married life our author treats you with a virtuous wife a lady who for twenty years withstood the pressing instances of flesh and blood her husband still a man of sense reputed unless this tale his wisdom have confuted left her at ripe eighteen to seek renown and battle for a harlot at troy town to fill his place fresh lovers came in shoals much such as now adays are cupids tools some men of wit but the most part were fools they sent her billets doux and presents many of ancient tea and thericlean china railed at the gods toasted her over and over dressed at her danced and fought and sighed and swore in short did all that men could do to have her and damned themelves to get into her favor but all in vain the virtuous dame stood buff and let em know that she was coxcomb proof messieurs the beaux what think you of the matter dont you believe old homer given to flatter when you approach and pressing the soft hand favors with wellbred impudence demand is it in womans weakness to withstand cease to be vain and give the sex their due our english wives shall prove this story true we have our chaste penelopes who mourn their widowed beds and wait their lords return we have our heroes too who bravely bear far from their home the dangers of the war who careless of the winter seasons rage new toils explore and in new cares engage from realm to realm their chief unwearied goes and restless journies on to give the world repose such are the constant labors of the sun whose active glorious course is never done and though when hence he parts with us it is night still he goes on and lends to other worlds his light ye beauteous nymphs with open arms prepare to meet the warriors and reward their care may you for ever kind and faithful prove and pay their days of toil with nights of love  epilogue spoke by mrs bracegirdle just going to take water at the stairs i stopped and came again to beg your prayers you see how ill my love has been repaid that i am like to live and die a maid poetic rules and justice to maintain i to the woods am ordered back again to madam cinthia and her virgin train it is an uncomfortable life they lead instead of quilts and down the silvan bed with skins of beasts with leaves and moss is spread no morning toilets do their chambers grace where famous pearl cosmeticks find a place with powder for the teeth and plaster for the face but in defiance of complexion they like arrant huswives rise by break of day cut a brown crust saddle their nags and mounting in scorn of the green sickness ride a hunting your sal and hartshorn drops they deal not in they have no vapors nor no witty spleen no coffee to be had and i am told as to the tea they drink it is mostly cold for conversation nothing can be worse it is all amongst themselves and that is the curse one topic there as here does seldom fail we women rarely want a theme to rail but bating that one pleasure of backbiting there is no earthly thing they can delight in there are no indian houses to drop in and fancy stuffs and choose a pretty screen to while away an hour or so  i swear these cups are pretty but they are deadly dear and if some unexpected friend appear the devilish  who could have thought to meet you here we should but very badly entertain you that delight in toasting and champaign but keep your tender persons safe at home we know you

pleasing theme we talked and mingled sweet discourse when on the sudden the cry of hounds the jolly huntsmans horn with all the cheerful music of the chase surpised my ear  and straight a troop of nymphs once the dear partners of my virgin heart flew lightly by us eager of the sport last came the goddess great latonas daughter with more than mortal grace she stood confessed i saw the golden quiver at her back and heard the sounding of her silver bow abashed i rose and lowly made obeisance but she not sweet nor affable nor smiling as once she wont with stern regard beheld me and wherefore do thou loiter here she said of me thy fellows and our sports unmindful return thou fugitive nor vainly hope to dress thy bridal bed and waste thy youth in wanton pleasures and inglorious love a virgin at my altar were thou vowed it is fixed by fate and thou art mine for ever with that she snatched a chaplet from my hand which for thy head in fondness i had wove and bore me swiftly with her  in my flight backwards methought i turned my eyes to thee but found thee not for thou were vanished from me and in thy place my father lay extended upon the earth a bloody lifeless coarse struck to
