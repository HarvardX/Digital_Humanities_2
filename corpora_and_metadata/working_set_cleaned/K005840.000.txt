observations on the use of opium in removing symptoms supposed to be owing to morbid irritability  by alexander grant senior surgeon of his majestys military hospitals during the late war in north america  london printed by j nichols for the author  m dcc lxxxv  to robert adair esquire inspector general of all his majestys military hospitals etc etc etc sir immediately upon my return to this country i should have communicated the following observations on the use of opium but one opportunity soon offering of exhibiting it in a similar case to those in which i had found it successful and since that three or four others the last of which was a very bad ulcerated throat i thought it was better to wait the event of these cases than too hastily to adopt an opinion which from its novelty and importance demanded the most guarded circumspection  as the experienced salutary effects of opium in a disease in which its effects have hitherto been little known arose in most instances from circumstances in the constitution owing to irregularities incident to a military life i have endeavored as far as my experience would lead me precisely to determine what these circumstances are  and as it is to you sir i am indebted for the situation which afforded me these observations i think it my duty to address them to you and i am extremely happy in this opportunity of expressing my gratitude and of assuring you that i am always with esteem and truth sir  your most obedient and most obliged humble servant alexander grant st albans street jan         in the year      i had an opportunity of observing in his majestys general hospital at new york the good effects of opium in a variety of cases originally venereal in which mercurial preparations appeared to be of no efficacy  it happened that a great number of soldiers fell under my care at the same time who labored under evident symptoms of morbid irritability which might be owing to different causes but all these patients were undergoing or had undergone a course of mercury  these symptoms in all their variety of appearances and changes at first arising from the venereal virus and terminating in what has since upon reasoning and reflection appeared to me to have been brought on by morbid irritability were all relieved and finally the cure completed by alleviating pain and procuring rest  and here i may remark that soldiers in general are cured of the venereal disease with more difficulty than any other patients owing to their ignorance and inattention or to their desire of protracting the disease and frustrating the usual modes of relief  the state of the disease in which as far as i am able to judge from the trials i have made our expectations are likely to be answered from the use of opium is when the ulcers are spreading or continue much the same with a foul appearance bad discharge and much pain the patient having little or no rest and all local applications seeming to be of no service to these symptoms may be added a quick pulse which is an invariable attendant being in general above an hundred sometimes an hundred and twenty and sometimes more in a minute  when i first administered opium in cases of this sort i had the satisfaction to find that i gained two material points viz ease and rest with some in the first twentyfour hours and in general within two days afterward from these good consequences i was induced to continue the use of it increasing or diminishing the quantity as occasion required and entirely omitting at the same time the use of mercurial applications either externally or internally  without entering into a disquisition on opium i take the liberty of concluding that it will be sufficient if i am enabled to state facts and mention the useful effects of this medicine in a disease which is one of the most violent that the human body can be afflicted with  with regard to the action of opium on the body in this disease i have to observe that in some patients its effects were sudden in others gradual in general the circulation of the blood was very much decreased by it and sometimes the pulse was rendered so slow as to beat only fifty and forty times in a minute but this effect is not always necessary to the cure as a good deal will depend upon the patients disposition to irritability which is the principal thing i attend to  for i have constantly observed that as soon as that has been lessened some salutary change has been produced on the surface of the ulcer  its effects in a few of the cases were almost instantaneous amongst these was that of a young man twentytwo years of age who had two buboes one in each groin which were opened and treated in the usual way but continued in an ulcerated state for five months during which time he rubbed in three ounces and a half of strong mercurial ointment which seemed sufficiently to affect the constitution a proper diet was used and every thing else directed which was thought necessary at the time no change being perceived he was ordered to wash out and take purging physic which he did several times three weeks elapsed and at this period he was not in the least emaciated but remained in full strength and good habit of body at this time the ulcers were foul with thick edges and the discharge from them ichorous with considerable pain and the patient had little or no rest i then began with opium and gave him the first night one grain and a half only directed a low diet and dressed the ulcers in the most simple manner the next day there was no alteration i increased the dose of the medicine half a grain in that day the following day he was much the same but the day afterward which was the fourth a favorable change was observed and from that time to the expiration of three weeks gradual changes took place and both ulcers perfectly healed without his having had occasion to increase the dose or to make use of any other medicine and here i will beg leave to remark that with every patient i have avoided as much as possible such applications as seemed to make the parts in any way uneasy a soft wellmade bread and milk poultice will answer in the early part of the treatment and afterward dry lint and cerate but if a fungus exists i prefer a solution of thebaic extract in an oatmeal poultice applied cold in contact with the sore to any thing else  the manner in which the alteration takes place is both curious and singular the first favorable symptoms are ease and rest the next if i may be allowed the expression is an unfolding or loosening of the texture of the surface of the ulcer after the irritability is lessened which effect soon takes place the parts are in a state of relaxation owing to the stricture on the surface being relieved and finally the cure is assisted by the skin corrugating or contracting to the center of the ulcer unaided by stimulating applications and frequently with very little assistance by the usual way of a new skin  in several cases i have observed the cure go on extremely well without the surface of the ulcer appearing florid at any one time as is usual in healthylooking sores i am very happy in this part in having mr wiers surgeon of his majestys military hospitals permission to say that he has observed all the above facts that i mention and since that having communicated my ideas to mr forster who is likewise surgeon of his majestys military hospitals and whose abilities i respect i have much satisfaction in being able to add his opinion in corroborating the above facts mr forster having observed the same appearances and changes that i have endeavored to describe  the third fourth or fifth day was the time i in general found the appearance of the sores change for the better  the dose that i have in general begun with in this disease has been about one grain and a half the first night which i have increased night and morning until i found it answered the intended purposes with a view of keeping the patient quiet and less disposed to move i always divided the time and therefore gave it night and morning and what is very extraordinary the patient in the daytime never appeared to me more drowsy than if he were not making use of the medicine but with some an indolency took place and continued or discontinued either as the constitution became used to the medicine or to the variation of the dose i confess myself i was always happy when it appeared as i never knew any harm accrue from it and besides its own action internally opium disposes a restless temper of mind to observe a proper regimen and to obey any directions that may be thought necessary at the time i have always observed that it is best to keep the patient ignorant of the medicine whilst he is using it  a tremor which sometimes came on never obliged me to decrease the dose or to pay any particular attention to this symptom unless the bowels were disposed to be costive and then a purge readily relieved it in a great measure  the preparation that i invariably gave my patients was extractum thebaicum if any objection arose to its being used in a solid state i preferred dissolving the dose in plain water to the tincture or any other form  with regard to the quantity that may be given i will not determine i think for the most part the disease yielded to about four or six grains a day i have in two or three cases given eight grains and in one extraordinary case of a cancerous lip of near three years standing i increased the quantity to twentyfour grains in a day divided in three doses the patient was a man about fifty years of age and i was six weeks in bringing him to this dose which i continued for a few days and finding that it did not do any material service in the progress of the cure i discontinued it yet now and then a favorable change seemed to appear for two sinuses that i had occasion to lay open digested well and closed no ill effects were produced by the medicine excepting sometimes a giddiness which was always relieved by a gentle purge previous to his making use of opium he had always a quick pulse but it afterward decreased to between forty and fifty strokes in a minute and continued so for some time and i cannot help being very much of opinion that had opium been properly given in the earlier state of the disease a cure might have been obtained and in this opinion i am confirmed by a case i have lately attended which was an ulcer in the mouth of three months standing with all the characteristic marks and symptoms of an incipient cancer which was completely cured by opium and cicuta joined this patient major sinclair dr garthshore attended with me the first time we saw him we agreed in opinion with respect to the means to be pursued for his cure and never had occasion to deviate from the plan before he began the use of these medicines he was almost in a state of distraction from pain and his pulse beat an hundred and twenty strokes in a minute this quickness of pulse was diminished on the third day and about the tenth the ulcers changed for the better and in a month afterward he was quite well this patient drank a decoction of four ounces of sarsaparilla every twentyfour hours during his cure   gentle purges frequently become necessary in the early part of using the medicine though in a small dose especially where the body is disposed to be costive and i have generally found that a little glauber salts answered the purpose as this operated without my being obliged to delay the use of opium on the second or third day with some a headache came on in consequence of the bowels being constipated but this always readily gave way to a gentle purge and i have always found that as the constitution became used to the medicine the pain of the head was no longer an attendant and in general the body became regular nay with some a diarrhoea has been produced which has continued for two or three days and that without seeming to do any harm  an increased secretion of saliva is not uncommon as well as of urine it does not depend upon taking a large quantity for it will happen sometimes in the first six days but neither one nor the other seems at any time to be injurious nor does it appear necessary to forward the cure as patients who have experienced neither of those effects have obtained it in as short a space of time  one remark further i must add with regard to diet viz that until i procured ease and rest i continued the patient on a low diet which i in general began with and as circumstances changed afterward so i made such alterations as the constitution seemed to require sometimes adding meat and sometimes either a gill of rum in the day or wine in proportion  from the above observations it will appear that i am inclined to confine the good effects of opium which are indeed very considerable to an advanced stage of the disease or what in my humble opinion may more properly be termed morbid irritability simply in which state mercury has either lost its efficacy or seems to do mischief and this irritability may i apprehend probably arise from different causes as it certainly may be a question whether there was any virus of a venereal nature remaining in the cases in which i gave opium however that may be the good effects of the medicine were unquestionable and it will appear that i do not trust to opium as a specific in recent cases or where any part of the venereal virus might seem to remain for the last case i had under my care being of so complicated a nature i joined mercury with the opium for the last three weeks but not till i had fully and effectually relieved the symptoms of morbid irritability  the case i allude to was that of a bad sore throat which came under my care about six months ago the patient was a gentleman about three or four and thirty years of age and of a thin habit  at the time i first saw him he was rather in an emaciated state he was pursuing a course of mercury which he had began about two months before i found upon examination several ulcers in the fauces and a large one on the left tonsil a severe pain on the forepart of one leg with the periosteum thickened  an eruption on his breast his pulse beating an hundred and thirty strokes in a minute a most restless disposition  great anxiety  and he had not had any sleep for some weeks i omitted entirely the whole of the plan he was then upon and did not give him any thing till bedtime when he took one grain and a half of opium with directions to repeat one grain the morning following upon seeing him the next day before i asked him a question he cried out i am a well man to what i was i have had no pain since last night and slept well this formed the foundation of his cure i increased the dose till he took three grains at night and two in the morning  on the second day he made use of the steam of hot water through the inhaler which he repeated occasionally afterward with evident advantage  on the third day the ulcers seemed to appear cleaner and every day afterward he gradually grew better till the twentyfourth day when all the parts were healed  on the fifth day i observed that his pulse was in a natural state and it continued so the whole time of his recovery  the eighth day after using the opium a spitting came on and continued eleven days for a few days he spit about a pint each day this did not weaken him in the least  from being confined to his bed he was able to walk about and every day gained strength just at this time i directed a quart of very strong decoction of sarsaparilla to be taken every day which produced a gentle diaphoresis and i continued this plan for six weeks and for the sake of security for the last three weeks i joined to the opium at bedtime half a grain of mercurius calcinatus in the course of the first fortnight the eruption disappeared and the thickened periosteum gave way to a blister  on the  0th day i began to decrease the quantity of opium  and from the   th to the   d day when i left it off considering him as perfectly cured i only gave one grain in the twentyfour hours  he had occasion to make use of purging medicines at different times owing to a costive habit of body but these never interfered with the opium  as concisely as possible i will just mention among other cases the following  william rockett of the detachment of guards that was in america during the late war thirtyseven years of age had ulcers on each tonsil and almost the whole of the fauces with violent pains in his bones these complaints were of three months standing mercurials and other medicines had been administered during the whole of that time  he was of a thin habit of body with a pulse from an hundred and twenty to an hundred and thirty strokes in a minute he began with one grain and a half of opium the first night  on the third day no alteration having taken place i increased the dose one grain  the next day to appearance the ulcers seemed not quite so angry and in every other respect he was better  on the eighth day he appeared weak and his throat in general relaxed i omitted the opium and began with the peruvian bark in as large doses as the patients stomach would bear and ordered him to make use of an astringent gargle  on the tenth day the bark occasioning nausea i was obliged to leave it off the pain in his bones returning with violence i again gave him two grains in the morning  the next day he was better  on the twelfth day as he was much the same i increased the dose one grain in the morning and continued this plan to the fiftysecond day without varying the dose when every thing seemed to go on so extremely well and the pains of the bones having left him i omitted the two grains in the morning  in a week afterward all the ulcers were healed and he was gaining strength daily i continued one grain at night for a fortnight longer and discharged him from the hospital perfectly cured it was near a fortnight before the pulse returned to its natural state and afterward it was frequently under sixty  this case happened among the first in the year      and mr rush surgeon to the second troop of horse grenadier guards and late surgeon to the brigade of guards in north america was witness to the whole of the treatment  thomas wells thirtysix years of age of a strong plethorick habit of body with rather a full pulse had small ulcers on the tonsils and fauces and an ophthalmia for which he had been salivated without the least benefit i directed for him a low diet and began with giving him one grain of opium night and morning  the next day he was easier  the second day much the same  the third day a good deal better  and on the sixth day being much the same i increased the dose one grain at night  the next day he was going on well and continued getting better till the fourteenth day when his throat was quite well and his eyes much relieved  on the sixteenth i omitted the opium in the morning  and on the eighteenth as he was nearly well i omitted one grain at night  on the twentythird the inflammation was gone and in every other respect he was perfectly well  on the thirtieth day the opium was entirely omitted and he was discharged from the hospital  april  th      i was desired to see john blewers a sailor twentyeight years of age of a plethorick habit of body with ulcers on the glans penis a phymosis the praeputium in a gangrenous state and suffering most excruciating pain his pulse beat an hundred and twentystrokes in a minute and appeared to be increasing in quickness he had rubbed enough of the mercurial ointment to affect his mouth twice  i began with two grains of opium at night and one in the morning  the next day he said he had enjoyed a good nights rest which he had been a stranger to for some time  on the ninth he was much the same in appearance and i directed two grains of opium to be taken night and morning  on the tenth he had ease and rest  on the eleventh the pain was much relieved and there was an appearance of part of the praeputium sloughing  on the twelfth he was not quite so well and the dose of opium was now increased to three grains night and morning  thirteenth he was better  fourteenth the slough was thrown off and he was better in every respect  fifteenth he was in a good state and continued going on well till the eighteenth of may when the ulcers being nearly healed i decreased the dose of opium to four grains a day  twentieth and twentyfirst i decreased the dose two grains more  twentyfifth he was quite well but continued to take a single grain a day for a week longer  besides the above i had the satisfaction of effectually relieving with the same manner of treatment ten other patients of whom six had either obstinate or spreading ulcers in the groin one an ulcerated glans penis and three ulcerations of the tonsils and fauces  having remarked that in cases where fungus exists i prefer a solution of thebaic extract in an oatmealpoultice made and applied cold i beg leave as proofs of its peculiar efficacy to add the two following cases neither of which as far as my enquiries went originated from the venereal disease  i isaac pratt twenty years of age had a very large ulcer on the fore part of his right leg with a fungus at least an inch high on one part inclining to the inside of the leg and of a hard texture  this ulcer which came on after a long intermittent fever began with an inflammation attended with small white blisters it grew worse and worse and when i first saw him was of thirteen months standing the peruvian bark and other medicines were occasionally made use of as seemed necessary as were also a variety of external applications including a tight bandage without producing any favorable change though the patient recovered his health in every other respect the discharge from the ulcer was ichorous and at times the pain was very great but at intervals he was perfectly easy his pulse was never affected excepting when he was in pain  conjecturing that morbid irritability might be the cause of the ulcers continuing in the same bad state i left off the usual dressings and in their stead applied to the sore an oatmealpoultice prepared with a solution of thebaic extract in the proportion of three drachms of the latter to eight ounces of cold water this dressing i renewed twice a day and i likewise began with giving him internally one grain of opium night and morning  this was on the   th of february    0  on the   th no alteration was produced i increased the dose to two grains night and morning  march  d no alteration being observable i increased the dose of opium to three grains night and morning at this time i found it necessary to give him a purge  on the  th there seemed to be an appearance of a favorable change  during the five following days the changes for the better though slow were very evident and upon applying my finger to the fungus i felt that it was not quite so hard as before at this time another purge was thought necessary and the patient continued till the latter end of april gradually getting better  the same dose of opium viz three grains was constantly exhibited and now and then as occasion required a small dose of salts which always answered the purpose of procuring stools when well diluted  on the  d of may the fungus was totally gone and the ulcer nearly healed  on the  th i decreased the dose of opium to two grains in the day  on the  th i decreased it to one grain  and on the  th i entirely left it off  on the  0th the ulcer was perfectly cicatrized i had continued the poultice till within six days of the cure and then applied cerate  about eight months afterward i saw this man and he informed me that his leg had continued well from the time he was discharged from the hospital  this ulcer healed without having had at any one time a florid appearance  this case with others that i have had an opportunity of observing together with the remarks of my colleagues messrs forster and wier will i flatter myself be sufficient to make surgeons less fearful of the probability of a cure being obtained and less desirous of using stimulating applications with a view of producing the change to a florid or what is commonly termed healthy state of an ulcer for as far as i am able to judge by so doing the cure will be protracted  ii march   th    0 abraham elstone fortyone years of age was received into the general hospital with an ulceration on the whole surface of the chin and left side of the lower jaw with a fungus of nearly the thickness of half an inch irritable to the touch and extending universally over the ulcer and attended with an ichorous discharge he had been six weeks in this state  he informed me that at two or three different times in the early part of his life he had been subject to an enlargement of the maxillary glands which had always been soon relieved  the surgeon whose care he was under for the present disease considered the case as scrophulous and treated it accordingly without any sort of benefit as the ulcer continued to spread and was rendered exceedingly painful by the growth of the patients beard  i directed one grain of opium to be administered night and morning and likewise recommended the use of an opiate poultice cold as in the former case this method was persevered in till the twentieth but without any alteration although the dose of opium was increased to four grains night and morning  on the   th there seemed to be an appearance on the ulcer for the better  i increased the dose of opium to five grains night and morning  from the   th of march to the  d of april the patient complained less of pain and from the  th to the   th of april the fungus was gradually decreasing  on the   d the discharge was changed for the better and the fungus was nearly gone  and on the   th there was not the least appearance of fungus remaining and the parts were perfectly easy and relaxed  about a fortnight afterward the ulceration was quite healed and i laid aside the poultice but i did not begin to lessen the doses of opium till the   d of may after which time i went on gradually diminishing them till the patient omitted them altogether and on the   th of june i discharged him from the hospital perfectly recovered and eighteen months afterward i had an opportunity of enquiring after him and had the pleasure to find he had continued well
