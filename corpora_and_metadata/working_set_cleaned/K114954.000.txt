the general history of printing from its first invention in the city of mentz to its first progress and propagation through the most celebrated cities in europe particularly its introduction rise and progress here in england the character of the most celebrated printers from the first inventors of the art to the years    0 and    0 with an account of their works and of the most considerable improvements which they made to it during that interval  by s palmer printer  london printed by the author and sold by his widow at his late printing house in bartholomewclose also by j roberts in warwick lane and by most booksellers in town and country m dcc xxxii  preface as it is very natural and commendable for every man to be ever inquiring after any discovery or improvement that may be useful to his profession and to communicate it to the public i am willing to hope that the care and pains the time and expense i have bestowed on the following history will be approved by every one who considers the nature use and extent of it and the rather because nothing has been yet published at least in english on the subject of printing so methodical and comprehensive either in the historical or practical part of it as to the history i could not without some regret observe that we had nothing in our own language but some few fragments dispersed in several authors who only spoke of it occasionally whilst so many italians germans and french had wrote so copiously upon it and ex professo though even these seem rather to have had a view to the introduction and progress of the art in their respective countries than to the displaying of its excellency and improvements neither did i find that any of them had given so particular a history of the invention and inventors or so general a one of its progress and promulgation through europe and beyond it as i could have wished or as i thought might be compiled  however neither these considerations nor the discoveries i had made from some ancient and valuable editions i met with in some of our noble libraries nor even the examples of several men of my profession abroad who have writ largely on both the subjects could have prevailed upon me to have undertaken this historical part which i knew deserved a much better pen the practical being more within my province my ambition reached no higher than to have published such a complete system of it from the helps i had received from mr fertel and mr jn andr endters two eminent printers the first at st omers and the other at nuremberg who have published two curious treatises of it and from my own observations and improvements on them as few of my profession would have failed of being the better for in some branch or other of the art and i could with the utmost pleasure have communicated all the other discoveries which i had occasionally made to any person that would have been at the pains of writing this history but when i discovered my design i found to my surprise that the practical part would not meet with that encouragement and approbation i expected particularly from those for whose benefit and improvement i had chiefly designed it though the public could not but have been the better for it by having much better and neater impressions than are generally done  upon this account my friends and patrous persuaded me to alter my design and to suspend the practical part till the historical which they pressed me also to undertake had in some measure made way for it pursuant therefore to this new plan i resolved to spare neither cost nor pains to get a sight or at least a certain intelligence of all the old editions that were valuable either for their antiquity elegancy or for any light they could give me into this history and to add my own observations upon them not only as an historian but more especially as a printer the reader will find by the sequel that none but one of that profession and one that is well versed in those old ancient works can form a right judgment of them and this is the reason that so many of them have been mistaken for manuscripts or have been supposed to have been printed upon wooden blocks even by persons otherwise very learned and judicious whereas it is even demonstrable that they were done by separate metal types  my next care was to read over all that has been writ hitherto upon the subject especially by the judicious malinkrot by de la caille chevilier endters p pater orlandi and by the learned mr maittaire from all whom the reader will find i have received no small helps and which i do here gladly acknowledge and if i have at any time ventured to dissent from them i hope he will find my opinion backed with sufficient authority but where that could not be obtained i have contented myself with leading the reader to the most probable side and it is with no small pleasure that i have found one or two of my conjectures since confirmed by the discovery of some latent pieces which were not known to them they had indeed access to the most celebrated libraries of their own countries but this history will convince them that all that is valuable and curious is not confined to them and that we have many as nobly and richly furnished in our own as any in theirs  and here i should be extremely ungrateful if i did not take this opportunity of acknowledging the great helps and curious informations i have been favored with by several of the patrons and encouragers of this work as well as my great obligations to the right honorable the earls of pembroke and oxford to whom i am proud to own myself beholden but more especially to the former for all the discoveries which this history has above any other extant my free access to those two libraries as well as to those of my very good friends dr mead dr rawlinson mr richardson and others besides some of our public ones such as those of oxford cambridge and of the middle temple have afforded me the satisfaction of seeing many of those scarce editions which have been mentioned by most annalists if we except mr maittaire either from catalogues or hearsay and here i gladly take this opportunity of returning my thanks to these learned correspondents who have favored me with any ourious intelligence from those libraries which my business and the bad state of health would not permit me to visit  the order of this history is as follows  the first book contains an account of the discovery and inventors of the art whether really such or only pretended with remarks on their first trials upon blocks and their first editions  the second book treats of the promulgation of printing into all the several cities and places in europe and the improvements made to it by the most eminent printers down to an    0  the third gives an account of its first introduction into england its rise and progress in several cities towns and monasteries with the characters and works of the most famous english printers to an    0 a fuller account of all which may be seen in the following table of contents  this performance i entirely submit to the approbation or censure of the curious and candid as it shall deserve and i shall gain the main end i proposed if what i have done shall contribute to some more full and elaborate productions of this nature  thus far mr palmers preface to the historical part as to what relates to the practical we need not trouble the reader with it here what the author designed to treat of in it may be seen by the table of contents prefixed to the first number of this work in this table he will likewise find several particulars which were promised to be added to this history but which we have been obliged to omit either for want of materials or because they were not thought so necessary to this work by the promoters of it of the first sort was the history of printing in scotland and ireland concerning the former of which we can add nothing to the short account which was printed at edinburgh by mr watson the kings printer there and as for ireland we are still more in the dark for want of memoirs mr palmer had likewise promised the prints of the rebuss of all the foreign eminent printers but as he had not got them cut before his death and has given an account of them at the end of their works it was thought that charge might as well be spared so that we have only added those which were used by the most considerable ones of our own nation his list of the most excellent printers from   00 to this time the several acts for regulating the press and for securing the property of copies being left very imperfect the charge of finishing them was likewise thought unnecessary for which reason they are also omitted  all that needs be added with regard to his practical part is that as it was intended to have been printed first the author has left it in such perfect order that if the public will be pleased to encourage it an edition may be easily printed from his manuscript

historical account of the authors discovery improvement and progress of the art of printing an art so highly beneficial to mankind by preserving and transmitting to posterity the treasures of ancient and modern learning that its original has been esteemed divine i shall begin with a previous enquiry into the causes and concurrent circumstances which excited the inventors of it to a discovery that might answer this end with more expedition and exactness than transcribing the only method known before  the world at this time began to recover from a state of ignorance under which it had labored many centuries learning revived and was patronized in almost every country of europe its votaries exerted a laudable zeal in searching the libraries for those valuable books which had lain buried in obscurity and were become extremely scarce great numbers being lost in the times of ignorance manuscripts were procured and multiplied but the price of them was such that none but men of fortune could purchase them   0 crowns for a livy and  0 crowns for three volumes of plutarchs lives de tribus voluminibus plutarchi in quibus parallela viginti quatuor continentur titulos sumpsit ut mones pretium minus lxxx aureis esse non potest etc papiens p     vet edit  was then a moderate price a few manuscripts were thought a portion worthy a noblemans daughter and one or two entitled the donor and his posterity to the perpetual prayers of a monastery nay kings themselves disdained not the office of procuring them for their learned friends as appears from a letter of antoninus bocatellus sirnamd panormus to alphonsus king of naples and sicily significasti mihi nuper ex florentia extare titi livii opera vaenalia libros pulcherrimos libro pretium esse cxx aureos quare majestatem tuam oro ut livium quem regem librorum appellare consuevimus emi nomine meo ac venire ad nos facias interim ego pecuniam procurabo quam pro libri pretio tradam sed illud a prudentia tua sciae desidero uter ego an pegnius melius fecerit is ut villam florentiae emeret livium vendidit quem sua manu pulcherrime scripserat ego ut livium emam fundum proscripsi haec ut familiariter a te peterem suasit humanitas and modestia tua vale and triumpha epistel lib    and an old manuscript hebrew bible was a present from the emperor frederick iii to reuchlin who was sent ambassador to him paulus jovius relates a pleasant story of one jason mainus a student of pavia whose extravagance having brought him to a goal was obliged to deposit a manuscript codex juris on parchment into the hands of an usurer in order to procure his enlargement petrarchs rhetoric master likewise by pledging two volumes of ciceros works saved himself from a prison  as this excessive price tempted some to purchase estates by the sale of their books and exchange learning for money so the learned at that time freely parted with their wealth to procure those invaluable remains of antiquity out of a generous design to communicate them to the world  the transcribers now had a favorable opportunity of enriching themselves which they might have enjoyed much longer had not they possessed with the most mercenary views done an incredible and in some cases irrecoverable damage to learning by mutilating and corrupting the best authors hence arise those frequent complaints against their negligence and ignorance which have cost the learned an infinite deal of labor to remedy to evince this the following instance will suffice  john andreas bishop of aleria one of the greatest critics of that age tells pope paul ii in his dedication prefixed to plinys natural history in nonum annum premi non potuit emendatio ne futura quidem exacta post nonagesimum  printed at rome in the house of the maximis by panaratz and sweynheim anno    0 that though he had spent nine whole years in correcting that author yet ninety more would not complete a correct edition this demonstrates what difficulties the republic of learning encountered with at it is revival namely the scarcity and excessive price of books and the sordidness of the transcribers from whose hands they came so maimed and incorrect that the great printer stephens truly said they were a plague to the purchaser these were motives sufficient to excite the inventors of this art to a discovery so beneficial to the world and of such honor and advantage to themselves who those excellent persons were and where it was made will come under our enquiry in its proper place and here the reader will find just cause of wonder that this art which has been styled the nurse and preserver of arts and sciences should if i may use the expression be so forgetful of itself as not to leave us the least sketch of its own history the inventors being more ambitious of deserving than of purchasing praise some light indeed we receive in this affair from a few inscriptions used by faust at the end of his first printed books to this purpose this present work with all its embellishments etc was done not with pen and ink etc but by a new invented art of casting letters printing etc by me john faust and my soninlaw peter schoeffer in the famous city of mentz upon the rhine anno  but recourse must be had to the writers of those times for the history of this invention many cities have contended for the glory of it and engaged the learned in defense of their claim but those on the side of harlem have managed the controversy with great warmth and charged faust the inventor with robbing his supposed master laurence john coster of many thousand weight of his materials on christmaseve when the whole family and city were in prayer at church with other such ridiculous stories invented merely to deprive this great man of the honor which he had so long incontestably enjoyed had this been published in his lifetime when he might have defended himself or presently after his death when his soninlaw or some of his friends might have done it for him he had undoubtedly been cleared but such an accusation was not hinted till     years after and then grounded only on suspicion as dr junius owns ut fert suspicio  who was the first that attempted to transfer this discovery from mentz to harlem however fausts name died not with him though some dutch writers made use of his art to asperse his memory and others of several nations rose immediately in his defense in particular the learned malincrot dean of munster in his treatise de ortu and progressu artis typographicae has not only refuted what was advanced on the other side but made such researches after the old monuments of the art and collected so great a variety of testimonies supported by undeniable facts as seem at once to determine the controversy boxhorn indeed attempted an answer but whoever reads it over cannot but be convinced that an overfondness for his countrys honor has made him deaf to the most evident demonstrations of his antagonist however as he and his followers have given up the point as to separate metal types in favor of john faust and lay claim only to the invention of printing on blocks of wood which they affirm to have been stolen from coster by faust whose next invention they would have to be only an improvement of the former i shall give the reader an idea of both and show the difference between those first essays of printing and that perfect one which succeeded and continues to this day  chap ii an account of the different manners of printing by blocks of wood and separate metal types it is agreed by most writers on this subject that about the year    0 several attempts were made by some persons with vast expense and labor which proved abortive but that the discovery of separate metal types was not brought to perfection till about the year    0 we find that their first essays were by carving or cutting letters with a sharppointed knife upon blocks of wood each block containing a page or one side of a leaf that instead of the common ink which is the sort they first used they invented a more glutinous one which succeeded better being less apt to spread that they pasted the two white sides of each leaf together to make them look like single leaves but of this i shall have occasion to speak more particularly in some of the following chapters in the mean time i shall endeavor to demonstrate that this invention has not that merit for ingenuity usefulness or novelty which the dutch writers boast of  with respect to the first the only requisites are a tolerable genius sharp tools and a good copy as to its usefulness the only advantage resulting from it is that whatever the book be the forms remain entire so that as many editions as the author pleases may be printed without the expense of a new composition but on the other hand if we consider that those forms are of no use to any other work and the time and expense in cutting them very great with the great space so many pages of wood must take up we shall perceive the necessity of inventing moveable metal types but farther this method of printing was far from being novel it is even demonstrable from authentic testimonies to have been practiced in china and japan above four centuries before it was known in europe it is not easy i grant to prove that we received it from them because of their vast distance and the little commerce between us before the year    0 yet there is no impossibility but that it might have been brought us by some merchant either by the way of muscovy or the red sea the persian gulf or arabia of which opinion i could mention many authors gonzala de mendosa in his history of the marvels of china written in spanish book iii chap    and martin martini in his atlas sinensis tell us that they could prove by good arguments that the invention of guns of the loadstone and printing was known to us by their means what adds to the probability of my conjecture is that the chinese to this day send with their goods printed papers in the manner of our shopkeepers handbills several of which i have seen and it is not impossible but the hint of printing on blocks of wood might have been taken this way  whoever has a just idea of the genius of the chinese and japonese will own their capacity to have invented the method of printing with separate types if their manner of writing had admitted it but as they are known to write not with letters as other nations but with characters each of which stands for a whole word and that the number of those characters amount at least to  0000 though some authors reckon above  0000 it would be impossible to have cases large enough to contain em besides the insuperable difficulty of distinguishing and retaining them in memory to return from this digression let us now take a short view of the other new and more expeditious method  if we duly consider it in all its branches it will evidently appear the result of no small study time and cost the cutting the counterpunches and punches and sinking them into the matrices the adjusting them to the mould that curious piece of mechanism for casting single letters the difficulty of the whole manual operation of letterfounding in the printing the disposition of the cases the curious contrivance of the several parts of the work between the compositors correctors and pressmen etc add to all this the fine invention of the printingpress so admirable for its mechanical fabric together with the curious apparatus necessary for a printing house for an explication of whose terms we must refer to the second volume of this work these are things which require a genius vastly superior to devise better hands to execute greater forecast to obviate and readiness to remedy all unexpected defects more time and patience to go through all its various parts more resolution to overcome all difficulties and lastly the expenses necessary to this invention vastly larger than those of the former and consequently we shall be far from thinking an interval of ten years too long but rather admire that such a prodigious design could be contrived and perfected in so short a time  what has been said on this head will sufficiently demonstrate the disparity between these two methods and convince the reader how much the former is inferior in every respect to the latter nay if we dare rely on the judgment of the learned we should scarce think it worthy the name of printing since it has nothing common with it except the ink and even a rowler covered with cloth would supply the place of a press to print their pages of wood  now whether it be faust or coster who practiced this method on wood first whether mentz harlem or any other city gave it first encouragement whether the aforenamd persons had the hint from china or happened on it accidentally though if we admit of the latter supposition faust and mentz have the better title this must be granted from what has been said that by printing we do not understand the method of printing on blocks of wood claimed by harlem but the present art of printing by separate metal types which is so justly admired for its expeditious and correct way of preserving and propagating knowledge and to which we owe the improvements made in most arts and sciences for near three centuries past  hence it appears how little reason the dutch writers have to value themselves upon an imaginary victory which were it granted in its fullest extent would be despicable in comparison of the other yet boxhorn in his theatrum hollandiae page     places his hero coster in a kind of triumphal chariot dragging his vanquished enemies the germans and french after him with a pompous inscription which i think worthy the curious readers notice quem flos urbium harlemum patritia familia edidit laurentio costero qui incredibili and prope inhumana ingenii felicitate moguntinis nequidquam negantibus and gallis frustra obstrepentibus artem typographicam primus invenit monumentum hoc l m p q typis posuimus   he exults as if every sentence in that book was demonstration and imposes an eternal silence on all those nations which have appeared in defense of mentz in a stanza of short verses after the manner of claudian which for its singularity is likewise here quoted serrarii libelli streperi tacete galli taceat sonourus author solus ovantem batavus emeditatus artem haec vox aetheriis insonet axibus haec vox per populos per mare transeat harlemus typicam prodidit artifex   however i persuade my self that two or three of the following chapters will convince us of the vanity of these triumphs unless this piece of divinity and poetry composed by scriverius shall alter our sentiments it contains four verses to be placed under costers statue and cited in the theatrum holland abovementioned p     vana quid archetypos and praela moguntia jactas harlemi archetypos praelaque nata scias extulit hic monstrante deo laurentius artem dissimulare virum hunc dissimulare deum est   i shall only inform the english reader that the author of them pronounces it as rank atheism to deny coster the glory of this invention as to deny god that of the creation i shall now leave harlem and the dutch writers and pass over to the city of mentz to examine the testimonies brought in favor of her after having returned boxhorn four lines from a learned italian poet who may be supposed a more impartial witness in this controversy abstulerat latio multos germania libros nunc multo plures reddidit ingenio et quod vix toto quisquam perscriber et anno munere germanica conficit una dies laur valla     chap iii testimonies of writers from the middle of the   th century in favor of john faust malincrot has collected the testimonies of writers on either side of the controversy from the promulgation of the art to the time in which he wrote viz ann    0 and ranged them in the beginning of his book in the following order  those who declared for mentz before the dispute was started by dr junius and quoted by him in that work    those who have written on the same side since junius     0  those who have written in favor of harlem    those who are neuters     by this list it is manifest where the advantage lies as to numbers but lest so many testimonies should be thought tedious it will not we hope be improper to select the most considerable especially from those authors who wrote soon after the discovery and were better acquainted with this matter than those who lived any time after it and may be justly supposed to have followed their predecessors but i would therefore avoid as much as possible clogging or interrupting the thread of this history i shall only extract the most material authorities out of them and in such a manner as shall be consistent with it by inserting the passages themselves in the notes that the reader may use his pleasure either in reading or omitting them  but before i proceed any farther it will be necessary to obviate an objection that will infallibly occur to the readers mind which is that in mentioning the first inventors of printing in the two preceding chapters i have not so much as named john guttenbergh whereas the greatest part of the authors whom we are about to quote place him in the first rank and mention only the other two as coadjutors to him in answer to this it will be sufficient for the present to say that the sequel of this history will show that guttenbergh had no other share in this invention than by furnishing the other two with necessary supplies to defray the great charges of it and that the authors of the mentz and cologn chronicle whom the rest seem to have followed in this as also the learned antiquary trithemius have certainly confounded guttenbergh with faust that is mistook the one for the other as will hereafter appear in its proper place  of all the authors to whom the world is indebted for a particular account of this discovery abbot trithemius justly claims the preeminence both upon the account of his living nearest the time of this discovery which he tells us happened in his younger years tempore infantiae meae apud moguntiam etc trith epist fam epist     as well as for his care to derive his intelligence from its origin we have two noble testimonies out of his chronicle the one from the first part entitled chronicon spanheimense where his quoque temporibus ars imprimendi and characterizandi libros de novo reperta est in civitate moguntina per quendam civem qui johannes guttenberg dicebatur qui cum omnem substantiam propter nimiam difficultatem inventionis novae in eam perficiendam exposuisset consilio and auxilio bonorum virorum johannis fust and aliorum adjutus rem inceptam perfecit primus autem hujus artis dilator fuit post ipsum inventorem petrus opilio de gernsheim qui multa volumina suo tempore impressit morabatur autem praefatus j guttenberg moguntiae in domo zumjunghen quae domus usque in praesentem diem illius novae artis nomine noscitur insignita chronic spanheim ad ann    0 speaking of the year    0 he says that about this time the art of printing and casting single types was found out anew in the city of mentz by one john guttenberg who having spent his whole estate in this difficult discovery by the assistance and advice of some honest men john faust and others brought his undertaking at length to perfection that the first improver of this art after the inventor was peter schoeffer in latin opilio de gernsheim who afterward printed a great many volumes that the said guttenberg lived at mentz in a house called then zumjunghen but afterward known by the name of the printing house but lest the reader should be startled at the word anew de novo it will be requisite to acquaint him that trithemius was in all probability of the same opinion with some other writers who from a passage of st cyprian misunderstood wherein the invention of printing by which is meant no more than that of stamping of letters and hieroglyphics upon medals coins etc is attributed to saturn took occasion to reckon it among the arts perditae and consequently esteemed this rather a revival of the art than a new discovery but he sufficiently retracts that error in the next passage we shall quote from him which was not wrote till many years after and that from a more diligent enquiry into the discovery and merit of this new and till then unheard of art for this will appear from his words as you will see immediately  this next passage which is fuller and for its singularity and decisiveness deserves to be set down at length is taken out of the second part of trithemiuss chronicle entitled chronicon hirsaugiense this book was unknown to the learned till the year    0 when the benedictins of the monastery of st gall in switzerland begged leave to publish it from the original manuscript which had lain hid all that time the abbot wrote this toward the close of his life after he had been informed of many particulars relating to this invention from the mouth of peter schoeffer in english shepherd sirnamd de gernsheim to whom faust for the many helps he had received from him namely in devising punches matrices and moulds for casting their metal types in which the main perfection of the art consisted gave his only daughter christina in marriage and from a servant took him into partnership with him as appears by the inscriptions to the first books published by them of which we have given a sketch already the passage is as follows his temporibus in civitate moguntina

city of mentz in germany upon the rhine and not in italy as some writers falsely affirmed the wonderful and till then unknown art of printing books by metal types characterizandi was invented and devised by john guttenberg citizen of mentz who having almost exhausted his whole estate in contriving of this new method and laboring under such insuperable difficulties in one respect or other that he began to despair of and to throw up the whole design was at length assisted with the advice and purse of john faust another citizen of mentz and happily brought it to perfection having therefore begun with cutting characters of the letters upon wooden planks in their right order and completed their forms they printed the vocabulary entitled catholicon but could make no farther use of those forms because there was no possibility of separating the letters which were engraven on the planks as we hinted before to this succeeded a more ingenious invention for they found out a way of stamping the shapes of every letter of the latin alphabet in what they call matrices from which they afterward cast their letters either in copper or tin hard enough to be printed upon which they first cut with their own hands it is certain this art met with no small difficulties from the beginning of its invention as i heard  0 years ago from the mouth of peter schoeffer de gernsheim citizen of mentz and soninlaw to the first inventor of the art for when they went about printing the bible before they had worked off the third quire it had cost them already above  000 florins but the aforementioned peter schoeffer then servant and afterward soninlaw to the first inventor john faust as we hinted before being a person of great ingenuity discovered an easier method of casting letters and perfected the art as we now have it these three kept this manner of printing very secret for some time until it was divulged by their servants without whose help it was impossible to manage the business who carried it first to strasburg and by degrees all over europe  thus much will suffice concerning the discovery of this wonderful art the first inventors of which were citizens of mentz  these three first discoverers of printing viz john guttenberg john faust and peter schoeffer his soninlaw lived at mentz in a house then called zumjunghen but ever since known by the name of the printing house  from this authentic testimony i shall beg leave to make the following observations viz   that when the author concluded his chronicle ann      two years before his death and above    years after the discovery this invention was indisputably ascribed to mentz he says indeed that some writers had attributed it to italy but without any foundation and therefore he rejects this notion as absolutely false yet junius as has been already hinted first started a dispute in favor of harlem almost   0 years after the art became known and after him dr mentel began another in favor of strasburgh ann    0 both which shall be answered in their places  the next observation is that though the passage quoted out of his first chronicle seems to be taken if not copied out of that of mentz which is likewise a very ancient and authentic monument yet our author seems not to have been satisfied with it till he had it confirmed by surer hands other authors indeed have written concerning the origin of this art according to the best memoirs they could procure whether true or false but our author alone has been at the pains to fetch his information from the fountain head and delivered the particulars of it as he received em from the principal agent in the invention in the quotation from his second chronicle so that his testimony were it the only one we could produce for mentz ought still to be esteemed unquestionable and decisive  another particular worth our observation is that though he mentions two books as printed immediately upon the discovery viz the catholicon and the bible yet he sufficiently shows the difference between the methods of their impression the former being done upon wooden planks cut with a knife after the chinese manner as our wooden cutts are done now whereas the bible was printed with separate types which as we showed in the preceding chapter is the only way that merits the name of printing this seems plainly intimated by the words in the citation beforementioned when they came to print the bible and by the vast expense they had been at before they finished the third quire of it from which it is evident that this sacred book was the first work of consequence which the authors of this art made choice of to signalize the first fruits of their invention  the last thing i would observe is that though trithemius gives the precedence of this discovery to john guttenbergh in the beginning of this passage yet within a few lines after he twice gives the title of the first inventor of printing to john faust which contradiction cannot be well reconciled otherwise than by supposing that he through inadvertency wrote the name of john guttenberg instead of john faust and this is far from being improbable since their christian names are the same and though he again puts guttenbergh first when he speaks of the house in which they lived yet this might be done only out of respect to him either as being a knight according to the writers of that time or because he was the most opulent of the three and had contributed most to the charges of the invention  this must be allowed unless we could suppose that the editor having compared the two passages together namely that out of the first and this out of the second chronicle had corrected as he imagined the latter by the former upon a suspicion that the author writing the last almost  0 years after he had received the account from schoeffer might have mistaken one name for the other but to be certain of this it would be necessary to consult the original however what confirms me in my conjecture is that the author or his editor have committed a mistake and that guttenberg had no other interest in the discovery than by assisting them with money to promote the design is the lawsuit which he commenced against faust at mentz about the money expended and the judgment of the court thereupon of which the learned salmuth has given the following account in his appendix to pancirols commentaries eodem tempore moguntiae commorebatur johannes guttenbergius honestis parentibus natus qui proxime fausti aedibus habitabat hic cum animadvertisset insignem hancartem typographicam non solum omnium ore passim celebrari sed etiam admodum lucrosam esse familiaritatem cum fausto contraxit and quia opulentus erat pecuniam ei ad sumptus necessarios obtulit quod fausto minime ingratum fuit quandoquidem comperiebat sumptus quos in artem faciebat quotidie crescere and tunc opus chartae pergamenae imprimendum sub manibus habebat quapropter cum guttenbergio convenit and pactus est ut quicquid in illud opus impenderetur communi utriusque lucro vel damno cederet quoniam vero faustus plus insumpserat quam guttenbergius necessitatem postulasse arbitrabatur hic dimidiam suam partem exsolvere detrectavit qua exre cum lis orta esset alter alterum moguntinae in jus vocavit ubi partibus auditis pronunciatum fuit si johannes faustus interposito juramento affirmare posset omnem pecuniam quam mutuam sumpsisset in commune opus erogatam non autem in proprios usus conversam fuisse guttenbergium ad solvendum obligatum esse cui sententiae faustus paruit sicut ex archetypo instrumenti quod etiamnum superest anno      sexto novembris a johanne ulrico helmosperger notario de ea re confectum fuit liquido demonstrari potest unde evidenter apparet guttenbergium nequaquam artis typographicae inventorem and primum authorem esse sed aliquot annis postquam ea inventa fuisset a johanne fausto in consortium adscitum pecuniam ei suppeditasse  cum igitur guttenbergius ad sumptus resundendos damnatus fuisset and ex eo simultates inter illum and faustum magis exarsissent ille autem interea artem vidisset and didicisset siquidem inter tot operas quae ad illam excudendam requiruntur fieri non potuit ut ea diutius occultaretur quod etiam deus proculdubio noluit moguntia argentinam se contulit quo aliquot ex operis secum attraxit post illud dissidium alii quoque qui apud faustum artem illam didicerant eum deseruerunt and francesurtum atque in alia loca se receperunt cum praesertim anno      moguntia capta and pristina sua liberate privata fuisset quo factum est ut haec praeclara ars omnibus innotesceret and publici juris fieret appndic ad commentar paneirol ad titul    qui est de typographia  and this may be esteemed another pregnant testimony for faust since it is extracted from an original record of the lawsuit the narrative as related by our author is as follows  about this time there lived at mentz one john guttenbergh born of honest parents who dwelt next door to john faust he observing this famous art of printing was not only cried up every where but also very gainful contracted a friendship with faust and being exceeding rich offered to supply him with money to defray the charges of it which was gladly accepted by faust who began to find the expense grow too fast upon him and wanted vellum to print a work then in hand upon this he agrees and covenants with guttenbergh that whatever sums were laid out in the work should turn to their common profit or loss but because faust had disposed of more money then guttenbergh imagined the business would require he refused to pay his moiety upon which a dissension arose between them and they summoned each other before the judges at mentz the parties being heard it was decreed that if faust would make oath that all the money which he had borrowed had been expended in carrying on the common business and that he had converted no part thereof to his own private uses guttenbergh should be obliged to pay him faust submitted to this decree as may evidently be proved from an original instrument still extant which was drawn nov   ann      by uldric helmosperger a notary public pursuant to the said sentence hence it manifestly follows that guttenbergh was in no wise the inventor or first author of printing but that he had been admitted by faust into partnership with him some few years after the discovery of the art and had lent him money to prosecute the design  guttenbergh being cast and obliged to pay cost and charges and new quarrels arising daily between faust and him and he having seen and learned the business as it was impossible that among so many hands requisite to the carrying on of the art it should continue longer a secret which probably god would not suffer it to be he guttenbergh went off to strasburg taking some of the workmen along with him after this breach others having learned the art from faust left him and settled some at frankfort and others elsewhere especially when the city of mentz was taken the city of mentz formerly a very wealthy city of the empire was taken through a strategem by the archbishop adolph in the night preceding st s simon and jude in the year      and plundered and deprived of its freedom ann      and deprived of all its former liberties whereby this excellent art became more public and universally known thus far salmuth whose account is confirmed by the author of the encomium chalcographiae vid malinkrot p     j arnold bergellanus who wrote an elegy upon the dissension between those two persons in which he seems to favor guttenbergh more than faust and to have followed wimpheling who out of love to his fellowcitizen for he represents guttenbergh as born at strasburgh and not to have removed to mentz till he had almost perfected the art makes him the chief person in this discovery yet mentions both the lawsuit and the decree as well as the deed before mentioned but differs from salmuth in affirming that the lawsuit was not yet ended when he wrote his book which might arise from guttenberghs hanging it upon the hooks and escaping to strasburgh as salmuth observes or to harlem as others believe however this is evident and agreed on by all hands that there was an end at once to all their partnership into which he was only admitted for the sake of his purse which was absolutely necessary to faust  from all these testimonies which are not only quoted but strongly assented to by the judicious malincrot vid malinkrot c   i shall make one or two remarks in favor of mentz and faust which are   that among all the learned i have conversed with whose curiosity has lead them to search into the rise and progress of printing and all the writers upon this subject i could ever meet with not one has pretended to have seen any book printed in john guttenberghs name even in the oldest monuments remaining of the infancy of this art whether printed upon wood or by separate metal types   that on the contrary where there is any mention made of either printer or place it is still in fausts and schoeffers name  therefore until there is some better proof of guttenberghs name either jointly with the other two or separately or some book produced with it it seems evident beyond contradiction that the glory of this invention is wholly due to john faust and the improving and perfecting it to his soninlaw peter schoeffer exclusive of john guttenbergh this i hope will suffice to justify my conjecture that either trithemius mistook the names or the editor of his second chronicle changed them to make it agree with his first and to sasfy the reader that i had good reasons and authority to forbear mentioning guttenbergh among the first inventors i shall only add with respect to the learned salmuth that he prefaces this account with a succinct relation of the improvements which the ingenious peter schoeffer made to the art as the invention of punches matrices etc as likewise of the difficulties which they met afresh by reason of the softness of the metal in which they had cast their first types and of his finding out a new mixture which fully answered the design lastly that faust was so pleased with his servants ingenuity that he made him his soninlaw this passage which i have here subjoined caeterum in exercenda hac nova art operis quibusdam usus est

trithemiuss second chronicle that one might easily be induced to think he had copied it from him were it not that this letter was neither printed or indeed known till almost a whole century after salmuth wrote as appears by camerariuss letter prefixed to his book and dated from nuremberg ann       the learned wimpheling claims the next rank as being contemporary with trithemius and a no less diligent searcher after the memorable things of his own country he wrote his book ann   0  or   0  wherein is the following account viz that in the year    0 when ferdinand was emperor of the romans that great and almost divine gift the discovery of a new way of writing was bestowed upon mankind by john guttenbergh who having first invented the art of printing went afterward to mentz where he perfected it  the rest of the passage which relates chiefly to the promulgation of the art and the printers who enriched and signalized themselves by it we shall refer to the second book to which it properly belongs  i have already remarked something of wimphelings partiality to his own city strasburg and indeed it is what the reader may observe in all authors whose country laid the least claim to this invention faust for having carried on the business with all possible secresy and scarce being known out of his own city till the dispersion of his workmen they wherever they settled challenged to themselves the honor of this discovery or at least of being coadjutors to the inventor as we shall show in its proper place however the reader will see with pleasure how our author retracts his too great liberality to his fellowcitizen in another work viz his catalogue of the bishops of strasburg wherein he expresses himself thus under that bishop robert of bavaria was the noble art of printing found out by a certain strasburgher though in an imperfect manner but upon his going to mentz unto other practitioners of that art by the directions of one john gensfleich an old gentleman blind with age the art was perfected in the house called guttenbergh in english goodhill where the college of lawyers now stands to the eternal honor of the german nation  there is no need to observe to the reader the difference between this passage and the former nor to inquire whether it was out of remorse or upon better information that the author gave this latter account but it will be proper to remark that gensfleich is another name given by several writers to faust or perhaps a nickname which he was known by it signifying gooseflesh so that our author has attributed to him at least the glory of having practiced the art at mentz before guttenbergh came and to have directed him in perfecting what he had in vain attempted at strasburg the reader may likewise observe that guttenbergh seems to have been thus denominated from the house so called in which faust and he carried on the business till their mutual discords parted them  john nauclerus author of the universal history which is divided into generations histor univer gen    tells us that this art of printing with metal types was discovered at mentz under the emperor ferdinand iii ann    0 and extols the genius of germany as for other glorious inventions such as guns etc so more particularly for this of printing which he makes a large encomium upon he lived near the times of this invention viz ann    0 and though he mentions not the authors of it yet since he says it was discovered at mentz ann    0 it is plain he could mean none but faust seeing no books were printed there for many years after but by him and his soninlaw  neither have the poets of those times been wanting in celebrating this invention from which alone they and their works could expect that immortality which they confer upon the great and good we have quoted some of them in the preceding chapter as laurentius valla an italian and sebastian brand a german though this last being a native of strasburgh and afterward mayor of that city we will not pretend to determine whether what he sings of the rhenish nation and the german genius be meant of mentz or his own city however it is evident that he never dreamt of holland or harlem but let us now hear conrad celt the first german poetlaureat who speaking of the river rhine has the following tetrastich upon the city of mentz amor lib   eleg      jamque mogunciacam vastus te flectis in urbem quae prima impressas tradidit aere notas qualem ego te memorem talem qui invenerit artem italicis graiis plus memorande viris in another elegy he expresses his desire of visiting that famous city which had taught the germans this excellent method of writing without ibid eleg   pen etc i hope to be excused the pains of a larger collection of this nature the reader may find plenty of such poetical encomiums upon this art in malinkrots history chap   and elsewhere but i cannot omit inserting a short passage out of the famous swedish poet nicodemus frischlin who in his julius redivivus a comedy in praise of germany and the art of printing has these lines  primus inventor typographiae moguntiae vixit fatale nomen adeptus fausti  soon after which he gives an elegant description of the wonderful change produced by this art which rendered the germans before a rude and illiterate people able to teach the most polite nations of europe by its admirable quickness in multiplying of books which is elegantly expressed by campanus bishop of aleria in this verse  imprimit illa die quantum non scribitur anno to return to the historians of later date peter apian who for his incomparable skill in mathematics had the honor to be tutor to the emperor charles v assures us cosmograph lib   that mentz a frontier town between high and low germany was the place where printing was discovered

carried to cologn then to strasburgh basil and at last to venice its first author and inventor was john guttenbergh otherwise called zumjungen who had two other citizens for assistants viz john faust and john medimbach who kept this art very secret having sworn their servants not to divulge it mutius who wrote his german chronicle ann      attributes the invention of guns and soon after that of printing to mentz but the most illustrious testimony in favor of faust is that of the great collector of german antiquities john aventine to this purpose hoc anno    0 magnum ac vere divinum

writing undoubtedly revealed to him from heaven commonly called chalcography or printing which he invented and perfected within the space of two years this gentleman like an indulgent father studied how to preserve learning and excellent books to posterity which must otherwise have perished through the carelessness and indolence of these times had not this art by which one man can print as many pages in a day as several hands can write in a year quoted before given new vigor to mens genius made learning flourish rendered books so cheap as to be a purchase for students of the lowest fortunes and excited men to the study of arts and sciences by the plenty of learned works which it has afforded us this divine invention was kept private by john faust and peter schoeffer de gernsheim to whom he had given his only daughter christina in marriage and all their workmen were bound by an oath not to disclose it ten years after this john guttenbergh of strasburgh one of fausts servants divulged it in germany ulric han a fellowcitizen of his and xyxtus resius brought it to rome and italy where within my memory aldus manutius a person designed for the restoration of learning signalized himself etc the remainder of this passage chiefly relates to the dispersion and promulgation of the art and therefore is unnecessary to be set down here there is but one thing in this quotation that can puzzle the reader which is that the author makes guttenbergh to have been one of fausts servants instead of his partner and usurer as has been showed already in the rest he exactly agrees with the writers quoted before with respect to the disagreement among authors concerning the names of the first inventors if we remember that guttenbergh to evade the sentence pronounced against him at mentz departed with some of fausts workmen to strasburgh it will not appear improbable that some who wrote at a distance might confound him with those servants especially considering that his name was never in any book printed at mentz however it is plain that a place of one writer mistaken by another has been the occasion of leading many more who have followed him implicitly into the same error an instance of this which will be no digression from our history is as follows  the authors who have followed peter ramus from sabellicus zuringer etc down to paul pater author of the treatise de germaniae miraculo the art of printing published ann   0  have ascribed this invention to j regiomontanus and thought they did the art no small honor in making so great a mathematician its author what seemed to confirm their opinion was that faust guttenbergh and he were contemporaries and it is probable lived near each other though he afterward removed to nurembergh what made this still more probable was that regiomontanus perfectly understood mechanics so that as it is said he made an iron flyspring from under his hand fly round the room with a humming noise and return back under his hand he is likewise reported to have made a wooden eagle which flew from nurembergh to meet the emperor hovered over his head in a tonick motion and went back the same way with him it would be dangerous now to assert the truth of these stories since such flights of ingenuity have been so long discouraged to make way for more useful inventions yet jul scaliger was so far from doubting of them that he pretends to have found out the art and bragged that he could perform the like with a wet finger however this was sufficient to persuade our authors that regiomontanus reputed so universal an artist was most probably the person who invented the method of printing and communicated it to faust and guttenbergh in consequence of which they have placed him at the head of the other two nevertheless this notion seems to take its rise from a passage in purbachs tables wherein it is said that the discovery of printing is to be referred to the times of regiomontanus as malinkrot has fully proved this story i hope will both convince the reader of the danger of following an author too implicitly and justify my differin from the generality of those who attribute the discovery to john guttenbergh whose opinion i apprehend to be sufficiently confuted setting aside this mistake of p ramus with respect to regiomontanus he agrees with the rest of our other testimonies in favor of faust and i conceive it to be not in the least improbable that the inventors might in such a variety of tools implements and other things necessary to the perfecting this art have recourse to him or some other ingenious person for advice and assistance  however it is certain that regiomontanus was a very early printer though not taken notice of as such by any writer i have met with i did indeed believe him to have been an assistant in perfecting of the art but never could meet with any sufficient authority to fix the honor upon him till i was admitted into the library of the right hon the earl of pembroke whom i beg leave to take this first opportunity of mentioning with honor and gratitude not only for his great condescension in allowing me a free access to his noble collections of ancient editions but likewise for several very curious hints upon this subject which shall be mentioned in their proper places here it was that his lordship was pleased to show me the following great curiosity viz manilius in  to with these words at the end  ex ossicina johannis de regiomente in nuremberg the antiquity of this curious edition shows it self at first sight though there be no date to it a circumstance much to be lamented though too common to many of those ancient monuments in the infancy of the art i must therefore be obliged to rank it with the rest of these dateless works of which i shall have occasion to speak in the sequel of this history it is evident this is an older edition than that mentioned by fabricius of      which it is reasonable to suppose not only by his being contemporary with but assistant to faust in perfecting this art however as regiomontanus was a man of such profound skill in astronomy mechanics and several other branches of learning i am willing to hope time will bring forth some further testimonies concerning him  but what convinces me that he had no share in the first discovery of the art is that in his long dedication prefixed to his astronomical tables the first piece he ever published which i have seen and which is dedicated to the primate of hungary he does not make the least mention of his having been concerned in such a noble discovery which it is reasonable to suppose he would have done could he have claimed such a singular piece of merit to have recommended him to so great a patron especially when he expatiates so much upon the difficulties that attended the work he dedicates to him but to return  i apprehend a probable objection against the testimonies before quoted which are scarce a fourth part of those collected by malinkrot that they are taken from germans who may be reasonably supposed too partial to their country and consequently less to be relied on than foreign writers whose authority would be of far greater weight in this case this i shall obviate by showing that learned authors of other nations are consistent with the germans in this particular i have already cited two poets the one an italian the other a swede the former of whom ascribes this discovery to germany and the latter to john faust of mentz my next design is to produce some of those who are eminent for their enquiries into the antiquities of their own and other countries at the head of these stands polydore vergil an italian who in his book de rerum inventoribus after an elegant encomium upon the art and a description of its important benefits to mankind proceeds thus wherefore that the author of such a discovery may not be deprived of his due praise and that posterity may know to whom we are indebted   quare tantae rei author non est sua laud fraudandus praesertim ut posteritas sciat cui divinum acceptum beneficium refer debeat itaque johannes guttenbergius natione teutonicus equestri vir dignitate

practice it there as we have been informed by the citizens themselves he is reported likewise to have made another discovery viz of a new kind of ink used now by all printers sixteen years after this ann      one conrad a german brought it first to rome etc  our author makes no mention of any but guttenbergh yet as he says the art was first practiced at mentz it is plain from what has been said before that he deserved not the first name in this invention the citizens who gave this account were certainly those that dispersed themselves from faust who though they learned the art of him yet might esteem guttenbergh the first author because he was most considerable and not unlikely lorded it over the rest who he knew could not carry on the business without his purse whilst faust whose chief care was to conceal the art till he had reimbursd himself so far as to be able to carry it on without his help might let him enjoy the honor of the discovery in the mean time what confirms my conjecture is that if conrad arrived at rome in the year      he must have left mentz before faust and schoeffer had printed any books with their names however in this case faust would not be the only man whose indigence and honesty have been inducements to part with the credit of a beneficial discovery to a person of less merit rather than to let it die with him for want of means to carry it on  the following author jacobus philippus bergomensis  jacob philip bergomens lib    supplem chronic ad ann      ars imprimendi libros his temporibus in germania primum enata est quam alii repertam esse asseverant a cuthimbergio argentino alii a quodum alio nomine fausto alii a nicolao genson praedicant pro qua innumerabiles authors ipsi congregarunt divitias etc who is doubtful concerning the genuine inventor may easily be set right from what has been already said he tells us that the art of printing was first brought to light in germany about the year      that the discovery was by some attributed to guttenbergh of strasburgh by others to one faust and by a third sort to nicholas genson or jenson that the authors of it got immense riches etc with relation to this jenson it will appear by the sequel of this history that he was only one of those who first carried the art into italy where he distinguished himself by his fine impressions etc but never made the least pretenses to the invention there is no necessity of repeating what has so often been said concerning guttenbergh whom palmerius of pisa asserts to have been the author of this discovery about the year    0 his words are as follow  quantum literarum studiosi germanis de beant nullo satis dicendi genere exprimi potest namque a johanne guttenberg zumjunghen equite moguntiae rheni solerti ingenio librorum imprimendorum ratio anno    0 inventa hoc tempore in omnes fere orbis parts propagatur qua omnis antiquitas parvo aere comparata posterioribus infinitis voluminibus legitur chronic ad ann      what obligations the learned world has to the german nation cannot be sufficiently expressed for the art of printing which had been invented by john guttenbergh zumjungen a knight of mentz upon the rhine about the year    0 is at this time viz ann      divulged almost throughout the world by which the works of the ancients may be purchased at a small price and be read in an infinite number of volumes since printed there are a prodigious many more authors who though they do not mention either the names of the inventors or the place of the discovery yet unanimously give the honor of it to germany and even paulus jovius who ascribes the invention of wooden planks to the chinese from whom it was brought into europe by the way of scythia and muscovy when he speaks of the other method of printing says it is no wonder that several arts and sciences owe their birth to the germans since the noble discovery of metal types as well as that of brass cannons was found out by them lib    histor   my next testimony is that of the celebrated politician john ruterus who not only in his historical relations attributes the invention of guns and printing to the german nation but confirms it more fully in his book de fortuna illustrium virorum etc where he says that he will not contend about the author of printing but gratefully acknowledge the singular gift of god in it seeing one man can print as much in one day as the best hand can write in a whole year for there is scarce continues he a press especially in the german printing   ruteruss his words as i find them translated by gaspard eusius in malinkrot p    are these de authore artis impressoriae hie non digladiabor summum id dei beneficium grato animo nos sedulo decet agnoscere ab uno enim homine uno die tantum literarum imprimitur quantum vix toto anno scribi posset singulis enim diebus in quolibet prelo in germanorum typographiis ter mill sexcentae chartae nonnunquam etiam quater mill interdum ultra etc houses which does not print off   00 sheets per diem nay some  000 and others exceed even that number  i shall conclude this chapter with a passage out of the great monsieur thevet cosmographer to the king of france not only because his authority will easily outbalance that of all the dutch writers but likewise because there are some particulars in it which will be acceptable to the reader as it is something prolix i shall only extract the most remarkable part as follows thevets lives and pictures of illustrious persons chapter    this art of printing is believed to have been first invented at mentz in germany about the year      by john guttenbergh a german knight who began his first essays of it there and found out a new sort of ink now used by the printers but there are some writers of opinion that this honor rather belonged to john faust and ives in latin ivo schoeffer two years before that time and affirm that guttenbergh john mentel and others whose names our author quotes out of pantaleon all germans improved afterward the art and divulged it in several parts of germany and at length carried it to foreign nations others write that this art came originally from china and cathai but this assertion is without any foundation seeing the east indies were not discovered by the portugese till about    years ago whereas printing has been invented and practiced ever since      paul the venetianindeed gave the first description of that country about  00 years ago but made not the least mention of printing being used there a confirmation of my opinion is that the greeks mingrelians abyssines turks persians moors arabs and tartars write all their books by hand this method was ordained in turkey by an edict of bajazet ii who prohibited the use of printed books under pain of death ann      which edict was confirmed by selim i bajazets son ann      besides this whilst i was in egypt i saw several books so neatly written on the bark of palm trees that they might be taken for printed ones the merchants which bring their wares from india through the red sea make use of the same sort of written books some of which are now to be seen at the library of the queen dowager at st germans in the fields near paris others pretend that this art of printing has been carried as far as mexico which kingdom is directly opposite to cathai the one being in asia toward the south and the other in america toward the north pole however it must be owned that the americans write with characters representing several kinds of beasts fish fowl the different parts of human bodies and the like by which they express their mind as the egyptians did formerly  i have two of those books by me with an interpretation of their hieroglyphics the goddess minerva is said to have been the inventress of learning and war and the germans have imitated her in both these respects by the invention of bombs and printing which were certainly discovered by them one fault however that nation labors under which somewhat eclipses their glory which is that they know not how or at least neglect to improve those inventions that were so easily found out by them  the author proceeds in an encomium upon the art and those who raised it to greater perfection but that belongs to another chapter  i hope that the testimonies produced hitherto will be more than sufficient to fix the palm upon faust and the city of mentz and that the reader will follow me with pleasure to the next chapter where they will be confirmed by incontestable matters of fact  chap iv authentic facts in favor of faust and mentz if the testimonies alleged in the preceding chapter are insufficient to convince any person that this invention is due to faust what follows in this will i conceive put it quite out of doubt unless he be more incredulous in this case than a dutchman for the great erasmus has not only owned himself convinced of this truth by one single fact but even transmitted it to posterity i shall therefore begin with that noble testimony which is a privilege granted by the emperor maximilian to john schoeffer grandson of john faust not only for the sole printing the works of t livy at the end of which the privilege is annexed printed by the said john schoeffer at mentz ann      but likewise prohibiting all persons to reprint either the said book or any other which should be afterward printed by him in consideration of his being grandson to the first inventor of the art of printing concerning whom erasmus who first published that work speaks in his preface to it as follows if those who furnished origin and st jerome with writers and parchments have merited the highest commendation what praise is due to printers and booksellers who supply us with whole volumes for a small price if ptolemy philadelphus acquired such reputation for collecting so great a library what recompense can be made to those who furnish us daily with books in all languages but amongst all these to whom we are so much obliged we must gratefully remember the first inventor of this divine secret john faust grand father to john schoeffer thus far erasmus without the least mention of his countryman coster with respect to the emperors privilege it could not be suspected of any partiality to faust rather than to guttenbergh or to mentz rather than strasburg etc since they were equally under his dominion  the next fact to be related is that of the tools old types etc of the inventors preserved in mentz above   0 years at least after the sacking of that city ann      and viewed before that time by some eminent persons as curious relics of the art among others john arnold bengellanus hodie vetustissima quaedam in eum imprimendi sc usum ab authoribus comparata quae vidi instrumenta extant moguntiae bergellan in praesat encom su typograph assures us that he had seen them there and nic serrarius  adjiciantur primi denique artis hujus modioli quos antiqua hic moguntiae enim scribebat domus in cesariae horti platea custodit quosque mihi insuper albinus typographus monstrabat nichol serrarius de rebus moguntin l   c    says they were then kept at mentz in a house in the street called keysers garden and shown to him by one albinus a printer we need not bring a greater number of authors to attest this seeing it may likely be esteemed but a weak proof by some of our readers but if they will consider what noise junius and scriverius have made about some trifles compared to these preserved at harlem in memory of coster according to a tradition of two or three old gentlemen they will not wonder that i lay some stress upon this and choose sometimes to make use of their own weapons against them i shall therefore subjoin another fact which is the inscription set up at mentz by ives of witigen or venza doctor of laws and professor in that university in the inner court of the college of lawyers johanni guttenbergensi moguntino qui primus omnium literas re imprimendas invenit hac art de toto orb been merenti ivo witigensis hoc saxum pro monumento posuit anno   0  this inscription though it favors guttenbergh more than faust is more authentic than any of those three brought by junius for coster the last of which as malinkrot observes is either written or at least published by him the second is but a few years older and the first not placed over costers door till after junius had published his description of holland  a proof still stronger is the inscriptions found in the oldest books printed at mentz wherein that city is styled the mother and inventress of printing if harlem or any other city could have shown a juster title to this honor it is surprising that this place should have enjoyed it for above     years without the least contradiction and that no dutch writer did so much as attempt in all that long interval to confute those known and remarkable colophons or inscriptions which faust began to print at the end of his books when he could no longer conceal his discovery and in which he gives an account of the inventors and manner in which the books were done first negatively viz not with pen and ink or any other writing instruments and then affirmatively but by a new art of casting types and printing to which he adds the city of mentz as the place where they were printed and concludes with the date of the month and year when they were finished we shall only subjoin some of the oldest and most remarkable of them for the present  i begin with that which is at the end of the codex psalmorum printed an      and consequently the oldest book known to be printed with a date or inscription it is in the emperors library at vienna and peter lambec who was library keeper gives this account of it reperi interea unum impressum in membrana in cujus fine de origin artis typographicae hoc legitur testimonium praesens psalmorum codex venustate capitalium decoratus rubricationibusque sufficienter distinctus ac inventione artificiosa

printing viz this present book of psalms embellished with beautiful capitals and illuminated with all necessary rubricks was thus formed by an ingenious invention of printing by separate types without pen or wrinting and finished with great care for the service of god by john faust citizen of mentz and peter schoeffer de gernsheim in the year of our lord one thousand ccccl vii on the eve of the assumption i e aug     the next impression is the rationale divinorum officiorum of william durand printed at mentz an      in fol malinkrot has it and tells us that it had been formerly bequeathed to the monastery of galilea near zutphen a place afterward destroyed in the civil wars to be kept chained in the library and for which the donors were to be prayed for together with their whole generation the inscription at the end of it being exactly the same with that of the book of psalms needs not be repeated here it is likewise mentioned by hoffman in the second volume of his lexicon universale printed at basil ann      who says he saw it in the library of that university bearing date      he calls it officiale durandi p  0  and gives this inscription at the end praesens hoc etc as before  the next in date is the catholicon a latin vocabulary the same which is affirmed by trithemius to have been printed in wood some time before    0 and which was reprinted at mentz ann    0 i have seen two of these books one in the earl of pembrokes library and the other in the learned dr meads with this very remarkable colophon at the end altissimi praesidio cujus nutu infantium linguae

other nations and of his free gift to make conspicious by this glorious invention this work was done not by the help of quil pencil or any writing instrument but by the agreement symmetry and proportion of the printingpress then follows a doxology in four latin verses to this purpose  to thee father son and holy ghost three in one be honor and praise o catholic reader give thanks for this book in the church and never cease to praise the blessed virgin mary  thanks be to god  this book though it mentions not the printers yet is easily known to have been done by faust and schoeffer from the likeness of the types and because at that time there were no other printers at mentz or any where else  two years after this came out the great latin bible in solio which i also saw in dr meads library which according to trithemius and the cologn chronicle must be the second edition of it the first having been printed soon after the year    0 though without any colophon whereas this has the following praesens hoc opus finitum ac completum and ad eusebiam dei industry in civitate moguntina per johannem fust civem and petrum schoeffer de gernsheim clericum diocesis ejusdem est consummatum anno incarnationis dominicae      in vigilia assumptionis gloriosae virginis maria this present work was finished and completed designedly for the service of god in the city of mentz by john faust citizen of it and peter schoeffer de gernsheim clerk of the said diocese in the year of our lords incarnation      on the vigil of the assumption of the glorious virgin mary  it is unnecessary to remark that the word clerk clericus does not here signify a clergyman for it is plain that schoeffer was not so by his marrying fausts daughter and leaving a son to succeed him but it was usual then to give that title to men of moderate literature father le long in his bibliotheca sacra gives us the colophon of this bible something different from ours though of the same date the reader may see it at full length in the ingenious mr mattairs annals page  0 not    concerning this bible some writers give us the following account which is not a little in favor of faust that it was so like handwriting and the titles and capitals so finely painted on vellum that faust sold some of them at paris for a prodigious price but the buyers finding a greater number upon him than it was possible for several men to transcribe in their whole life and the pages of each copy so exactly alike that he was seized tried and condemned for magic and sorcery and was accordingly dragged to the stake to be burnt but upon discovering his art the parliament of paris made an act to discharge him from all prosecution in consideration of his admirable invention however it is not a miss to inform the reader that his black art for which he was so roughly treated was printing his bible on the black letter i shall in its proper place give my reasons for my opinion that the bible which faust sold for ms was the first printed by him in the mean time this process against him and his discharge from it by order of that parliament being matter of fact it was not foreign to our purpose to mention it here  the last book which we shall speak of is tullys offices printed ann      at the end of which are these words praesens marci tullii clarissimum opus johannes fust moguntinus civis non atramento plumali canna neque aerea sed art quadam perpulchra manu petri de gernsheim pueri mei feliciter effeci finitum an mcccclxv die iv februarii  john faust citizen of mentz happily perfected this famous work of marcus tullius not with pen and ink etc but by a new beautiful art by the assistance of my boy peter de gernsheim feb   ann      the edition at oxford is dated      though generally thought to be the same this inscription i saw in the book which that great lover of the antiquities of the art of printing and promoter of learning the right honorable the earl of oxford showed me the first time i had the honor to wait on his lordship and to whose kind reception and information i stand greatly indebted  the next inscriptions i shall mention are those in peter schoeffers name alone in which there is a constant and remarkable strain of gratitude and respect for the city of mentz from which besides other ample encouragements he had received his freedom as a reward for his improvements in the art as every one of them has an encomium upon that city i shall content my self with abridging some of the first and giving the last which has something singular in it at full length and conclude this head with a remarkable one used by his son john schoeffer at the end of some of his books  in the book called the decisions of the rota printed ann      and said to be still extant in the library of franckfort he styles the city of mentz the inventress and protectress of printing in some other books viz justinians institutions printed ann      and      etc he calls her the noble city which god has preferred to all others and signalized with such superior gifts etc the like is also to be seen at the end of harpianuss speculum december praeceptorum printed ann       the last is at the end of

happily finished by the art of printing by peter schoeffer de gernsheim in the city of mentz to the honor of which city the blessed st jerome writing to ageruntia concerning monogamy or marrying but once has given this lasting testimony that many thousands of its inhabitants are honored in the church for having suffered martyrdom in defense of the catholic faith  mentz now returns him jerome praise for praise by publishing so many of his writings for the service of the church in the year of our lord    0 the seventh day of september which is the eve of the nativity of the virgin mary give glory to god  this is an instance how ready schoeffer was to take all opportunities of expressing his love and gratitude to that city and rendering her praise as lasting as his own works  the last inscription which gives a succinct account of the discovery is at the end of trithemiuss breviary of history and is as follows impressum and completum est praesens chronicorum opus anno domini mdxv in

of st margaret virgin in the noble and famous city of mentz first inventress of this art of printing by john schoeffer grandson of the worthy john fust citizen of mentz the first author of this art who found it out at length by his own ingenuity and began to practice it anno    0 in the time of the thirteenth indiction frederic iii being then emperor and the most reverend father in god theodorick pincerna de erbach being princeelector and arch bishop of mentz anno      he perfected this art under god and began to put it in practice with the assistance of peter schoeffer de gernsheim first a servant and then his soninlaw who having made many necessary inventions in it had his daughter christina fust in marriage as a just recompense for his labor and useful discoveries these two abovenamed viz john fust and peter schoeffer kept this art secret having taken an oath of all their workmen and servants not to divulge it in any manner whatsoever but afterward it was divulged by those very workmen anno      and spread it self over several provinces of europe etc  the like inscription is at the end of the breviarum mindense printed anno      by the same person in both which the reader will be pleased to observe that there is not a word mentioned of john guttenbergh  upon the whole it is my opinion that were there no other evidence but these inscriptions they would be sufficient to determine this controversy seeing neither harlem strasburgh nor any other place can produce any thing equivalent had harlem for instance any such authentic impressions in favor of coster all other testimonies of the best writers for mentz would have been rejected as inconsiderable or if dr mentel could have produced any single book printed by his progenitor of older or even equal date with the oldest of these he would infallibly have triumphed over all his antagonists it is certain that there is no book known to be printed at harlem or any other place of equal date with the last which were done by faust though it has been proved that he continued printing near ten years before he put his name to his impressions whence it follows that he was not only the first printer with fusile metal types but likewise the first inventor of them according to the testimonies quoted in the preceding chapter  i doubt not but the reader is now willing to hear what methods the competitors with faust take in order to evade such a cloud of authentic testimonies and what arguments they can allege in defense of their claim in short what grounds they have of triumphing in such an extraordinary manner but i must here acquaint him that if he expects evidence answerable to those clamours he will be extremely disappointed in the two next chapters however since a controversy cannot be fairly decided unless both parties be heard in their turn i shall not desire the reader to believe me implicitly but propose their pretensions in as just a light and brief a manner as possible together with the answers of malinkrot and others to them to which i shall take the liberty to add my own thoughts and observations whether they chance to illustrate and confirm or to contradict the concurrent testimony of the early and the established notion of the modern writers upon the subject and leave it to him to judge of the merit of the cause  i hope what i said last will not be looked upon as either a piece of presumption or ostentation in me no man can be more ready than i am to own the great helps i have received from these great men especially from malinkrot chevalier mattaire orlandi and some others of less note or my own insufficiency for such a work as this without such an assistance but though they are all great and learned men in their way yet for want of a sufficient acquaintance with the business of printing it was impossible for them not to overlook some things of moment which a printer would easily discover at first sight viz whether a book be ms or printed whether printed from pages of wood or with separate types in both which respects many of them have been either puzzled or mistaken i shall add but one instance more not foreign to our purpose the famous mons naude directed his readers how to know the books printed by faust by the mark in the paper which he calls the heifers horns mr mattaire who has been as curious and diligent as any one tells us he could never observe that mark or any thing like it whereas the very first book the earl of pembroke showed me of fausts printing by holding a leaf against the light the mark appeared very plain i shall beg leave to add that the hints and helps i have had from the curious and learned and my access to several noble libraries have moreover enabled me to make many more curious observations on this subject than i could otherwise have done let this be said once for all  chap v the pretensions of harlem examined and confuted i have more than once hinted that this controversy in favor of harlem was not started till above     years after the discovery of the art when hadrian junius m d began the dispute during that long interval the invention was universally ascribed to the city of mentz though the names of the inventors were sometimes confounded and what ought to surprise us most of all is that not one dutch writer during that time ever offered to contradict the received opinion concerning faust and mentz though many of them were men of great learning and some either natives of harlem or had been educated in that university it is really wonderful that neither regard to truth or their countrys honor nor the common ambition of being the author of a new discovery should have inspired some of them to undeceive the world in this point if they had the least grounds of suspicion but whatever be the reason of this unpardonable supineness in them dr junius rather than fall under such a charge undertook a task as difficult as that egyptian one of making brick without straw for from a collection of old traditions wooden types and two or three books printed on wood without name date or any other mark by which it might be guessed when where and by whom they were done with some other transmuted relics of the first essays of the art he has formed a story which he thinks will baffle all the testimonies urged on the other side and turn the panegyricks bestowed by the learned on the noble inventor into the vilest calumnies as his story is very prolix and unnecessary to be set down at length the following abstract may suffice  though the glory of this art is entirely due to the city of harlem yet i am sensible how deep the contrary notion in favor of mentz is rooted in the minds of men  were i blessed with that eloquence which carneades is so famed for who never affirmed any thing but what he fully proved nor opposed any error but what he clearly confuted i might have just hopes to reduce this stolen glory to its owner and bring to light the truth which has so long lain hid in democrituss well  for if those ancients who contended for the invention of letters in behalf of their favorite heroes have merited such applause what hinders but that i influenced neither by partiality to one place nor envy toward another but with a sincere love to truth should appear in so just a cause which has been suffered to sink for want of advocates  and if plutarch esteems him the best evidence who is not biased by favor or affection i have a sufficient claim to it since none of costers posterity can reward me for my performance i shall therefore relate what has been told me by some grave and worthy old gentlemen who have filled the best offices in the city and heard it from others of equal weight and authority viz that about     years ago there lived at a noted house standing to this day over against the royal palace one laurence john sirnamd coster which word signifies a sexton or churchwarden or in the romish sense one who is entrusted with all the rich plate sumptuous robes etc belonging to the parish church a place hereditary in his family who was the person to whom the art of printing owes its original though he has been unjustly deprived of that honor  that walking by chance in an adjacent wood according to custom after a full meal or on holy days he cut some letters out of the bark of beechtrees which being inverted and joined together he began to print some words and then whole lines in hopes that this might turn to the advantage of his grandchildren that the success of this prompted him to greater discoveries he being a man of an extraordinary genius that he with thomas peter his soninlaw finding the common ink apt to spread invented a more glutinous sort and began to print whole pages of which kind i saw some essays in an anonymous work printed only on one side and entitled the mirour of our salvation written in low dutch the white sides of the paper being glewd together to hide the chasms that after this he changed his wooden letters into lead and then into tin which was still harder and more durable some of these old types being cast into drinkingcups are still to be seen at the aforesaid house out of which gerard thomas costers greatgrandson died a few years ago but as all new inventions meet with encouragement this art began to require a greater number of hands which proved the first cause of mischief to this family for one of his servants named john but whether faust or not i shall not now enquire being employed in this business after having taken an oath of secrecy had no sooner learned as he thought the method of casting and joining the fusile types etc but he took the next opportunity of robbing his master of all his printingtools together with his art to which end he chose the night before christmas as the most proper for his design when the whole family with the rest of the city were at church at midnightmass thence he escaped to amsterdam next to cologn and at last settled at mentz where the year following viz ann      he printed alexandri galli doctrinale a grammar much in vogue at that time with those very types that his master coster had used before this is the substance of what i had from those gentlemen of veracity who told me they had it handed down by tradition and this has been likewise confirmed to me by others of equal repute i remember to have heard my tutor nich gallius an old gentleman of a very tenacious memory say that when he was a boy he heard one cornelius a printer an old man who had been one of costers workmen mention the story of the first trials of printing with a great deal of vehemence and even with tears especially when he came to the thievish part of it protesting he could execute the rogue himself with the utmost pleasure if he had been alive then cursing those nights in which for near three months together he had lain with so vile a miscreant a story like this one quirinus talesius reports that he had heard from the same printer  this is what my sincere love of truth obliged me to publish whatever the consequence be  but i am fearful that prejudice in this case will outbalance reason and authority the passing of this invention into germany in a lawful way had been no harm nay i believe that it pleased god to make it the means of perfecting and divulging so useful an art etc    here is all that our author could collect in defense of his cause which he had made the best of after his way it were indeed to be wished the doctor had rather imitated the modesty of carneades than wished for his eloquence since that great philosopher however he seems to forget it never was known to affirm any thing convinced as he was of the weakness of human understanding and of the power of prejudice he always contented himself with confuting the opinions of others without ever showing that he held any of his own but such an excellent talent would have spoiled his design and condemned both his book and his old mens fables to obscurity and oblivion and saved some other authors the trouble of writing in the vindication of either but though he has been followed by about a dozen of his countrymen yet no additional testimonies are to be expected from any of them for even boxhorn who wrote with the greatest vehemence and spleen against malinkrot has been obliged to content himself with palliating the account of junius and endeavoring to show that it is not quite so improbable as his antagonist has represented it however it must be owned that except the two last named authors and one or two more viz berchius and scriverius the first of whom has been confuted by nicholas serrarius a jesuit in his book de rebus moguntinis lib   cap          and    and the later by the learned mons naude george draude and others i say except these all the rest write more moderately without invectives or ill language and some of them even with doubt whilst others modestly contend only for the invention of printing on woodenplanks leaving that of metal types to faust but even this is inconsistent with the story of junius who asserts coster to be the inventor of them both and faust the thief it would be superfluous to multiply quotations out of the writers on the side of harlem since they follow junius upon his bare testimony and a confutation of him will easily dispatch all the rest i shall therefore examine the probability of his account and see how far it outweighs the testimonies and authorities alleged on the other side in the execution of this the best method will be to follow the steps of the learned malinkrot who has sufficiently exposed the numerous absurdities which this story is attended with setting aside therefore the oddness of costers fancy in choosing to make his first letters of the bark of beech which will bend whilst green and break when dry whilst the wood itself would have been much more proper to bear the weight of the press and the improbability of his changing them into metal ones which is barely asserted by junius and contradicted by berkius boxhorn and other dutch writers as we hinted before nothing can be more ridiculous than the converting those types into drinking cups to perpetuate the memory of their discovery they had certainly been more authentic in their former state at least if some notable work or inscription had been printed with them or would it not have been a better method to celebrate the name of the inventor to have distributed annually a portion of wine out of them in order to inspire their poets with songs in his honor and fausts shame or to have hanged them up as trophies in the town hall or great church etc with respect to the stolen types which were turned to a better purpose by the thief who the next year printed with them alexandri doctrinale and the works of petrus hispanus if junius may be credited who was the first that said or thought of this well might serrarius say after the emperor julian who will be found innocent if one accusation makes a man guilty one would naturally think that this story was devised in the woods and walks about harlem for several of the writers before mentioned and particularly the colognian chronicle alleged by boxhorn agree that the latin bible was the first book printed by faust at mon it is surprising that these gentlemen of harlem should pretend to tell us what was done with their types in the very heart of germany and yet be entirely ignorant of what was done in their own city besides at that time it is certain as we have already shown that separate types of any sort of metal were unknown  but to proceed this treacherous servant it seems went off at    aclock at night when the whole family was at church  it is highly improbable that a dutchman should leave his shop so open and exposed at that time of night when it was filled with all the tools and apparatus of an invention so important and known only to himself and his man for it is downright absurdity to think that he might depend on the oath with which he had engaged the latter to secrecy such a night as that wherein the inhabitants of the city were going to or coming from mass was by no means proper for such a design and supposing he might have passed undisturbed with his stolen treasure yet he could not with the same facility pass through the gates or leap over the walls with at least a thousand weight of letters on his back or if his booty was those wooden planks with which the two large books mentioned before were printed as some of the dutch writers seem to hint against junius it was sufficient to load two or three carts that he should go with them to amsterdam then to cologn and at last to mentz without being taken notice of is no less astonishing i shall not insist upon his rashness in choosing to go through such public roads and noted cities and thereby running the danger of being seized the consequence of which would have been capital punishment nor upon the unaccountable supineness of his master in not pursuing nor causing him to be apprehended when he opened shop at mentz where he could easily have reached him nor yet upon the probability that the public must have been obliged by this daring attempt of robbing the country of such a glorious discovery to prosecute the robber with the utmost severity where ever he could be found  in the next place should we grant that faust or some other servants had stolen the types does it necessarily follow that he carried away the art with them could neither coster nor his soninlaw and assistant tho peter nor any of his grandchildren recover a new press cast new types and publish something that might expose the thief and show to whom the world was indebted for this invention besides it appears from junius that some of the types were left behind which were afterward transformed into drinkingvessels if these were not sufficient to set them to work again the interval of ten years viz from the pretended robbery anno      to the divulging of the art anno      was more than enough to have completed a new set seeing the first inventors devised tried and perfected this method in less time but it is urged that coster died either of grief or otherwise before he had brought the art to any perfection so that harlem was anticipated by mentz this is affirmed by majolus and quadi though without grounds for junius tells us that he invented the separate metal types as well as woodenblocks and met with such encouragement that people came far and near to purchase his books though at very dear rates now if he was alive as he and berkius relate anno      six years after this pretended flight during that interval he might have renewed his works there being no want of buyers and inscribed his books after this or some such manner this work was done at harlem by l j coster the inventor of this art of printing etc and not by that notorious pretender john faust who stole my art and instruments and is set up at mentz etc but nothing of this nature was ever done by coster or his posterity which is a plain indication that this whole story is what salmuth and other learned writers affirm it to be a mere old wifes fable without foundation or even probability how the devisers and publishers of it can maintain it with so much positiveness and vehemence with such calumnies invectives and ill language against persons of incomparable learning who could not give into such an absurd and legendary account is not my business to enquire i shall only observe that their charge upon a man of such conspicuous merit as john faust recoils with double force and shame upon themselves for it proves them guilty of a crime more flagrant than what they accuse him of in endeavoring to deprive him not only of the glory of that invention in order to fix it upon an imaginary countryman of theirs but even of what is most valuable in the world his reputation upon the bare testimony and tradition of three old citizens whose memory is as justly questionable as their and juniuss impartiality in a case wherein the honor of their city and fellowcitizens is concerned and what is still a greater aggravation of their unjust calumny to make use of fausts noble discovery to publish and perpetuate his shame whose honor and memory ought rather to have been celebrated by it little did that good man think that his art would ever be put to so vile a use against himself  in the mean time i must not omit to remark that of all the writers whom we have quoted for mentz and of many more collected by the diligent malinkrot in his history of printing there is not one native of that city munster indeed was born near it but educated at a greater distance and serrarius though he lived sometime there was born in lorain yet if such an objection had been just against ten or twelve of em there remains enough to fix the laurel on fausts head but with respect to the old evidences of harlem we only know what junius is pleased to tell us of them that they were persons who served several considerable offices in the city however malinkrot makes a very shrewd remark upon one of them viz cornelius the printer who in a sally of passion wished faust had been then alive that he might have executed him with his own hands and was at that time as junius relates above eighty years old now as this theft is pretended to have been committed anno      and it appears from an edition of tullys offices that faust was living anno      it is plain that in this space of    years cornelius might have had an opportunity of gratifying his revenge upon him if he had thought fit this circumstance therefore which was contrived to add weight to the story serves only to burlesque and overthrow it  i fear the reader is more weary of this argument than i could wish since there are two or three new allegations out of those who followed junius which though of small weight i would willingly examine before i dismiss this chapter though it were only to show what shifts they are driven to who undertake to support the credit of juniuss legend and to let the world judge whether such arguments are not more likely to overthrow than maintain this cause i shall here propose em with the utmost brevity  boxhorn in his theatrum hollandiae triumphs upon the evidence of two eminent writers whom he has violently wrested to speak in defense of his claim one is the author of the cologn chronicle the other mariangelus accursius a learned man who flourished in italy about the beginning of the sixteenth century the former writes to this purpose chronic coloniens quamvis autem ut praemittitur moguntiae ars haec inventa fuerit eo modo quo nunc temporis communiter usurpatur prima tamen ejus praefiguratio seu simulacrum ex donatis hollandiae reperta and desumpta fuit qui ibi ante id tempus excusi fuerunt e quo illis principium artis depromptum est at posterior haec inventio priore quoad artificium and subtilitatem long praestantior fuit  n b theauthor wrote this chronicle in high dutch but i could never procure the original and have been obliged to make use of malinkrets translation of it    that although the art of printing had been found out at mentz in the manner we now have it yet the first hints or pattern was taken from the donatus of holland which had been printed there that the aforesaid art took its origin from them though the latter invention is much superior in contrivance and ingenuity it is to be observed by the bye that this author wrote in the year      almost  0 years after the discovery and had these particulars from ulric zel an old bookseller then living at cologn the next testimony is a passage written by accursius upon the first leaf of a donatus printed at mentz by john faust as follows joannes faust civis moguntinus avus maternus joannis schoeffer primus excogitavit imprimendi artem typis aereis quos deinde plumbeos invenit multaque ad poliendam artem addidit ejus filius schoeffer impressus est autem hic donatus and consessionalia primo omnium anno    0 admonitus certe fuit ex donato hollandiae prius impresso in tabula incisa theatr holland p       john faust citizen of mentz grandfather by mothers side of john shepherd was the first that devised this art of printing with brass types which he afterward changed for leaden ones his son peter schoeffer added many other improvements to the art this donatus and the confessionalia were first printed in the year    0 he certainly took the hint from the donatus printed before in holland upon wooden planks what this donatus and other books of that sort were and whether really done in wood or otherwise with some other particularities relating to them shall be considered in a distinct chapter our present enquiry is how far they make for the cause of the dutch writers  we will suppose that ulric zel was a man of as good a memory as those mentioned by junius and that the second passage quoted was actually written by accursius which is far from being certain let us now examine what both these writers do and what they do not affirm they affirm   that this method of printing by fusile types was found out at mentz by john faust and improved by his soninlaw peter schoeffer   that they printed some books in the year    0   that there was a donatus printed before that time upon wooden planks in holland and   that from the hint or as the chronicler terms it the model or pattern vorbildung of those wooden planks faust began the new way of printing by fusile types though this last article seems only a conjecture of theirs  they do not affirm   that the old method of printing on wood was the foundation of the new one   that this donatus was printed at harlem rather than at any other place or by coster than any other person though if they had asserted this it ought to be examined how they got that intelligence seeing it was not known in holland ann      in which year junius died that any such book had been printed there for that author who was indefatigable in collecting whatever favored his cause would never have failed to mention it and jos scaliger though he since declared himself for harlem formerly attributed this rude invention to the city of dort   they dont affirm that this donatus was printed before the catholicon of mentz wherein lies the main point for though they say it was done before faust had perfected his invention yet it does not follow that it was before he had begun to print with wooden planks nothing therefore can be gathered from these authors even with respect to this invention in wood that favors coster or harlem more than faust or mentz  i have already observed that some of the dutch writers are for dividing the glory between those two corrivals and particularly peter berchius in this he is followed by no less an author than boxhorn so often mentioned for his zeal in this dispute he finding the impossibility of defending all the assertions of junius is willing to come to a composition his words are these sed non difficile est hanc tam gravem ac tam nobilem controversiam and quae clarissima nostri aevi ingenia exercuit componere nempe si vel id quod res est concedainus typos quidem ligneos a laurentio harlemensi primum fuisse inventos typo vero stanneos aereos and plumbeos ad horum exemplar efformatos esse a joanne fausto cive moguntino boxhorn theat holland it will be no difficulty to reconcile this great and weighty controversy which has exercised the greatest wits of the age if we will as indeed we ought yield the honor of the old wooden invention to coster of harlem and that of metal types to john faust citizen of mentz but this accommodation is attended with this disadvantage that it will set the dutch writers at variance not only with one another but also with themselves whereas it is much better in my opinion to continue in war with the whole world than to bring a domestic one into their own bowels a consequence still worse is inevitable for what will become of the pompous story of fausts robbery and of those creditable evidences mentioned by junius would not they with the utmost vehemence protest against such a partition treaty and old cornelius the false accuser deserve the most sanguinary treatment to be retaliated on him from some angry moguntine will not the drinking cups those noble relics of costers metal types run the risque of being turned into vessels of dishonor and all the inscriptions in his praise his statues and even his house at harlem be liable to some such dismal fate  if we should yield them this invention of wooden planks so eagerly contended for or agree with the more moderate of their writers that faust and coster though at so great a distance happened upon it together or grant to boxhorn that harlem was the mother and mentz the nurse of these two discoveries and that the one is but an improvement of the other yet coster would not have deserved half of the incense bestowed on him nor faust the least part of the calumnies which he has suffered in vain were such shifts and forgeries used to deprive him of so small and inconsiderable share of his glory whilst the far greatest part of it which could not be touched was more than sufficient to make him outshine and even eclipse his rival for whose sake he was so ungratefully treated had not he been blessed with a genius vastly superior to that of his supposed competitor or contented himself without aiming at a more useful and expeditious method than the first the common wealth of letters had received as little advantage from his discovery as his own name and memory from those dutch writers were they the only persons to transmit them to posterity however if their partiality and adherence to junius have influenced them so far as to make such returns for those improvements which they are obliged to acknowledge that he made common justice will oblige me to acquaint the reader that other writers of that country of equal learning and a more generous nature have been so far from joining with them that they have ascribed the invention to faust alone i have before quoted an encomium of the great erasmus upon him and his art and shall close this chapter with another out of the learned opmer of amsterdam who died about the year      i e  0 years after junius and has left us the following testimony in his posthumous book of chronography etenim hoc anno moguntiae a joanne fausto ars imprimendi exerceri coepta est fuerat is avus joan is shoefferi chalcographi nostrae aetatis vir dignus ut celebretur   quid quod sub mundi vesperam instante supremo jam die inter caliginosas impiorum atque discordiarum feralium procellas rarae pietatis summaeque

annumerandus opmer op posth p  0  edit colon    this year    0 the art of printing began to be exercised at mentz by john faust who was the grandfather of john schoeffer a printer of this age and worthy the highest encomiums in another place in the beginning of the  th book there is the following elegant panegyric upon the art and inventor  that at the decline of the world when the last day seemed to approach so many men of accomplished learning and singular piety should break forth like bright stars with unusual luster through the tempestuous clouds of deadly discord so that you would have thought the world had been recovered from a long disease and gradually reassumed its lost strength the arts and sciences this was effected by the assistance of that art which from metal characters of letters ingeniously cast disposed in the order in which we write spread over with a convenient quantity of ink and put under the press has ushered into the world books in all languages and multiplied their copies like a numerous offspring and has obtained the name of typography this art of printing was most certainly invented and brought to light by john faust in the year    0 it is amazing that the author of so important a discovery and so generous a promoter of divine and human learning should be unworthily traduced by a writer of the german affairs surely such a person deserves eternal remembrance and a place amongst men of the brightest genius  who this german writer was our author no where tells us but it seems as if his unnatural usage of his own countryman had taken off opmers wonder at the like treatment from the dutch writers if it should be asked what converts these last have made among other nations i can only answer that i know of none  the generality of writers have esteemed juniuss story unworthy of either credit or confutation and if any of the moderns seem neuter or doubtful in this case it is more owing to a peculiar affectation of modesty than either to any design of complimenting the dutch or fear of being mistaken in so evident a matter  chap vi an enquiry into the first books printed on blocks of wood viz the donatus speculum etc as the reader may reasonably think there is something exceilent in these books either for beauty of impression learning correctness etc from the great noise which they have made among the writers of this controversy i must begin with acquainting him that their whole merit consists only in their being looked upon by them as the very first essays of the art of printing even before the invention of fusile types this is so far from admitting of any controversy however some of them may have been misled into a contrary opinion that their being printed only on one side of the paper and afterward glewd together on the blank side from which they were called paginae conglutinatae is a very pregnant proof of their being done after the first method viz upon wooden blocks thowe shall not only corroborate the fact by many other undeniable arguments in the sequel of this chapter but even lead the reader into so plain a method of judging of those works from those printed by fusile types that he will not have the least room left to doubt of it  as for the donatus so strenuously insisted upon by bertius and others in favor of harlem it is a question whether there be one copy of it extant seeing it is not to be met with in any of those curious libraries i have either seen or heard of nor could ever be procured by any of our searchers into these ancient monuments though they have spared neither pains nor cost to have it sought for far and near to which let me add that no author i am acquainted with has pretended to have seen it if we except angel rocha who in his bibliotheca vaticana printed at rome in the year       to page     tells us that aldus manutius junr showed him a grammar of donatus printed on vellum upon one of the first white leaves of which mariangelus accursius a learned author living in italy about the year   00 had wrote as he supposed with his own hand the following words in latin that this donatus and another book entitled consessionalia were the first printed books and that john faust citizen of mentz and first inventor of the art of printing had printed them ann    0 as has been said in the last chapter  from this account of accursius it is plain first that this donatus bore neither date nor name of place or printer otherwise he need not to have been at the trouble of guessing at them secondly that donatus is the name of the author not of the book and that it was only a grammar for boys for so rocha calls it in the place before quoted to which we may add that in the last list which the first printers at rome gave of their works to the pope they call it donatus pro pueris so that it could not be such a trifling thing as some authors have thought it who only call it a primer the third thing i would observe from this passage is that john faust who is here called the first inventor of printing is affirmed to have printed it at mentz but what has puzzled the world is what the same author adds at the end of the passage viz that faust did certainly take the hint from the donatus in holland first printed on blocks of wood which for that very reason those authors who have followed him have thought fit to make  0 years older and have supposed them printed about the year    0 i might indeed have omitted this passage seeing accursius seems to hint that this book of his was printed by fusile types but as it was the only one that has been seen by any author and confirms some of our former assertions i thought it would not be amiss to insert it especially considering that it was not impossible for accursius to be mistaken in his judgment of its being printed after the new method of separate types as many other learned men have been in the like case the merit of this quotation has been examined in the last chapter and it is plain that all the authors that have mentioned the date of this book such as beughen boxhorn bertius and others have taken it upon trust as well as what they affirm of its being done upon wooden blocks since none of them pretend either to have seen it or to have taken it from any author that had and if we should admit what accursius affirms that those supposed dutch ones were older than this he wrote upon it will make it still plainer that they had neither date printer nor places name since this which is supposed ten years younger is without any of them the same may be said of the other books i am now going to give an account of viz the speculum ars moriendi etc which are in the earl of pembrokes curious collection none of which though they seem to be improvements of one another has the least mention of time place or printer  however as to their being engraven upon wooden blocks and consequently being the first essays or as some antiquaries call them the first maculatures of the art i am fully convinced both by the ink with which they are printed viz the common writing ink and by some undoubted trials i have made of them i shall therefore lay down the following rules to distinguish between books printed on blocks of wood and separate metal types  first let an m w or any other remarkable letter be curiously examined both as to its length breadth and shape and compare it with the same letter in another word if they vary either in similitude or size you may be assured they are not metal types since the most curious lettercutter writingmaster or engraver cannot make any two letters so alike but a nice observer will distinguish one from the other on the contrary in separate metal types each letter being cast in the same matrice it is impossible there should be the least difference either in shape or size  secondly another way is by choosing any word the longer the better take the length of it with the points of the compass and compare it with the same word in another place and if you find them both of the same length you may depend upon their being printed with separate metal types for as each letter is cast in the same mould it is impossible that their length should vary but in writing and engraving there will be a visible difference in the same word in various places  thirdly measure the length of a page tell the number of lines in a full one and take the white spaces between each line and by comparing them to any other full page in the book if they are printed with metal types there can be no variation in any of these respects whereas if they were done in wood it would be as impossible for them to agree in any one instance as it would be to engrave or write any two pages wherein there should be no visible variation in some one or more of the forementioned particulars it was by these methods that i distinguished in the sive books in the earl of pembrokes library what was done on wood and what by separate metal types  melchior adamus and after him the learned malinkrot and some others tell us of separate wooden types cut with a knife which were used by the first printers before the discovery of casting them into metal but besides that this seems inconsistent with the most authentic testimonies we have quoted hitherto concerning this invention whoever considers the vast time and trouble it would require to cut such a quantity of them as is necessary to print any moderate work the great difficulty of making them stand exactly upright and even in line and body how liable they would be to split break warp shrink and swell with continual wetting and the weight of the press with many more such like inconveniences and difficulties will easily judge not only of the absurdity of this notion but also of the impossibility of any of those old books being printed by any such types since it is obvious to every eye that no one single work could have come perfect out of their hands for the reasons abovementioned  before i dismiss this point i must not omit acquainting the reader with a mistake into which chevillier has been unwarily drawn even when he took the surest method of coming at the truth concerning one of these books in question viz the speculum salutis he tells us page     and     of his origin of printing that having one of them in his own possession and having met with another in the library of the celestin monks at paris he had the curiosity to have them examined by a printer a founder and an engraver who judged them to be printed with separatemetaltypes so that those who have read his book have thought it a sufficient ground to alter their opinion of their being done on wooden blocks but this mistake of chevilliers proceeded from his not examining the whole book because as i shall show anon there were many leaves supplied afterward by separate metal types one of which he had the misfortune to light upon otherwise they must have manifestly seen the difference  i come now to give the reader an account of the other five books viz ars moriendi the history of the apocalypse the history of the bible the speculum salutis and the spiegel or speculum translated into low dutch that these however are not all that was done upon wooden planks is plain because trithemius tells us of the catholicon first printed upon wood scaliger speaks of a psalter of the same stamp which his grandmother had and other antiquaries mention several others not worth inserting here all which are either perished or are as yet undiscovered however i cannot omit the speculum and some others seen by saubert in the nuremberg library of which he was keeper and mentioned by him in the catalogue of that library called in latin bibliotheca norica which books were printed in high dutch and may justly be supposed some of faustuss first tentamina or essays from ann    0 to    0 but as that author has only given us the names without any further account of them i shall pass them by and return to the five abovementioned which are no where to be met with together but in that noble collection of the right hon the earl of pembroke and as no one besides my self has described them all i hope the reader will not be displeased if i give him a more particular account of them than any but a printer could possibly have done they are all five printed on a very small folio  i ars moriendi or speculum morientium it is a moral treatise upon the subject of dying well with wooden cuts suited to the taste of the romish church a sick man is figured lying in his bed with angels and devils attending him the one to tempt the other to strengthen him to which end the designer has made labels from their mouths to express the intention of each the designs of this first book are somewhat better drawn than those of the rest for in that age as well as ours there were good and bad painters or designers but the presswork is the worst of the five this induces me to think this piece to be the oldest and its wanting the several improvements which we find in the others does not a little confirm me in my conjecture for first it is printed with common writing ink without any gum which is plain from its spreading it self and soaking into the paper so that in many places it is scarce legible and the ink is grown withal so pale by length of time that it does but just show it self at the best secondly it seems to have received several degrees of improvement as the work went on and is better printed and with better ink the nearer it draws to the end the third circumstance that proves its priority to the rest is that it has neither the capitals a b c etc which are now called signatures at the bottom of the first pages of each sheet nor any direction word at the end of each page which is a guide to the bookbinder how to place the sheets this improvement we find in the two next books  ii the history of the apocalypse this book which i venture to give the second rank to has the advantage of being printed with better ink than the former which makes it much more legible it appears to have some gum dissolved with the ink which was one of the first improvements that was made to the common sort of ink it has likewise the signatures at the top of each page of the sheet this piece contains the history of st john the evangelist in forty six pages each having some figures ill cut representing some part of that saints life the cuts are interspersed with short sentences arguments and explications in monkish latin prose likewise cut in wood after an indifferent manner the paper has the mark of the heiffers label and horns which is allowed to be the mark in the paper faust used  iii the history of the bible this contains only histories out of the old and new testament promiscuously blended together with wooden cutts better performed though worse drawn than any of the two foregoing it has likewise the arguments and explanations of each cut and the paper seems to be the same with that of the apocalypse it has also the improvements of ink and signatures these were in all probability the first signatures the  th and  th here have them not nor the books with fausts name and though the terence printed at milan    0 has them yet spira and jonson printed afterward without nor have they used them in france in      yet in the same year they were used at oxford   iv the speculum humanae salvationis it is commonly called speculum salutis or the mirror of our salvation and is a comparative history of the old and new testament it is written in monkish latin verse rhimd this is by far the most perfect of the two i have seen that which dr mead showed me wanted many leaves but this only two it consists of fifty six pages and each page has two columns of verses which are so well cut that were it not for some differences in the magnitude and shape of the same letters one might easily be induced to think them printed with metal types and i believe this is the reason that made some authors suppose them to be done with separate wooden types i have already taken notice of the improbability of that notion  v de spieghel this is only a translation of the speculum salutis into flemish it was upon this book that dr junius and the other dutch writers who have followed him lay so great a stress and upon whose antiquity preferable to all others they ground their claim to the invention of printing in favor of coster however it is very plain that the latin one is prior to this and that this is only a translation of that because the wooden cuts are the same in both the latin explanations at the bottom are left untranslated and the cuts are printed with the same pale gumd writing ink as in the latin one rather brown than black whereas the body of this work is composed with separate metal types and printed with an ink as remarkable for its blackness as any sort since made use of it has also in several places the same mark in the paper viz the heiffers label and horns acknowledged by mons naude to be the mark in fausts paper in the latin speculum a great many pages are supplied with the same separate metal types presswork and ink as the body of this whole flemish one and has all the appearances sufficient to convince any one of its being done at the same time and by the same hand one of which supplied pages of the latin speculum chevillier happened to pitch upon when he showed it to the printer founder and engraver before mentioned there is one circumstance worth noting which is that the speculum salutis though cut on wood each page consists of two distinct pieces the label piece is the draught or representation of the history the lower piece is the history itself in two columns and if i may venture to account for this motled work it must be by supposing that after they had cut the design they might print several proof sheets as is usual now to see if it needed any amendment which proof sheets of the draughts only together with a complete book of the latin speculum might afterward fall into the hands of some dutch printer who got it translated into low dutch and printed it with separte metal types upon the same proof sheets under the designs which were before printed at the label of the page and this will evidently appear from the manifest difference of the ink as before mentioned  there remain still two points to be examined with relation to the donatus   whether it be the first book printed with wooden planks   whether it was done by l coster at harlem to the first there is only the testimonies of ulric zel citizen of cologn who relates what was done almost fifty years ago and of mar accursius who wrote in italy what he heard was done at a still greater distance from him to these who could not possibly be acquainted with every circumstance of this discovery we may reasonably oppose the authority of trithemius for he learned what he tells us not from report and uncertain tradition but from the mouth of peter schoeffer who related nothing but what he was an eyewitness of or rather particularly interested in now trithemius ascribes the invention of wooden blocks to j faust and asserts that the catholicon was the first book of any consequence printed in that manner and that his next step was the more ingenious invention of separate metal types  let the world judge whether his testimony be not far preferable to that of the two former scriverius indeed and after him mr beughen affirm the donatus to have been printed anno    0 but give no reason for their fixing on that year rather than any other and it is manifest from what they say before that they only proceed upon a supposition that this method being discovered about that time this book which is perhaps the least considerable of those which were printed then might be one of the first essays of it however let the catholicon the donatus or any other be the first book printed in europe with wooden planks yet there is no ground of boasting it to be the first in the world since the chinese practiced that way of printing at least  00 years before either faust or coster were born  the next consideration is where and by whom it was printed the dutch attempt two ways of proving it was done by coster at harlem the first is that of junius who pretends that it was one of the first trials of costers metal types but this has been so fully confuted that they have been obliged to recur to another shift which is that coster invented the engraven planks and with these printed the donatus and speculum salutis and that from this faust took the hint of inventing metal types an improvement of the former method alibi enim ars alibi ornamenta artis inventa illa inter hollandos haec inter germaniae moguntinos  harlemum tipographiae velut matrem mogunt am autem nutricem fuisse and alumnam ibi superatum quicquid in novae rei exordiis impeditum hic additam majorem arti speciem and facilitatem boxhorn de art typogr invent p        as the latter part of this assertion has received a sufficient answer in the second chapter and elsewhere so i need not insist long upon a confutation of the former part i e the books themselves since they carry no evident characteristick nor are affirmed with certainty by any author to have been done in holland no doubt the latin speculum is the original and the dutch only a translation since as i observed before the latin arguments under the figures are left untranslated the learned saubert likewise tells us in his history of the norimbergh library that he has seen several books there printed in high dutch after this manner one of which is the speculum quae ligno incisa sunt huc non refero v g libellum fabularum and similitudinum qualis est d hartlhorni libellus germanicas itemque speculum mortentium speculum salutis and id genus alia saubert histor biblioth norimberg p      who can therefore determine which is the most ancient or where they were printed if the dutch one could be done no where but in holland because it is in low dutch by parity of reason the high dutch must have been printed in germany and as to the latin it will remain still undetermined whether it was done in the one or the other and nothing will be certain concerning it except that it must have been printed before the translations from the whole of what has been said it is apparent that all the proofs which the dutch bring either from facts or authentic writers confute rather than support their pretensions and i hope by this time the reputation of faust is sufficiently cleared from the two fold wrong done it by those who endeavor to deprive him of his due honor and asperse him with the vilest accusations of treachery and theft and that the reader not only esteems him acquitted of both but is satisfied that neither coster nor harlem have the least share in this discovery  before i conclude this chapter i cannot omit a conjecture of the ingenious mr mattaire which will be a considerable confirmation of what has been said before he tells us de loco and opifice incertiora adhuc sunt omnia si pro mguntia pronuncietur non multum haerendum erit de opificibus tribus scilicet antea celebratis aut tempore quod anno      quo primum juxta receptam hactenus a plerisque opinionem integrae typographiae opus per johannem fust and petrum schoeffer elaboratum prodiit fuerit forte vetustius opus enim minus perfectum oportet perfectiori praeivisse sin autem cui argentina plus placeat aut quam cur duarum malim postea aperiam harlemum guttenbergus quem quidam argentinam migrasse potior vero de qua deinceps disseram authoritas harlemi consedisse affirmat haec primae suae artis molitus est rudimenta non qui em ante annum      quo accidisse fertur inter ipsum faustumque dissidium quae ipsi fuit migrandi causa neque forsan multo post      quo perfectior innotuerat imprimendi ratio annal typgraph p     that he is inclined to think the books beforementioned were printed at harlem rather than at mentz or strasburgh because though guttenbergh removed at first to the latter soon after the sentence pronounced against him by the judges of mentz yet it appears from several authors even of our own nation that he either suspecting his safety there and a farther prosecution from faust for the money adjudgd to him by the decree and deed mentioned in a former chapter or upon some other reason came afterward to harlem in this city he is supposed by our author to have taught the art to coster and practiced it with him about the year      if this be admitted which has all the air of probability to recommend it coster will be left entirely destitute of his former glory the reader will find mr mattaires proofs for what he advances concerning guttenberghs printing at harlem in his book before quoted ibid a page    ad  0  quae ex lambethano ms descripsit de eo rum veritati cur dubitemus non video ex iis itaque pauca mecum colliget lector alibi forsan non ediscenda    johannes guttenbergus quem exorta inter ipsum and faustum contentione argentinam migrasse scribit henricus salmuth harlmum inde aliquando profectus est ibique primus artem typographicam a se inventam n onstravit and ipse anno      exercuit quod si admittatur contra laurentium costerum cui inventionis palma a belgis tribuitur manifest faciet etc ib p       which i refer to rather than to those old and scarce authors from whom he has extracted them i shall close this controversy of harlem with the words of malinkrot non hercle harlemicae silvae spatiis non batavicus deambulationibus non hollandico otio tam laboriosae artisanxium and difficilem partum debemus sed mogutinus potius sudoribus rhenanae industriae and difficilibus nixibus germaiae assiduitatis indefessae operationi continuae multorum annorum instantiae llum acceptum fee tenemur typograph cap   page    it is not the spacious woods of harlem nor the fine walks of holland nor the supineness of its inhabitants that could produce an art so difficult and laborious but it is to the strenuous endeavors of the city of mentz and the assiduous and indefatigable industry of the rhenish nation for many years together that we are indebted for it  chap vii the pretensions of strasburgh confuted in the two former chapters the falsity of the charge against john faust has been so fully demonstrated that one would have reasonably expected the ill success of this accusation and the many learned advocates that appeared in his defense might have been sufficient to deter the most sanguine of mortals from a second attempt upon so great a man nevertheless the reader must have patience to hear him arraigned at another bar for the like crimes committed about the same time though upon another person and at another place distant several hundred miles from the former  four years after the publication of boxhorns dissertatio de typographiae inventione and inventoribus printed at leyden    0 there started up another who in a small treatise entitled brevis de loco tempore and authore typographiae excursus pretended to prove that faust stole the art of printing from john mentel at strasburgh it is true this author was ashamed to set his name to it but neither that nor the meanness of his performance hindered the diligent malinkrot who was then writing his treatise de ortu and progressu artis typographicae against junius and his followers from confuting it hereupon james mentel doctor of physic at paris a man of learning and great grandson of mentel the first strasburg printer of that name published a book called paraenesis de vera typographiae igine at paris anno    0 wherein he undertook to make good the charge which the anonymous author had laid against faust and challenged the glory of the invention in favor of his ancestor though no particular answer to this book has been published yet there is not one writer upon this subject that i know of that has not taken occasion to confute or at least to say something to discountenance it i should therefore esteem my self wanting to this art and its inventor should i omit giving a short account of this controversy and expose the vanity of such an attempt especially because it may be thought that dr mentel would not have troubled the world with it so soon after the other unless he had had something more weighty to allege in favor of strasburgh than the dutch had for harlem  i hope to propose the arguments on both sides so fairly that the reader will easily judge of the pretensions and merit of this new competitor and with such brevity that he will not be tired with it by referring still to the quotations in the margin without interruption to the story  the first evidence alleged by dr mentel is an old strasburgh chronicle of equal authority with the harlem tradition to this purpose anno millesimo quadringentesimo quadragesimo als zum drittenmahl etc quae latin sic sonant cum e tribu vietorum tertius in consulem esset electus dominus nicholous schantliti and praetura urbana fungeretur walterus spiegel etc eximia illa and mire utilis typographia strasburgs inventa est ab incomparabili viro johanne meant lo habitante in foro fronhoff in aedibus vero viengarten hoc est lustri vulgo nuncupatis quod divinissimum opus non celavit unum ex famulis suis sibi dexteritate ingenii atque acumine notum johannem geasfleich vocatum and illum moguntye sm ut abs illo in ea re juvaretur sed male feriatus is servus ubi quadamtenus industriae istius fuisset conscius nequissime cum hero se gessit am cum johanne guembergio populare suo pinguis census homine ac vitae sort aurifice se socians qui jam de art quidpiam subodorabatur ut meroria cujus opera fabricadis ad id instrumetis usus antea fuisst

consequi illac egredi apud se constituerunt ac moguntiam profecti suut mentel p      that anno    0 nich schantlitt being consul etc the excellent and truly useful art of printing was invented at strasburgh by the incomparable john mentel who dwelt in the fronhoff market and at the house commonly called viergarten brothelhouse which divine invention he communicated to a servant of his of great ingenuity and dexterity by name john gensfleich a native of mentz that he might be assisting to him in the business but this treacherous fellow had no sooner learned the mystery but he served his master a base trick by associating himself with his counrryman j guttenberg a wealthy silversmith who began to smell out something of the art having been employed by mentel to make some necessary tools and discovering to him the secret which he had been entrusted with by his master these two hoping to make themselves famous by this art but being fearful of divulging it at strasburgh where the inventor lived resolved to remove thence and settle at mentz  with respect to this chronicle and the writer of it we only know what our author tells us in his translation inserted at the bottom of the page for the chronicle is written in high dutch as it wants therefore some better authority for its support dr mentel brings as a confirmation of it the testimonies of the writers quoted in our third chapter who make mention of guttenbergs carrying the art from strasburgh to mentz where he perfected it by the assistance of john faust alias gensfleich whose words are not therefore necessary to be repeated here in the next place he alleges an inscription which with mentels coat of arms was put at the beginning of otho brunsfields onomasticon printed at strasburgh by john schott anno      importing insigne schottorum familiae ab frederico romanorum iii imperatore jeanni mentelin primo typographiae inventori ac suis concessum anno      p  0   that these arms of schotts family had been given to john mentelin first inventor of the art of printing and to his posterity by the emperor frederic iii anno      after this he gives us a latin epigram written by erhard windsberg and inscribed to the three famous germans who set up the first printingpress at paris in the first verse of this he has thought fit to change the word alemannia germany for these of tu argentina thou strasburgh as more proper for his purpose  the book at the end of which are these verses is the epistles of crates the cynick printed by martin crantz and his two partners beforementioned anno    0 not at strasburgh as our author would fain insinuate to his readers but at paris where it is still extant in the library of the sorbon and was seen among others by chevillier who has occasionally confuted mentels supposition and exposed his unfair quotation of the epigram page    of his history of printing as we shall show in its proper place  this is all that i can find in mentels book which has the appearance of argument the rest consists chiefly in digressions and quotations in praise of the art and of the german nation which are entirely foreign to this controversy in short our author shows himself more desirous of appearing zealous for his ancestors honor than solicitous what credit his work will merit among the learned i shall give an instance or two of this and proceed to the confutation of his main arguments  in page    he gives us a piece of a comedy written by the famous swedish poet nicodemus frischlin but is pleased to overlook the lines quoted by us before at p    in which he affirms john faust citizen of mentz to have been the inventor of the art though they are at a very small distance from the passage quoted by him what is still more remarkable is that mentel affirms that our swedish poet dedicated this dramatic piece to the senate of strasburgh which he would scarce have done had he dreamt any thing of that citys claiming the glory of this invention against his hero john faust or heard any thing of the charge of theft alleged against him by the strasburgers the other instance of his unfairness is no less considerable at p    where having supposed that the rationale durandi was not printed till after the falling out of faust and guttenbergh viz ann      to evade the force of the real date      he says with a very serious air that he had credible information from men of great learning both printers and others that it was wrong printed and that the figure i which is put before should have been after the x that instead of mcccclix it should have been mcccclxi whereas mr mattaire assures us vide quaeso mentelii in opinione falsa obstinati ipsiusque hominum ornatissimorum hallucinationem manifestam annus enim illius libri exprimitur non numeralibus litteris sed disertis verbis millesime quadringentesimo quinquageimo nono annal typograph p    anno col    that the year is not printed with numeral letters but in words at length one thousand four hundred fifty nine i can hardly suppose dr mentel could be mistaken for want of an opportunity of consulting the book itself seeing it is to be so easily met with in several ibraries of paris which stand always open to the learned and curious and i dont find he has been wanting in ransacking them to find out any thing to his purpose though should even this supposition about the date be allowed it would not therefore follow that no books were printed before the year    0 with fausts and schoeffers names exclusive of guttenberghs as dr mentel attempts to persuade his readers for the psalmorum codex printed ann      mentions only the names of the two former and the latter was never printed in any book that could yet be produced what is said will suffice i hope to give an idea of this authors sincerity whose three principal authorities i shall now examine  first as to the strasburgh chronicle we may reasonably be excused for not laying the same stress upon it that our author does since the obscurity of the writer a suspicion of his partiality for his countrys honourand a difficulty of believing a person in his own cause in opposition to a great number of more credible witnesses are obstacles almost invincible i am therefore inclined to think that the bare opposing of the chronicle of cologne and trithemius who assert that the art was first brought from mentz to strasburgh will be a sufficient confutation of it though there were no other authorities for the one nor arguments against the other however we have an unexceptionable witness to produce against this chronicle viz the learned wimpheling who was not only an eminent citizen of strasburgh and almost contemporary with the discovery of the art but is likewise quoted by dr mentel though his testimony be diametrically opposite to his purpose the first part of the passage is set down at length in page    wherein he attributes the whole invention to john guttenbergh and tells us that he did not perfect it till he had been sometime at mentz whilst john mentel undertaking the same business printed a great many volumes very neat and correct and grew exceeding rich in a short time interea joannes mentel id opisicii genus incoeptans multa volumina castigate and polite imprimendo factus est brevi opulentissimus wimphel loco tat  this is all that wimpheling says of mentel nor has any author except that of this strasburg chronicle mentioned or supposed him to be the inventor but only one of the first that practiced that art at strasburgh and if the reader will recollect what most of the writers quoted in the third chapter of this book have said concerning guttenberghs leaving mentz and returning to strasburg where some of them affirm him to have taught mentel the art we shall not wonder that wimpheling makes him the first inventor of it seeing he practiced it there sometime before it was known that faust had done the like at mentz and was consequently the first printer that wimpheling might know of nor is it reasonable to suppose that guttenbergh could have been weak enough to say any thing of what had passed at mentz between faust and himself it being so little to his credit  mentels next authority is taken from the coat of arms given to the family by the emperor frederick iii for which there is no other testimony but the first leaf of the onomasticon however supposing it to be authentic may we not with the greatest reason oppose to it the patent or privilege granted by the emperor maximilian to john schoeffer in consideration of his being the grandson of john faust the first inventor of the art of printing this privilege being of much later date than the other may be reasonably enough supposed a retracttion of the former which might have been surreptitiously obtained especially considering that faust has the concurrent testimonies of writers and incontestable facts but mentel only brings an old chronicle and the most precarious grounds to support his pretensions however the authentickness of this grant is not only much questioned by the generality of writers but has one material objection against it which is that the person to whom it was given never made any mention or show of it in all the books printed by him at strasburgh which according to wimphelings account were very numerous it seems to me surprising that if he had really obtained such a noble testimony of his being the first inventor of printing and had been so treacherously robbed both of the secret and the glory of it by a faithless servant he had not made use of his imperial majestys authority whose subject he was as well as faust to confirm the honor of the invention upon himself and the shame of the theft upon the other but on the contrary there is not one book to be met with though we may reasonably think dr mentel was not negligent in such a search that was printed by john mentel before the year      and even this was without any mention of the place where it was printed as appears from the speculum morale of vincentius in folio which is the oldest book known to bear his name whereas faust and his soninlaw put their names to their impressions almost sixteen years before that time as is plain from the psalmorum codex printed ann      what is still more wonderful is that john mentel never placed this coat of arms in any of his books as we can find for the oldest edition that has it is the geographical work of ptolemy printed by his nieces son mdxx that is  0 years after the invention    years after the grant and    after faust had begun to print in his own name even by mentels own confession  i come now to consider the epigram and dr mentels wild inferences from it which he grounds upon a supposition that the epistles at the end of which it is printed were done at strasburgh from which he would conclude that from this city not only the three first printers of paris to whom they are inscribed but also the most celebrated ones of europe came his words are these ut ita consentaneum sit assevevare ab argentorato velut a ca pite hoc artificium primo fluxisse atquedimanasse hinc ad came suosque magnam partem tipographos primores illos quorum meminit wimphelingus erhards windsberg cujusdam epigramma quod habetur in calce epistolarum cratetis ubi ubivis gentium nam locus non ponitur quanquam putem strasburg at certe novellis and artis infantiam plane redolentibus literarum characteribus impressarum etc p     so truly may it be affirmed that this art at first flowed from strasburgh as from its fountainhead whence it dispersed it self abroad to that city therefore and to the greatest part of her first printers mentioned by wimpheling is that epigram of erhard windsbergh directed which is at the end of cratess epistles wheresoever these are printed for there is no place named though i should rather think at strasburgh they being done with some of the first types whose rudeness plainly shows the infancy of the art all this is said without any foundation and would scarce have deserved to be inserted here but that it afforded me an opportunity of showing the reverse from the testimony of chevillier who examined and compared the the edition of cratess epistles with the first impressions of these three printers of paris which are given under the first list and found them exactly alike they are all done upon the same paper with the same types ink etc and demonstrate the infancy of the art he adds farther that there is a greater probability that these three partners came from mentz than from strasburgh though there is no record left of the particular place but of germany in general because he finds a great conformity between their characters and impressions and those of peter schoeffer thus he tells us p    of his history of printing that the speculum of zamora printed by them at paris ann      bears a very great likeness with st jeromes epistles printed at mentz    0 their rationale durandi of      with scheoffers speculum harpianum x praeceptorum their edition of utinuss lenten sermons of      with the scrutinium scripturarum pauli burgensis printed at mentz      from which the author reasonably concludes that it is more likely they came from the city of mentz than from that of strasburgh i shall now subjoin at the bottom of the page the epigram both as it is printed in the genuine edition of the epistles and as mentel has altered it erhardi windsbergh epigramma ad germanos librarios egregios michaelem martinum and uldaricum  genuine edition  plura licet summae dederis alemannia laudi  mentel plura licet summae dederis tu argentina laudi at reor hoc majus te genuisse nihil quod prope divinam summa ex industria fingis scribendi hanc artem multiplicans studia felices igitur michael maremeque semper vivite and ulrice ho queis opus imprimitur erhardum vestro and non dedignemini amore cui fido semper pectore clausi eritis   i need not i believe point out to the reader the material difference between alemannia and tu argentina the latter of which were it authentic would undoubtedly determine the dispute on the side of strasburgh but as the former is exactly according to the edition preserved in the sorbon library ever since it was printed it is plain that author of the epigram who was probably a countryman and intimate acquaintance of the three printers and corrected their editions adding sometimes a copy of verses in their praise did not design to particularise any city but to give the honor of the art to the german nation in general it is likewise probable enough that they might not come all three from one and the same city but perhaps each of them from a distinct one in which case the poet must have been forced either to name them all or disobliged one or two of them or spoil a good epigram and therefore rather chose to compliment them under the name of germans without regard to the place of their birth  though i have now done with dr mentel yet before i close this controversy it will not be improper to observe that there are two cities more of germany which have laid claim to this invention viz ausburgh and russenburgh in alsace the first of these owes its original to a passage misunderstood in the supplement to polydore vergil de rerum inventoribus attributed by irenicus to gilbert cognatus and printed ann   0  in   o it runs thus the art of printing is reported to have been discovered by the industry of peter schoeffer of ausburgh or invented by some of his relations and cultivated by him it is plain here that the author does not say that the art was invented at ausburgh but that the inventor was a native of the place in which he was certainly mistaken seeing schoeffer who best knew the place of his own birth declares himself in all his inscriptions a native of gernsheim a small town upon the rhine a little below worms besides we have no books extant which are printed before the year      at ausburgh when john schuster gave an edition of paul orosiuss chronography in folio the other town viz russenburgh is likewise said by the same irenicus to have been esteemed by some writers the inventress of the art of printing and that it received its name from the noise of the many printingpresses at work in it but this name seems to be more ancient than that art and no book printed there has been ever produced nor any author of antiquity mentioned it so that this was only a mistake in cognatus if he was the writer of the book beforementioned i hope that by this time enough has been said to satisfy the reader that all which has been urged in favor of harlem strasburgh or these two last cities is unworthy to come into competition with these noble testimonies and facts we have alleged on the side of mentz i shall therefore with the greatest pleasure dismiss this rough and tedious path of controversy and resume the thread of our history  chap viii the time of the discovery of printing the difficulty of fixing the exact time of the discovery arises from these two reasons   becausee the inventors made many fruitless trials and a great number of maculatures before they could bring the art to any tolerable degree of perfection   because the vast expenses of such a discovery obliged them to keep it secret as long as possible or at least till they had reimbursd themselves in some measure by finishing the latin bible which though a great and expensive work was most likely to compensate their pains and cost when finished this is the foundation of the disagreement between writers upon the subject which may however be easily reconciled by attending to the different epochas from which they date the discovery some of them as wimpheling palmerus althamerus etc date it from the infancy of the invention of wooden blocks and assign the year    0 others as the author of the chronicle of cologn trithemius aventine and many more from the invention of fusile types anno    0 andrew thevet angel rocha etc fix the discovery of the former method in      whilst others place the time of the second invention in      or      among whom are apianus and p langius lastly philip bergomensis and peter ramus assign the year      for the perfection of it to accommodate this discrepancy among all these authors it will be sufficient to say with relation to the first that they take their date from the time in which the invention of wooden blocks was perfected rather than from its infancy with respect to the last that they thought a ten years interval much too short for the transition from the infancy of the former to the perfection of the latter method and therefore allowed a few years more than their predecessors had done as for those who fix the latter invention in      they were such as esteemed the first printed book to have been the catholicon printed ann    0 or perhaps the second impression of the bible ann      or tullys offices an      as zwinger and others supposed and allowed some years more for the invention and perfection of the art now it is plain that before the psalmorum codex as we have hinted there is not any book known to have been printed with an imprimatur at the end and it is equally certain that the learned knew nothing of this last book till the year      in which peter lambeck published the second part of his catalogue of the imperial library where this noble monument is preserved which is the reason that it is omitted in all the lists of the first printed books it is not strange therefore that these writers for want of dates and facts should be obliged to guess as well as they could at the time of the discovery however we find that the chronicler of cologn serrarius sebast munster and others after them well enough reconcile this diversity of opinions by assigning the year    0 for the former invention and    0 for the latter to these if we add the authority of trithemius who certainly had the best information in this matter from peter schoeffer a principal person in the invention it will be evident that about the year    0 they began to apply themselves to cutting or engraving upon wooden blocks after the chinese manner and printed some books with them but that after the year    0 they found out a more excellent way for these are trithemiuss words in the famous passage quoted in chap   post haec inventis successerunt subtiliora inveneruntque modum fundendi formas omnium latini alphabeti literarum etc  viz of casting separate metal types this method they might have been devising and trying before that time i e during some part of the first ten years though they continued still printing after the old way till they had quite perfected the new one either to bring in a continual supply of money necessary or perhaps to keep the world from prying into the new discovery wherein they were engaged  i have said nothing hitherto of the dutch writers who to make the time of this invention agree with juniuss story of fausts pretended theft have put it back some above ten others twenty years how little credit they merit in this particular is already shown and the reader will be still more convinced of it when he sees what shifts they are reduced to for want of authorities to oppose to the vast number of writers quoted on fausts side not one of whom ever thought of fixing this remarkable epoch beyond the year    0  their first authority is the inscription set over laurence costers door by one of the citizens of harlem which is mentioned by all the dutch writers and says that he found out this art ann    0 but this is of too recent a date to be of any weight  scriverius in his apology against naude makes the discovery two years older and gives us a chronographic verse hic fago cxsc vi ptas la vreati cvsplde for mas  scriver apolog pro patr contra neudeum    whose numerical letters make up the date of mccccxxviii boxhorn carries it still farther back viz to the year    0  but as the two former dates were affirmed without any foundation this author has endeavored to confirm his own with something that might bear the appearance of authority and to reconcile it with the other two by affirming that coster began to lay the foundation of this art ann    0 though he did not perfect it till ten years after the author upon whose testimony he would have us believe it is one joseph karro a jewish rabbi who in a book entitled shulkan aruch or mensa instructa extracted by him out of another jewish book called arbugh thurim i e quatuor ordines tells us of an old chronicle printed at venice a m      which answers to our year mccccxxviii this book of rabbi joseph he owns that he could never meet with yet he infers from what is said there that there could be no printing at venice at that time unless harlem had it some years before i shall content my self with giving boxhorns words in the margin circa annum    0 prima nobilissimae artis

hunc certe velim accuratius aspiciant qui habent  especially since neither his rabbi nor himself have gained any credit in this particular as it would indeed be wonderful if a jew should be believed before the concurrent testimonies of all the learned men in europe if he wrote what boxhorn quotes out of him he either was prodigiously mistaken or affirmed it as is too common with his nation contrary to his knowledge though if we should deny that he ever wrote thus i cannot see with what reason boxhorn could resent it since he neither saw the book himself nor gives the authors name from whom he took it however leaving him and the rest of the dutch writers to search for more authentic proofs than what they have hitherto alleged let us return to our own which if we dare rely upon as we have the greatest reason to do it will be plain that this art was first attempted about the year    0 and about ten years after happily perfected by john faust and peter schoeffer in the city of mentz that though the former imperfect method was known in china some hundred years before we had it yet this latter the only one which deserves the name of printing was neither known nor practiced till those two persons had communicated it to some of their servants by whom it was divulged and dispersed over europe and even beyond it this will appear more evident in the next and subsequent chapters  chap ix of the first books printed by faust and schoeffer there has been frequent occasion of mentioning the catholicon as the first trial of the art of printing according to trithemiuss testimony but as it is our design to speak of those only which are done with separate metal types and bear some certain date or mark of the printer i shall suspend the account of it till i come to treat of its second impression by the same faust and schoeffer ann    0  t is certain that if only that book which bears the oldest date is to be esteemed the first printed the book of psalms so often mentioned will bid the fairest for the first rank nevertheless i can see no reason to depart so far from the testimonies of trithemius and the chronicle of cologn as not to allow the preference to the latin bible which as they tell us was the first book to which the pious authors of this art thought fit to consecrate their labors in this opinion they have been followed by many learned and judicious writers both ancient and modern particularly malincrot chevillier de la caille paul pater and watson i shall therefore select the strongest of their reasons add a few remarks of my own upon them and leave the decision to the reader  first with respect to trithemiuss testimony which i think is unexceptionable seeing he affirms nothing but what he had from peter schoeffers mouth he plainly enough intimates that the bible was their first work when he says that the art was found out by degrees that after they had finished the discovery in speculation and came to put it in practice they were involved in many difficulties that a primo inventionis suae etc impressari namque bam trithem loco sura citato soon after or from the beginning of this invention when they went about printing the bible before they had finished the third quaternion or quire of four sheets the charges amounted already to four thousand florins a prodigious sum in those days if we duly consider these words we cannot but conclude the bible to have been the first book they engaged in our author indeed mentions not the year in which it was printed but this might proceed from forgetfulness or want of information however since such a work could not be finished in a short time when the art was in its infancy the hands but few and unacquainted with the several branches of composition imposition correction distribution etc we may suppose the invention to have been perfected in speculation about the year    0 and yet to have required some time before it could be put in practice by reason of the difficulties arising in it so that it will be reasonable to allow a year or two more before the impression of the bible could be completed this may in all probability be the reason why trithemius who is always very exact in his chronicles and mentions the year of any fact when he is sure of it rather chooses to make use of a more general expression in this case viz his temporibus about this time when he speaks of the year    0 if we recollect that he expresses himself in the same words in his first chronicle we shall be obliged either to allow a larger scope to them or else suppose that the catholicon which was done in wood and the bible printed with metal types were finished at the same time which would be absurd  the manuscript cologn chronicle tells us that it was printed in the jubilee year    0 in a large character such as is used in the impressions of missals or mass books which answers to our double pica this chronicle was written in high dutch ann      the author of which acquaints us that he had the particulars of this invention from ulric zel an old bookseller then living at cologn as the original is not so well understood here i shall subjoin at the bottom of the page the whole passage in latin as i find it translated by malinkrot ars primum inventa in germaniae urbe moguntina ad rhenum circa annum    0 and ab eo donec scriberetur   0 inventioni ejus corumque quae ad illam pertinent opera impensa fuit eoque anno qui jubilaeus fuit coeptum fuit primim libros imprimere primusque qui excuderetur liber liblta fuere latina impressaque ea sunt scriptura

typographum agit v d malinkrot de art typog p     the words are to this purpose that the art of printing was found out at mentz  ann    0 that from that time to    0 they were employed in perfecting it that they were began to print books in the jubilee year and that the first that was printed was the latin bible in a large character etc here ulric zels words are to be taken in a lax sense for he is far from saying that any thing in this kind much less the bible was finished in the year    0 but only that they began then to set about printing it how long it was before they completed it or what date it bore is what he neither does nor perhaps could so well inform us of however though we cannot be certain either from him or trithemius when this noble work was perfected yet it is manifest from their restimony that except some maculatures and small trials the bible was the first considerable piece printed by faust  i am not ignorant that mr mattaire in his annals has declared himself of the contrary opinion but as he has not confuted any of the abovementioned testimonies though he must have read them in the authors before quoted nor given any reason for his departing from them i have given preference to the judgment of so many learned writers confirmed by two such considerable testimonies to his single opinion i apprehend but two tolerable objections against this the first is that not one of these bibles is known to be extant the second is that faust cannot probably be supposed to have begun with so large and expensive a volume when a smaller would have been more proper for an essay and brought him a more speedy gain to the first i answer   that this bible being so full of abbreviations etc in imitation of the old way of writing and difficult to be read might undergo the same fate with many other books both ms and others to be thrown by and destroyed when the fairer and more legible impressions came in vogue   the learned saubert in his oration de bibliotheca reipublicae noribergensis tells us that he had seen no less than eight copies of them in the norican library without date colophon or any other mark of their being printed by faust as i have not been able to procure sauberts book i must content my self with giving the reader the passage out of paul pater in which this is mentioned it is as follows biblia latina quorum translatio divo hieronymo vulgo tribuitur circa    0 and sequentem moguntiae in membrana impressa quorum faustus exemplar nummis uncialibus seu thaleris septingentis quinquaginta parisus venum dederat ut supra ex abbate spanhemensi narravimus inter primordia merito numerari cornelius beughen memorat iocunab tyopgraph amsterd ann      edui similiter henricus salmuth alium bibliorum codicem ibidem lucem vidisse denarrat cui haec in fine verba erant apposita praesens ratilis divinorum codex consummatus est per johannem faust civem mogunt and petrum gernsheim etc ann      etc sed errare hac part salmuthum quod rationale illud sacrum scripturam esse putet cum tantum breve aliquod guillelmi duranti scriptum sit quod se quoque possidere bern a malinkrot refert ne ue tamen prorsus negaverim biblis latina hoc

nobis adductam p pater de german mirac lipsiae ann    0 page    the latin bible commonly supposed to have been translated by st jerome printed at mentz upon vellum about    0 or the following year a copy of which faustus sold at paris for   0 crowns as we related out of trithemius is justly reckoned among the first beginnings of this art by corn beughen in his incunab typograph amsterd ann      henry salmuth likewise mentions another bible published ann      at the end of which are these words this present rationale etc was finished at mentz by john faust etc but salmuth is doubtless mistaken in taking this book for the bible of which it was only a short explanation a copy of this bern malinkrot tells us that he had by him i would not however be too positive that there was not a latin bible printed in the same year seeing john saubert owns that he had seen eight copies of it in the norican library without faustuss colophon undoubtedly for the reason beforementioned viz in order to sell em for manuscripts from this passage it appears that there are eight bibles without fausts mark preserved in that library and seen by saubert though both he and p pater took them for the second impression in which they are certainly mistaken   because this was printed ann      and not ann        because it is so far from having been printed without a colophon that it has one of the fullest and plainest that faust ever used at the end of any of his books the reader will see it when we come to the edition itself but   it is not impossible but that there may be still more of these copies in some other libraries as yet undiscovered the only intelligence which we had concerning these eight is owing to saubert neither would these gentlemen have believed that there had been a psalmorum codex printed at mentz ann      though assured of it by trithemius and zel had not peter lambeck the emperors library keeper    years ago told us that he met with it in that famous library i have been likewise assured from the mouth of a gentleman of credit that a friend of his had seen one abroad with the date of      and farther that twas his opinion twould be brought to england how many authors have had a notion that tullys offices was the first printed book yet time has produced no less than four printed before it exclusive of the bible now in question and may yet discover more concerning this  i come now to the second objection so much insisted upon by some viz that it is improbable faust would begin his first essays with a volume so large and expensive when a smaller would have answered his purpose much better and brought an immediate gain my reply is   that the great expense at first consisted in purchasing such a quantity of materials as the business required and not in printing of the first book which was inconsiderable compared with that consequently a smaller volume would have been too slender a reimbursement for such great sums expended besides we have shown that they took up money of guttenbergh for buying of parchment etc and were not so straightened as before   as faust designed to sell as many of his first printed books as he could for manuscripts in order to make up the cost which he had been at it is obvious that he must pitch upon some considerable and valuable book before his art was discovered and where could he fix upon one more adapted to his purpose than this i will not insist upon the piety of the persons so conspicuous in all their inscriptions though our age may call it superstition which might have a great share in determining their choice i shall only add that as it was by no means advisable for him to sell any of his first essays left they should betray his invention so it was most prudent to make them upon the first leaves of the bible which if they succeeded would in time make him ample amends and if they did not the loss was no greater than if they had been tried upon a donatus or a primer besides none of our authors have affirmed that he began to print the bible before he had perfected the art both in theory and practice and made a sufficient number of maculatures and other trials which it was the most prudent way to burn as soon as printed off i shall leave this discourse of the first bible to the readers choice either to close in with or dissent from us in allowing it the first rank and proceed now to the remainder of our proposed list it will be necessary however to acquaint him although we have given the preference to that sacred book upon the testimonies of so many ancient and modern writers though it bears no date yet in the following list i am about to give him of these first impressions of faust we chiefly inquire after such as carry either date or some other certain mark of the year in which they were printed for as to those that do not i shall speak of them afterward and show that those authors who thought to have found out their date have proved to have been in an error which will be a sufficient reason for us not to depend upon any others of the like nature  next to the bible we find five several impressions which have certainly been made between the years      and      the first of these which as we hinted is omitted in all the lists of the first books that have been printed before lambecks catalogue of the vienna library is the psalmorum codex printed at mentz upon vellum anno      concerning this what has been said already will suffice the colophon of it is in the fourth chapter p     the second is the rationale divinorum officiorum written by william durand printed at mentz upon vellum two years after the psalter viz anno      by john faust and peter de gernsheim or schoeffer malinkrot who knew nothing of the psalter reckons it the first printed book next to the bible and tells us that he purchased one of them which had formerly belonged to a monastery of franciscan monks destroyed by the civil wars the inscription of which is very near the same with that of the psalter this rationale is likewise in the earl of pembrokes library where i saw it it is beautifully printed in folio upon vellum and is a singular beauty as to presswork  the supposition of malinkrot and others that this was the first printed book was the reason that father labbe a learned jesuit began his list of printed books from the years of its date viz      to   00 and the author of the supplement to bellarmins ecclesiastical writers makes this remark upon it that anno      john faustus having discovered the art of printing first printed the book of guill durand de officiis ecclesiasticis in the city of mentz these authors were certainly in the right seeing no book was then known of an older date but since the second part of trithemiuss chronicle and the second volume of the imperiallibrary have been published we must look some years back for the first impression and give that rank to a more noble work  the third is the catholicon a latin vocabulary printed at mentz anno    0 the second time for the first impression was done upon wood this book is likewise in the earl of pembrokes library where i saw it it is in a large folio and beautifully printed we have given the inscription of it in the fourth chap p  0 in which though the printers name is not expressed yet it was done by faust and schoeffer both from the similitude of its character paper etc with that of their other works and because there were at that time no other printers either at mentz or any where else this catholicon is a kind of grammar compiled by john of genoa a dominican friar anno      it is divided into four parts the last of which contains a dictionary of latin words digested alphabetically there have been several editions of it in folio as chevillier tells us who saw two of them one very old and without date the other printed at paris anno   0  by jodocus badius another impression of it is done at lions by antony du ry anno    0 and augmented by peter gille furetiere therefore was led into a palpable error when he affirmed after dr mentel and father jacob a carmelite that the first printed books known in europe were durandus de ritibus ecclesiae printed anno      a bible printed anno      st austin de civitate dei and tullys offices seeing here are no less than four printed books before the oldest of them besides this book de ritibus ecclesiae was not written by william durand but by john stephen durant who was first president of the parliament of toulouse and is therefore a different book from the durands rationale we are now speaking of and of a much later date  the fourth is the second edition of the latin bible printed anno      in folio with the following inscription at the end presens hoc opus finitum ac completum and ad eusebiam dei industria in civitate moguntina per johannem fust civem and retrum shoefer de gernsheim clericum dioecesis ejusdem est consummatum anno incarnationis dominicae mcccclx i in vigilil assumptionis gloriosae virginis mariae  this present work was finished and perfected for the service of god in the city of mentz by john fust citizen and peter schoeffer de gernsheim clerk of the same diocese it was completed in the year of our lord s incarnation mcccclxii on the eve of the assumption of the glorious virgin mary i have seen one in the library of dr mead and another at the late mr wooodmans bookseller in vellum and chevillier saw two more at paris in two volumes of this bible walchius walchius decas fabularum generis humani printed at strasburgh   0  in  to page     relates a story which ought to be mentioned here as far as respects the common opinion faust went to paris with some copies of it finely illuminated where he sold one of them for   0 crowns and another for  00 till at length he reduced his price to  0 and  0 crowns the great quantity which he sold and the exact likeness of every copy made it suspicious that they were done by a more easy and expeditious way than that of writing whereupon the buyers thinking themselves imposed upon began a prosecution which obliged him to fly the country and return to mentz thus far walchius who says nothing of fausts being accused of magic as some others affirm what relates to the person of faust will be best considered in the next chapter as to the bible itself it is my opinion that the reason why the generality of authors have thought this second edition to have been that which he sold for ms is that they scarce knew of any other book printed before it mr le gallois in his treatise of the finest libraries page    tells us that there was nothing printed before this bible of      which faust brought to paris quoiqui en soit il est certain qu on ne voit rien aimprime avaunt ctte bible que faust apporta luy meme a paris father de st raomuld affirms likewise in his thesaur chronolog page     that we have nothing printed before the year      and the great naude who in his addition to the history of lewis xi says that he had seen about   000 old books in  0 or  0 of the most celebrated libraries in and about the city of paris and has writ a treatise ex professo upon this subject in the aforementioned book chap   page     expresses himself thus but we have no book printed before      and page    he says that we must needs suppose them the first printers to have made an infinite number of proofs and maculatures before they could justify and get all their implements fitted together after which they began at length to compose not tullys offices etc but the great bible in folo which was finished anno     vide chevillier page     but for my own part i cannot suppose that faust would offer a book to sale for a written one which had such an inscription as must infallibly discover the cheat it is urged that he might print a certain number of them without this and after the discovery reprint the last sheet with this colophon at the end but this is improbable upon two accounts first he had already printed three books with inscriptions viz the psalter the rationale and the catholicon all which import particularly that they were not done with pen and ink or any writing tool but by a fine new invented art of casting letters and printing with them now since some of these must of necessity have been known in france long before this year it was impossible to have deceived them by any but the first impression unless we did suppose that he kept the three former unsold and unseen which would be most absurd to imagine but secondly it is plain that his design in selling them for mss was to reimburse himself for the vast charges which he had been at in devising this invention preparing all the necessary materials making essays etc such expenses must have reduced him above twelve years before this to the necessity of a recruit seeing he had perfected the new invention and began to print with it on or soon after the year    0 as has been fully proved nor can we in any probability suppose that he should work on for twelve whole years successively and print three editions two of which were very large without vending them especially since he is reported by most authors to have enriched himself exceedingly by this time and consequently wanted no such strategem if i could have obtained with all my endeavors any certain information of the year in which he went to paris it would have determined the dispute however if i may be allowed a conjecture since we find by the unanimous consent of writers that the art was perfected in the year    0 and no books printed in his name till anno      as yet known faust might most probably spend these seven years in printing illuminating and selling his first bible after which his new art being discovered he thought it in vain to keep it secret longer and therefore in his next book gave the world an account of his method as we find in the psalmorum codex and those that followed it what confirms my conjecture is that guttenburgh who was prosecuted by faust for the moiety of the money expended and gave a deed bearing date      for the payment pursuant to the judges determination instead of complying with it escaped to strasburgh and left his partner in the lurch this we may reasonably suppose reduced faust to such streights as obliged him to go to paris with what books he had in order to sell them to the best advantage these reasons induce me to think that it was the first and not the second bible which faust sold at such extraordinary rates the reader is at his liberty to judge as he pleases in this matter  the fifth is the tullys offices printed at mentz ann      though some editions have a later date by one and others by two years all of which are printed at mentz with the same inscription in every respect as we shall show immediately the right honorable the earl of oxford showed me this book it is a small  to and very beautifully printed and well preserved sir thomas bodley had this in his library which he presented to the university of oxford where it is still kept dr james published a catalogue of all sir thomass books entitled catalogus bibliothecae bodleianae in  to anno   0  in the     page of which book we find this tullys offices with the following inscription ejusdem liber de officiis etc an      about  0 years after this dr thomas hyde published his catalogue of all the books in the university library printed at oxford in fol ann      in which he gives the date of the book page     which is the same with the former and confirmed by antony woods history of that university printed likewise ann      page     immo anno domini      ut fert aliud exemplar in bodleiana bibliotheca  mr beughen mentions the same date in his list of the first editions moguntia in  to ann      quae postmodum sunt recusa ibidem an      in  to and romae      etc incunab typograph     and tells us that it was reprinted at mentz two years after viz ann

feliciter effeci finitum an mcccclxvi quarta die mensis sebruarii chevil p    this present noble work tullys offices was done by john fust citizen of mentz not with pen and ink etc but by a new art etc by the hands of my boy peter de gernsheim ann mcccclxvi on the fourth of february several eminent writers as i have already hinted have esteemed this the first printed book among whom is peter ramus or de la ramee royal professor of mathematics in the university of paris who had this edition in his library and affirmed it to be the first work produced by the art of printing cum primum typographiae exemplum moguntiae editum sit anno       ut constat ex ciceronis officiis quae primum omnium librorum typis aeneis impressa sunt exemplar officiorum istorum habeo in membrana impressorum p ramus schol mathem lib   in this he has been followed by our countryman anth wood in the book before quoted by pasquier in his recherches de la france lib   chapter   and by several others it is very probable that the edition of      and      may be the same the last sheet only reprinted which may be easily known by comparing them together and it were to be wished that some of the curiosos of oxford would take that trouble since they are both there as appears from ant woods list  after the finishing of this book faust is supposed to have died or lost his sight as some report or at least to have grown so rich that he left the business wholly to his soninlaw peter schoeffer who then instructed his son john in that art we find no more books printed in fausts name all the rest being in peter schoeffers some of whose inscriptions are given in the fourth chapter  i have dwelt somewhat longer upon these noble relics of our first printers because i am sensible of the great value which the curious and learned have for them  i come now to those of other but fictitious dates which it will not be improper to say something of in order to prevent the reader from being deceived or puzzled by them  among all the apocryphal editions that are to be met within any library exclusive of those which are supposed to have been printed with wooden blocks and discoursed of already in a distinct chapter that which bears the oldest date is the book of sermons de sanctis by leonard de utino john godfrey olearius lutheran minister of st marys church at hall in saxony says it is still preserved in the library of that church and dated      though there be no mention of the place where it was printed the reader will find his account of it quoted in the margin leonardus de utino ordin praedic  ejus sermonum de sanctis liber sub ipsa typographicae artis incunabula anno      impressus absque tamen loci mentione habetur in bibliotheca templi mariani nostri hall confer dn parentis halygraph appendice t t t   b sermones ejusdem quadragesimales and dominicales ann      prodierunt abac patrolog p      in his book de scriptoribus ecclesiasticis published under the title of abacus patrologicus in  vo at jena      in which he quotes the testimony of his father godfrey olearius who wrote the history of hall printed at leipsick in  to ann      chevillier observes very justly that olearius has mentioned neither the size nor printer of this ancient book and that all who have since spoken of it rely upon his testimony he thinks therefore that it ought to have been more nicely enquired into since if the date be true it entirely overturns the received opinion that this art was not perfected till the year    0 the reasons of his suspecting it is because utinus lived in italy ann      according to possevinus and can hardly be supposed to have had such credit in germany as that his sermons should be printed after a new method scarce known to above five or six persons he is therefore of opinion that the book is a manuscript or that olearius has guessed at the date or which is most likely that this is the date of the compiling not of the printing of it  mr mattaire has taken the pains to solve the greatest part of these doubts and given the following account of it jam dabo tibi lector quod in votis habuit cheviliierus unde editio tantae vetustatis specie venerabilis testimonio novo certior fiat and notior vir quidam literarum peritus  dum aquisgrani peregrinabatur ibi in regularium coenobio vidit librum supra memoratum in fol ex quo descripsit haec quae in libri

magnifice civitatis utinesis ac nobilium virorum ejusdem mccccxlvi in vigilia beatissimi patris nostri dominici ofessoris ad laudem and glam dei omnipotentis and totius curie triumphantis libri ipsius

curious and learned gentleman of his acquaintance met with a copy of it at aix la chapelle in a monastery of regular monks out of which he transcribed the following colophon printed at the end of it in english thus thus end the golden sermons upon the saints throughout the whole year compiled by master leonard de utino doctor of divinity of the order of the friars preachers at the instance and entreaty of the magnificent city of utino and the noble citizens thereof mccccxl vi on the eve of our blessed father dominick confessor to the praise and glory of almighty god and of the whole triumphant court mr mattaire adds that the characters of it are very rude and ill shaped and so full of abbreviations that they are as difficult to read as those printed at mentz ann      and    0  this makes it abundantly plain that though the book carries the abovementioned date yet it bears testimony that the compiling and not the printing of it is there intended so that not only the difficulty disappears but chevilliers conjecture is manifestly supported and mr mattaire seems entirely of this opinion and besides instances in a book or two which he has whose dates as he assures us were those of their being compiled though the obscurity of their inscription might possibly lead an unwary reader to take it for that of its impression and indeed it is an unreasonable supposition that printing could have been brought to such a degree of perfection at that time against the general testimony of writers besides neither the abbreviations nor the rudeness of the character can be a sufficient index of their antiquity seeing as he observes they continued in use among some eminent printers even beyond the year   00 in the next place i shall mention some editions whose dates are certainly proved to be wrong the first is the regula pastoris of pope gregory a copy of which is in the french kings library with this inscription supposed to be written at the end tentamentum fausti an essay of john faust ann      now it is plain from what has been said before that faust was so far from making any essays at that time that he had already printed several perfect editions mr mattaire gives us this account of it p    that he met with a book in  to in the kings library at paris without the name of either place or printer only with this title liber regulae pastoralis gregorii papae ad johannem episcopum ravenensem at the beginning of which gabriel naude had written two verses to the reader with his own hand intimating that book to have been certainly printed by faust at mentz because the mark of the paper which is the head and horns of an heifer is an infallible criterium of fausts books and an advertisement in which he confirms his assertion from the rudeness of the types the want of diphthongs and some other circumstances that favor the infancy of the art and concludes that faust would not put his name etc to it till his frequent essays had emboldened him to make himself public as he did afterward in the durands rationale of      catholicon etc  mr mattaire does indeed prove plainly enough that the rudeness of the types and want of dates names etc continued some considerable time after the discovery of the art and consequently that that could be no certain mark of its being one of fausts first essays however as nothing certain can be affirmed concerning this book we shall dwell no longer upon it i have seen aeneas sylviuss letters printed by koelhoff of lubeck which is certainly antedated for this reason several dates in the letters being ten years older than the date of the book itself there is another of his books in fol in the library of the sorbon with a false date at the end of these words flores de diversis sermonibus and epistolis b bernardi per me joan koelhoff de lubeck coloniensem civem impressi an mcccc feliciter finiunt for it is plain the art was not so much as thought of at that time nor perfected till  0 years after but what demonstrates the falseness of the date is that this john koelhoff was scarce born then since he printed the works of n gerson in   vol in fol at cologn ann      which are of the same make and character as the flores abovementioned as chevillier p  0 and    observes who therefore thinks that the following numbers lxxxii were omitted at the end of mcccc the same author mentions two or three editions more of the same nature the last of which is the manipulus curatorum of guy mout rocher with the following uncommon date at the end completus parisiis anno domini millesimo cccc vicesimo tertio amen chevil p    printed at paris in the year one thousand cccc and twenty three amen it is plain that the art was not brought to paris till the year    0 as shall be shown in its place so that the last c must have been taken up by the balls or lost some other way upon the whole it may be esteemed a general rule that all dates before the year    0 are false and this is corroborated with the suffrage of all learned writers upon this subject in the mean time as it is not reasonable to imagine that faust and schoeffer could be altogether idle from the year      in which they are supposed to have finished their first bible to      in which they published the psalter unless we can suppose that fausts lawsuit with guttenbergh and his journey and stay in france could take him up five whole years and that his ingenious son did not venture upon any work by himself if time and industry should as we may reasonably hope it may discover any more of those old and valuable monuments of the infancy of the art provided such impressions bear either a certain date or mark of their being done at mentz and by our protodaedali before the dispersion of their servants or even after that time i doubt not but the learned will allow them a proper rank in the lists which shall be published hereafter  chap x remarkable occurrences between the year    0 and the divulgation of the art though i proposed to avoid all unnecessary repetitions yet this chapter being designed as a short recapitulation of the history of the first twelve years the thread of which has been unavoidably interrupted by controversy and to introduce some material occurrences which could not properly be inserted in any other chapter or such as may have escaped the readers memory i find the impossibility of joining these notable events together without interspersing them with most of those already touched upon and this has rendered an apology before hand highly necessary  i begin with the year    0 in which it is agreed by most authors that the art was perfected in theory and practice the inventors having prepared their tools and materials and made a great number of essays thinking they might with safety attempt some considerable volume their next care was to carry on the business without danger of being discovered to this end they admitted as few servants as possible into any part of the secret and such only upon whose sidelity they might depend engaging them to the greatest secrecy by an oath this being done they allotted to them their several provinces but concealed every branch of letterfounding and composing if my authority be required since all our accounts relating to these beginnings are so obscure and imperfect i answer that this may reasonably be inferred from a remarkable passage out of the learned hen pantaleon a physician of basil part of which i have already quoted in a former chapter as far as it related to faust and schoeffers being the authors of this art the remainder of it is as follows erat enim ars illa primo abscondita and pauculis manifestata litteras enim in sacculis clausis secum in officinae ferebant ac dum abeunt auferebant donec temporis successu ars aucta atque plurimum illustrata fuit do illustribus german part   page      this art was at the first kept very secret and communicated to but very few for they faust and schoeffer tied up the types in bags which they brought into the workroom and took away when they went out till at length in process of time the business increasing caused the art to be divulged all the authors quoted by us agree with pantaleon about their keeping the art with all imaginable secrecy but scarce any have informed us of this circumstance of their carrying their types with them to and out of the workroom which would have been a vain precaution had they entrusted any but themselves in the compositors part however it is evident that the whole secret did not consist therein the cutting the punches sinking them into the matrices making the moulds and casting the letters might be still a secret to any one that had been entrusted so far as to go through all the branches of the business of printing and he must have been a person of a surprising genius who could have found out the mystery of letterfounding by barely seeing the letters therefore the keeping that part to themselves was making it a greater secret than all the oaths they could bind them with  the next remarkable occurrence is that of their admitting john guttenbergh a wealthy goldsmith into partnership with them as it is related by the last named author by salmuth and others quoted in the third chapter this gentleman finding his neighbor faust engaged in a new and advantageous invention which he wanted money to carry on and attracted by a prospect of gain offered his purse and assistance upon good terms to faust who gladly accepted the proposal but guttenbergh pursuing his own private rather than the common interest and having attained some insight into the art began to object that faust had converted some of the money to his own uses and refused the payment of his dividend of the charges till faust had obtained a decree which obliged him to pay his moiety of what the plaintiff should swear had been expended upon the common fund this he evaded by giving a bond payable some time after and escaping to strasburgh his native city before it was due but he first took care to learn as much of the art as he could to furnish himself with printingtools and to draw off some of fausts servants with him at strasburgh he communicated to john mentel or mentelin the secret and his design of setting up a printing house there however neither he nor his workmen were so thoroughly instructed in the business but they were obliged to demur a considerable time before they could perfect every thing for the work and to make many trials in order to attain the right method which is evident from this that there is no book extant with mentels name till the year      and not at all with guttenberghs for it is scarce probable that if they had printed any considerable volumes before that time they should all have perished without being so much as taken notice of by any author and especially by their learned townsman wimpheling whilst there remain so many of fausts in the writings and in the hands of the learned and curious during this time faust finding himself imposed upon by guttenbergh and disappointed of the money expected and wanting either will o power to sue him in that city where he fled formed a strategem to raise himself a fresh supply which succeeded according to his wish for he went to paris with some of his finest vellum bibles one of which was sold to the king for   0 crowns and is still to be seen in the royal library at paris a masterpiece in that kind another was bought by the archbishop of paris for  00 crowns but as people were unwilling to give so exorbitant a price he offered some of the last for  0 crowns and less in hopes to have disposed of them all before he was discovered it is not indeed to be supposed that they were all equal in the ornamental part yet the beauty of the work the elegancy of the flowerpieces initial letters etc the variety of the finest colors intermixed with gold and silver with which they were exquisitely variegated made the purchasers fond of showing them to their acquaintance as every one thought the whole world could not produce such another it is reported that the archbishop thinking his bible worth his majestys seeing carried it to him who viewed it with surprise and in return showed his own upon a stricter examination and comparing em together they found that the ornaments were not exactly the same but as to the other part supposed to be written they observed such a conformity in the number of pages lines words and even the letters as soon convinced them that they were done by some other method than transcribing besides two such bibles were the work of a mans lifetime to transcribe and upon enquiry he was found to have sold a much greater number hereupon orders was given to apprehend faustus and prosecute him as a conjurer i should have been apt to think this charge too absurd to gain belief except among the vulgar and that it was only connived at in hopes it would terrify him to a discovery of his art were it not for a passage which i have met with in mr maichels history of the paris libraries wherein he mentions a strange problem published by father bouhours a learned jesuit  whether it be possible that  german should be a wit mr maichel justly takes the part of his countrymen and proves them much wiser for the invention of printing than those stupid paris doctors who rather believed it an effect of magic than of human wit or invention de la caille relates that he fled to mentz and suspecting his safety there departed to strasburgh where he taught john mentel or mentelin his art but there is not the least probability for this assertion since he could not be safer at one place than at another and with respect to mentel it is much more probable tha he learned the invention from guttenbergh than from faust who perhaps was never at strasburgh unless he passed through it in his journey to and from france  however the parliament of paris thought fit to make an arrest in favor of him and to discharge him from all further prosecution in consideration of his noble invention and as i am credibly informed a salary was paid by that crown to fausts descendants for many years after as a reward for his sufferings and merit this was the end and success of that expedition and proved at length very advantageous to him and made some amends for the melancholy hours of his confinement and the terrors of an approaching death  faust discharged thus with honor and a large supply of money returned to mentz where being informed that his quondam partner guttenbergh was endeavoring with the assistance of mentel to set up a printing house at strasburgh and to challenge to himself the whole glory of the invention he began to consider that it was not only in vain but even dangerous to conceal himself and his art any longer from the world and it is probable resolved at last to make both as public as possibly he could in all the editions which came from his press till at least ann      or      in which he is supposed to have reprinted the last leaf of tullys offices the last book known to be printed by him during the interval between      and the taking of mentz ann      faust meeting with prodigious encouragement was obliged to increase the number of his workmen and open more of the art to them than he had done till then some of these having attained a sufficient insight into the mystery were induced to go somewhere else and set up for themselves to which they were encouraged both by the example of those who went away with guttenbergh and probably by invitations from other places which were desirous of having the art brought to them pantaleon tells us that some of those who signalized themselves the first in italy were of that number and indeed if we consider how soon they began to print in that kingdom especially rome venice etc and make a just allowance for preparing the great apparatus of a printing house with their first essays before they came to work off those volumes which are of the oldest date some of them pretty large we cannot but think that they left mentz long before it was taken faust however had a sufficient number of servants left to finish his last editions which are mentioned before after this we hear no more of him till the year      wherein peter schoeffer and one henlif a bookseller gave a book to a monastery in order to obtain the prayers of it for fausts soul by which it was apparent he was dead before that time or perhaps before    0 because schoeffer in that year printed st jeromes epistles in his own name without any mention of his master faust  here therefore i am obliged to conclude the history of that illustrious man though i should have been vastly more satisfied in communicating other particulars of his life and death could i have found em in the writers of those times but germany is not the only ungrateful country that has neglected such as have best deserved of her for the following books will furnish us with instances of this in other parts of the world i shall only observe that as it is the property of false desert to be solicitous for panegyricks and monumental records whilst true and intrinsic merit is silent and equally contemns both so whilst the dutch bestow the highest encomiums upon a suppositious and imaginary inventor the germans have been so regardless of a true and real one as to leave it entirely to his own works to transmit his praises to posterity if faust had died before the sacking of mentz we might have had grounds to suppose that some monument had been erected to his memory by his fellowcitizens and destroyed by the conqueror but as he survived those times at least six or seven years and carried on and improved the art during that interval it is impossible to entertain so favorable an opinion of the moguntines however his books and the art which he left us will more effectually and universally proclaim and perpetuate his name and memory than any monumental inscriptions etc and endear both to the learned and curious as long as the art or the world itself shall endure  there is one occurrence worthy to be mentioned which i omitted in this chapter not so much out of forgetfulness or neglect since it is an instance of fausts gratitude and generosity as because it is not easy to fix the time of it nor so likely to have happened within the compass of these ten years as of some of the former viz between    0 and    0 that is his giving his only daughter in marriage to his servant peter schoeffer admitting him into partnership and procuring him the freedom of the city of mentz as a reward for his services and the improvements which he made to the art such as the invention of punches matrices metaltypes and as some report printers ink if these discoveries are owing to him faust made him as ample amends as he could possibly i wish schoeffer had been so grateful to his generous master as to have transmitted to us a fuller account of his life and character than what we enjoy or if he performed this that time had not deprived us of so valuable a monument the want of which obliges me much against my will to bring this chapter and history to a conclusion and rest satisfied with what we have  chap xi the conclusion with an account of the ancient method of printing i am now come to the close of the first book of this history which i have endeavored to enrich with collections from dead and living authors and every thing valuable that i could procure upon this subject from many of the most curious libraries the next book will open a large and pleasant scene in the mean time i cannot conclude this better than by giving a short summary of the whole and digesting it into distinct periods that the reader may as it were at one view see the whole progress of the art and fix it more easily in his memory and by closing it with an account of the old way of printing used during the time of faust his soninlaw etc    this art was devised a considerable time before any thing done that way appeared    it is not improbable that the first hints of engraving upon woodenblocks might come from the chinese who practiced it above  00 years before it was thought of in europe    the attempts to imitate it began about the year    0 and not before    the new and more perfect method of printing with fusiletypes did not succeed it till  0 years after viz    0    this new invention was discovered by john faust in the city of mentz in the perfecting of which peter schoeffer assisted him very much and was amply rewarded by his master  john guttenbergh had no other share or merit in this discovery than by promoting it with supplies of money from time to time and that not from a principle of a public spirit but for his own interest which made him drop both the art and artist when he found it less gainful than he expected    this invention was kept with all imaginable secrecy by these three parties till guttenbergh upon a difference between them took some of their servants with him to strasburgh where he began to practice it and to teach it to john mentel the person in whose favor the strasburgh pretensions were afterward started    this contention not happening till the year      they had already printed the latin bible and perhaps privately disposed of some number of the copies seeing their dispute was about stating their accounts and balancing the charges and profits of the business    whether their first separate types were of wood or lead or any other metal they ventured to print their first essays but on one side of the page till they had found out a better ink than the common sort which they then used    it is probable from this circumstance that their first improvement upon common ink to prevent its spreading was only by charging it with a proportionable quantity of some watery gum such as gum arabic mastick etc which though it remedied that defect would not suffer the paper to be printed but upon one side but either schoeffer or his master having found out the way of making it with oil they then printed on both sides   0 they did not begin to put their names and inscriptions at the end of their books as we can yet find till the year      this they continued to do till faust either dyed or left off the business     guttenberghs name was never joined with theirs nor put to of the books which he printed after he abandoned faust     some others of fausts servants forsook him before the taking of mentz and settled some at cologn others in italy     the greatest dispersion of them was when that noble city was taken and plundered by archbishop adolph ann      so that the art became universally known throughout europe  there remains now only to give the reader an idea of the first way of printing and of what is most peculiar to it which though a subject well known by the curious may not be unacceptable to several persons to whose hands this work may chance to fall    with respect to their forms they were generally either large or small folios or at least quartos the lesser sizes were not in use    the leaves were without runningtitle directionword number of pages or divisions into paragraphs    the character itself was a rude old gothic mixed with secretary cast on purpose to imitate the handwriting of those times the words were printed so close to one another that it was difficult and tedious even to those who were used to mss and to this method and often lead the inattentive reader into mistakes    their orthography was various and often arbitrary and as for the diphthongs ae and oe they were not at all careful about them    they had very frequent abbreviations which in time grew so numerous and difficult to be understood that there was a necessity of writing a book to teach the manner of reading them    their periods were distinguished by no other points than the double and single one i e the colon and full stop just after the same manner as the reading psalms in our common prayerbooks are pointed all other punctuations being of much later invention    they used no great letters to begin a sentence or proper name of men or places    they left blanks for the places of titles initial letters and other ornaments in order to have them supplied by the illuminators whose ingenious art though in vogue before and at that time yet did not long survive the masterly improvements made by the printers in this branch of their art those ornaments were exquisitely fine and curiously variegated with the most beautiful colors and even with gold and silver the margins likewise were frequently charged with variety of figures of saints birds beasts monsters flowers etc which had sometimes relation to the contents of the page though mostly none at all these embellishments were very costly but for those that could not afford a round price there were others done after a more ordinary manner and at much cheaper rates    the names of the printer place etc were either wholly neglected or put at the end of the book not without some pious ejaculation or doxology   0 the date was likewise omitted or involved in some crampt circumstantial period or else printed either at full length or by numerical letters and sometimes partly one and partly the other thus one thousand cccc and sixty etc but all of them at the end of the book     there was no variety of characters no intermixture of roman and italick which were of later invention but their pages were continued in a gothic letter of the same size throughout     their rubricks which were very frequent and added no small beauty to the pages were sometimes done by the same hands as the initial letters     whenever they met with any greek they either left a blank for it to be afterward filled up by writing if the passage was long or if short consisting only of three or four words they got it cut on wood though after such a rude and illshapd manner that it required some pause to be read     the quotations of the places out of which they were taken were very often neglected both in manuscripts and printed books which caused the curious no small trouble to find them out     they had seldom dedicatory or prefatory epistles and when they began afterward to retail them in their impressions they generally placed em at the end of the work a piece of justice as much neglected as wanting in our age     they collected no table of contents no index nor summary which are indubitably a great help to the reader nor any erratas at the end for what faults were in their editions were rather owing to the manuscripts which they printed after than to the carelessness of the printer     they printed but few copies at once for  00 or  00 were then esteemed a large impression though upon the encouragements received from the learned they increased their numbers in proportion     lastly if i may be allowed this article they were not solicitous to obtain privileges and patents for the sole printing of any particular volume though toward the later end of fausts time several of his servants set up printinghouses and were ambitious to excel their master how soon after those privileges began appears from that granted by the emperor to john schoeffer fausts grandson ann      for the sole printing t livius and to prohibit any other to reprint those books which had come from his press and as this had been granted upon the account of his being the grandson of the first inventor of the art so several popes and princes gave like patents to their first printers as a mark of their favor  i shall here mention something concerning their way of bookbinding an account of which we find in scaliger scaligeriana hag edit in  vo p      who tells us that his grandmother had a printed psalter the cover of which was two inches thick in the inside was a kind of cupboard wherein was a small silver crucifix and behind it the name of berenica codronia de la scala this book seems to have been printed with wood but probably bound like the rest  as to the prices of their books i cannot find any thing particular except what i have before quoted out of campanuss dedication to the pope from which it may be inferred that in his time at rome they were sold for about one fifth part of what the mss had done to this i shall add an instance of the gift bequeathed by p schoeffer and conrad henlif of the same profession to a library of monks which will enable us to guess at the great rate they still were sold for la caille relates it out of the annals of the abbey of st victor at paris and it is as follows anniversarium honorabilium virorum petri schoeffer and conrdi helf ac joan fust civium de moguntia impressorum necnon uxorum filiorum parentum amicorum and benefactorum qui petrus and conradus dederunt nobis epistolas beati hieronymi impressas in pergameno excepta tamen summa duodecim scutorum auri quam praefati impressores receperunt per manus domini joannis abbatis hujus ecclesiae  kalend november ann      de la caille page     the anniversary office for the souls of the honorable peter schoeffer conr henlif and john faust citizens and printers in the city of mentz as also for the souls of their wives parents children friends and benefactors which said p schoeffer and c henlif have given us the book of st jeromes epistles printed upon vellum in two vol fol ann    0 excepting nevertheless the sum of twelve golden crowns which the aforesaid printers received from our lord john abbot of this church oct          hence it is plain that the twelve crowns which in those days were more than equivalent to as many pounds now were but part of the price or value of the said book and that the other part whatever proportion it bore to this was remitted to them in consideration of this anniversary office to which there used to be no price fixed though the least for it was generally five or six crowns  i conclude this chapter with an observation of mons de la monoye concerning the phrase of libri editi which i hope the curious will be pleased with he tells us that this phrase was used before the invention of printing and signified only books published and dispersed abroad in some considerable number in opposition to those that were writ fair to be set up in libraries which were called libri scripti this observation he proves from a passage out of philelphus who speaking of his ten books of latin odes expresses himself as follows carminum libri editi quinque versuum quinque millibus nam alteri quinque qui tantundem versus complectentur partim scripti sunt non editi partim ne scripti quidem i e five books of the latin odes are already published containing  000 verses the other five which will contain the same number are partly written not published and partly still unwritten he observes further that the first five books of odes were not sent to the press till the year      when they were printed in  to at brescia besides the same philelphus tells his reader in one of his epistles written ann      that he designed to publish all the ten books in that year libros december hoc anno edere institui which could not be understood of printing seeing though the art was perfected about this time yet it was still kept secret till four years after when faust put his first colophon to the psalter whether this observation be as certain as it is curious i shall leave to the judgment of my readers  chap xi an account of the first printed bibles before the year   0  as those authors who have wrote any thing fully upon the subject of pinting have given their readers an account of the first bies  have been printed from the discovery of the art to the year    or even beyond i thought our english readers would not be displeased to have a short abstract given them of those ancient and valuable monuments of the art and i cannot but think it will be more acceptable to have them all in one view than dispersed as they would be were i to give them under their respective printers who lived at a vast distance of time and place from one another especially considering that some famous cities and even universities as that of louvain have not printed so much as one single bible in all the interval between the year    0 and   00 and even beyond whereas others for instance that of nurembergh has produced at least    in that time i shall place them according to the years in which they were printed and add such farther particulars concerning them as i have been able to meet with in those authors who have given us an account of them and such as my own observations have enabled me to collect from those noble libraries i have formerly mentioned  by this the reader will be sufficiently apprisd that i intend to speak only of those which bear any certain date but as for those which are either printed without date or with a disputed one i shall just say so much of them as will let him see how little they are to be relied on and what reasons i have to pass them by i have i think already ventured to give the reader a rule how to judge of such works viz if their dates are before the year    0 they must be supposed to have been wrong printed either designedly or by mistake the reader will find proofs sufficient of the former in our next book and the later is too well known to require any however in this later respect i shall give him an instance or two of it because it will be a kind of a key to rectify any other that may hereafter fall in his way  we meet with an account of a german bible still kept in the library of the city of ausburgh affirmed by hottinger who saw it there to have been printed with fusile types ann      but with this caveat however ni fallor if i am not mistaken as writing at some distance of time and place other authors have given it that of      but as either of them preceded the time of the invention malinkrot tells us that martin zeiler thought it twas only a manuscript version made ann      but mr beugben does not scruple to tell us in the preliminary discourse to his incunabula typographiae that they only misplaced the two last figures of the date and printed      instead of      chevillier mentions two more out of lipenius whose dates are demonstrably false the one is a bible printed at paris ann      and the other at lions ann      whereas it is certain that printing was not brought to paris till twenty seven years after the date of the first viz ann    0 nor to lions till six or seven years after that the same may be said of another printed at basil and affirmed by two booksellers of geneva in the catalogue of their books to bear date      since it is plain that that city did not receive the art till about      if the reader therefore will take this rule with him to examine the time in which the art was brought to any place which he will find in the following book he will easily rectify any wrong date that may come in his way and as for those which do not mention the place or printers name he may safely rank them amongst the apocryphal ones and them which have no date at all but as the former have been taken notice of by all our annalists i shall be obliged so far as i am able to ascertain their respective dates as we go along    before i come to speak of those which bear a certain and indisputable date i must not omit the first printed by faust and schoeffer about    0 or soon after and mentioned by trithemius the colognian chronicle and some other authors as the first considerable work printed with fusile types by those two protodaedali i have already given the reasons of its being printed without date or colophon which would have betrayed the discovery of their new art and prevented fausts selling it for ms but this however ought by no means to hinder us from giving it the first rank seeing the fact is so undeniably attested it is pity they have been long ago either destroyed or buried in some private libraries where the most diligent searches have not as yet been able to find them out perhaps its being printed so like ms may be one reason why they are still looked upon as such by the owners if any such there be for which reason i am still willing to hope that time may discover and bring some of them to light and that what has been said in this history and by authors of a much higher character will spur up some curious persons to make a more diligent search after so valuable a monument till when no farther account can be expected of it than what we have already given    the next is that which i have ventured after other authors to call the second impression of the bible printed at mentz by the same worthy inventors ann      and which is consequently the most ancient we know extant in any library we have already given some account of it in a former chapter p    and of the colophon printed at the end of it which we need not therefore repeat here as there are several copies of it here in london where i have seen them and elsewhere in england we need not go to any foreign authors for an account of it it is printed in fol as indeed all their other works were for though i have followed peter lambecks notion of the psalters being printed in  to because its size may be very much like that of a quarto yet if i may here venture to give my judgment of a book i have not seen i think i have sufficient grounds to believe that the first printers had their paper made of all sizes and that the five books printed on blocks of wood already mentioned to be in the earl of pembrokes library would appear to any one like quartos were it not that the signatures show the contrary  the next impression we meet with is one which mr mattaire gives us upon the authority of a learned friend of his who desires to have his name concealed and the want of whose date is supplied by a colophon of three latin verses importing that it was printed in the third year of lewis xi reign i e ann      by the three german partners who brought the art to paris though there be no mention made of the place where it was printed vid annal typogr p    and  0 i am persuaded that mr mattaires friend was mistaken in the first verse and i should not have given it a rank here nor even mentioned it were it not to prevent the readers being puzzled with this account of it under the year      or his supposing me guilty of an omission but as chevillier gives us the same colophon printed at the end of the first paris bible by the same three partners with this variation however from the former that in the first verse instead of semi lustrum it has tribus lustris that is instead of the third it imports the thirteenth year of that kings reign we may easily suppose that it was the first paris bible of      and that this unknown gentleman might possibly be mistaken however the book being in queenscollege library in cambridge it may be easily consulted    the next impression therefore to that of mentz      is that of ausburgh in latin augusta vindelicorum printed by john bemler ann      in latin fol it is mentioned by martin crusius melchior adamus and after them by malinkrot chevillier seems indeed to think their testimony insufficient to ascertain so old a date but i cannot see any reason for it seeing it is four years more recent than the taking of the city of mentz and the dispersion of fausts servants besides the city of ausburgh was so near mentz and so considerable withal that it is no way improbable but some one of them might go and settle there even sooner than the year         the latin bible fol printed at reutlingen reutlingae a small town in germany in the duchy of wirtembergh ann      mentioned by hallevordius father le long de la caille chevillier and others but more particularly by john saubert in his catalogue of the norican or nurembergh library where he saw it the printer of it was john de averbach we have nothing else extant of him at least with his name    the latin bible fol printed about      mar    at rome by conrard sweynbeym and arnold pannariz or pararaiz as i have seen it printed in one of their books who were the first printers that settled in that city it has a preface and at the end four latin distichs in praise of those two germans and a small work or history of aristeas and is translated by matthias palmerius the printers tell pope sextus iv in the lists which they gave him of their works that they had printed     copies of it concerning this bible spondaeus gives us the following account we have says he the bible printed at rome in two very large volumes ingentibus voluminibus ann      in the house of the maximis by two germans named conrard sweynheym and arnold pannartz    the italian bible translated by nicholaus malherbis in italian malermi a venetian abbot of the order of the calmaldules printed at venice ann      calend aug in fol by vindelin de spire who with his brother john was the first who brought the art of printing unto that city chevillier tells us he has seen it in the library of the mazarinecollege at paris in two volumes and that though the imprimatur does not mention the printer yet it is easy to guess at him by the italian verses which squazafica has put to that edition    mr mattaire mentions another fol italian bible printed in the same year      of malhermis translation without printer or places name father le long is the author he has taken it from    the latin bible reprinted at mentz by peter schoeffer ann      on the eve of st matthias the apostle fol the learned walton editor of our english edition of the polyglot thought this the first impression of the bible and

without printer or places name or both because such were only the wretched performances of a few who made it their business to reprint the editions of some of the most famous printers of europe whether of the bible or of any other considerable work and to vend them underhand for the right ones this was an abuse which began very early to be complained of for no sooner had a froben badius aldus or any other great printer published a work which had cost him infinite pains to correct as well as great sums of money to purchase the best manuscripts but they pyrated them in such a shameful and incorrect manner that they could afford to sell them for less than half the price and as there wanted not sordid persons to encourage this vile practice and to prefer those maimed performances to the more correct ones if they could but save money by them it often proved that the sale of a valuable edition was hindered to the great loss and discouragement of the printer whilst the bad ones went off with ease this occasioned them to complain of the abuse in their prefaces to their works and to appeal to the learned against such practices some of whom in particular erasmus did not fail to write very sharply against those enemies to learning who were at length come up to such a degree of impudence as to counterfeit the names marks and rebuss of the famous printers of which we shall have occasion to give an account hereafter in the mean time all their complaints and efforts proving ineffectual toward the suppressing such pyracies they were forced to have recourse to the higher powers and to employ the assistance of their learned patrons to obtain them patents and privileges for the sole printing of those works upon which they had bestowed so much pains and cost but this more properly belongs to the next book to which i am now hastening  book ii the history of the dispersion progress and improvements of printing from      to    0 the introduction hitherto we have seen the art of printing kept with the utmost secrecy by its inventors and confined to the city of mentz till the fatal year of its being taken plundered and deprived of all its former rights and franchises as we have hinted already which occasioned the dispersion of the greatest part of fausts servants whom we must suppose by that time to have been very numerous these seeing the deplorable condition to which that noble city was reduced and the difficulty of carrying on the business any longer with that freedom and encouragement they had till then enjoyed and being perhaps inclined enough of themselves to leave their masters to go settle in some of the most famous cities of europe where they were sure to gain not only wealth and honor but the friendship of the learned immediately dispersed themselves and settled some in the neighboring cities of cologn and ausburgh others went to rome venice paris etc where they soon met with all the encouragement they could wish this happened as we have hinted in the former book in the year      so that faust and schoeffer had happily concealed the art from the rest of the world at least the space of twelve years from the time of its being perfected we must however except one of his servants viz nic jenson who if the date of his first book be true and genuine must have given his master the slip before that fatal period since we find this book finished at venice an      with great advantage and improvement we shall have occasion to enquire further into this man and his work in the sequel of this book however if we except this one single work we dont find any footsteps of the infant art being carried out of its nurses arms duing those twelve years  but now we must consider it in a different view dispersing it self over diverse nations patronized by popes and kings and esteemed a divine blessing to mankind it seems now to have left the city of mentz where it yet shines there brighter than ever and at the same instant discovers it self at rome venice oxford and paris and in a space shorter than can be imagined becomes conspicuous over all europe  as there is so great a number and variety of events and remarkable occurrences which happened in several cities of europe at the same time or immediately after one another with respect to the first printers who settled there the improvements made by them and the encouragement they received it will be absolutely impossible to dispose them in such an order as may give the reader at once a full view of them all without interrupting the series either with respect to time or place thus for instance while we show the transactions at rome during the two or three first years venice paris oxford cologn milan etc will open new scenes to our view attracting our eyes toward them and oblige us to break the thread of one to begin with that of another which continual diversions would rather confound than instruct the reader and render the history confused and tedious our best annalists and historians being sensible of this have followed a better method father orlandi in particular the latest that has wrote upon this subject has taken that of de la caille who proceeds with every city by it self from the time it is supposed to have received the art to the end of the century according to their fairest claim to priority in point of time and then goes on with the next in order this method i have chose and given under the head of each city the names character and merit of each printer that has wrought there from the time of its receiving the art to the end of the year   00 and pointed out the excellencies of those who have been eminent in this art either by the beauty of their types the elegance and correctness of their works the number of their editions or any improvements which they made by this means i hope the reader will clearly see the early progress of printing in every place if not at one view yet at least in such an order as more easily to form an idea not only of the printers and cities wherein they resided but likewise of the most considerable patrons for wealth learning etc of that time to whose character and merit i have not failed to do justice throughout this whole work  i proposed at first to have closed this history with the fifteenth century but when i came to consider that the most eminent printers to whom we owe many important improvements of this art such as aldus at venice amerbach and froben at basil badius at lions and paris with many others did not begin to appear upon this stage till almost the close of it and that their merit was not discovered till the beginning of the next i thought it an unpardonable injustice to them and my readers to curtail their history by too scrupulously adhering to my proposed epoch and therefore have chosen to continue this history twenty years longer i e to    0 and sometimes made an excursion beyond that time when ever any of those excellent masters have outlived it this has afforded me another agreeable opportunity viz of mentioning some others who did not enter the province of printing till after the fifteenth century  another motive which induced me to continue this history  0 years longer was that i found all the improvements that had been made to the art were made by that time i e by the year    0 at least the foundation of them was so far laid before that year that whatever has been done since either with relation to the beauty of letter elegancy of impression variety of types printing in different languages especially in the eastern ones in different columns correctness and the like all these and many more had already been carried on to such a perfection before this time that it admitted but of small improvements to be made to it afterward i have therefore thought it a much better period to close this history with than that of   00 where orlandi concludes his this has given me an opportunity of mentioning not only the improvements themselves but likewise those glorious printers to whom we owe them however as it would swell this book too much to insert the names of all the printers that appeared within those  0 years they being too numerous and a great many of them deserving rather to be remembered with shame than honor i have resolved to speak only of those who signalized themselves either for some improvements they made to the art the beauty and correctness of their editions or any other merit they have been conspicuous for it is for that reason i have chosen to speak of them in a chapter by it self after i have closed the   th century to which i shall also add in another chapter an account of the abuses which crept into the art from its promulgation to    0 that there may be nothing wanting to make this history as complete and instructing as possible  it will be necessary to acquaint the reader that though we have followed the method of the best annalists in settling the priority of every city according to the date of the oldest extant work that was printed there which is certainly the surest way and least liable to mistakes yet it is more than probable that they might receive the art much sooner seeing some time must reasonably be allowed for setting up a printing house and furnishing it with the necessary apparatus which in the infancy of the art was more difficult to procure for want of proper workmen acquainted with all the branches of such a tedious work for which less than a year or two could scarce suffice and because we are not absolutely sure that those editions which we give for their first were really so mr mattaire who has taken such pains to search the best libraries of london oxford paris etc for those old monuments that he thought he had exhausted that subject has nevertheless post dated the claim and rank of several cities by some years if orlandi may be credited who afterward rectified them by the discovery of some older editions and who can tell what time may produce that may wholly invert our present order thus for instance some of the historians quoted in the last book tell us that strasburgh cologn francford etc received the art before any others yet as we have none of their works extant but such as were printed some years after we have been obliged to give them a lower rank and place them after rome paris venice etc the reader may easily remember that guttenbergh left mentz and settled at strasburgh some years before the taking of the former i e before ann      and that he taught john mentel the art in the latter yet we meet with no edition done there of older date than      viz the decretum gratiani printed by henry egestein though cologn received some of fausts fugitive servants soon after his rupture with guttenbergh yet the oldest edition there as yet known is the works of pope leo i printed    0 what became of those impressions before that time is scarce worth our enquiring since the best of those which have been since published are far inferior to those done in italy france etc in beauty of character elegancy of composition correctness and choice of mss to print after while themselves proved indolent enough to neglect those improvements even after they had been made in other countries  however it is probable they might have sufficient business in printing small books of devotion lives of saints and legends which according to the taste of those times and of that nation in particular were eagerly bought up and thumbd over till scarce a leaf was left while the men of learning and politeness were more curious in laying up such only as were a credit not only to the author and printer but to the art it self but however that be i hope what i have said will sufficiently convince the reader how cautious we should be in fixing the epochas and consequently the rank and claims of every city in this respect since we know not but the next diligent searcher may find matter enough to give this order a new turn  i have shown in the close of the last book to what a degree of perfection the art of printing was advanced even before the year      and given there some account of that noble edition of nich jenson which is supposed to be done ann      with the encomium which mr mattaire to whom we are beholden for the first account of it about eight years ago gives to that masterpiece of the art since which i saw it at the earl of pembrokes what seems strange in that printer is that from the time of this date      to      not one of his impressions is to be met with so that neither their beauty nor the esteem which they merited among the curious have been able to preserve them unless they are still latent in some libraries till some accident brings them to light as happened to the decor puellarum it is unreasonable to suppose that a man who could in so short a time improve the art to a degree equal to the best printers of the next age and published so many excellent volumes from    0 to    0 should have continued idle for nine or ten years  for this reason many learned persons are of opinion that the date of the book is wrong printed and that one of the xs was either carelessly or wilfully omitted or taken up by the balls but mr mattaire will by no means allow this supposition and gives his reasons against it but though i am partly of his opinion yet there are two reasons that induce me to differ from father orlandi in allowing the preference to venice before these last mentioned cities the first is that this impression of the decor puellarum does not mention the place where it was done and therefore might as well have been printed in any other place as at venice our annalists give no other reason for its being done there rather than any where else but that jenson is found ten years after the date of it flourishing in that city for the space of another ten years but how to fill the chasm of the first ten is what they are at a great loss as we shall see by and by my second reason is that had this book been really printed at venice ann      it would have been absurd for the two spires who did not settle the till about ann      to ve taken upon them in their first colophon the title of the first persons who taught the city of venice the art of printing or if they had i doubt not but jenson would have taken care to have confuted such an assumption in some of his own works which he never did allowing therefore the date of this work to be genuine yet it would be too presumptive to build the claim of that city upon a book which for ought appears was not printed there  i have ven urd to say so much concerning this impression in this introduction because of its being dated one year before the time our second book begins so that it could not so properly be brought into the book itself without antedating of it by that one year for the sake of one impression before mr mattaire gave us an account of it in his annal typogr most authors gave the city of rome the preference to that of venice by at least   or   years and with respect to the latter the two spires were allowed to have been the first printers there according to the verses that are at the end of their first works this impression therefore does at most prove jenson to have began to print some where before those two brothers were settled at venice what discoveries may be made hereafter which may perhaps invert the present order is what i am not concerned about at present my business is to settle it now according to the best light i have been able to get i hope the reader will excuse me if the respect which i bear to those noble cities who gave the first encouragement to this infant art has made me somewhat prolix and what he may perhaps call over curious in settling this point of precedence for since it may be so easily settled and adjusted from authentic records it would have been an unpardonable omission in me to have neglected it seeing every one of those cities do still value themselves upon their rank and have taken all possible pains to find out all the old monuments that would both support and advance their respective claims  i know that some annalists in order to fill up the chasm of nine years have supposed that jenson went from venice to paris where he taught the art of printing and set up some presses and instructed several who became eminent printers but this is improbable on many accounts   because there are none of his works done at paris   because his character is much finer than any used in france by the first printers there   because he would have met with such encouragement there especially considering it was his native country that there had been no occasion to return to venice lastly because if he had taught so many skilful workmen in the art of which himself was then by far the greatest master it would have been unnecessary to send for the three partners out of germany who did not however come to that city till about the year      that is six or seven years after his supposed coming thither to this we may add that upon this supposition the art must have been brought to paris several years sooner than the most authentic records and the best writers allow which seems as improbable as it is difficult to assign a place where jenson printed this work from all which allowing the date of the decor puellarum as no place is mentioned where it was printed we are obliged for the reasons before mentioned to give the preference to rome  chap i the city of mentz monastery of subiaco and the city of ausburgh    faust and schoeffer continue to print at mentz after the dispersion of most of their servants and the taking of that city if those cities which gave the earliest invitations and encouragements to the art of printing do so justly merit to be recorded in their respective ranks that of mentz certainly deserves to be placed at the head of them upon two accounts   because it was the mother and inventress of it and   because it still continued to promote and cherish it after it had been reduced to a foreign yoke in the first book we considered her in the former view whilst she was the only one in the world that engrossed both the art and artists to herself but the conquerors sword was the occasion of its being dispersed through the most eminent cities of europe till this time the best of fausts servants being tied by an oath of secrecy and perhaps by some more powerful engagement had not dared to forsake their master and if some few had ventured to break through their engagements yet were they still so imperfectly acquainted with the art that they never performed any work that could abide the test of time if we except n jensons but now as the city was deprived of its freedom and privileges it abolished the difference between master and servant citizen and foreigner they began to look upon themselves as free from all former ties and at liberty to accept of the invitations which they received from england italy france etc so that in the space of very few years there was scarce a metropolis or considerable city where there was not one or more printinghouses set up several monasteries likewise began to entertain those fugitives very early as we shall show anon and wherever any of those workmen chanced to settle themselves they did not fail of meeting with all the assistance and encouragement which the most eminent men either for power or learning could give them however as they cannot be supposed to have been all men of equal capacity and industry so we need not wonder if they did not signalize themselves every where alike but whilst one sort of them did in a short space improve the art to a very considerable degree others of a more sluggish nature contented themselves with going on in their old way and some of them even from bad to worse  we need not doubt but that faust and schoeffer during this sad interval were as much courted by other nations to leave mentz and betake themselves to a place of greater tranquillity and in a more flourishing state but their love to their native city which had favored them so much in its prosperity prevailed upon them to continue there and to carry on their business as before this is apparent from the list of their works given in the first book and the edition of the great bible which they printed in this very year with that of tullys offices three years after gives ground to suppose that the merit of this invention procured them some particular regard and privilege from archbishop adolph as soon as it became known to him which might induce them to go on with the business as they had done formerly however if they printed nothing between the year      and      as we dont as yet find that they did we may reasonably suppose that the confusion in which the city then was might obstruct it for that time since we dont find such a length of time between any of their other works the truth is we have very few or no particulars concerning them except what we have given in the first book wherein i endeavored as well as i could to trace fausts history to the end of his life all that we can add concerning peter schoeffer is that he continued printing several considerable volumes till the year      which he then subscribed with his own name and to some of which toward the latter end of his life he added his coat of arms which might in all probability have been given to him either by the archbishop or some crowned head accordingly we find these words added to his colophons suis consignando scutis that they were marked with his own arms he left a son john schoeffer who became likewise an excellent printer at mentz but he must in all likelihood have been very young when his father died seeing we find nothing printed by him till ann   0  when he acquainted his readers in the colophons to his first impressions that he was the son of peter schoeffer and grandson to j faust etc the first inventors of the art and that himself was an excellent master of it and an eminent citizen primarius civis of the metropolis of mentz but as this is beyond my proposed epoch i shall say no more of him  i dont find any other printer in the city of mentz during peter schoeffers life about    0 we meet with one single work of no great consequence done there by one erhard rewick and between the year    0 and   00 there are about fifteen impressions printed there without any printers name and therefore are supposed to have been done by some of fausts servants who dared not put their names to them whilst schoeffer and his son lived  though i do not design to swell the following book with a list of the works done in every city it having been done by the indefatigable mr mattaire and father orlandi but only to give my readers an account of the most eminent printers that have signalized themselves in any of them with the names and dates of the less considerable ones yet i hope the reader will forgive me if my respect for p schoeffer whose works are so much valued by the curious as well for their antiquity as for their elegance correctness and those ornaments which he still caused the illuminators to bestow on them to the last induces me to subjoin a list of them they are as follows with their colophons    the edition of tho aquinass secunda secundae printed in fol ann      with an inscription at the end to this purpose hoc opus praeclarum secunda secundae alma in urbe moguntina inclitae nationis germanicae quam dei clementia alti ingenii lumine donoque gratuito caeteris terrarum nationibus praeferre illustrareque dignatus est artificiola quadam adinventione imprimendi seu characterizandi absque ulla calami exaratione sic effigiatum and ad eusebiam dei industria est consummatum per petrum schoiffer de gernsheim anno domini m cccc lx vii die sexto mensis martii  this noble work entitled secunda secundae was finished in the famous city of mentz in germany which nation the divine goodness has vouchsafed to signalize with superior gifts to all other nations of the earth by a new invented art of printing etc without the help of any writing instrument etc for the service of god by peter schoiffer de gernsheim ann dom      on the sixth day of march in this he has altered one letter of his surname viz the first e into an i in the next he changed the i into a y according to mr mattaires list who likewise justly censures his latin syntax in writing dei clementia dignatus est though this hinders not his being a correct printer as well as tolerable good clerk for those times    the next is the institutiones juris imper justinian cum glossa in fol ann      the colophon is much to the same purpose with the former in which he is very liberal of his incense to mentz and the whole german nation it is superfluous to give a translation of it but the original may be seen in the margin praesens institutionum praeclarum opus alma in

have now done with the city of mentz whose fame in this respect seems to have been entirely confined to fausts family and that no further than to his grandson john schoeffer seeing nothing considerable was ever printed there by any other person except the travels of bernard bredembach dean of mentz into the holy land ann      by one erhard rewick a native of utrecht whom we have just mentioned it is now time to come to those places which showed the earliest specimens of this art and to give the best account we have of them     the monastery of subiaco the next place that we know of which signalized it self in the art of printing is the monastery of subiaco in latin monasterum sublacense in the territories of campania in the kingdom of naples and subject to the pope the monks of which are of the benedictin order and very rich having the lordship of no less than fourteen castles here the art was introduced so soon that in the year      there was published an edition of lactantiuss institutions in fol so correct and elegant and in such a beautiful roman character that nothing seems wanting but the name of the printer what is still more surprising is that lactantiuss quotations from the greek authors are printed in a very neat greek letter and extremely like that which the first printers of rome conrard sweynheym and arnold pannartz became noted for this induced father orlandi to think it was one of the first essays which those two germans made in that convent before they went to rome but this can by no means be allowed because though the character be like theirs yet it appears by the eight first impressions which they printed at rome that they had no greek alphabet till four or five years after the date of this impression as we shall see in the next chapter the following colophon is at the end of it  in the year of our lord mcccclxv and the second year of the pontificate of pope paul ii in the xiii indiction and on the last day but one of the month of october in the venerable monastery of subiaco this scarce and curious edition is mentioned by montfaucon in his diarium italicum p     and seq who has given it an earlier date viz      but the mistake arises from the last figures being imperfectly printed we know nothing of any other impression which came from that monasterys press     the city of ausburgh the next is the city of ausburgh in latin augusta one of the most opulent of the imperial cities in germany in which the learned john bemler set up a printingpress about the year      the only two books that are known to be printed by him are the latin bible in fol with this inscription  er joh bemler augustae vindelic ann      and his translation of joh nach s summa praecipuorum capitum fidei christianae out of latin into high dutch printed ann      whether he printed any books during that six years interval or was employed wholly in translating this last work is difficult to determine as well as whether he published any thing after      however there were five other eminent persons in that city who though they did not begin so soon as he yet printed diverse learned works most of them being either citizens or natives of ausburgh might in all probability learn the art from him  as we have little or nothing particular concerning them except their impressions we shall content our selves with giving their names character and the time in which they printed as far as we can discover it by their known works  after the above named john bemler came    john shusler citizen of ausburgh a very good printer but whose works reach only from ann      to         gonter zainer de reutlingen who printed from ann      to      we have but eight of his impressions    ant sorgius citizen of ausburgh from      to      we have but four of his editions    erhard raldolt of ausburgh who after having printed some works at venice with his partner bernard pictor till the year      or beyond returned to his own native city and there set up a press about or before the year      and continued printing till    0 if not beyond however he was a very diligent printer for those times seeing he printed in that short space seven books in latin    the last we find in this city is john schensperger who printed a chronical work in latin with cutts fol ann      but whether any besides that is not as yet known  we find likewise two or three dutch books printed here without printers name and of no great consequence  chap ii   the first printers at rome their patrons and correctors books printed by them etc their petition to the pope   the city of tours        the town of reutlingen      soon after ausburgh had received the art of printing it was brought to rome by two germans conrard sweynheim and arnold pannarts who set up a printing house there anno      the second year of the pontificate of paul ii under the patronage of john andreas bishop of aleria who was the popes library keeper justly famed for his learning and generosity these printers assisted with that prelates purse did immediately prepare an elegant round roman character and a sufficient quantity of the finest paper they invented likewise such variety of spaces as kept a beautiful distance between the words and made their impressions appear with the greatest neatness and exactness their margins were broad and not only added a grace to the pages but rendered them likewise convenient for the writing of notes etc and their ink was so excellent that it still looks as fresh as if newly printed in short they were persons who valued their credit and the honor of pleasing their patron more than riches and spared neither cost nor labor in order to make their impressions as beautiful and correct as possible which any one that has seen them will own with pleasure  i doubt not but the great acquaintance amongst the learned which their noble patrons friendship procured them might be a great means of their improving the art to such a degree seeing such persons were best able to discover the faults and inconveniences of the first printed books which these germans might more easily rectify when they became acquainted with them these two partners settled themselves in the house of peter and francis de maximis brothers and roman knights where the bishop of aleria not only furnished them with the most valuable manuscripts out of the vatican and other libraties but also prepared them himself corrected their proofs and prefixed prefaces and dedications to their works in order to recommend them the more to the learned world this laborious task was followed by him with such application that he scarce allowed himself time to sleep what a value this great bishop had both for the art and these two great masters of it appears from his dedication to pope paul ii prefixed to the edition of st jeromes epistles which i shall now give the english reader a translation of it was says he in your days that among many other divine favors this blessing was bestowed on the christian world that every poor scholar can purchase for himself a library for a small sum  that those volumes which heretofore could scarce be bought for an hundred crowns may now be procured for less than twenty very well printed and free from those faults with which manuscripts used to abound  for such is the art of our printers and lettermakers that no ancient or modern discovery is comparable to it surely the german nation deserves our highest esteem for the invention of the most useful arts the wish of the noble and divine cardinal cusa is now  in your time accomplished who earnestly desired that this sacred art which then seemed rising in germany might be brought to rome your pontificate glorious in every respect will be as immortal as learning it self in which this art was brought and laid at your holinesss feet  it is my chief aim in this epistle to let posterity know that the art of printing and typemaking was brought to rome under paul ii this blessing was certainly conferred on us by our heavenly shepherd that a book is now purchased for less than a binding formerly receive then great generous and glorious pontif the first volume of st jerome graciously  and take the excellent masters of this art conrard sweynheym and arnold pannarts germans under your protection etc  thus were these two printers caressed and encouraged by most of the men of letters and fortune at rome and even by the pope himself who frequently visited their printing house and examined with admiration every branch of this new art which seemed designed to recover learning and restore that city to its ancient luster this excited them to approve themselves worthy of all that esteem which was showed them by publishing a vast number of elegant impressions some of which were so large that they could not be done without great labor and charges as will be evident from the list of their works which they presented to the pope of which we shall give an account in its proper place  what their first impression was whether ciceros familiar epistles or st austins book de civitate dei is what authors can by no means agree about that the former was printed at rome ann      with a latin epigram at the end of which their names are at full length and on the following year a new edition of st austins book anno igitur eodem      opus augustini de civitate dei eruditissimum epistolas hieronymi disertissimas cum luminibus orationis tum viribus argumentorum instructas vulgaverunt  anno superiore tullianas dederant epistolas hoc dant hieronymianas etc annal typograph p    is plain beyond contradiction the dispute therefore seems to be about an edition of it older by a year in which the printer without either naming himself or the place in which it was done contents himself with this colophon in latin mcccclxvii in the third year of pope paul ii etc from which last words and the likeness of the character with the lactantius printed at subiaco and their first impressions at rome they venture to affirm it to have been printed by them without deciding whether at rome or any where else orlandi the last writer upon the subject speaks of it as follows p    egli e ancora certissimo che il primo libro il quale usci dalle stamp di roma e sempre stato creduto dagli autori il sant agostino de cvitate deo il quale se been non addita il luogo ove stampato ne il nome degl impressori tutta volta e di carettere tondo romano stampato nel anno terzo di papa paolo ii e nel millesimo      come si leg in detto libro orleand origin della stamp page     it is certain that the first work that came out of their press has been universally believed by authors to be st austins book de civitate dei and though it mentions neither the name of the place or of the printer yet being printed in a round roman character and in the third year of paul ii ann      as may be seen at the end of the said book it cannot but have been done by them but i think i have two material objections against it the first is that if they had printed it at rome they would not have omitted it in their list to the pope and if at subiaco or any where else i cannot see how they could print the cicero at rome in the same year secondly though the likeness of the character seems to carry some proof and inclined him to believe the edition of subiaco to have been also done by them yet it is evident by what we hinted in the introduction that they were so far from being furnished with a greek alphabet that their first works have all the greek done upon wood in a very inelegant manner and that whenever the quotation was above three or four words they left a blank space to be filled afterward with the pen whereas this of lactantius has all the greek quotations printed in a beautiful cast letter and therefore though we may allow this edition and that disputed one of st austins to have been done by the same hand yet it is plain it could not be done by those two germans if we can believe them they will tell us that they began their first trial with a less considerable work viz donatuss grammar of which they printed only  00 copies this is plain both by their putting it at the head of their list and by their prefacing it with the words  unde imprimendi initium sumpsimus after which they went on with concerning these two editions the letter on which they were printed gave names to two sizes of printingletter viz from ciceros epistles that sized letter has been called cicero ever since in italy france and germany and answers to our pica holland alone calls it median the other is from st austins book which is called augustine in several parts of europe but with us english but this i shall treat of more largely in the second volume ciceros epistles and the rest of their works without mentioning any edition of st austins before the year      the epigram which we mentioned before to be at the end of both these editions is as follows  hoc conradus opus sweynheim ordine miro arnoldusque simul pannartz una oede colendi gente theotonica romae expediere sodales in domo petri de maximis i have already hinted their method of managing the greek quotations which they followed in the first volumes they printed that is till the middle of the year      perhaps were they forced to it for want of workmen to cut the greek alphabet but at length notwithstanding the neglect of that tongue might have excused them from the labor and expense of procuring setts of punches and matrices for printing in that language and the difficulty of finding workmen fit for such a task they surmounted every obstacle of this nature and formed a complete greek alphabet which they used in the edition of aulus gellius concerning this edition the bishop of aleria speaks thus however this proved a very arduous task at first  for a great part of the latin was corrupted through the negligence of the transcribers and a much greater part of the greek depraved maimed and mutilated even that which remained entire was scarce understood by latin scholars by reason of their ignorance in greek some attempts have been made by persons skilled in both tongues to restore this jewel to its former luster but they either discouraged by the difficulty or diverted by other affairs desisted from the undertaking thus writes that learned prelate who by the assistance of theodore gaza a man of great abilities and universal learning performed this admirable work rectified the latin text and rendered the greek intelligible this edition was printed ann      in a fine character with the arguments to each book done in red by the illuminators the quotations which are long and more frequent than in any other author are printed in a fair greek character considering this kind of printing was but in its infancy and what is extremely remarkable they were so correctly printed that as we are assured by mr mattaire in two whole pages which contained seventy six lines of a considerable length there were but fourteen faults of impression the place mentioned by that author may be seen in page    of his annals typogr where he has set down those places which were wrong printed in order to convince the world by the smallness of their number of the accuracy and diligence of those two printers  he tells us likewise that their greek character was somewhat large round and even without accents ligatures abbreviations or any thing that might perplex the reader except only that sometimes two or more words were joined together without any space between them and that the periods had either no full stop or one in the wrong place so that a person not used to mss was doubtful where the sense ended to this edition was prefixed a dedicatory epistle of the bishop of aleria to the pope wherein he acknowledges the kindness of his holiness and the cardinal of ostia in supplying him with money in his greatest exigencies and promises to proceed with the utmost industry in furnishing the learned world with new productions from the press at the end of the book is a copy of verses supposed to be written by the same prelate in praise of that edition which are elegant for those times the reader may find them at length in mr mattaires annals p    i shall only give a latin octastich which was printed at the end of several of their impressions in commendation of the printers wherein the poet apologizes for the harshness of their german names offensive without doubt to an italian ear they are inserted particularly in the first edition of st jeromes epistles and the great work of nich de lyra entitled glossa ordinaria in universam bibliam   vol fol and in several others the reader will find them in the margin aspicis illustres lector quicunque libellos si cupis artificum nomina nosse lege alpera ridebis cognomina teutona forsan mitiger ars musis inscia verba virum conradus sweynheim arnoldus pannartzque magistri romae impresserunt talia multa simul petrus cum fratre francisco maximus ambo huic operiaptatam contribuere domum   thus they continued printing without intermission mission for seven years whilst their patron procured em all possible assistance and overlooked their impressions this is manifest from the editions of tully st jerome livy lucan the works of st leo ovid nicholas de lyra and especially of pliny with many more in which the bishop acquaints the world with the pains taken by himself and his constant assistant theod gaza in correcting the originals and presiding over the editions  juvit mirifice vir summae eruditionis ac sapientiae theodorus meus gaza atque ita quidem ut absque illo nec pene dixerim mundus hoc munus fuerit impleturus epist dedic ad pap paul ii prefixed to pliny  for this reason dr mentel mentioned in our first book affirms him to have been corrector of sweynheims press and campanus bishop of teramo who was ulric hans patron to have performed the same office in his joannes andreas praesul aleriensis qui in ipsorum libraria taberna  esse non dedignatus est ut nec campanus in uldaric mentel de vera typograph origin p     this is

rendit correcteur de son imprimere de composer cette epigramme a sa louange que raporte faernus addit ad hist lud xi p      and diverse other writers but it is questionable whether those excellent persons can properly be called correctors or rather do not deserve the title of authors or editors  however there is an eminent passage in this epistle of the bishops before plinys works which as it demonstrates his care and diligence in his province ought not to be omitted it was says he irenaeus lugdunensis episcopus item justinus ex philosopho martyr item cum divo hieronymo eusebius caesariensis seram posteritatem adjurarunt ut eorum descripturi opera conserrent diligenter exemplaria solerti studio emendarent idem ego tum in caeteris libris tum maxim in plinto ut fiat vehementer obsecro obtestor atque adjuro ne ad priora menda and tenebras inextricabiles tanti sudoris opus relabatur  the earnest request of ireneus bp of lions and of justin who of a philosopher became a martyr and likewise of st jerome and eusebius of cesarea to the latest posterity that those who were to transcribe their works would diligently compare the copies of them and carefully correct them the same request i make now both with respect to other books and in particular to pliny lest that work which cost so much labor and study for he spent above nine whole years in it should again sink into its former errors and inextricable darkness  hither to we have seen the flourishing state of this press which in the space of six or seven years at most viz from ann      to      obliged the world with no less than twelve thousand four hundred and seventy five volumes in eight and twenty editions some of them very large and all beautiful and correct so that if their vast labors and cost had met with suitable success they must have raised a prodigious estate but whatever be the cause it is certain that the greatest part of this library remained still in their hands for want of buyers which reduced them to the most necessitous circumstances father orlandi endeavors to account for this illsuccess by supposing that their impressions being in roman character were disliked in those days because the learned had been so accustomed to the old gothic as not to approve of this new though preferable one this conjecture seems the more probable upon two accounts   because several eminent printers were obliged to comply with the taste of the age and use the old character resembling that of mss   most of the first printers of paris venice rome etc who began with the roman were forced by degrees to resume the old gothic which continued till almost the middle of the next century and proved the ruin of many valuable impressions in diverse parts of europe however that be our two germans under these pressing exigencies had recourse to their great patron who immediately drew up a petition in their names and behalf to pope xystus iv subjoined to the fifth volume of nich de lyras gloss and presented on the  0th of march      in this he represents their great merit and misery in the most pathetick terms imaginable gives a catalogue of all the volumes printed by them the greatest part of which was still unsold prays his holiness to consider their deplorable case and declares their readiness to deliver up the unsold books either to him or to whomsoever he should command for their present subsistence the bishop to show that he was sensibly touched with their misfortune prefaceth the petition in his own name and requests the pope to hear the just complaint of his worthy and industrious printers and afterward exposes their circumstances in their own words as this curious piece has never yet that i know of been translated into english i presume the reader will be pleased to see it with the promised list of their works both which they printed with the works n de lyra chevillier tells us he saw it at the beginning of tome   of that great work it is as follows   jo and ad xyst iv

upon this subject has thought fit to translate his name into that language in which he wrote this printer came and set up a printingpress at rome within a very short space after sweynheim and pannartz he was a person so accomplished in his art that several nations have claimed him and in particular the germans and french these latter grounded their pretenses upon the following authority anthony campanus bishop of terumo the most distinguished poet and orator of his time performed the same office to him which the bishop of aleria did to the two germans viz of preparing and correcting his copies revising his editions and writing epistles and commendatory verses upon them he observing that han had latinizd his name and subscribed one or two of his impressions uldaricus gallus particularly the edition of the universal history of rodoricus santius a spaniard whom pope paul ii made governor of the castle of st angelo and bishop of palentino took occasion to mistake his name wilfully for he could not possibly be ignorant of his being a german and to represent him as a frenchman not so much out of respect to that nation above the germans as for the sake of a pun in his epigram which you will find in the margin anser tapi custos jovis unde quo nis constreperes  decidit  uldricus gallus ne quem poscantur in usum ocui pennis nil opus esse tuis   the witticism consists chiefly in this that the gauls or french being discovered by the noise of the geese one night in their attempt to surprise the roman capitol a countryman of theirs had found out a way to be revenged of them by teaching the world an art of writing without the help of their quills these verses are annexed to an edition of t livy by u han without date and quoted by several authors  mich fernus in his life of that bishop tells us that he learned this epigram of a turk whom he met with in a journey to the popes territories and who gave him account of his conversion to the christian religion and his early love of eloquence which induced him to leave turkey and come to rome to see the famous paul ii and campanus whose works he had carefully collected and amongst other things recited this epigram however it is evident that he was a german by his adding the name of his country to that of gallus in several of his editions thus in that of cicero de oratore ann      he calls himself ulricum gallum de wiena in st austin de civitate dei ann      ulricum gallum almanum in some others ulricum gallum de bienna and de ingolstat wimpheling undertook to prove him a german against fernus who in his life of campanus changed gallus into gallicus to make him an absolute frenchman and ascribed this mistake to his having translated his name into latin which as hermolaus barbarus asserts ought never to be done but in this he did no more than what was frequent among the germans and others who to soften the harshness of their sirnames either altered or latinizd them so fust changed his into faustus schoeffer into opilio leichtenstein into levi lapis des rouges into de rubeis and the learned stephens into stephanus which custom still prevails in foreign parts and the famous mons le clerc of amsterdam styles himself joan clericus in all his latin works to return to ulric iian  the time of his first coming to rome is not easily determined some affirm that he was settled there before sweynheim and pannartz as wimpheling mons naude and dr mentel but this seems improbable upon two accounts   because we have no edition of his so ancient as those of the two last named   because the bp of aleria who was the editor of all the first impressions of these determines in their favor and his testimony is of much greater weight in this case than that of those writers he attributes the honor to sweynheim etc of having founded the first printing house at rome and brought the art from germany in the preceding popes reign and by their example encouraged others to do the like as he speaks in the petition to xystus iv above quoted now xystuss predecessor was paul ii who was advanced to that dignity in august      and in his days they came to rome if campanus the patron of ulric had known of his settling there before them he would certainly have contradicted the bp of aleria and maintained the priority to the man who under his protection proved so indefatigable in his business that himself was engaged night and day in revising his works cum uldricus quidam gall qui formas in urbein literarias nuper intulisset illum interquiescere assiduis emen ationibus non permitteret remque literariam ex magnis dissicultatibus inopiaque ad ingentem ubertatem gloriosissimo illo and divino opificio evocaret etc fern in vita campani  the merit of this printer appears from his fine impressions and the choice that his patron made of him to publish those works which he had procured and corrected with the utmost application as well as from the praises which he gives him in his prefatory epistles and verses we find by the list of his books that he frequently neglected the date of the impression and his own name the former defect is supplied as far as possible from some material circumstances either in the epistles affixed to them or elsewhere in the book and the latter by a diligent comparing of one edition with another for there is some peculiar difference between the characters of the first printers by which a nice observer may judge of the author  thus mr mattaire remarks that the types of con sweynheim and arn pannartz were easily known by their having a long s at the end of words the i without a point and no diphthongs those of nic jenson were much more round and neat with the diphthongs ae and oe whereas jo spires made use of e for ae and ulric han uses a single e instead of a diphthong  about      han took simon nicolai de luca into partnership with him till the end of the year      after which he printed by himself till      there was also a brother of his called lupus han whose name stands alone in some of those impressions which are nevertheless allowed to be ulrics by reason of the likeness of the character etc and added to the list of his works by the two latest annalists mr maittaire and father orlandi he affected to put at the end of some of his editions the colophon of john faust and peter schoeffer non atramento plumali calamo etc i e that it was not done with pen ink or any other writing instrument etc  ann      he began to print a register in two columns at the end of his virgil all his other editions as yet known are    in number the first of which is cicero de oratore in   books ann      the last til livy in italian      this last is in three volumes fol the  d of which has an error in its date where they have printed    0 instead of      this work has not indeed his name but those who have seen it make no doubt but it was printed by him  the two germans had reason to tell the pope in their petition that their example had encouraged many more printers to come and settle at rome seeing we find no less than thirteen who practiced the same art there between    0 and    0 besides the brother of uldric han and his partner simon de luca and eight or nine of whom were actually settled there within a few years after the two former but as we have nothing left particularly concerning them except their names and their works we shall just mention them as they came in course of time    george lavfr de herbipoli    0 alias wortsburg he wrought in the monastery of st eusebius at rome as we find by an epigram of eight verses in latin rhyme written as is supposed by his corrector celestine pulverinus and printed at the end of his edition of tractatus de institutione simplicium confessorum ann      he had a partner some space of the time viz leonard pelugi we have but five editions of his the first is that of st chrysostoms homilies translated into latin by fr aretine sol ann    0 the last is durandi speculum ann      he had another corrector named pomponius    adam rot      he used likewise fausts colophon and in the first of the two editions we have of him styles himself clericus metens dioces his last ediion is dated         john philip de lignamine      he was a native of messina and a sicilian knight and intimate with pope sixtus iv to whom he inscribed a book of his writing de unoquoque cibo and potu utili homini and nocivo and eorum primis qualitalibus malinkrot mentions him page    upon the authority of simler which last affirms him to have printed the following works at rome viz quintilian suetonius the works of st leo lactantius st ambrose tullys offices laur vallas elegantiae and horatii opuscula but we find none of these editions in the list of his works but only four less considerable ones the three first in italian and the last eusebiuss history translated into latin by rufinus and printed ann         stephen planck of padua      we have eight editions of his the last of which is dated         george sachel de reichenhalt      his last edition of three is dated         john reynard de eningen      we have but one edition of his printed at rome ann         years after which we find him printing at strasburgh   0 john de nicolao haneymar de openheim          john schusener de bopardia      we have but two editions of theirs both dated          john tibull de amidanis cremonese      the two editions we have of his bear the same date     eucharius silber of wirtzburgh       this silber alias franck a german and native of wirtzburgh signalized himself at rome by the fineness of his letter which were of the venetian sort he set up his printing house in campo di fiore and not only translated his name silber silver into latin but likewise into greek so that some of his editions are subscribed achirion and argyrion others argenteus added to that of franck the works we have of his are twenty one in number from ann      to   00 however he continued printing there many years after but either the greatest part of these last have been lost or else he printed but little since we meet only with two editions of his from   00 to   0  in mr mattaires annals  his correctors were michael fern sirnamd archipoeta bartholomeus salicetus and ludovicus regii the first of whom collected with prodigious industry all bishop campanuss works which he caused to be printed in two different places within six months of each other viz at venice and rome in the order in which he had digested them these impressions were printed so incorrectly that he was obliged to insert an errata in silbers edition wherein he expresses a vast deal of indignation that a work in which he had labored so much should yet be published so full of faults and gives it the following title vis ex stulto demens idemque ex demente insanus fieri libros romae primus imprime corruptorum recognitio after this he proceeds to the errata with an acknowledgement of his own errors and endeavors to clear the printers of others he shows the care which he had taken to render the edition correct but that his efforts were frustrated by the carelessness of the printers who being tired with a days labor correct their proofs imperfectly and frequently neglect or omit the authors corrections  in the sequel of this history we shall have occasion to mention some erratas of a much greater length than the foregoing which fern complains so loudly of though this contained four large pages in fol the two last printers in this city before   00 are     simon de nicolo of luca      who had been sometime partner to the famed uldric han and of whom we have but one edition and     peter de turre ann    0 in which year he printed ptolemys cosmography in a large folio with maps and cutts and in a beautiful character orland p    which is all that we have of his we find about twenty more editions without printers names however the reader will easily see by this list of printers and the scarcity of their works that the art began to dwindle very much before the close of the century and if he consults mr mattaire upon the next he will find it still much thinner of both but whether for want of encouragement or what other cause is not my business to enquire     the city of tours      tours is an archiepiscopal city of france in which we meet with but one book printed this tho done in an old gothic character which was not as yet used in any place but mentz is so elegant that it may be esteemed a masterpiece of that kind it is to be regretted that the printer of such an excellent work should be unknown the impression was done in the archbishops palace but if the reader upon that account shall expect it to be a piece of devotion he will be vastly mistaken for it is not unusual with ecclesiastics of the most elevated stations in that church to have a greater relish for gallantry than religion the book is the loves of camillus and emilia to which is subjoined another upon the same subject translated from boccacio by aretin and is inscribed as follows  francisci florii florentini de amore camilli and aemiliae liber expletus est turonis editus in domo guillelmi archiepiscopi turonensis anno millesimo quadringentesimo sexagesimo septimo pridie calendas januarii  to de duobus amantibus libellus in latinum ex boccacio transfiguratus per leonardum aretinum this book is joined to the former and printed in the same character and form  the following book was printed in the same city a long time after viz la vie and miracles de monseigneur st martin translatee de latin en francois imprimee par mathieu lateron fol  me de may tours       n b though we design to treat in a distinct book of the introduction and progress of printing in england yet it is not amiss to remark here that oxford comes next in course to the city of tours according to our premised criterion of the oldest editions for the most ancient impression printed in that university is st jeromes exposition of the apostles creed  to bearing date ann      a copy of which is now in the earl of pembrokes library     the town of reutlingen      this town of reutlingen and the city of venice are next the former of which being nearer to mentz may so far be allowed the first rank it is a small town in the duchy of wirtembergh in which john de averbach set up a printing house ann      and published the two following editions    biblia latina fol per johannem de averbach         alvari pelagii hispani ordin min summa de planctu ecclesiae christianae reutlingae       this is a very scarce book and has not the printers name but is nevertheless supposed to have been printed by averbach it is in fol and the next edition of it was printed at ulm ann      this john averbach must not be confounded with the learned j amerbach of basil of whom we shall speak in its proper place  chap iii the city of venice      the names character etc of the printers who flourished in this city from ann      to aldus manutiuss time      as the city of venice has excelled all others not only in the number of workmen and editions but likewise in the goodness and excellency of them i shall be forced to divide it into two chapters in the first of which i shall speak of those printers who flourished from its first settlement there by john and vindelin de spira to the time of the great aldus manutius whose merit alone will very well deserve to be spoken of in a chapter by it self though there were no others to bear him company in it  with respect to those first printers twill be superfluous to repeat here what i have said in the introduction of this book concerning nich jenson and the reasons for suspending my judgment concerning his edition of      and allowing the priority to the foregoing cities before that of venice there will be further occasion of speaking of that printer when we shall come to thoseother works of his printed between the years    0 and    0 in the mean time i beg leave to remind the reader of the remark upon this head which we just hinted in the introduction viz that the verses at the end of the first impression by john and windelin of spire ann      evidently prove them to have been the first who brought the art to that city the reader will find them in the margin primus in adriaca formis impressit aenis urbe libros spira genitus de stirpe johannes in reliquis sit quanta vides spes lector habenda quam labor hic primus calami superaverit artem mcccclxviiii   mr mattaire who has a particular regard for his countryman jenson and first discovered to the world the edition in dispute very justly intimates that there was such an emulation among the first printers that they made no scruple of claiming the priority from each other right or wrong either by false dates as we hinted before or by pompous verses annexed to their works from which he infers a probability that these two brothers might do so whereas jenson in his opinion was too modest to have been guilty of such a piece of arrogance for my part i cannot see any necessity of accusing either side of such a fault seeing they never charged each other with it besides jenson in all probability printed his book somewhere else and therefore might indeed be too modest when he came to venice to challenge the priority from them as to that place in particular however as to the point of modesty i own i am at a loss to what side to give it seeing all the first impressions both of jenson and of the two brothers are backed with epigrams equally magnificent and i dont see where there would have been the least immodesty in either to have ascertained a just claim against an unjust assuming rival let me add that if there was any wilful mistake on either side which i think there was not it is more probable jenson should have committed it than the two brothers because he might easily if there was occasion excuse it by making his date pass for an error of impression whereas the two germans published themselves in words at length and in the plainest terms the first printers at venice and so left no room for evasion i shall therefore begin with them who were not inferior to jenson himself  john and vindeline of spire      they were natives of germany but whether of the city of spire whose name they bear or whether that was only their surname i cannot determine for though some of the epigrams annexed to their books seem to imply the former yet it is difficult to affirm certainly that it was not a poetical license which in this case might have been more excusable than that of campanus upon ulric han mentioned in the preceding chapter however it is plain that many of the german printers had no other sirnames than those of the places wherein they were born  these two brothers soon surpassed all their predecessors in the beauty and neatness of their characters and the elegance of their impressions which to this time render them admired and esteemed by the curious above all other ancient editions venice by this gained so much reputation for the fineness of her types that some eminent printers at rome and elsewhere either furnished themselves with setts of them or endeavored to imitate them acquainting their readers in their next impressions that they were printed characteribus venetianis with venetian types chevillier indeed thinks this to have been an imposition upon the world nor can it be denied but that some of them pretended this in order to recommend their own wretched performances but this demonstrates the superior merit of that city and the laudable emulation of her printers not only to excel those of other places but even one another and indeed these two brothers with john de cologn and n jenson seem to have brought the art to its utmost perfection because none of the most famous printers which succeeded till our time such as vascosan the stephenss etc have surpassed them in this respect as well as because this like other arts seemed obnoxious to a certain fatality and decline when carried to a particular height as it happened in the space of six or seven years after their first settlement at venice what i mean is that they should so unaccountably suffer themselves to be carried away by the degenerate taste of that age and change their beautiful roman character for the old obsolete and disagreeable gothic which they began to print with about the year       the spires had the two following learned men for their correctors viz christopher berardus of pisauro and george alexandrinus john the elder brother is reported to be the first who put the directionword at the end of the page and that upon good grounds since no book to our knowledge before his tacitus has it the singular use of which is too obvious to want explanation he lived no longer than to the year    0 and was succeeded in the whole business by windelin who managed it with great applause by himself till      in which year he took john de cologn into partnership with him we find but one book viz plautus printed by them jointly so that it is probable each of them returned soon after to his separate press this windelin was so highly esteemed as a printer even by his own countrymen a thing very uncommon that he was twice invited into germany by some eminent counselors at law of that nation to print there the following considerable volumes viz   bartholi commentarium juridicum which he performed ann      without the name of the place adding only two verses inserted in the margin hos windelinus clara virtute magister transcripsit celeri formula pressa pede maitaire annal typogr p    sub not b  and   the commentaries upon the five books of decretals of nic tudeschi of sicily sirnamd abbas panormitanus ann      vita orlandi page     he printed likewise in germany about the same time the first edition of the tractatus tractatuum sive oceanus juris    vol fol but as he had engaged himself presently after his brothers death not to leave venice as appears by the verses at the end of st austin de civitate dei ann    0 qui docuit venetos exscribi posse johannes mense fere trino centena volumina plini et totidem magni ciceronis spira libellos coeperat aureli subita sed morte peremptus non potuit coeptum venetis finite volumen vindelinus adest ejusdem frater and art non minor adriacaque morabitur urbe  begun but not finished by his brother he returned thither and continued printing with prodigious honor till the year      wherein he began to fall in with the gothic character beforementioned in this he was followed by all the rest and even by the celebrated nic jenson though this last still preserved the beauty and neatness of his forms which the others very much degenerated from about this time windelin probably died because we meet with no impression of his that bears a date later than      such was the esteem the learned had of this excellent printer that of twenty eight impressions we have extant of his above twenty of them have a latin epigram at the end in praise of him some of which are of a considerable length and most of them by different hands the first edition is that of ciceros epistolae familiares ann      the last we know of with a date is dantes poems ann      some of his editions are without date    nicholas jenson janson or genson    0 nich jenson is allowed by the generality of writers to have been a frenchman and as he was one of the first of that nation who was eminent in this art all his countrymen have been more than ordinarily lavish of their praises on him so that whoever reads some of their encomiums would be apt to think him the only printer of merit in that age and that there had never been any edition worth their consideration till it came out of his press and this they did even before they so much as dreamt of that early masterpiece of his the decor puellarum we need not therefore wonder at mr mattaire if we find him so highly pleased at the discovery of this singular work for it must be owned that unless we will dispute the date of it the highest encomiums must fall short of his merit since it will plainly follow that he was not only the earliest by some years who improved the art but likewise who brought it to its greatest perfection with respect to the fineness of his roman characters and elegancy of composition whereas were the supposition of those who think it antedated by ten years to be allowed it will be manifest that there had already been several eminent printers at rome venice and elsewhere before him who introduced that noble and elegant character and that though his should be allowed to be somewhat finer than those of his predecessors yet would his merit be inferior to theirs and his improvement upon them be but small in comparison of that which they made upon the old moguntine types however that be i acknowledge with the greatest freedom and sincerity that he was an excellent master of the art and his impressions as beautiful and for the last ten years space wherein he followed the business as numerous as any of his contemporaries polydore vergil highly commends him for having so wonderfully improved the art of printing and sabellicus owns that he and his partner john de cologn excelled all the printers of their time in the richness and elegancy of their impressions sed omnium maxim opibus and eleganti literarum forma multum caeteros antecelluerunt nicholates jenson and johannes coloniensis sabellic enead  0 l    the learned omnibonus leonicenus who prepared copies for him and corrected some of his editions has in an epistle to the bishop of belluno left us an excellent character of him prefixed to his quintilian anno      accedebant justae preces magistri nicolai jenson gallici alterius ut vere dicam daedali qui librariae artis mirabilis inventor non ut scribantur calamo libri sed vesuti gemma imprimantur ac prope sigillo primus omnium ingeniose monstravit ut huic viro qui de re literaria tam been meruit nemo sit qui non favere debeat idcirco non difficulter impetravit ut non solum hoc opus verum etiam utramque ciceronis artem corrigerem  wherein he extols his types and mentions him as a second daedalus and as one to whom the greatest share of this invention was due  the learned therefore are very justly surpised that so excellent a master and so great an ornament to the art of printing should be the first who brought the gothic character to venice in which he printed his bibles divinity and law books this method was followed by all his brethren both in that city and in several others of europe though it must be owned that he far surpassed the rest even in that respect and showed a more exact taste and judgment for his gothic types had all the beauty and elegancy which they were capable of and may be still read with pleasure and admiration  i dont find that he had any other corrector besides omnibon leonicenus abovementioned if we except franciscus colutia verzinensis who in his dedication prefixed to the work of palladius de agricultura of which he was the editor tells jenson to whom he dedicates it that it was at his desire that he had undertaken to correct that work by this it seems as if jenson was the first printer who had any of his impressions dedicated to himself most of his works like those of the two german brothers have a latin epigram at the end in praise of him but what is remarkable not one of them speaks of him as the first venetian printer which circumstance alone would be sufficient to justify us for postponing him to them we meet with four of his editions printed in one year viz    0 which shows him to have been a very diligent workman and in the space of ten years we have thirtynine of them still extant exclusive of the decor puellarum besides those which may have been lost or are still undiscovered the first edition printed by him in gothic character is st austins book de civitate dei anno      the two last of his works are dated         christopher waldarfer of ratisbon    0 concerning this printer we know little except that we have four of his editions still extant corrected by ludovicus carbo or carbone the third of which viz servius comment on virgil fol anno      has an epigram of four latin distichs in his praise by which we may guess that he printed a great many more works than these four especially classicks the last of them viz plinys epistles has neither the name of the printer nor place but by a dedication prefixed to it by the said carbo to borso duke of modena one may conclude it to have been done by waldarfer he removed from venice soon after and set up a printing house at milan where we shall find him when we come to that place      john de cologn and john manthen de geretzen      these two germans came and settled at venice soon after the two spires and were equal to any of their contemporaries in the beauty of their roman types the fineness of their paper and elegance and correctness of their works but they likewise gave into the gothic way of printing and it is observable that venice and lions have produced more of those impressions than almost all italy and france together whether these printers were more modest than their brethren is uncertain but however in the list of their editions we meet with none of those pompous epigrams and panegyricks upon themselves so frequently used at that time they took nic jenson into partnership with them toward the later part of their printing john de cologn is affirmed by some to have invented the registrum chartarum about anno      but it is obvious to the reader from the catalogue of uldric hans works at rome that the latter used it at least two years before him  there is one thing remarkable in one of their colophons at the end of their editions of valerius maximus fol anno      and which for that reason i have subjoined in the margin venetiis impressoribus expositus fuit per joh de cologn agrippin ac joh manthen de gherretsteim mcccclxxiv qui una fideliter viventes eosdem impressores ad hoc duxerunt  that they were rather booksellers than printers because they acquaint the readers in it that they had given this work to be printed by men hired for that purpose we shall meet with many more in the sequel of this history who followed their example  however it must be owned that all the works that came out of their press or were printed for them are an honor to them the last list of their editions according to father orlandi amounts to    from ann      to       as we know little or nothing concerning the following ones besides their names and their works we shall just mention them in their rank according to the date of the works we have of them    antony bolognese or antonio de bartolomeo de bolonia      we have five editions of his from      to         leonard achates of basil        edition    gabriel de

this was his true name he being a frenchman though in his latin editions he writes himself jacobus rubeus or de rubeis and in his italian ones di rossi and rossi he was justly esteemed one of the best printers in his time it is affirmed by some that he assisted nic jenson in improving his roman characters but this is improbable because it does not appear that he came to venice till two or three years at least after the other had published some of his fine editions however the beauty of his letter and the fineness of his impressions are incomparable particularly the two histories of florence in italian one written by leonard de arezo and the other by poggius are accounted masterpieces in that kind at length he left venice and settled at pignerol in piedmont where he printed an italian bible the satyrs of juvenal and some other work which we shall speak of in its proper place there is one thing more to enhance his merit which is that he complied not with the degenerate taste of those times in introducing the gothic characters into his printing house his impressions from anno      to      are ten in number     christopher arnold we have but two editions of his from      to

inventor of italick letters his life character and greek editions with an account of the other printers at venice till the year   00 aldus manutius the most eminent printer of the fifteenth century was born anno      when printing was yet in its intancy who as he grew up became such an admirer of this new art that though his education learning and genius might have justly excited him to greater employments yet he chose to devote his whole time and study to the cultivating and improving all the branches of it this design he performed with such indefatigable application and vast chages that his whole ambition seemed to be confined to this province and the advancement of learning omnem enim vitam decrevimus ad hominum utilitatem consumere  nam etsi quietam ac tranquillam agere vitam possumus negotiosam tamen eligimus and plenam laboribus ald pafat d lascar creten  after he had received the rudiments of grammar under gaspar of verona he applied himself to the greek and latin tongues under the great baptista guarini of verona and in a short time made such a progress in these languages as not only to surpass his fellow students but even to rival his master himself thus he continued furnishing his mind with every part of literature in order to fit himself for that business of which he was afterward to become the ornament the war breaking out in italy and the city of ferrara being besieged he removed from thence to mirandula where he became acquainted with the great picus of that name a prince of the brightest genius that age had produced and one of the greatest lvers of learning and of learned men who not only received him with open arms but procured him the acquaintance of many learned men by whose conversation and correspondence aldus received no small advantage toward the acquiring that great knowledge of the greek and latin tongues which he became afterward so famous for in the   th year of his age anno    0 he began to prepare the necessary apparatus of a printinghouse wherein he spent four years and consequently did not begin printing till about anno      during this interval he observed with regret to what degree the abbreviations used by all the former printers every where were multiplied so that they became unintelligible without some key to direct the reader an instance of which is given in the margin this curious example of the abbreviations used in those times is extracted from okams logic folio verso leaf     as follows  si hic e fall s m quoth d simplr a e pducibile a deo g a e and s lr hic a n e g a a e pducibile a deo etc which words printed at full length will run thus sicut hic est fallacia secundum quid ad simpliciter a est producibile a deo ergo a est and sim liter hic a non est ergo non est producibile a deo vide chevil p   0  these abbreviations were grown in time so numerous and universal that books were obliged to be published to teach the method of reading and understanding them    upon this he considered a method to remedy this inconvenience and set them quite aside in his editions but because the printing the words at length would enlarge the volumes a fourth part for there was scarce one word in five that was not abridgd and increase the price he resolved likewise to remedy that to which end he invented the italick character called from him aldine or cursivus and cancellarius from its resemblance to handwriting which byits figure and closeness gained as much upon the round roman as the abbreviations did and reduced the volume to near an exact bulk thereby rendering them absolutely useless this is the main though not the sole advantage which he proposed by this new character for the world has since found its extraordinary usefulness in many other respects which being obvious to every person i shall not particularise here but mention only the agreeableness of a mixture of roman and italick however it must be owned that aldus made too great use of the latter in printing whole volumes in that character which is known to tire the eyes much more than the roman upon this account several emineat printers afterward rejected it in their quotations when they were of any considerable length and substituted double commas or guillemets at one end of the lines to distinguish the citations from the body of the book which guillemets were so called from their inventor a french printer of that name  to return to aldus s soon as he had persected this new character which must necessarily cost him prodigious sums of money he obtained a privilege from three several popes for the sole use of them during the se of fifteen years and these pontifs give him great encomiums upon the account of this invention the first of these was granted him by alexander vi and is dated sept      0  with the following preface quoniam dilectus filius noster aldus manucius romanus ad communem doctorum utilitatem novisexcogitatis characterum formis assiduam operam libris emendandis imprimendisque impendit magnosque in ea re labores sumptus que facit vereturque ne insurgente invidia aemulationeque excitata aliqui sumpto de ejus characteribus exemplo ad eandem formam libros imprimant deque alterius invento novum sibi lucrum quaerant ideo nobis fecit humiliter supplicari etc  for as much as our beloved son aldus manucius romanus has for the common benefit of the learned invented a new set of characters and been at vast pains and charges in correcting and printing of books  and is afraid lest some through envy or emulation should get patterns of his characters and print with them thereby reaping the benefit of another mans invention he has therefore humbly besought us etc  he obtained the like privilege from pope julius ii within four months after the first viz jan      0  which begins thus for as much as thou  have been at the pains to print with such diligence and elegancy within these few years and for the common benefit of all the learned many greek and latin volumes corrected and revised with the utmost care and diligence in those new characters which are vulgarly known by the name of cursivi and cancellarii and are so beautiful as to seem written by hand etc cum tu  graecorum and latinorum auctorum volumina summa cura and diligentia castigata a paucis annis ad communem omnium litteratorum utilitatem characteribus quos vulgus cursives seu a cellarios appellas imprimi tam diligenter and pulchre curaveris ut calamo conscripta esse videantur etc   his successor leo x likewise granted him a brief to the same purpose within ten months after expressly prohibiting any person to print in or imitate that character during the space of fifteen years ne per spatium quindecim annorum iis characteribus quos ipse invenit vel edidit primus imprimere  neve characteres quos cursivos seu cancellarios appellant imitari praesumant etc   it is apparent from the tenor of these briefs that this italick character was not the only particular wherein aldus signalized himself for the number and correctness of his editions with the beauty of his characters gained him the esteem and admiration of the learned nor need i tell the reader how highly all his works have been valued ever since as well as those of his son paulus manucius of his soninlaw andreas azolanus and his grandson aldus which are of equal merit with his own and of equal value his ambition of being esteemed not only a man of letters as he really was but also the most correct printer of the age was such that he spared no cost in procuring the best mss nor labor in revising them and his care was so great lest any errors should escape him either in the m s or proofs that as we are assured by angel roccha keeper of the vatican library he would not allow himself to print above two sheets in a week audivi ab iis qui cum eo versati sunt  duo ad summum folia singula quaque hebdomada imprimi solere cum hodie totidem fere in singulo quoque praelo quotidie cudantur ang roc de bibliotheca vaticana page      but this must be understood only of such works as required a more than ordinary diligence and application otherwise it were difficult to reconcile this with what aldus says in his preface to euripides ann   0  quandoquidem mill and amplius boni alicujus auctoris volumina singulo quoque mense emittimus  that he published some good author every month of which he printed above a thousand copies or with what erasmus says of him in his proverbs aldus bibliothecam molitur cujus non alia septa sunt quam ipsius orbis erasm chtl   cent   prove    that he was erecting a library whose limits would be those of the world it self however that be his accuracy and diligence is unquestionably attested by all the learned and he tells pope leo x in his petition beforementioned that the height of his ambition was to present the world with authors corrected with the utmost exactness and that nothing was more mortifying to him than to see any faults in his impressions every one of which he would gladly if possible have redeemed at the price of a crown of gold sic doleo ut si possem mutarem singula errata nummo aureo  what assistance he had from the learned in correcting his books may be gathered from his preface to the greek edition of aristotles logic where he assures us that he had some of the ablest critics with him to assist in the correction and in the preface to the physics of that philosopher he boasts that his impressions were more perfect and correct than the very originals from which they were printed dicere queo quicquid meo labor formis excuditur ipsis exemplaribus long correctius ac magis perfectum exire ex aedibus nostris   but it must be owned that the learned are far from granting him this last piece of merit which he challenges and some of them have objected that he either printed them not according to the best manuscripts or corrected them by his own conjectures or followed sometimes too scrupulously those which were faulty and imperfect upon this account erasmus though a great friend of his complains that michael bentius who printed his proverbs had followed the corrupt editions of aldus in the quotations from homer and cicero nam michael bentius contulit quaedam loca a me citata ex graeco homero ab aldo excuso item ex cicerone aldino cum aldina sint depravatissima vita erasmi lugdun batav in   o page      the same author tells john betzemius in a letter sent with a catalogue of his works that some of plutarchs books were printed by aldus after some very corrupt manuscript hoc unum erat incommodi quod aldus hoc opus excudit secundum exemplar multis locis depravatum tom   oper erasm  yet he excuses him in another letter officina veneta dedit nobis festum pompeium egregie depravatum non insimulo aldum solet ille tales operas alicui paedagogo committere page     supradict edit lugdun batav  and lays the blame upon some pedagogue whom aldus entrusted with the care of some of the editions of ancient authors if this be fact it is very much to be regretted that so great a printer to whom the republic of learning is in all other respects so much obliged should be overseen in a matter of such importance and this in all probability is the reason why he thus expresses his dissatisfaction at his own editions in the petition to the pope beforementioned sed ego non credulus illis nullum enim adhuc dedi librum in quo mihi ipsi satisfecerim that he was so far from regarding the flatteries of some persons that he had not as yet published one book with which he could be satisfied sed ego non credulus illis nullum enim adhuc dedi librum in quo mihi ipsi satisfecerim   besides this he carries his complaints still further and inveighs loudly against two sorts of men who alone are capable of depriving the learned world of the benefit of printing unless some speedy stop be put to their wretched performances the first are those who notwithstanding their notorious ignorance and incapacity presume to print any kind of books the second are the half learned editors who not only venture upon publishing ancient authors but likewise write notes and commentaries with their own corrections upon them thus was this great man concerned to see the corruptions already crept into the art through the avarice of some and ignorance of others whilst himself found by sad experience that all his care as well as learning was scarce sufficient for such a task as no printer ever surpassed him in the latter so none ever equaled him in the former for so indefatigable was he in that laborious province that he scarce allowed himself time to eat sleep or attend his domestic affairs and which is still more was so regardless of his health as to neglect those pleasures and recreations so necessary and conducive to the preservation of it the learned zuinger in his theatrum vitae humanae p      of the basil edition   0  tells us that his mind was entirely engaged in the care of his printing house that as soon as he had ordered his other necessary affairs he shut himself up in his study where he employed himself in revising his greek and latin manuscripts reading the letters which he received from the learned out of all parts of the world and writing answers to them to prevent interruption by impertinent visits he caused the following inscription to be placed over his closet door quisquis es rogat te aldus etiam atque etiam ut siquid est quod a se velis pe paucis agas deinde actutum abeas nisi tanquam hercules veneris supposituus humeros semper enim erit quod and tu agas and quotquot huc atulerint pedes  whoever you are aldus earnestly entreats you to dispatch your business as soon as possible and then depart unless you come hither like another hercules to lend him some friendly assistance for here will be work sufficient to employ you and as many as enter this place these words were afterward borrowed by the learned oporinus who from a professor of the greek tongue in the university of basil became one of the most eminent printers either of that city or even of europe and were set over his study door for the same intent  aldus is affirmed by many authors to have been the first who printed whole volumes in greek particularly the learned henry stephens asserts both in the complaint of the art of printing written by him and in his epitaph upon aldus that he was the first printer in that language qui graphicis primus tradidit illa typis  and gesner tells paul manutius alduss son in the   th book of his pandects that if he is not mistaken there were no greek books printed before those of his father or at least not with equal beauty and correctness with his exemplaria graeca ante patrem tuum aut nulla ni allor aut pauca nec ea industria typis pulicata sunt  though this is not strictly true as we shall immediately show yet as he was the greatest printer in greek and inventor of a beautiful character these and several other authors might easily attribute to him the first rank in this province the first greek book was published by him anno      as appears by the lists which the annalists give us of his works and from what aldus himself says in hi preface to stephanus de urbibus anno   0  eodem anno quo vexari bello coepit italia difficillimam hanc ego imprimendorum librorum provinciam accepi  that he begun his first greek impressions in the year wherein the war in italy commenced viz anno      at the time of the expedition of charles viii king of france to seize upon the kingdom of naples some writers from a mistaken passage in his preface to aristotle anno      wherein he tells his patron prince carpi that he presents him with the prince of philosophers plato excepted now first printed and very correct have thought it to have been his first greek impression whereas he published at least three the year before however it is plain he had printed no book in any language before anno       it appears from what has been said in a former chapter concerning the lactantius printed in the monastery of subiaco anno      the gellius at rome      and others that several considerable fragments were printed in greek with no small elegancy and correctness but besides these there were several editions in that language printed in diverse cities of italy some years before the principal of which we shall mention  the first as yet known is the greek grammar of constantine lascaris  to revised by demetrius cretensis and printed by dionysius palavisinus at milan anno      afterward reprinted at venice by leonard of basil anno       the next is the greek psalter printed at venice anno      by alexander of crete  to and homers batrachomuomachia or battle between the frogs and mice  to at venice by leonic of crete in the same year but as these may be esteemed only preludes or essays in that language we shall come to a more considerable edition viz that of homers works in greek which b neril caused to be printed at florence in a large folio anno      by demetrius of milan a native of crete this excellent work i have seen in the curious library of the learned dr mead and i dare affirm that whoever examines the whiteness and strength of the paper the fineness of the character the elegant disposition of the matter the exact distance between the lines the large margin and in short the whole performance with its various ornaments will easily own it a masterpiece in that kind there was likewise a fine edition of isocrates printed at milan in fol by henry german and sebastian ex pontremulo anno      a year before any of alduss impressions appeared  however though he was not the first greek printer yet no person ever signalized himself more in that province than he nor equaled him in beauty correctness and number of editions concerning the beauty of his greek characters of which he is said to be the inventor mr mattaire tells us page     annal typogr that those in which he printed the psalter aesop aristotle aristophanes etc were somewhat larger rounder more beautiful and elegant adorned with frequent ligatures which added no small beauty to his greek editions etc nor is this is the only particular for which the learned world is so much obliged to him since his designs reached still farther and were answered to his great satisfaction before his death which happened anno      he observed with no small regret how much and how long the greek tongue had been neglected in order therefore to revive that noble language and accustom the learned by degrees to read nothing but the originals he resolved to publish most of his books in greek only this succeeded so well that the oldest men began to acquaint themselves with it and as many youths engaged in the study of that tongue as of the latin which gave him such sensible pleasure that he mentions it in several of his prefaces and particularly in that prefixed to aristotles logic wherein he thus expresses himself nostris vero temporibus multos licet videre  hoc est senes in senectute graece discere nam adolescentulorum ac juvenum graecis incumbentium jam tantas fere est numerus quantus eorum qui latinis propterea graeci libri vehementer ab omnibus inquiruntur quorum quia mira paucitas est etc in our days we may see many old gentlemen who follow catos example in learning the greek tongue for with respect to the youth they equally apply themselves to that as to the latin upon which account greek books of which there is now a prodigious scarcity are come into very great request etc in his preface to stephanus de urbibus he observes with pleasure nam non in italia solum sed etiam in germa a calna pannonia britannia hispania and ubique fere ubi romana lingua legitur non modo ab adolescentibus juvenibusque sed a senibus quoque summa aviditate studetur literis graecis that italy was not the only nation where in the greek tongue was in vogue but that in germany france hungary britain spain and almost every place where the latin was known not only the young but even the old studied greek with the utmost eagerness and application  all his impressions were not of that nature for in some of them printed before and afterward as musaeus greek grammar procluss sphaera the works of philostratus eusebius contra hieroclem etc he first gave the whole greek text and then the latin translation  soon after this he invented a method entirely new of printing these greek editions with their translations which i do not find practiced by any printer since  they were imposed after such a manner that the purchaser might have them bound either with the greek and latin separate or with a leaf of the one and a leaf of the other alternately for instance the first leaf was greek then followed the first in latin then the second greek leaf and the second latin and so on to the end but with this precaution that the greek of the first leaf was only printed upon the second page of it and the latin version opposite to it the latin upon the second page of the latin leaf was the version of the greek upon the first page of the third leaf and all the greek upon the second page of this leaf fell exactly over against the latin of it in the first page of the fourth or second latin leaf this order being observed throughout every other leaf being greek and the rest latin it was easy either to bind it in two volumes the one greek and the other latin or into one with the original first and version afterward opposite to each other  but as we remarked before this excellent method was never observed not even by those who reprinted such of alduss editions as had been done after this way viz esops and gabriels fables lascariss grammar etc for they printed the greek in one page and the latin upon the other which is vastly more inconvenient than his method the manner of printing both languages in two columns not being invented till after the year    0 vide chevil page     i conceive there is no necessity of giving a more particular description of alduss greek types because his works are so universally known to the curious but whoever desires to know further concerning them and their superior excellence to those used before may consult mr mattaires annals page      aldus has been likewise supposed the first or at least one of the first who printed in hebrew but this is certainly a mistake for though he had a font of hebrew yet he made but little use of it and it is evident that the jews of soncino in the duchy of milan began to print books in that language about twelve or fourteen years before aldus appeared as shall be shown in its proper place chevillier p     tells us that he saw nothing of his in this tongue but the hebrew alphabet which is still preserved in the sorbon library we find however that he wrote and printed an introduction to the hebrew tongue as appears from  book printed by him ann   0  entitled aldi manutii grammaticae latinae linguae rudimenta de literis graecis and diphthongis etc ut and introductio ad hebraeam linguam  to indeed justin decadius a grecian and inhabitant of venice who caused the greek psalter to be printed by aldus in  to flatters those of his own nation to whom he dedicates it with a promise which that printer made him of printing an edition of the bible in hebrew greek and latin but it is not known that he ever performed it at least with relation to the hebrew  before we close the character of this great man it will be proper to acquaint the reader with the reason of his assuming the name pius after the year   0  because even this is another testimony of his merit he received it from his patron prince albertus pius de carpi whose tutor he had formerly been and who on account of his singular desert adopted him into his family and contributed large sums toward defraying the charges of procuring and correcting manuscripts preparing three fonts of italick greek and hebrew characters entertaining so many learned correctors and such a number of workmen beside the other charges common to every printing house his chief correctors were peter alcyonius demetrius chalcondylas marcus musurus and alexander bondinus  the mark of his printing house which shall be given with the rest of the marks or rebuss of the printers of the   th century at the end of this book was a dolphin twined about an anchor and nibling at it signifying his close and indesatigable application to business which he went through with deliberation and judgment chevillier tells us that he took it from the emperor titus and that peter bembus who was afterward made a cardinal presented him with a silver medal which had that emperors head on one side and on the reverse a dolphin twisting himself round an ahor this was likewise according to some authors the device of augustus the emperor  festina lent  the anchor being designed to signify rest as lightning or the dolphin were to denote swiftness these titus afterward expressed by the dolphin signifying swiftness and an anchor designed to stop the course of a ship denoting slowness aldus himself seems to hint at this signification when he tells prince carpi in his epistle dedicatory prefixed to procluss sphere anno      sum ipse mihi optimus testis me semper habere comites ut oportere aiunt delphinum and anchoram nam and dedimus multa cunctando and damus assidue  that he could testify for himself with the greatest sincerity that he had always those two companions with him which they say are so necessary viz the dolphin and anchor and published many things with deliberation and yet without intermission his son paul who was printer to the vatican his soninlaw a de azola and his grandson aldus used the same mark  some vile printers of florence finding the impossibility of equalling alduss editions resolved to counterfeit them as well as his rebus and carried on the cheat for some time till it was discovered by means of a mistake committed by the engraver who reversed the dolphin so that his head was on the left side of the anchor whereas in alduss mark it was on the right whether his soninlaw andreas de azola first perceived this difference i will not affirm but he first gave public notice of it to prevent the worlds being any longer imposed upon this passage in the preface to his livy in  vo anno      is given at full length in the margin extremum est ut admoneamus florentis quosdam impressores cum viderint diligentiam nostram in castigando and impimendo non posse assequi ad arts confugisse solitas hoc est grammaticis institutionibus alds in sua officina formatis notam delphini anchorae involuti nostram apposuisse sed ita egerunt ut quivis mediocriter versatus in libris impressionis nostrae animadvertat illos imprudenter fecisse nam rostum delphini in partem sinistram vergit cum tamen nostrum in dexteram totum demittatur  i am sensible that in this sketch of the history of that printer i have exceeded in many cases my proposed limits yet i hope the worth and character of the person will sufficiently excuse me for not keeping too scrupulously to our epoch  the works which we have of him from      to   00 are in number twenty four fourteen of which are greek and the rest latin or latin and greek  the reader may easily perceive how short this list comes of the number which we might have reasonably expected from so industrious a printer within the space of six or seven years especially considering that as himself assures us he published an author every month which amounts to almost four times our number whether the rest are perished or are still latent in some libraries i shall not determine but am willing to hope the latter and that time will by degrees bring them to light  however he still continued printing many years after the close of the century and took his fatherinlaw andreas de azola in latin azolanus in partnership with him as to the time of his death or any particulars of it i have not been able to discover any thing certain i shall therefore conclude his history with a remark or two concerning an edition of his which i hope will not be disagreeable to the reader it is that of poliphili hypnerotomachia written by franciscus columna to prove that all the world is but a dream wherein he relates many things worth learning it has been supposed to be printed at treviso anno      because at the end are the following words tarvisii cum decorissimis poliae a more lorulis distineretur misellus poliphilus mcccclxvii kalendis maii i e when the unfortunate poliphilus was in love with the charming polia       this they thought to have been the year when the book was printed whereas mattaire and orlandi observe that the words plainly demonstrate it to be the year in which colonna finished it besides it is evident from the character the registers directionwords commas interrogatory points and other particularities as well from the last leaf which contains the errata and concludes thus venetiis mense decembri mid in aedibus aldi manutii accuratissime that this edition came out from alduss press however orlandi tells us that this leaf was designedly torn off because there is no date of the year in which it was printed but mr mattaire gives us an account of these errata page     which bore this title gli errori del libro fatti stampando liquali corrige cosi then follows the errata containing fifty nine full lines a greater number than aldus ever put at the end of his works after the errata are the latin words abovementioned venetiis etc it is plain from this that      was the year in which the author finished it at treviso and the date of the edition      with respect to the authors name orlandi deduceth it from the initial letters of each chapter which being joined together form these words poliam frater franciscus columna peramavit orland page        the remainder of the venetian printers to ann   00 are as follows     antony moretus of brescia   edit          jerome de alexandria     antony zanchi or de zanchis   edit          otinus della luna of pavia   edit from      to        00 john alvysius de varesio milanese   edit        0  barthol justinopolitanus   0  gabriel de brisighella   0  john bissoli   0  benedict mangi of carpi  we have but two editions of these four partners viz phalaris epistles  to      and aesops life and fables  to   00 both in greek the former of these editions has a privilege from the senate of venice for their sole printing of it during the space of ten years and an epistle of bartholomew justinopolitan to contarenus a senator of venice wherein he complains of the great abuses which were crept into the art of printing and the disadvantages thence arising to the common wealth of learning through the ignorance and negligence of printers which increased every day among them he seems therefore rather to have been an editor than a printer and to have hired the other three to print in partnership with him   0  antony de guzzago of brescia   edit        0  sebastian manilius a roman and partners   edit        0  john bapt sessa of milan   edit        0  zachariah caliergi of crete he was a very eminent printer of greek we have two editions of his both of      viz simplicius comment upon aristotles cathegorics fol and etymologicum magnum fol in greek the last of these printed at the desire of a constantinopolitan lady he removed to rome and printed there till ann      if not beyond and the lexicon varini was printed by him in that year   0  lucantonius de giunta or zunta of florence   00  all the printers of this name de giunta or zunta have been persons of the most distinguished merit for their performances at rome florence lions and venice their common rebus or mark was the flowerdeluce and sometimes the eagle the first of that name is this lucantonius giunta a man of noble extract who employed john de spira to print for him at venice  whether this spira was a son or grandson of one of the two brothers who first brought the art to this city is uncertain however the giuntas signalized themselves in that art till the middle of the sixteenth century the following edition is the only one we know of printed by him before the close of this century viz regulae sancti benedicti sancti basilii sanct augustini and francisci collectae atque ordinatae per d j franc brixianum monachum congregationis s justinae ordinis s benedicti de observantia  to cura and impensis nobilis viri luc antonii de giunta florentini art and solerti ingenio magistri johannis de spira idibus april venetiis some of the impressions of matthew capcasa at venice      are said in the colophon to be printed at the desire of lucant zunta   0  nicholas blasti one greek edition dated   00    0 albertine vercellensis   edit dated   00  these are all the printers hitherto known to have wrought at venice from the time of its receiving the art to the year   00 but there were many more who as was hinted before made a trade of reprinting some of the best editions in a slovenly incorrect manner and to undersell the good ones for which reason they did not dare to set their names to them father orlandi gives us a list of  0 of them done at venice during that interval the greatest part of which i am apt to suspect are of that sorry kind  chap v of the three first printers at paris and their successors the encouragement which they met with some account of the books printed by them with other particulars a second printing house set up in the louvre by king lewis xi rest of the paris printers whoever desires a complete account of the first settlement progress and improvement of the art of printing in the city and university of paris the metropolis of france will find that subject copiously treated of by de la caille in his origin de limprimerie printed anno      and more particularly by chevillier in his origin de limprimerie printed at paris anno       these two authors have chiefly confined their history to that kingdom and as they had all possible opportunities of searching the records and libraries of that university have been enabled to acquaint the world with a vast many particularities relating as well to the art a to the most eminent printers there but since an induction of them would swell this work to too great a bulk i shall select the most curious and material parts and refer the reader for the rest to the authors before mentioned sufficient reasons i hope are already given against the opinion of those who contrary to all the most incontestable records assert that nich jenson first brought printing to paris this particular is further confirmed by the two last mentioned french historians whose account of that matter is as follows  some time before the year    0 william fichet and john heynlim de lapide or lapidanus two famous doctors of the university of paris and of the college of sorbon observing the progress of printing in several cities of europe began to use their utmost efforts in order to introduce it not only into that city but even into their college where they might give it all necessary help and encouragement they were both persons of great reputation for their learning and public spirit the former was a savoyard by birth and a great restorer of the long neglected art of rhetoric and all polite literature the latter was a german and had been rector of the university and prior of the college of sorbon to which last dignity he was chosen again about this time as there were then but few if any except germans eminent in printing lapidanus undertook to bring some of the most skillful thither this could not but seem easily attainable by him who had such a numerous acquaintance amongst the learned in germany and is supposed upon good grounds to have been of the same diocese if not the same city with uldric gering a native of constance the latter being influenced by the kind invitations of a person of such esteem who promised him the college of sorbon for his abode and his assistance in procuring and preparing manuscripts and revising his editions and allured by the hopes of considerable gain in so rich a city wherein the art was yet unpracticed brought two other countrymen with him viz martin crantz and michael friburger or de columbaria or colmar in alsace to paris where he set up presses in the hall of sorbon and in the year    0 published the first book that ever was printed in any city of france except that of tours mentioned in a former chapter father orlandi tells us that lewis xi gave fitchet and lapidanus orders to send for some of the best printers to paris at his own charge and that by this means the three german partners were induced to settle there chevillier takes no notice of this but attributes the honor wholly to the sorbonists however it is certain that this king was a great encourager of learning as appears by the magnificent library which he formed at his palace in paris whither he brought not only all the books which his predecessors and in particular charles v sirnamd the wise and charles vi had collected and set up at fountainbleau but likewise all that he could purchase at any rate together with a great number of editions printed at mentz by faust and schoeffer and what manuscripts he could not purchase he ordered to be curiously transcribed and to be set up there a remarkable instance of this mentioned by the french writers is as follows  the king understanding that the college of physicians at paris had in their library the works of rhasis a physician translated out of arabic into latin sent to borrow it in order to have it transcribed but the college representing it as against their constitutions to lend any of their books without a sufficient pledge his majesty was contented to obtain the use of it by depositing a large quantity of his own plate whether therefore the king or the two doctors brought the first printers to paris it is beyond doubt that he gave them sufficient encouragement and access to the library at the louvre with liberty to print from any of those volumes in the choice of which it is probable they were directed by their two patrons  as the art was then in its infancy at paris their first editions were in a large round roman character but greatly inferior in beauty to that of their contemporaries in italy their paper was smooth and strong though less white their impressions were maimed and imperfect with letters and words half printed and finished with a pencil the inscription and title of some epistles and the large initial letters of books and chapters were done with the hand for which a blank was left in the page they had no capitals nor regular spaces but were full of abbreviations in short there was nothing to recommend them except the newness and the beauty of the ink they used few rubricks and those only upon vellum some of their books begin at the folio verso or even page and all of them are without titles number of pages signatures or directionwords they used no signatures till the year      and then placed them not at the bottom but at the top of the pages they added neither date nor names of printer and place all which are only to be gathered from the prefaces or epigrams at the end or some other circumstances as will appear from the list of their works especially of those printed in the three first years    0      and      it is certainly very surprising that neither gering nor his two learned patrons who must infallibly have seen some of the italian editions especially those of rome and venice which had all these necessary ornaments should not make them sensible of their deficiencies in all those respects however so few were the elegant printers in those days that the learned men of paris who esteemed the art of more consequence than these embellishments failed not to acknowledge their obligation to the sorbon doctors for the services they had done to the university in settling the printers there upon whom they were equally liberal of their encomiums enough of these may be seen in chevillier page    and seq i shall only cite in the margin an epigram printed at the end of gaspar pergamensiss epistles which was their first impression and had prefixed to it a letter of thanks to those great men upon their bringing the art to that city  the epigram ut sol lumen sic doctrinam fundis in orbem musarum nutrix regia parisius hinc prope divinam tu quam germania novit artem scribendi suscipe promerita primos ecce libros quos haec iudustria finxit francorum in terris aedibus atque tuis michael uldaricus martinusque magistri hos impresserunt ac facient alios  is addressed to the city of paris and sufficiently shows not only that this edition was the first fruits of the art both in that city and kingdom against those who ascribe that honor to jenson but likewise that the parisians congratulated themselves for their success in introducing it thither since it gave the university an absolute authority over all printers and booksellers in the seven following particulars mentioned by chevillier page     viz    that all the printers and booksellers of paris after the first settlement of printing there have still continued in their former state that is been esteemed as agents and servants to that university   that they are obliged to take the oaths to the rector of it   that they are not allowed to follow that business till the university has judged them qualified for it   that the university exercises their jurisdiction over them by summoning them to appear etc by fining punishing and deposing them for any misdemeanor   that the edicts and ordinances of the king empower that body to visit and search all printinghouses warehouses for books and booksellers shops etc   that the university set a price upon their books which was affixed to their catalogues and placed in some conspicuous part of their shops lest any person might be imposed on by them this part of their province they exerted long before the art of printing was discovered over all transcribers illuminators booksellers etc   lastly that the booksellers etc should sell no books of religion etc till they had been examined and approved by the university or at least by the faculty of doctors of divinity we shall show in the third book of this history that the university of oxsord had the same authority over the printers and booksellers of that city  to return to our three printers they continued printing but three years at the house of the sorbon after which one of their patrons fichet being invited to rome by pope sixtus iv and the other intending soon after to return to germany they removed to st jamessstreet at the sign of the golden sun upon this they immediately rejected all their old punches matrices and letters and furnished themselves with some entirely new and printed several considerable volumes till the year      at which time crantz and friburger either returned into germany or at least left off printing for there is no edition with their names after that year but gering printed in his own name many years longer as shall be shown in its place in the mean time it will be proper to give the reader an account of this new set of characters which they made use of in their new house  it is to be observed that they were of three or four sorts all different from each other and from those used at the house of the sorbon and cast in new matrices one sort is vastly inferior to their former and resembles the handwriting of that time but such as was done stannea manu as aldus expresses it with a heavy hand  it is not however altogether gothic but rather like that which schoeffer used at mentz another sort was not unlike this in shape but of a much larger face the third was a roman much more round and fine than the two former but the fourth sort not used by gering till after the year      that is after his partners had left him is a very beautiful large roman which if we may believe chevillier who saw and compared them is in no case inferior to that of the spiras jenson or any other of the famous venetian and french printers either before or since thus gering attained to a degree of perfection equal with any of his brethren but was at last obliged to comply with the custom and print several books in gothic such as virgil and some others besides those for the use of churches the editions printed at this house and in these new characters are still defective with respect to their dates or printers names some wanting the one some the other and some both as appears by the list of his works given us by the forementioned author anno    0 gering took into partnership with him for some time william maynyal and in the year      removed from st jamessstreet and took a lease during life of a house belonging to the college of sorbon where he set up his old sign of the goldensun as he was now become very rich and had contracted an intimate friendship with the sorbon collegians he made them some considerable donatives both in books and money upon which account they chose him fellow of that college and assigned him chambers and commons in it and as he was not engaged in matrimony he took the more pleasure in conversing with them communicating his designs and using their advice about the books which he was to print and their assistance in correcting them in return for which he presented them with copies of all his editions it was no small advantage to that college which was called at first by the founder robert sorbon societas pauperum magistrorum parisiis in theologica facultate studentium to have so generous a friend and benefactor admitted into it who requited them for this honor with vast legacies left by him in his will to this college and that of montague in the same city for by his success in printing till anno    0 in which he died he had amassed a prodigious quantity of wealth all which he bequeathed to those two colleges what he endowed the sorbon in particular with was sufficient to maintain eight fellows to be added to those on the old foundation and two lectures every day one in the morning for the old and another in the afternoon for the new testament besides several other donatives to those of the house whom he had a particular esteem for  now considering that he was the first printer of that city and kingdom that he was invited thither by the college of sorbon that he had been so great a master of his art and so liberal to that poor society in his lifetime and after his death the reader may perhaps expect to hear of some monument erected by them to his memory but it is plain from what chevillier a fellow of that college tells us that they did not so much as set a gravestone over him to let the world know where that great man was buried so that our last mentioned author after a vast deal of pains could not gain the least certainty about it however to do them justice they ordered an anniversarymass to be said on the   d of august on which he died who his correctors were is difficult to determine but it is probable he made use of any of the collegians whom he pleased he had some other partners besides maynyal beforementioned and instructed several printers who signalized themselves both during his life and after he died there were likewise diverse other printinghouses set up at paris soon after his of which we shall speak when we have given some further account of his works chevillier in his list of them divides them into three classes viz those which he printed with his two partners in the college from    0 to      next those printed at the golden sun in st jamessstreet till anno      and lastly those which he printed from that time till his death either by himself or with his other partners of the first class there are eleven editions still extant all printed in the same character some of the first of which have epistles affixed and inscribed by fichet abovenamed to several princes and prelates and are dated    0 and      one of which to cardinal bessarion has the following aedibus sorbonae scriptum impressumque uno anno and septuagesimo quadringentesimo supra millesimum those of the second class are    in number and sixteen of the third class exclusive of those which he printed after the year   00 all which the reader will find either in chevillier or mr mattaire gerings last work is dated   0  which shows that he left off printing two years before he dyed for his death did not happen till anno    0 aug    the next printing house to that of the three germans last spoken of was set up by    peter caesaris and   john stol      these two printers were likewise natives of germany but had already studied sometime in the university of paris where the former had attained to the degree of master of arts these two became acquainted with their countryman gering and informed him of their design of setting up a printing house begging his assistance and instructions therein which he readily granted and thus was the second press set up at paris by these two learned persons who became soon after no less famous for their industry and application than they had been for their learning they pitched upon one of the houses belonging to the college of sorbon to print in which chevillier tells us was in st jamessstreet at the sign of the soldier and swan their character was short of the beauty of uldric gering though far from being of the gothic kind this may be one reason why a great many of their works are lost they were likewise guilty of neglecting to affix either their names or dates to their works so that the former is only to be gathered from the likeness of the character to their other works that are printed in their names and the latter is either supplied by some circumstance or wholly guessed at  their first work is supposed to be the speculum zamorae which though printed without date yet is known to have come out anno      by the epigram at the end one of their finest impressions is that of ochams decalogue which naudeus thought to have been done by gering but chevillier who has compared them with other of their works assures them to have been printed by them we have but ten editions of theirs from      to   00 but they continued printing beyond that time especially caesaris the next paris printer was    peter caron of whom we have but one edition dated         pasquier bonhomme      he printed the chronicle of france and that of st dennis in three volumes fol a scarce book and the only one we have left of him it is dated         anthony verard    0 he was one of the most considerable printers and booksellers of his time and very eminent for the curiosity and number of his ditions the greatest part of his books consist in romances and the like printed in a gothic character but so elegant as to please the eve extremely many of them are printed upon fine vellum la caille tells us that there are above an hundred volumes of his romances printed curiously on vellum embellished with exquisite miniatures or small cutts painted in water colors in imitation of the manuscripts which he printed after all which are to be seen in the french kings library however though he engaged most in romantic pieces yet he likewise published several learned volumes all in french with equal care and beauty in the same gothic letter  he kept his printing house and shop upon the bridge of notre dame at the sign of st john the evangelist sometimes he subscribes his books only with the first letters of his name a v his mark is enclosed with four french verses in a pious strain the reader will find them in the margin pour proyoquer ta grand misericorde a tout pecheur fair grace and pardon antoine verard humblement te record tout ce quil a il fient de toy pardon  whatever is become of the great number of his editions some of which were printed by the french king charles viiis order i can find no more in orlandis list than    from    0 to   00  the rest of the paris printers are as follows    nicholas

native of paris and rather a bookseller than a printer he is justly esteemed one of the most eminent and industrious ones of his time he kept the greatest number of the best workmen of any of his contemporaries with no less than fifteen presses continually at work at his own charges whilst himself was engaged in the business of his shop at the silver lion and procuring the most skillful correctors to revise his works he gained a prodigious reputation by the beauty and correctness of his impressions which though printed in a gothic character are much esteemed by the curious he began to print anno      though some copies of editions by several former printers have likewise his name as mr mattaire informs us yet all have not he continued printing till anno      and many of his impressions are as scarce as they are curious the learned henry stephens father of so many great printers of that name was so well satisfied of his merit that he was glad to have him for his partner with wolfgang hopyl mentioned above who was a printer of much older date petit became so famous both for the beauty and correctness as well as the number of his editions that he was afterward sworn printer and bookseller to the university of paris and chosen syndic or master of that company among those printers which he employed was the famous jodocus badius who printed several considerable editions for him in the title page of his books he used the words petit a petit by little and little alluding to his own name which he also used for his motto the books which we find printed in his name from      to   00 are only three the first of which is much valued by students in law viz  modus legendi abbreviaturus in utroque jure  vo per jo petit parisiis      for as we hinted before abbreviations were become so frequent and intricate in most sciences but especially that of the law that such a help as this was become absolutely necessary     john dryart we have but one impression of each of these dated          simon colin we have but one impression of each of these dated          godfrey marnef we have but one impression of each of these dated          michel tolosa   edit        0 alexander aliate   edit of each   00     thielman kerver   edit of each   00  we find also in orlandis list about    editions without printers names  before i dismiss this chapter i cannot omit observing that paris has been a noble patroness of the art of printing it is true venice is justly famed upon this account yet it ought to be remembered that most of her celebrated printers were of the french nation and signalized themselves as much in this art as any other nation and that paris excelled all other cities of that kingdom in this respect the encouragements which their kings and the learned of that and other countries have given the art and the care of the university over the printers have contributed extremely to the great improvements made therein besides this the french have shown an extraordinary genius and skill in the cutting of their punches for all languages they have been very curious about their paper and more particularly in adorning their editions with cutts head and tail pieces initial letters rubricks and other embellishments of that nature this i mention not so much with respect to the   th century as to the following no city has produced a greater number of the finest bibles than paris their large royal and polyglot bibles are justly esteemed masterpieces of that kind their editions of general and provincial councils of canon and civillaw the works of the fathers chronological and historical books and in short in every art and science are very numerous rich and valuable and many of them contain seven eight and ten large volumes and some twenty thirty and even thirty seven as the acts of the council printed by the famous anthony vitre at the louvre the women likewise were very eminent in this province and particularly charlotte guillard the widow of berthold rembolt ulric gerings partner who for the space of  0 years kept several presses and printed a great number of large and correct editions both in latin and greek her best editions were published after she became a widow the second time viz the bible the fathers in particular the works of st gregory in two volumes were printed so accurately that the errata contained but three faults her fame at last increased so that the learned lewis lippoman bishop of verona made choice of her to print his catena ss patrum in genesim which he finished in portugal this edition she performed so much to his satisfaction that when he assisted at the council of trent he came on purpose to paris to return her thanks and prevailed upon her to print likewise his second volume viz catena in exodum which she performed with equal beauty and correctness these with many other particulars relating to that admirable woman may be seen in chevil p    and seq  as paris has always abounded in excellent printers and furnished most other cities of europe with some of them so on the other hand it must be owned that it has produced several equally bad who have published many wretched editions and it is probable they might have still increased had not the university checked their growth for as it has such power over all printers and booksellers as to refuse admitting those into the business who are not sufficiently qualified and to turn them out of it or suspend or fine them for any misdemeanors as was hinted before it can more easily restrain them than where such checks are wanting however those whose merit recommends them enjoy all the encouragement they can reasonably desire both from their princes and the university they are endowed with privileges exemptions and immunities beyond any other city and have had frequent opportunities of raising themselves to great dignities of acquiring large estates and in short every thing suitable to their merit  chap v the settlement and progress of printing in the cities of cologn milan    0 strasburgh bolognia and treviso      the names dates and other particulars of their printers article i cologn    0 the city of cologn which is one of the most opulent hanstowns in the empire and an archiepiscopal see pleasantly situated upon the rhine by its nearness to mentz must necessarily have receivd the art of printing very early we have taken notice in the first book of this history that some of fausts servants left him even before the taking of that city and settled at cologn and the author of the chronicle of that name mentions it as the first city which received the art after mentz it is unquestionable that if her first impressions had been preserved we must have given it the precedence to almost all the cities hitherto mentioned but whether the first printers of it neglected to add their own and the cities name at the end of their editions a fault too common in those days or whether their works were too inconsiderable to be preserved it is certain that there is no book as yet known printed there with an authentic date before this year    0 which is the reason why according to our proposed method we can allow it no higher rank we have indeed in the introduction to this second book taken notice of one of the most eminent printers in this city viz john koelhoff who antedated some of his impressions but i hope the reader is fully satisfied from the reasons which we have given there that he began not to work so early since one of his dates is even much older than either himself or the art of printing cologn did not abound with great printers during the first  0 years viz till   00 though in process of time it became very famous in that art as well by those who lived in it as those that dispersed themselves into many cities of europe it is called colonia agrippina in latin from the empress agrippina neros mother the following are all the printers we know of till the end of the   th century    conrard winters de hombergh a citizen of cologn of whom we have but one edition dated    0   peter de olpe   edit both        arnold terborn or terburn   edit from      to        john koelhoff de lubeck   edit from      to      besides the two following ones which though printed with his name have a date manifestly false   flores de diversis sermonibus and epistolis b bernardi per me joan koelhoff de lubeck coloniensem civem impressi anno mcccc feliciter finiunt the reader may see by the time in which he printed that either the last c must have been taken up by the balls or omitted by the compositor and that it was done anno   00 or that some other figures are wanting to the date but it appears to me to be done by design rather than mistake    silvii senensis epistolae

are of a later date by several years than that of the book so that it must necessarily be false    henry quentel an excellent printer though omitted by the last annalist father orlandi continued printing long after the year   00 and had a son peter quentel and a grandson john quentel who likewise distinguished themselves for the goodness and correctness of their editions we have but   edit of his from    0 to   00    john guldenschayff   edit from      to       mr mattaire mentions likewise some bibles and a few other books printed here without printers names  article ii milan    0 milan in latin mediolanum is one of the four chief cities of italy situate near the rivers adda and tesino and said to have been built by the trojans after their expulsion by bellover king of the gauls this city after a variety of chances and wars was almost ruined by frederic barbarossa but now flourishes under the emperor of germany it received the art of printing very early and had many excellent artificers from the beginning whose works are equally valuable with those of any other cities we cannot positively affirm any thing concerning the time in which this art was brought hither nor who were the men that set it up the first both in time as well as excellency was    anthony zarot    0  he was a native of the city of parma though of cretensian parents as appears by some of his colophons and gained a great reputation for  0 years in which he continued printing by his elegant and correct impressions in a beautiful roman character which are sufficiently known among the learned he was obliged indeed to comply with the custom in printing some editions in old gothic yet even thse have all the elegancy and beauty they can admit of he is esteemed the inventor of signatures or alphabetical letters at the bottom of every sheet which at first he placed under the last line of the page where they ought to be but afterward he put them upon what account is hard to guess at the end of the last line so as to make them serve as it were for the last word in the page this appears by his edition of john simoneta de gestis francisci sfortiae ducis mediol anno      this whim of his was not followed by any printer nor by himself long for he soon returned to the first method his main province was printing of classicks which he executed with extraordinary diligence and accuracy he is said to be the first that printed missals or massbooks for the use of the clergy who were hitherto used to ms ones that which he printed anno      had the four latin verses in red letters which you will find in the margin antoni patria parmensis gente zarote primus missales imprimit at libros nemo repertorem nimium se jactt in art addere plus tantum quam pepesse valet   his chief corrector was the famous peter justin philelphus a person of learning and great application especially in correcting the faulty editions which zarot was obliged to procure from rome or other places his next corrector was the learned p steph dulcinio prebend of scala who tells the marquess of palavicino to whom he dedicates the second edition of manilius anno      that he had corrected that author in above three hundred places and cleared it from the barbarisms and other faults of the transcribers as far as it was possible to be done in a very corrupt copy zarot continued printing till the year   00 from which time we hear no more of him  we have twenty six of his impressions still extant many of which have either an epigram or a colophon in his commendation some are without printer or places name and even without date the last of which must be guessed at the former are easily known by the particular beauty of his character and because he printed no where but at milan    philip de lavagna milanese    editions from      to    0 the last of which viz eusebii chronicon in latin is without date and has a latin epigram of six lines written in his commendation by boninus mambritius    christopher valdarfer de ratisbon an excellent artist who printed at venice from    0 to      then came to milan where he wrought till anno      if not beyond he made use of the same corrector here which he had at venice viz ludovicus carbo or carbone a native of ferrara we have but four impressions of his done at milan from      to         dominic de vespolate   edit from      to         dionys paravicino   edit from      to       the former also took another partner viz    james marlian of these we have   edit              ludovic piedmontese  and   albert piedmontese of these two brothers we have only one edition viz dantes comedies with comments the text is printed in an elegant roman and the comments in a fine gothic character with the colophon which you will find in the margin

sometimes together and sometimes separately till after the close of the   th century the former of them printed a great many of the classicks and is reported to have printed a very considerable number of law books many of which are not yet come to light their corrector was benedict rhethoricus the number of their impressions hitherto discovered from      to   00 amounts to        simon magnagus

barthol miniator   edit both   00     peter martyr montlegatius   edit   00  there are also many editions printed at milan from      to   00 without printers names fath orlandi tells us that he has on purpose omitted many works done at milan because his learned friend dr joseph antonio keeper of the ambrosian library in that city was then ann      compiling a history which would shortly appear under the following title historia literaria mediolanensis ab an    0 ad   00 qua occasion de origin and progressu typographiae libris editis intra illud tempus ac viris illustribus eo seculo in eadem urbe florentibus by this we may easily guess that we have as yet but an imperfect history of that city we may say the same of almost all the rest except those that have met with some learned persons who have taken the pains of searching the libraries in order to give a more perfect and full one of them such as that of paris nurembergh etc  article iii strasburgh strasburgh in latin argentina and argentoratum is an episcopal see and the metropolis of alsatia upon the borders of france celebrated for the number of learned men which it has produced and the beauty and magnificence of its churches towers buildings etc according to the poets description imprimisque altas propius fert inclyta turres argentina domus doctorum clara viorum    it was the native place of john guttenbergh to which after his disagreement with faust he brought the art of printing together with some of his artificers so that it may be justly esteemed at least one of the first cities that practiced it after mentz though all the monuments of it are so far lost to us that we know not any books with a certain date printed there before the year       we have seen in the first part of this history how much this city has been celebrated by some authors upon the account of john guttenbergh whom they supposed to have been the inventor of this art or at least to have laid the first foundation of it here though he was obliged to retire to mentz in order to perfect it but as this i conceive has been sufficiently confuted already it is unnecessary to repeat it here i have likewise given the reader an account of another controverfy in favor of strasburgh and john mentel started about two hundred years after the discovery of this art by dr mentel of the university of paris who asserted that his ancestor was the inventor of printing which discovery he was robbed of by a treacherous servant whom he suspects to be our famous john faust i hope i have fully exposed the vanity of this authors pretenses and his unfaithfulness in quoting testimonies in behalf of mentel against whom were there no other evidence it would be sufficient to allege that there is not one book printed in his name before the year     and that without any mention of the city of strasburgh  all that is proper to add at present is that our author to elude if possible the force of this objection affirmed that this book which john mentel finished anno      was no less than twenty years a printing and contained ten large volumes in fol so that it must have been begun about      i e four years before faust had printed any work in his name but this is a groundless conjecture  this book is the speculum morale of vincentius belvacensis a very voluminous work but that it should have taken up  0 years in printing is only said without any authority or testimony for it however we may allow it to have taken up some considerable time without lessening the validity of what has been heretofore affirmed after several eminent authors viz that john faust at his return from paris where he had been selling his printed bibles for manuscripts stayed some time at strasburgh where he taught mentel his art the only difficulty against it is that if thi last had been let into the secret so soon there would be some earlier and a greater number of his productions to be seen the former is easily answered by the sad experience we have of too many of the old monuments of the art being either lost or not yet discovered and the latter de la caille endeavors to account for who peremptorily asserts this mentel to be the same with john mentelen or manthen de geretzsheim who went and settled at venice and associated himself with the famous john de cologne one of the most eminent and first printers of that city about the year      with whom he printed several valuable editions mentioned in the chapter of venice  if this assertion be well grounded it is superfluous to seek for any of his works at strasburgh except the speculum beforementioned if even that was printed there but as la caille has not mentioned his authority i shall not dare to assert the truth of this too positively we must not omit taking notice that this john manthen continued printing at venice with his partner aforesaid till the year    0 as the reader may see by what has been said of him there whereas john mentel is affirmed by the dr from the authority of gaspar benegerus to have died at strasburgh two years before viz      in honor of whom the great bell of that city was ordered to be rung the sunday following obiit dominus johannes mentel sabatho post conceptionem virginis moriae an o mcccc lxx iix et factus est i pulsus cum campana magna dominica sequenti paraen etc page    which is never done but upon the death of a prince or some very great man i shall not take upon me to decide the controversy but only say that if the speculum aforesaid be mentels first edition at strasburgh it will follow that he was outstript at least by two years there by the famous henry eggelstein of whom we have only two volumes both printed anno      the last of which is perhaps one of the largest that ever was printed the paper of it being of an extraordinary size exceeding even that which is commonly called charta magna it has likewise another remarkable particular which is that the beginning and end of it are printed in red and is therefore the first edition done after that manner  the printers therefore of strasburgh from      to   00 are as follows   henry eggelstein abovementioned   edit dated        john mentel   edit viz vincentii speculum morale in ten large volumes fol and supposed to be printed at strasburgh though no mention is made of the place where it was done it is dated        martin flach or flachen citizen of basil   edit from      to   00   leorius usner citizen of strasburgh   edit from      to        marc reynhard of strasburgh   edit from    0 to      and   nicol de philippis of gernsheym   edit from    0 to        john prus   edit        george reynhard or de grunynger   edit from      to      he had likewise printed at rome as we have seen under that head anno      orlandi has likewise given us a list of    edit printed at strasburgh without printers names  article iv bologna      bologna or bolonia in latin bononia an ancient and famous city of italy at the foot of the alps upon the river rhine in the territories of the pope was formerly called felsina from felsinus king of the thuscans which signifies a shield this name she preserved above nine hundred years and always was eminent for the number of learned men and brave warriers which she produced this city afterward was called bojona from buoi king of the gauls and in process of time bononia and bolonia it is at this day a celebrated university endowed with extraordinary privileges from emperors popes etc and such a concourse of students resort thither that it is recorded of one of their doctors and professors the learned azzo that he was obliged to read his lectures in some public market places to above ten thousand students for these and other reasons not necessary to be given here it has been styled archigymnasium mundi and the mother and founder of universities bononia docet matter studiorum petrus ubique pater legumque matter   it is no wonder therefore that the art of printing received such early encouragement from it and that it had so many famous workmen eminent for the beauty and correctness of their impressions  it is likewise observable that it had not the art brought to it by foreigners as other famous cities rome venice paris etc but was obliged for it to one of her own citizens viz    balthazar azzoguidi anno      a person well born and of good education who set up his press in that city and continued printing at least till the year    0 after which we hear no more of him his editions are all in a neat roman character and printed with great accuracy the first of which viz ovids metamorphoses anno      has the colophon which you will find in the margin balthessar azzoguidi civis bononiensis honestissimo loco natus primus in sua civitate artis impressoriae inventor ad utilitatem humani generis impressit a m cccc lxxi  by which it is plain that he was the first who practiced the art of printing of which he improperly calls himself the inventor in his own city of bolonia we have    editions of him from      to    0   hugo rugerius of regio   edit from      to      and   doninus bertoch of regio   edit from      to        dominic de lapis   edit      to

harlem   edit from    0 to      the last of these did likewise associate himself first with   math crescentinus and afterward with  0 john walbeck so that   of the   editions abovenamed were printed one with the former and two with the last    balthassar de hyruberia   edit both         dominic de silvestro de cini   edit         plato de benedictis or dei benedetti of bologna      this printer has never been excelled by any person in the beauty and elegance of his roman character and as his editions are extremely fine and correct so he has taken care to tell the world of it in almost every colophon at the end of his books by adding some pompous title to his name such as impressor solertissimus artis hujus exactor probatissimus quam pulcherrimis characteribus etc he is thought to have either learned the art at venice or furnished himself with his fonts from thence the first is most probable because we find an edition of dion chrysostoms oration de regno  to supposed to have been printed by him at venice anno      but f orlandi thinks this supposition illgrounded and therefore has mentioned neither him nor that edition under the article of venice but has put it at the head of those printed by him at bologna where having found a book printed anno      entitled baptistae mantuani carmelitani parthenices he reprinted it with his own name and colophon all his impressions as yet known the two forementioned ones included amount to sixteen the last of them viz vegetius and others de re militari is dated         benedict hector      he was a very good printer and bookseller who employed many printers of this city and kept likewise some presses of his own agoing as appears by those impressions we have of him all which are so correct and beautiful that he is justly ranked among the best workmen of his time and ugerius de pontremulo has honored some of his impressions with epigrams in praise of him we have four and twenty of them still extant from      to         bacilierus or de bacilieris      bassalerus or de bassaleris      bazalerus or de bazaleris      we have but three editions of this printer from      to      in each of which he spells his name differently he was an excellent printer and a rival of the famous plato de benedictis whom he endeavored to surpass in beauty of letter finess and accuracy of his impressions which though they do not excel yet are not at all inferior to those of his corrival and he does not fail accordingly to give himself some of these pompous epithets which we have seen of the other and it is observed that some of platos impressions were no sooner come out of the press but bacilierus went immediately to work upon them and published another edition in a small time after such an emulation could not choose but have proved an honor and service to the art had it lived till now    john james fontanese   edit both dated         hector faelli bolognese   edit from      to   00    hercules nani   edit from

printing soon introduced gerard de lisa a flemming by birth and an excellent printer was the first that set it up here we can only say in general both of him and this city that the few editions we have left of theirs are very elegant and in a neat character    gerard de liza or lisis or gerard de flandria       we have but four editions of him the two first are dated      the third      and the last      which makes me hope that more of them will still come to light these being esteemed very curious not only for their elegancy but likewise for their correctness    herman lichthenstein or levilapis of cologn       this printer we have spoken of under the chapter of venice and we shall again mention him under the city of vincenza where he printed for some time at treviso we have only two editions printed by him both dated      he died anno      whilst he was printing that voluminous work of vincentius entitled speculum morale    bernard de colonia   edit              michel

and  0 peregrine pasquali   edit            there is scarce one printer to be met with in history who changed oftener his place of abode his partners and even his name than dennis bertoch who sometimes calls himself bertoch doninus and sometimes dionys sometimes de bononia and at other times de regio his first works viz for      to    0 were printed at treviso immediately after which we find him at venice where he stayed till      thence he removed to regio and associated himself with marc antony de baccilieris and lastly he settled at modena about the year      we find but two of their impressions under this head dated      and       but though we have ranked them under the article of treviso yet they bear no name of any place and may indeed be supposed done by them at venice where they printed about this time however i have chosen to follow f orlandi who thinks it more probable that they were done at treviso  there is an edition printed by peregrine pasquali at scandiano near the city of reggio but with a date impossible to be understood or guessed at  it is as follows  diligentis ac ingeniosi calchographi peregrini pasquali exactissima tum opera tum cura haec candidi

  these three cities though distant from each other we have joined together at the end of this chapter for the sake of the editions printed at each of them in the same year      which were too few to deserve a distinct article since we meet with no impressions at either of them except the four following viz    at ratisbon an imperial city in germany upon the danube servii comment in virgilium fol

the kingdom of that name in italy it was formerly governed by kings of its own but afterward became subject to the crown of spain and is now under the emperor of germany this city has been the residence of men of the most distinguished wit and learning in ancient and modern ages as virgil who is said to have writ his georgicks here livy horace claudian petrarck bocatellus panormitanus laurentius valla the great restorer of latinity and eloquence perillus an elegant italian poet and many others of conspicuous merit the great number of learned men in this city particularly when printing became known and spread itself over europe was a sufficient inducement for some of the best printers to settle there but none encouraged the art and artists more than ferdinand iii king of naples whom we had occasion to mention before upon the account of the free access which the learned had to his person and their epistolary correspondence with him and who lived at the time of the infancy of the art as his learning was equal to the esteem he had for the learned i doubt not but it was he who procured the famous sixtus russinger a learned and pious priest who was a native of strasburgh to settle in his capital this seems more than probable not only because he was the first who set up a press at naples but from the great marks of esteem which that prince showed him insomuch that having discovered his intention to return to his own country he tried all possible means to divert him from it and even offered him a noble bishopric or any other preferment if that could have fixed him in his dominions but this venerable old man whether out of modesty or rather a desire of spending the small remainder of his days in his native city refused the kings offer and returned home laden with the presents of that generous monarch riessinger was not only a printer but a clergyman and famous for his great learning yet as he continued but a short time at naples we have few editions of his orlandi gives him a contemporary and fellow citizen viz peter of strasburgh who settled there about the same year but as i do not find that he printed any thing in company with riessinger or that any of his impressions are left i shall say no more of him  we have but four impressions of sixtus russinger or riessinger two dated anno      and      the other two without date they are all curious and correct and two of them have latin epigrams at the end in his commendation we dont find that he carried on the business after he came again to his native place

ancient manuscripts it was his first care that nothing should pass under the name of servius but what was truly his or any thing that was plain from the most ancient copies to be his might be maimed or wanting but because many persons choose to write the greek quotations with their own hands and there are but few to be met with in the old copies and their accents cannot be printed but with great

at naples about the year    0 as we have seen before after which he removed to florence and printed the abovementioned editions the first of which wants the places name but is reasonably supposed to have been printed there rather than at naples because its character is different from that used at the latter    antonius francisci venetian   edit        0 demetrius calcondilla milanese a native of crete       he was a person of admirable skill in the greek and latin tongues and at first a corrector of the press but afterward he turned printer first at florence and then at milan anno      where we have mentioned him under that article the only book known to have been printed by him at florence is a beautiful edition of homer in fol of which i have seen two copies it is printed in a fine greek character with a large margin and distance between the lines and considering that it was the first volume printed in greek is a very curious and valuable piece and bears the following title  homeri opera omnia cum textu graeco labor and industria demetrii mediolanenss cretensis sumptibus bernardi nerisii and nerii tenaidis florentinorum fol idib jan florentiae          francis bona corsi   edit from    0 to          bartholomew p florentine   edit               laurence francisci de alopa venetian       this was a very ingenious and famous printer both in the greek and latin tongues jo andreas lascaris a noble grecian and one of the most distinguished critics and poets of that time designing to revive as much as possible the study of those languages especially of the greek chose this laurence for his printer and corrected his copies it is remarkable that his editions in the greek are all printed in fine capitals throughout the use of which was till then unknown if we except four or five to be met with in some old impressions and manuscripts mr mattaire has given us a short specimen of the first of these curious editions with the preface of lascaris in latin capitals likewise interspersed with greek words the figures and letters of which as well as the number of words in each line and of the lines in each page answer exactly to those of that edition he has added some remarks upon them which the curious reader may find in his annals typograph from p     to     we have five editions of his all in greek the first and second are dated      and      the rest are without date     laurence morgiani   edit from      to          john of mentz   edit from      to          societas colubri or the fraternity of the snake   edit          philip junta or de junta

ferrara is an ancient city built in the time of theodosius ii surrounded afterward with a strong wall by the exarch of ravenna it was made an university by the emperor ferdinand ii and has always bee famous for men of learning and valor and for ingenious artificers an      it past from the dominion of the marquesses of este to that of the popes of rome under which it has continued ever since hither the art of printing was brought by one of its own citizens viz    andreas gallus       it appears by the colophon to his first impression which you will find in the margin impressi andreas hoc opus cui francia nomen trdaidit at civis ferrariencis ego etc  that he was either a frenchman or of french extraction though a citizen of ferrara which last might be bestowed on him upon the account of his being the first person who set up his press there the like encouragement having been given by many other cities to their first printers but whether he brought it thither from some other place or devised it at home as cennini did at florence is neither easy nor very material to guess he was a good printer and his editions are still esteemed by the curious  we have but twelve of them extant from ann      to       the rest of the printers of ferrara are as follows    carnerius augustinus whose father bernard augustinus was a bookseller of the same city we have four editions of his from      to      one of which viz boccacio in italian is the first poem printed in that language it has neither date nor name of printer or place but the character shows it to be augustines    severus of ferrara   edit         severinus bookseller of ferrara but whether this and the former be the same or father and son is uncertain we have but one edition of his viz alberti trotti de vero and perfecto clerico  to      in which he writes himself per severinum bibliopolam ferrariensem this edition orlandi tells us was afterward reprinted at lions ann      with a latin preface importing that it was about seventy years since severinus bookseller had published it at ferrara by which it would appear that he had printed it ann      even before either that city or even rome had received the art our author therefore guesses the mistake to be in the word septuagesimus annus which he thinks was printed instead of sexagesimus which last brings it almost to the very time    the fifth and last printer was laurence rossi or rubeus of whom we have   editions from      to       there are a few more without printers names the last of which is the history of pope joan in italian       article i the city of nurembergh      nurembergh or norimbergh in latin norimberga is a free city in germany upon the confines of swabia franconia and bavaria situate upon the river pegnitz it was formerly a democratical commonwealth but upon some domestic sedition it reduced itself to an aristocracy in the reign of the emperor charles iv under the government of twenty four senators chosen out of so many of their ancientest families which form of government has been continued ever since the city is very rich large and populous surrounded with a double wall above eight miles in circuit and   0 lofty towers it was always celebrated for producing the best artificers in every kind of handicraft and particularly for a beautiful metal of their own making called nurembergh copper the composition of which was kept with all imaginable secrecy within their walls every workman being first sworn to it so that the metal was almost equally dear with silver till about the latter end of the last century one of their own citizens came over and sold the secret here in england which has made it more common and consequently lessened the price of it this metal i purposely choose to mention because it was reckoned very excellent for making of matrices being far more ductile than the common copper and not so apt to break the punches  it will be no easy matter to fix the time when the art of printing was brought to this city john andreas endlers a printer of nuremberg who published a piece on printing in high dutch anno      and in it has given us an account of its progress in that city acquaints us that he had met with some ms annals which affirm that the art was no sooner found out at mentz but it was immediately communicated to nuremberg which did therefore receive it about the year      according to one or    0 according to another it is true our author is so far from being satisfied with their account that he has even taken the pains to confute them from more authentic testimonies however though i do not design to enter into a detail of that dispute yet i could not forbear mentioning thus much because it serves to confirm a former observation viz that not only the printers but likewise the cities themselves have taken no small pains to antedate their respective claims to this art  i have already taken notice in the first part of this history page    that the discovery of the art of printing had been attributed by purbach and peter ramus to that learned mathematician and astronomer john de monte regio or regiomontanus and mentioned maniliuss astronomy printed by him without date or places name our german author acquaints us upon the authority of gassendi one of the french royal mathematicians that regiomontanus came to nuremberg about anno      with a design to set up a printing house there in order to print his own works and those of other learned men with greater accuracy and speed and to improve the art of printing in several of its branches but that he met with so many obstacles to his design that he saw himself forced to make use of foreign printinghouses such as they were till one bernard walter offered to bear the charges of erecting a printing house for him as he likewise did toward many other curious inventions of his and enabled him to print purbacs new theory maniliuss astronomy and his own ephemerides for the use of the public  our author observes further that as this account of gassendis does quite overturn peter ramuss supposition of regiomontanus being the inventor of the art so it likewise shows him to have contributed much toward the improvement of it it likewise proves that there were some presses in this city before he came thither but who they were that set them up and what works they printed before that time is what he has not been able to find out because they have no dates or printers names  the oldest book he could find with a date is the commestorium vitiorum of francis de retza a dominican friar at the end of which are the words which you will find in the margin hic codex egregius comestorii vitiorum sacre theology professoris eximii francisci de retza ordinis predicatorum finit feliciter nuremberge anno  lxx o patronarum formarumque concordia and proportione impressus with this odd date  lxx o which our author seems to take for    0 this book was afterward reprinted by ant koburger anno      and afterward anno      under the following title summa quae destructorium vitiorum nominatur without printers name  the author mentions another book of the same date viz gerson chancellor of paris commentarium super sapientis hebrei cantica etc but as neither of these have the printers name we shall seek somewhere else for the first printer of nuremberg according therefore to our proposed method of the oldest edition known that rank will fall upon    antony koburger a person eminent for learning and the number elegancy and correctness of his editions which gained him the title of the prince of printers among the learned of his time at first indeed his character though of the venetian sort was somewhat imperfect and inferior to that of many of his cotemporaries but he afterward procured a new set which has been justly esteemed ever since as fine as any that have been used either before or after him he was no less solicitous in correcting his works so that though he was alone sufficient for that task yet he took the learned frederic pistorius for his assistant he spared no cost nor pains in procuring the best manuscripts and always desired the judgment of the learned before he ventured to print them the great jodocus badius has made this short but just panegyric upon him in a letter written to him anno      and printed at the beginning of the works of angelus politianus anno      litteratos omnes and colis and foves pervigilemque curam ad bonos codices vere terse and sine mendis imprimendos adhibes  that he was a great friend and lover of the learned and indefatigable in printing the best copies faithfully neatly and correctly mr mattaire has given us an extract of this letter in his annals typogr p    by which the reader may see what esteem this great man was in not only among the learned but likewise among the best printers of his time and it may be said of him that he printed more works than any of them particularly bibles of which the reader will find no less than    editions still extant one of which is in   another in   volumes in folio and a third with fine wooden cuts  he was no less diligent in printing other works and we are told by john and endters that he kept daily twenty four presses at work and employed no less than an hundred journeymen whom he maintained without doors they had a set hour to come to work and to leave off and he admitted none single into his house but obliged them to wait at his door till they were altogether and then they were admitted in and entered upon their respective works he was likewise a considerable bookseller and kept a spacious printing house at lions in france where he had sundry law books printed for him besides this he had his factors and agents in the most considerable cities in christendom and kept sixteen open shops beside warehouses and in all of them a considerable stock of the best books then extant so that he never was at a loss for any good editions to supply his customers with    thus he continued printing both at nuremberg and at lions with great success and applause till the year   0  if not beyond however we dont find any edition of his of a more recent date which makes me believe that he left off printing about that time in      james sachon one of his workmen at lions printed castellanuss latin bible for him with this colophon lugduni per jacobum sachon expensis antonii koburger the same is likewise dated from nurembergh but is supposed to be the same edition with that of lions he died in this year after having been for some time a member of the chief council of nuremberg all the editions that we have of him his bibles inclusive from      to   00 amounts to but thirty seven a number too inconsiderable for the many presses and workmen that he kept which gives me room to hope that time will discover a great many more    mr mattaire p    tells us of one adam of amberg the metropolis of the bavarian palatinate who flourished ann      but does not tell us where he wrought our german author says that he had met with a small treatise in  to of a sheet and half with his name and the city of nurembergh at the end so that he most probably resided there but though this work be without date yet his edition of ciceros orationes printed ann      though without places name may be so far presumed to be done here as to allow him the next place after koburger  the rest of the printers of this city are as follows    frederic creusner   edit from      to         john sensenschmid of eger         henry koler of mentz       and   andrew frisner de wunsiedel       koler was a native of mentz and in all likelihood one of fausts servants who left that city soon after it was taken and took sanctuary at nuremberg  the last of these viz frisner after having been corrector and assistant to john sensenschmid till      set up a printing house himself which appears from many of his books which bear his name as printer and editor he had studied for some time in the university of leipsick with a relation of his erasmus frisner a dominican friar who though but twenty seven years of age had composed several books the printing of which he committed to his kinsman andrew who printed them some time after at nurembergh where he dwelt as appears by several of his books from      till      after this having taken his degree of master of arts he removed again to leipsick where he was soon after chosen professor of divinity and attained even to the honor of rector magnificus of that university to which place he got all his printingtools conveyed he went from thence to rome where pope julius ii made him papae and sedis apostolicae primarius ordinarius by his last will which he made at rome ann   0  he left a noble legacy for the erection of a college at wonsiedel for the education and maintenance of young students of the family of the frisners which they enjoy to this day he left them also his historia lombardica which he had printed whilst at leipsick he likewise bequeathed all his printing materials to the convent of the dominicans of leipsick and expresses himself thus item i leave my iron chest presses instruments and other utensils and materials for printing together with twenty florens rhenish to pray for my soul and for buying the monks a better dinner than they used to have in the priors refectory  the day when they perform my bsequies  what use the monks made of the printingpress etc i can no where find we have but four editions printed by the aforesaid three partners from      to         conrard lentorius we have but one latin bible with the apostills of nich de lyra fol         george stuchs or flucks de sultzbach we have but one missal of his adorned with rubricks         gaspar hochfeder our german author calls him hochfelder   edit      and       with about  0 more without printers names  mr endters mentions some other printers before   00 but as he gives us no account of their works we shall say no more of them  before i leave the city of nuremberg i cannot but take notice that it is also famous for being the native place and constant residence of the great painter engraver mathematician and printer albert durer  mark antonio raphaels learned engraver gives him this character speaking of his skill in engraving and of his other excellent talents that if so excellent so exact and so universal a genius had been cultivated in tuscany instead of germany and had formed his study according to the excellent pieces which he might have seen at rome as the rest of our celebrated painters have done he would have proved the best in that respect that italy ever produced as he really was the greatest and most accomplished genius that germany could ever boast of  this great man was born ann      his father observing the early marks of his genius to all the liberal sciences spared no cost to have it improved by all possible means traveling excepted and by the best masters in germany but though his other talents have been highly celebrated by the learned yet i never met with any who took notice of his having been a printer no not even his countryman and fellowcitizen author of a piece on the subject of printing etc in nuremberg mentioned in the beginning of this article though several of his works are preserved in diverse libraries both public and private i have seen some of them very beautiful nor do i doubt but that his genius for painting and engraving led him to the other two branches of cutting upon wood and printing that he might be able to perform the whole work himself without the danger of having any part of it spoiled by unskilful hands and the better to print the descriptions of his cuts etc in a more elegant manner than could possibly be done in wood his improvement in the art of engraving or cutting upon wood was carried by him to its utmost perfection as all persons must own who have seen any of his works  the part of shadowing which is called crosshatching and which has been lost for many years and conducted if not wholly invented by him with such extraordinary beauty and truth joined to the uncommon luster of his ink has surpassed all the woodcutters ever since his reason for preferring this method of cutting on wood to that of copper plates were   the roulingpress which is wholly used in the later was not then so perfect as since   his most considerable works of which he was the author for he scarce printed any other being chiefly geometry perspective fortification and architecture as well as history wooden cutts were much the more eligible method upon several accounts especially when cut by such a masterly hand as his the only difficulty was to make it subservient to his historypieces but that he easily surmounted by the strength of his genius and those who have seen any of his performances even in this kind will readily own that nothing of that nature ever equaled them his usual mark was the initial letters of his name ad joined together thus albert durers printers mark but his most effectual way to prevent counterfeits was by giving his works a degree of beauty never yet attained to  with respect to his printing i have already hinted that he seldom meddled with any works but his own as i can find but as i have met with none done before the year   00 though he probably entered into that province before that time i shall not trouble the reader with a list of them but content my self with subjoining an account of a few of the most considerable which i have seen they are esteemed by the learned masterpieces of the kind and preserved as monuments of the authors merit being as follow    the history of the apocalypse consisting of a fine set of draughts upon that subject all cut upon wood with his own hand and with the utmost beauty and truth    the history of the four gospels done after the same manner and with the same beauty both these sets are printed with the common press with explanations and historical accounts of the designs placed either under them or on the other side or upon a distinct leaf they are both in fol    his book of proportions which he did not live to finish but was printed by his widow after his death is likewise esteemed another masterpiece in that kind i shall only add that the singular beauty of his ink the excellency of the press work and in a word the exactness of his performances do justly rank him amongst the greatest geniuss of the age i hope therefore the reader will excuse this digression in favor of a person to whom the world owes the great improvements made in the art of cutting upon wood which has been so serviceable to the printers in the ornamental part of their works  article v the city of verona verona an ancient city in lombardy famous for some noble relics of the old roman architecture such as amphitheatres triumphal arches etc which still retain some part of their former magnificence is likewise remarkable for having been the native place of several eminent persons in particular of cornelius nepos emilius maurus pliny vitruvius guarini and others it received the art of printing very soon yet made but small advantage of it we find very few printers in it and we have but a small number of their works left the first of them was    john de verona  who was a native of verona and son to nicolas a doctor of physic and the first who set up a printingpress in that city as appears by the colophon of the only book extant of his viz valturius de re militari liber fol per jo veronens veronae joannes ex verona oriundus nicolai yrurgiae medici filius artis impressoriae magister hunc de re militari librum literis and figuratis signis in sua patria primus impressit m cccc lxxiii  anno         felix antiquarius we have but   edit of theirs dated       and   innocent zileti we have but   edit of theirs dated         peter maufer    0  peter maufer was a frenchman and an excellent printer the first place where he set up his press was the city of padua about      as we shall show in its proper place thence he came to verona in      and after a short stay there went to venice in      and associated himself with nicol contengo as mentioned in the chapter of that city we have only the following book printed by him here  josephi opera latin ludovico contrada interpret fol per petrum maufer gallicum oct call jan pont max sixto   venetorum duce joanne mocenigo in inclyta civitate veronae    0    bonino de bonini de ragusio       who printed at first in the city of venice with andreas de paltasichis anno      whence he removed to verona and at last to brescia where he continued printing much longer we have but three of his editions done at verona      and         paul fridenperger of passaw in germany   edit      with a small number without printers names  article   the city of parma      parma is another ancient city in lombardy called by the romans gallia cisalpina situate in a very pleasant large plain and so well furnished with pasture ground that it is recorded by martial for the great number of cattle it bred tondet and innumeros gallica parma greges it was once under the popes government and given by paul iii to his nephews with the title of dukes of parma under whom it has continued ever since though this city received the art of printing so early as the year      yet it had but very few artificers and a small number of editions printed there it may indeed be reasonably supposed that these being so much inferior to those of venice rome paris etc have been mostly destroyed and the same may be said of many other cities however parma deserves to be remembered if not for the number and excellency of her printers yet for having given birth to some of the greatest of that time who were perhaps for want of sufficient encouragement here obliged to settle in other parts of italy among these were the famous antony zarot who printed at milan a great many fine and correct volumes as we have shown under that article fausto vincenzo and pellegrino del bonardi and bartholomew de parma in bolognia and matthew capcasa in venice mich manzoli in treviso with many more whose name and place of birth etc the reader will find in the article of each of those cities the first book we meet with printed here is the works of the famous lawyer baldus but has no printers name though it is dated at parma ann      however it is probable it was printed by stephen corali a native of lions who is the first in our list and printed or rather might reprint the same work the year following    stephen corali   edit from      to        augustine genoensis or of genoa   edit        andrea portilia   edit from      to        angelo ugoletti de parma   edit from      to      and near twenty more without printers names article vii mantua mantua one of the most ancient cities of lombardy situate in the middle of an island formed by the river mincio had its name and origin from manto daughter of tiresias a theban augur she bore a son called ocnus who built a city near the river po and from his mothers name called it mantoa or mantua after a great variety of changes it is now subject to the house of austria it has given birth to many learned men both ancient and modern and particularly to the immortal virgil this city cannot boast of any great merit with respect to the art of printing except that it was brought thither ann      by some germans who came to settle there but as it is probable for want of encouragement were obliged to remove we find but four of these printers at the most and at a considerable distance of time from each other of the two first we know but one edition and two of each of the rest as will appear from the following list    george and   paul germans   edit         paul john de burschbach of the diocese of mentz who was perhaps the same with paul german the latter of the two foregoing who takes now the name of his native town instead of that of his nation   edit              vincent bertoch of reggio   edit           and some others which have no printers names  article viii the city of derventer      derventer in latin daventria in lower germany near the river issel upon the confines of lower gelderland near the city of utrecht began to practice the art of printing ann      the  st impression done here viz prudentius aurelius poeta hispanus his poems  to has no printers name but is dated daventriae         richard pafradius   edit         james de breda   edit from    0 to      with about twenty more without printers names  article ix the city of padua      padua or padova in latin patavia or patavium so called by antenor the first founder of it in compliment to his companions who were paphlagonians and for whose sakes he called it by the name of their metropolis is a rich ancient and noble city upon the river brento and now under the government of the venetian republic famous for its hot baths and mineral waters and resorted to from all parts of europe it is one of the last cities we know of that received this art in the year      in which though it was not very eminent either for the number of printers or impressions yet it published several curious editions which had not as yet appeared in any of the foregoing cities the two first printers were    bartholomew de val de zochio of padua etc    martin de septem arboribus  of these we have but three editions                   peter maufer whom we have already mentioned under the articles of venice and verona we have four editions of his printed at padua from      to         laurence canozius de lendenaro   edit         albert de stendalia   edit         john herbert or herbort   edit           and one without date or places name    anton de carcano   edit         matthew de cerdonis de windischegrets   edit from      to         moses de castello   edit        0 jerome de duranti   edit      he wrought also in pavia with christopher de canibus ann          lewis or alois de como etc   edit          bartholomew de trossis   edit       with a few more without printers names  chap ix the cities of   louvain   ulms   utrecht ann        turin   genoa   brescia   alost ann      article i the city of louvain louvain in latin lovanium is a large populous and well fenced city the capital of all brabant and one of the most frequented universities in europe founded by john duke of brabant anno      it abounds with magnificent colleges and other sumptuous edifices according to that of the poet  postea musarum sedem collegiaque ampla  lovani aspicienda dedit it is likewise famous for the vast number of its students especially in divinity though the reader will scarce forbear wondering what sort of divines they must have been when we tell him that they had the art of printing near thirty years i e from      to   00 and god knows how far beyond and never printed one single bible in all that time at least as i can find in any annalist whereas we have observed that a nuremberg printer namely ant koburger printed at least a dozen in that time the truth is if we judge by the small number of workmen and of impressions done here we shall be apt to think that the art of printing met with but small encouragement since if we except the first printer of whom we shall speak presently i can find but two more till the year   00 after which whoever examines the second volume of mr mattaires annals typographici will find them run much thinner of either  the first press was set up here by    john de westphalia of paderbourn      an eminent printer invited to louvain by some of the heads of that university where he continued printing till ano      if we except   editions printed in his name if not by him the first in the town of alost in flanders not far from that of louvain anno      as shall be mentioned at the end of this chapter and the other viz epistola de simonia vitanda etc per rev magist engelbertum cultificis etc novimagii   julii       we have nineteen editions of his from      to      some of which are without date place or printers name but easily known to be his by the character    john veldener   edit of the fasciculus temporum      and         egidius vender heerstraten   edit      to      and five or six more without printers name  article ii the city of ulms ulms a considerable city in high germany situate near the danube between ausburg constance and strasburgh and famous for the finest linen and cambrick with which it furnishes most parts of europe began to set up the art of printing sometime before the year         john zeiner de reutlingen       was the first who practiced it there he was a native of reutlingen a small city in the duchy of wirtembergh which we have mentioned as one of the first in germany that received the art viz ann      this printer was in all probability the son or brother of gunter zeiner who worked at ausburgh from ann    0 and is mentioned under that article p     we have but nine editions of his from      to      two of which are the latin bible fol and one viz alvarius pelagius de planctu ecclesiae        vol fol in large paper is reckoned a very curious as well as scarce edition he used to subscribe himself sometimes jo zeiner de reutlingen or reutlinga and sometimes jo zeiner ulmensis oppidi incolam    leonard hol citizen of ulm   edit         john reger de kemnat   edit from      to       article iii the city of utrecht utrecht in latin ultra trajectum a city in flanders upon the rhine and subject to the emperor of germany received the art of printing about ann      if not before but its productions have been so few and inconsiderable that no annalist de la caille and f orlandi excepted has taken any notice of them and even the latter has been able to discover no more than three editions little remarkable either for bulk or beauty for which reason i suppose they are all three without printers name  article iv the city of turin turin in latin taurinum the capital of piedmont and residence of the dukes of savoy now kings of sardinia is situate upon the river durio nigh the po near the western alps it is a large rich and populous city and university strongly fortified and adorned with magnificent palaces churches and edifices it received the art of printing about ann      the first artists who set up their presses here were    john fabri       and   johanninus de petro       these two printed together at first as appears by their first impression viz breviarium romanum fol per jo fabri and johanninum de petro but fabri associated himself with martin huz a printer of the city of lions with whom he printed some editions and some by himself however he continued still at turin and we have three editions more of his printed there by himself from      to      wherein he subscribes himself jofabri lingonensis as for his partner we have nothing of him but the breviary abovementioned    nicolas de benedictis   edit from      to       and   jacopin svigus   edit from      to       article v the city of genoa      genoa in latin janua is a rich populous ancient city the metropolis of liguria and capital of the republic of genoa it is famed for having given birth to christopher columbus the first discoverer of america and for the greatness and extent of her maritime trade we meet with two noted printers who came and set up their presses there ann      viz    matthias moravus de olomuntz       and   michel monk or de monacho       but whether that city chose to drive any other trade rather than that of books or whether they found it already furnished from other places and so met with but small encouragement or for whatever other reason it is certain they tarried not long there for moravus printed but one book in company with monk and the next year removed to naples where he continued till ann    0 as has been said in the article of that city and we hear no further of monk the book they printed here is  supplementum summae quae pisanella vocatur fol per matthiam moravum de olomuntz and michaelem de monacho socium ejus x kal julii millesimo quadringentesimo lij quarto where lij stands for lxx       it is very likely that the ill success of these two printers frightened others from coming thither for we dont meet with any that ventured to settle there after them till a long time after the close of the century  article vi the city of brescia brescia in latin brixia an ancient and noble city in lombardy now under the republic of venice gave much greater encouragement to the art of printing than some of the last named cities about the year         henry of cologn and   statius gallicus  came and settled here and printed the following book the only one yet known to be printed by them here viz  homeri iliades per laurentium vallensem in latinum sermonem raductae etc viii kal december per henr coloniensem and statium gallicum brixiae         boninus de boninis of ragusio    0  whose first works were printed at verona ann      as has been said thence he removed to brescia where he continued printing till ann       his corrector was

after which he came to his own city brescia and printed sometimes by himself and sometimes with his brother angelo his corrector was a franciscan monk named angel de montelmo we have    edit of the former from      to      and   with both their names ann         arnold de arundis   edit without date    rabbi gherson       rabbi gherson was the son of r moses a jew of soncino where hebrew first began to be printed he settled first at brescia where he printed the two following editions in hebrew viz  mechaberith rabb immanuelis per rabbi gherson brixiae       biblia hebraice  vo per gersonem f mosis soncinatem ibid       chevillier tells us likewise p     that he printed also at riminium in romania a hebrew edition entitled col bo without date after this he removed his press to constantinople where he printed several other hebrew works till the year    0 in which he is supposed to have died    bernardine misenti de pavia came first from cremona where he had printed in company with caesar de parma ann      we have but   edit of his done at brescia from      to        0 francis laurini citizen of brescia we have only one edition of his viz homers iliads translated into latin by laur valla corrected by baptista farsengus a priest of that city      it has no places name but is supposed to be done at brescia  there are about  0 edit more without printers names  article vii the city of alost alost is a small town in flanders upon the river tever between brussels and gaunt in which the following printers set up their presses viz    john de westphalia         theodoric martin of alost       the former of these a native of paderborn printed in the city of louvain ann      till      as we have shown in that article we find likewise a book printed by him at alost ann      in company with theodoric martin a native of it as follows  liber praedicabilium  vo per jo de westphalia paderbonensem cum theodorico martini maii die sexto in alosto oppido comitatus

by the two great rivers rhine and brise which being navigable increase very much the commerce and riches of it so that in spite of all the calamities it has suffered in war it is one of the most opulent cities of germany the university is likewise very celebrated for learned men in all sciences and was founded ann    0 and endowed with privileges equal to any university in europe by pope pius ii in this city pope martin v called a council ann      soon after which it became famous for the improvements   which the art of printing brought thither in or before the year      received from some of its artificers who have been generally the best and most learned printers in europe and published the most elegant and correct editions of the ancient fathers and of the greek and latin classicks of this number were john amerbach and john froben of whom we shall give an account in the sequel of this article  the first book we meet with printed here has no printers name nor is it possible to guess from the character or any thing else in the edition who twas done by it is as follows  roberti de licio opus quadragesimale basileae         bernard richel      a citizen of basil and an excellent printer was the first who put his name to his editions there we have but three of them the first is his biblia latina fol per bernardum richel civem basiliae      the other two are dated              michel wenkler   edit from      to      the last of his impressions viz gasparini pergamensis epistolae  to f orlandi tells us in his list p     that this has neither date nor printers name but mr mattaire gives us the same edition under the names of michel wenkler and fred biel with some verses at the end as you will find in that author annal typogr p     only he or his printer has mistaken parmensis for pergamensis    nicholas kesler citizen of basil      of whom we have a biblia sacra printed at antwerp ann      and five other editions at basil from      to      his first edition viz textus sententiarum fol has the colophon which you will find in the margin in imitation of faust schoeffer and others anno domini millesimo quadringentesimo octuagesimo sexto octavo nonas martii non atramentali penna cannave sed quadam ingeniosa art imprimendi cunctipotenti aspirante deo in egregia urbe basilionsi nicolaus kslr selicuter consummavit   his last work viz libri deflorationum does not bear keslers name yet it being printed in the same character with the former is easily known to be his it has at the beginning the image of an old man with a triple face and these words over it sancta trinitas    john amerbach      john amerbach one of the most excellent and learned printers of his time was at first a student at paris under the famous jo lapidanus or a lapide who being rector of that university invited the three germans thither amerbach followed his studies till he attained to the degree of master of arts soon after which he came to basil and set up the art of printing for which he became as famous as he had been before for his learning  what countryman he was is not easy to determine some french annalists challenge him for theirs and orlandi calls him a parisian though perhaps on no other account than that he studied so long in that university his name is unquestionably german but neither the colophons of his editions nor his epitaph make any mention of his country for which reason we shall not pretend to affirm any thing upon that head his first care at his entrance into the business of printing was to get a font of the most perfect round roman which however he made no use of in his books of divinity the prevailing custom of those days being to print them in old gothic his next was to procure some of the best correctors of that age of whom though no person was more capable of correcting his works than himself he had a greater number than any of his contemporaries among these were martin dodo a prebend francis wyler a learned franciscan friar conrard pelican an eminent divine beatus rhenanus and others he was so careful and diligent in this province that he would not let one sheet pass unrevisd by himself reuchlin gives us this character of him in the preface to his book de verbo mirifico that he was a man of an excellent genius highly valuable for the neatness and correctness of his works and well skilled in several arts and sciences his former master jo lapidanus assures us i stud ego non favoris sed veritatis gratia ausim dicere quod non legerim libros hac art effictos quos tuis emendatiores exactiorique stilo consummatos probaverim vide chevil p      that he never read any books better or more correctly printed than his as amerbach was a man of singular piety and zeal for religion which appears from all his prefaces that scarce breathe any thing else so he rather chose to consecrate his labors to that than any other branch of learning this induced him to print the works of all the ancient fathers a task hitherto unattempted by any printer he began with an edition of st austin which he finished not till the year   0  in the old gothic but as he neither had a good manuscript to print after nor sufficient assistance from the learned we can only say that it was executed as correctly as could be expected in those times what he had most at heart was to publish st jeromes works which as he knew was impossible to be done without a competent skill in the latin greek and hebrew tongues the last of which he was too old and full of business to learn he made his three sons youths of bright parts divide that province among themselves who having studied those languages were obliged by him whether he lived or died to finish that edition which they faithfully performed but as this task wherein he was engaged was too large for one man he took the learned john froben whom we shall mention hereafter into partnership and printed several valuable and distinct volumes with him the greatest part of these particulars we have from erasmus in his prefaces to st austin and st jerome which later edition he revised and published anno      with a dedication to the archbishop of canterbury he highly extolls the piety of the amerbachs he praises the father for having taken such care of his sons education and the sons for the great progress they made in those tongues and for their piety in having so exactly fulfilled their fathers desire in the impression of a work which had cost them so much money and pains he frankly owns that as he stood in great need of some assistance for the hebrew tongue so he was chiefly beholden to those three learned brothers for it d erasm praefat ad s hieron opera  quod idem fecimus in hebraicis verum hac sane in part quod minus nostro mart poteramus

whilst his second impression of st austin was in the press it will not be amiss to repeat here a caution which we have elsewhere given the reader not to confound this john amerbach with john averbach of reutlingen who printed there a latin bible in fol ann      after which we hear no more of him la caille makes them to be the same person led undoubtedly into that error by the likeness of their names whereas the distance of time between them viz from      to      the different spelling of their names with other obvious circumstances might easily have shown him the mistake mr mattaire in the place before quoted has collected a great number of extracts out of prefaces epistles and other works of the learned in praise of him and it must be owned that too much could not be said in a mans commendation who had spent near  0 years in the service of religion with such constant zeal and application i shall refer the reader to that author for them and only add the epitaph which his youngest son boniface caused to be set upon his tomb  epitaphium joannes amerbachius hic cubat cum barbara ortenbergia singul pudicit foemina ac brunone basilioque filiis praepropere quidem hinc ereptis sed

froben      john froben was a native of hamelburgh in fraconia where he studied till he became master of the latin tongue and afterward went to the university of basil where he perfected himself in greek also and betook himself to the business of printing of which he showed himself so good a master that john amerbach took him as assistant and partner in his laborious and expensive undertaking of publishing the ancient fathers as we hinted before he acquitted himself so well both in this province and his own particular one that he acquired as great a reputation and esteem among the learned as his contemporary and partner to whom germany is obliged for bringing thither the neat round roman character hitherto scarcely known there and improving it to the last degree of perfection no person was ever more curious in the choice of the works which he sent to the press than he who had this excellent quality among many others that he would never print any bad books such as the sordid avarice of other printers had overstockd the world with but always chose the best authors and best manuscripts of them sparing neither cost in purchasing them nor pains in correcting and fitting them for the press in which though he was a man of singular learning yet he always preferred the advice and judgment of the learned of his time to his own among these were mark heyland erasmus wolfgang musculus jo oecolampadius wolfgang lachner and others all persons of the highest rank in the commonwealth of learning for which reasons his impressions have ever been and will continue in the highest esteem with all the learned he was likewise particularly ambitious to have his works correct and the abovementioned learned men assisted him very much in that province especially oecolampadius who tells us oecolampadius in his epistle at the end of erasmuss edition of the new testament in greek with a new latin version printed by froben ann      and dedicated to pope leo x  admirabile spectaculum mihi erat imo spectandum miraculum dictantem recognoscentemque quantum tria praela exciperent videre ac nihilo secius interim graeca latinaque exemplaria eaque varia and vetustissima consulentem graecos

temporis partem in hoc collocavit negotium  that he could not sufficiently wonder that erasmus who alone kept three presses continually at work who read and compared the greek and latin mnuscripts and consulted the writings of all the ancients and moderns etc could yet find time enough to correct the proofs of his works and adds that his example had not a little encouraged him to take the laborious task of a corrector upon him however neither frobens nor his correctors diligence could prevent that edition just now quoted in the margin from having an errata of a page and half though erasmus gave the finishing hand to every proof  this learned author in one of his letters to bilibaldus parcheimerus who was then at the emperors court complains highly of a great injustice done to many good printers in general and to froben particularly which was that he had no sooner published a good edition with great cost and labor but it was immediately reprinted by others and sold so much cheaper that he could never reimburse himself half his charges this reduced him to the necessity of obtaining from the emperor etc a privilege for the sole selling them for the space of two or more years according to the value of the work there being no other effectual way of preventing such an abuse the letter is dated from basil jan         the reader will find it in vita erasmi leyden edit      in   o page     what relates to our subject he will find in the margin plerique insidiantur homini propemo dum conjuati ut illum perdant ubi quid novi operis prodit quod putent fore vendibile mox unus atque alter suffuratus ex ipsius officina exemplar excudit ac venditar minimo interim frobenus immensam pecuniam impendit in castigatores frequenter and in exemplaria huic iniquitati facile

favore digna est quod nihil ex ea prodit ineptum aut seditiosum   we have had occasion to mention some cheats of even a worse nature with respect to the venetian editions which were counterfeited with the printers mark and sold for the right ones though incorrect and imperfect to the last degree  to return to froben he is reported to have hanged his proofs in public sight with a promise of a reward for every error that should be discovered in them by any person in his short preface to celius rhodiginus printed ann      he inveighs loudly against those pests of learning those printers who regarded not the correction of their works but had gain only in their view and advises the learned against buying such bad books for the sake of their cheapness assuring them that they purchased nothing but plague and vexation and that such wretched works could not but be dearly bought how cheap soever they were sold whereas he that bought a correct copy always bought it cheap how much soever he gave for it  parvo emit quisquis librum emendatum etiam magno emit magno emit quisquis codcem mendosum etiam minimo emit ibid   jo froben printed few volumes before the year   00 and the number of those which are extant is still smaller one of them was his concordance of the bible in fol ann      concerning which we meet with some particulars not unworthy the readers knowledge though a digression from our subject  first it was so exactly printed that there was not one error in all the numerical figures which in a work of that nature are at least one third part of the matter and is therefore very surprising froben added a second part to it which contained all the indeclinable particles that are to be met with in the bible this work was begun at constantinople by jo de raguza a parisian divine of the dominican order ambassador from the council of baden to the emperor jo paleologus about the year      yet he did little to it himself but left it to his three chaplains one of whom was a scotchman named walter sonaw who finished it in almost three years after this it was reduced into an alphabetical order by the directions of that council by john de segovia or secubia archdeacon of cujedo and doctor of divinity what gave birth to this second part of the concordance was no less remarkable john de raguza beforementioned coming to constantinople found the divines there engaged in a very warm dispute concerning the procession of the holy ghost i e whether from the son as well as from the father and that the controversy seemed chiefly to be about the particles ex and per i e whether it should be ex filio or per filium he was likewise informed that the sultan and all the mahometans having heard that paleologus designed a journey into christendom in order to reconcile this difference between the greek and latin churches had rallied the christians with no small scorn whom two such seemingly insignificant particles had divided to such a degree this ambassador failed not to acquaint the council with it who immediately ordered john de segovia to be ready to answer all the difficulties which the greeks should propose at their arrival at basil in the mean time the hussites and john huss of bohemia who were already at basil and insisted upon a communion in both kinds from the words of our savior unless you eat etc and unless you drink etc which their opposers said signified no more than unless you eat or drink from which they concluded that either the one or the other was sufficient to fulfill the command these i say made it still more necessary to have a concordance that should explain the meaning of those particles ex and per nisi and et and in how many different senses they were used in scripture this induced john de segovia to write the second part of the concordance relating to indeclinable words with a prolegomenon or preface in which he has given us this account of the occasion of it the learned sebastian brant author of the navis stultifera caused it to be printed by froben ann      and somewhat above twenty years after the same froben reprinted it with an elegant latin dialogue between a bookseller and the buyer relating to the value of good books instead of a preface to that edition the reader may see it at length in chevillier p   0  froben had two sons jerome and john who succeeded their father and published a great number of volumes with good reputation after his death which happened ann      erasmus tells us that what he had most at heart was to give the world a correct edition of st austins works and that he desired to live no longer than to see it finished ut inter familiares subinde dicere solitus fit se non optare longius vitae spatium quam quod absolvendo sufficeret augustino erasm epist ad ammonium tom   oper p      however he was deprived of that pleasure for j andendters tells us though he kept seven presses continually at work upon that edition yet not above two volumes of it were printed before he died to the great loss and grief of all the learned world the following epitaph written by his friend erasmus was afterward set upon his tomb  epitaphium joannis frobenii per desiderium erasmum rot arida joannis tegit hic lapis ossa frobeni orb vivet toto nescia fama mori moribus hanc niveis meruit studiisque juvandis quae nunc maesta jacent orba parente suo rettulit ornavit veterum monumenta sophorum art manu curis aere favore fide huic vitam in caelis date numina justa perennem per nos in terris fama perennis erit this epitaph was afterward printed according to la caille in henry stephens artis typographicae querimonia erasmus wrote another of four verses in greek which the reader may see in matt annal typog v   p     erasmus was not contented with writing the abovementioned epitaphs in his late friends praise but he made likewise a kind of funeral oration or rather elogium upon him in a letter to john emsted a learned carthusian the reader may see it at full length in the abovementioned annals vol   page    and seq  and indeed it was no more than he owed him since froben had long before given him a pleasure which few men beside him had ever tasted which was to see his own elegy before his death the occasion of it was as follows before these two were become intimate froben had heard that erasmus was dead and wrote much such another funeral oration upon him which he prefixed to an edition of that great mans proverbs which he published ann      erasmus could not but be highly pleased to see himself praised in so extraordinary and sincere a manner being well assured that such encomiums could not proceed from flattery or self interest for erasmus being supposed dead froben could have nothing to hope from him and had any but a man of frobens integrity and honor committed such a mistake one might be apt to suspect it had been wilfully done in hopes of procuring some valuable pieces from that learned author but whoever is acquainted with that printers character will undoubtedly believe him incapable of such mean arts i think therefore it will not be amiss to close the history of this great printer with some conspicuous parts of his character which we have not yet touched upon and which will easily acquit him of any suspicion which is that he was a man of the most disinterested and generous disposition erasmus in his letter to emsted abovementioned does even tell us that he was so to a fault and that he had often reproved him for it but in vain for his natural candor was proof against all admonitions of that kind neither did his munificence to men of learning and merit show itself only in the largeness of his presents to them but in the manner of bestowing them never says that author did he seem better pleased than when he had either by entreaties or by some cunning device prevailed upon them to accept of some favor from him the grief he showed in his countenance at their denial was such that they found it more difficult to refuse a favor from him than to obtain one from another person and when by chance continues he i have bought me some cloth for a gown he has privately sent and paid for it unknown to me as his house was open to all learned men so none had a heartier welcome than erasmus who used it as his home all the time he continued at basil and it is probable that he might have continued longer there had he not observed something in his family which he could not forbear grieving at froben was under petticoatgovernment which made his affairs go somewhat wrong wherefore he expresses himself thus to him in a letter dated from louvain fama tibi parta est ea poterit tibi magno emolumento esse si curam de tuo adhibueris sed mihi non placet domi tuae regnum istud muliebre etc but froben was of too easy and patient a temper to give himself any trouble about it we have a remarkable instance of this in the last year of his life when being seized with such a violent pain in his right heel that some physicians were for cutting off his foot he had no sooner received some easement in it than he went on horseback to frankfort about some business and though advised by his friends to stir seldomer abroad to go warmer in clothes and to spare himself as much as possible he refused to hearken to them and took such care to conceal his bad state of health and the anguish of his pain that he went still about his business till being seized with a fainting fit he dropped down and broke his skull against the pavement after which he continued two days without any sense or motion and expired ann      i hope the name and character of the person will excuse my account of these particularities especially since the great erasmus has thought them worth recording in a much ampler manner he left two sons jerome and john who became excellent printers and signalized themselves by their editions of the greek and latin fathers he had likewise some daughters one of whom named justina he married to nicolas levesque or episcopius an eminent printer of basil  his usual mark or rebus was a dove sitting on the top of a staff with two basilisks twined about it to which he sometimes added the initial letters of both his names io fro and sometimes the fourth verse of the    th psalm in hebrew the sixteenth verse of st matthews  0th chapter in greek and these words in latin prudens simplicitas amorque recti in three distinct lines all the works we have extant of his from      to   00 are only four viz a latin bible  vo in a small character dated      another in the old gothic  vo      his concordance of the bible mentioned before fol anno      and the speculum december praeptorum of henry harp  i can find but one more printer after him viz  john bergman de olpe      of whom we have only two editions of sebastian brants navis stultisea dated      and      the last of which is adorned with wooden cutts  besides these f orlandi has given us a list of above  0 basil editions without printers names  article ii the cities of esling placentia and pignerol these three cities being inconsiderable with respect to their productions in the art of printing except the earliness of their receiving it i have joined them into one short article   esling is a small city in the duchy of wirtembergh in germany it received printing either about or before the year      though we can meet but with the two following editions printed there by  conrard fyner      viz   petri nigri germani ord praed qui claruit anno      tractatus de judaeorum perfidia per conradum fyner eslingae         ejusdem tractatus de conditionibus very messiae contra judaeos germanice by the same ibid orl        placentia a noble ancient city upon the river po in italy in which we find only one edition printed by  jo peter de ferratis of cremona      viz biblia latina  to per jo petri de ferratis cremonensem placentiae        pignerol in latin pignarolium is a well fortified city in piedmont at the foot of the alps under the dominion of the present king of sardinia here the famous french printer  james des rouges or de rubeis set up his press after he had printed at venice from      to      with vast applause the first book which we find printed by him is a latin bible dated      in which all our annalists have followed father se long but it is doubtful whether he was not mistaken in the year seeing des rouges was still printing at venice anno      and that we find no more impressions of his done at pignerol till anno       however as it is not easy to determine whether father le long was in an error or the bible antedated or whether this printer kept two presses at the same time one at venice and another at pignerol i have followed the order of the annalists and ventured to place this edition and city under that year  we have but four editions of his printed at pignerol that of the bible of      included two of which are dated      and the last    0  article iii the city of vincentia      vincentia is a large ancient city and university in italy now under the republic of venice which received the art of printing anno      and obliged the world with a greater number of editions than many cities of italy and other parts of europe which we have seen hitherto    herman levilapis or lichtenstein      was one of the first that brought it hither he was a native of cologn and a very good but unsettled printer we have already seen him at venice and treviso at vincentia he printed some editions in partnership with nicholas petri of harlem alias peter de harlem  we have twelve of them extant in some of which he calls himself herman levilapis in others de levilapide or lichtenstein in others herman lichtenstein de colonia one remarkable edition of his viz  pauli

afterward to venice where he printed a much greater number of editions from      to   00 as has been said under that head  here are likewise a small number without printers names  article iv the cities of lubeck and valentia  the city of lubeck is one of the hanstowns in germany between the provinces of saxony and alsatia upon the baltic sea it is very eminent for its trade port fortifications riches and number of inhabitants  hither the art of printing was brought anno      yet appears to have met with but little encouragement from its trading inhabitants for we find only four printers in this city from      to   0  and they were so far from settling here any time that their bad success had obliged them to quit the place for we have but five editions extant of them all their names are as follows    lucas brandis de schafz   edit from      to        stephen arnold   edit        stephen arndes   edit        barthol gothan   edit      i shall only add that the first work of lucas brandis viz epitomae historiarum has the pompous latin inscription which you will find in the margin  imperiali in urbe lubecana art impressoria speciali gratia divina animatum ob salutem fidelium inventa epitoma istud in parts vi juxta mundi aetates divisum prius alibi non repertum quod placuit rudimentum novitiorum intitulari dei adjutorio qui supernas res ac subterraneas feliciter suaviter tranquilleque dispensat per magistrum lucam brandis de schafz feliciter est excusum atque finitum ut pauperes solvere libros non valentes unum tantum haberent hoc enchiridium loco multorum semper ad manum librorum  and which has led some authors into an absurd notion that the art of printing was found out at lubeck   valentia      there are so many cities and towns of this name in france italy and spain that it cannot possibly be determined in which of them the two following books which are all that we find under that name have been printed there being nothing in the titles or any other part to ascertain it and even the printers names are wanting    salustius  to valentiae        ximenius franciscus de vita christiana in vi parts distincta ibid      article v rostoch and bruges      and delph       rostoch is an imperial free city in germany upon the baltic sea here was founded an university about the year    0 fourteen years before which we meet with the following book the only one as yet known printed there by some regular priests as the colophon informs us  lactantii firmiani de divinis institutionibus fol per fratres presbyteros and clericos congregationis domus viridis horti ad sanctum michaelem in oppido rostochiensi partium inferioris sclaviae prout facultas and industria tulit emendate satis and accurate consummat millesimo quadringentesimo septuagesimo sexto quinto idus aprilis rostochii        bruges in flanders had a printer settled there anno      named    colard mansion of whom we have three editions from      to       orlandi gives us another printer of this city viz john de rey who printed centon epistolas dell bachiller  to      mr maittaire and la caille date this edition from burgos in spain and they seem to be in the right because the book is written in spanish and the printers name shows him to be of that nation   delph is a fine city in holland near the hague and rotterdam we meet with seven editions printed there all without any printers name the first of which viz the dutch bible is dated anno      the rest are dated as follows two    0 two      one      the last       chap xi the cities of   spire   lions anno        geneva brussels coscence and pavia anno        goude zivol anno      and caen ceulen cenzano and quilemburgh anno    0   lignitz husselet regio mont royal and wartzburgh anno        pisa aquila erford and langres anno      and   gaunt and memining anno      article i the city of spire      spire is an ancient city in higher germany situate upon the rhine between mentz and strasburgh it is now called in latin spira but formerly was called novimagium and nemetes  though this city does not seem to have cultivated the art of printing within her walls so much as other cities of germany yet it ought to be remembered for having given birth to some eminent printers who went and settled in other parts of europe and in particular the two famous brothers who first set up their presses at venice viz john and windelin of spire of whom we have given an account in the third chapter of this second part here we find the first beginnings of the art about the year      when    peter drach of spire printed the summa of archiep antoninus which is the first book we know of printed by him as he is likewise the only printer who put his name to any impressions done in this city his editions are but four in number from      to      besides which we find about ten more printed here without the names of the printers  it will not be improper to observe here that our latest annalists place the city of westminster under this year the oldest edition as yet discovered by them being socratess sayings printed by caxton anno      however the reader will find by the third book of this history that there is a more ancient one by three years viz the game of chess which is dated anno      now in the possession of my worthy friend the curious mr granger of the east india house and it is plain from the account of the arts being brought into england that they began to print in the abbey of westminster much sooner than that year  article ii the city of lions lions a rich and populous city in france upon the rivers rhone and arare is called in latin lugdunum and is allowed to be one of the most ancient cities in europe so that some french writers have not scrupled to fix the date of its foundation within  00 or  00 years after the flood which may more easily be believed than disproved it has been always eminent for men of learning in all arts and sciences which were particularly cultivated there but more especially after the art of printing was introduced which received such encouragement there that it has continued in a flourishing condition ever since some annalists have asserted that it is the first city in france which set up a printingpress but if we would judge of this controversy by the dates of the oldest impressions we shall find that the city of tours and next that of paris had the art several years before as has been already shown however if lions has not the preference of rome paris venice etc either for the antiquity or beauty of its productions it must be acknowledged that it has gained it by the quantity of large impressions than which no city in europe has furnished the learned with a greater number it is still a great emporium or market for books in all languages and sciences and as it has encouraged some of the best artists to settle there and publish beautiful and correct editions so it has induced many a wretched one to choose it as a proper place to print and vend a much greater quantity of bad and counterfeit ones but this has happened in most famous cities of europe lions has likewise been celebrated if not for introducing at least for encouraging the gothic character and published more volumes of that sort in proportion to those that were done in fine roman than any other city and what is more remarkable of the printers of this city they were vastly more fond of that inelegant character than of the roman especially for bibles divinity law and physic books  the reader will be justly surpised to hear what encomiums they gave it and how proud they were of their performances in that kind i have subjoined in the margin three or four scraps of their colophons to show what a piece of merit the printers of the   th and above half of the   th century made of their works printed in this character not only at lions but likewise at venice paris rome etc sublimi literarum effigy etc john de cologne at venice used to phrase it thus done in sublimely fine characters etc another charactere jucundissimo m joan herbort alemani cujus vis et ingenium facile supereminet omnes values himself upon the beauty and excellence of his character a third opus pulchro literarum charactere politissimum etc calls it the most elegant character and a fourth certante minio purpurae rubedine superante cervas nigredine sepia  politioribus characterum typis etc the most polite of all characters so that if a person did not see what types they meant he would be apt to judge it any other than the gothic the famous badius sirnamd ascensius who had printed in this city of lions from      to   00 is reported to have gone afterward to paris with a design to stop as much as possible the current vogue of this old gothic but in vain for he was obliged to continue it himself till almost the very later end of his days and besides it still remained in great use long after that insomuch that atensis complains lynceis uutur oculis and herculeo labor i quando ethniorum aliquis aut nugax poeta u verbosus orator est imprimendus sacris quosvis typos quamvis trito and consusaneos adhibent praesat ad gregor that printers were extremely curious and spared no cost to give elegant impressions of the heathen poets orators etc whereas any battered old gothic types were thought good enough for those of divinity in the close of this second book we shall mention some of the printers to whom the world is obliged for the total disuse of that inelegant character to return to lions the first printer we find there is    bartholomew buyer      of whom we have only the two following impressions the first viz the new testament in french is without date and has been supposed by de la caille to have been printed about   00 but f le long more justly supposes it both by the rudeness of the character and its likeness to that of the next edition of buyer which is dated      to have been printed about this time    martin husz two edit from      to       and   jos faber two edit from      to         perrine lathomi   edit       he printed likewise at venice with some others about         william le roy   edit from

trechsel german   edit from    0 to      whose corrector was the famous jodocus badius of whom we shall speak hereafter some of whose learned works comments and annotations he printed anno      and seq as silvae morales cum interpretatione badii ex virgil horat pers juvenal ennio bapt mantuan sulpit caton with some others which we shall speak of anon i must not omit mentioning that all trechsels works are highly valuable and correct     engolhard schultis german   edit          matthias huts   edit          ant labillon   edit both       and    martin saraceni   edit both          jodocus badius sirnamd ascensius      badius was born in the castle of ase in the territories of brussels and called ascensius from it he spent his younger years in study at brussels gaunt and last of all in the university of ferrara under the great bapt guarini where he became master of the greek and latin tongues and very famous for his learning and parts he removed afterward to the city of lions where he publicly taught those two languages and became corrector to jo trechsels press as has been said before he published several works some of which were his own as silvae morales contra vitia fol      epigrammatum lib   navicula stultarum mulierum the life of thomas a kempis prefixed to his works and some others several excellent commentaries were likewise written by him upon the greatest part of the classicks and other latin authors as horace juvenal martial lucretius seneca salust valerius maximus quintilian aulus gellius and others all which he printed himself in folio very elegantly and correctly though some of the first he caused to be printed by john trechsel whose daughter he afterward married and had many children by her to all his editions which were not a few he used to prefix an epistle dedicatory addressed to some person eminent either for his quality piety or learning among others he dedicated the first volume of tho waldensis works to pope clement vii after he had taken the business of printing upon him he became so excellent a printer that the learned rob gaguin general of the trinitarian order who was perfectly well acquainted with his merit wrote a letter to him to desire him to undertake the printing of his works this with some other invitations of the learned brought badius to paris about      presently after his fatherinlaws death where he designed to teach the greek tongue and where his last endeavor after he had furnished himself with fine sets of roman characters was to explode the old gothic both in his works and by his example as we hinted before and accordingly printed the philobiblion of that great encourager of learning richard bury lord high chancellor of england bishop of durham and founder of the oxford library toward the middle of the   th century which book was sent to him by dr bureau bishop of cisteron and confessor to the french king in order to be printed by him this was the first book known that came to the press after he set it up at paris it is dated   00 the next year he printed the provinciale seu constitutiones angliae cum annotationibus gullielmi lindewode   0  in  vol fol in a beautiful round roman this book as de la caille tells us is very scarce and much sought for being very necessary for those who would understand the old french used in william the conquerors time though i doubt he is mistaken the work itself being in latin he began to print by himself about the year      at which time the great aldus manutius began at venice than whom neither that age nor the next produced two more learned or excellent printers  as this later was chiefly engaged in printing and correcting of greek authors so badius was employed in the latin ones and there seemed a kind of friendly emulation between them each carrying away the palm in a separate province upon account of this merit the editor of guil de rubione in his dedication to the earl of castille calls ascensius a person skilled in all kinds of science and the prince of printers omnigenere disciplinarum eruditissimo ascensio impressoriae artis primati  and trithemius ranks him among the scriptores ecclesiastici when he was but two and thirty years of age and gives him the following panegyric viz that he was a perfect master of literature not unskilful in the holy scriptures a good philosopher orator and poet a man of a bright genius and a fluent tongue vir in secularibus literis eruditissimus and divinarum scripturarum non ignarus philosophus rhetor and poeta clarissimus ingenio excellens and disertus eloqui etc erasmus likewise gives him a great encomium in his dialogue entitled ciceronianus prefers his style to that of apuleius and highly applaudes his admirable facility of writing i shall give the latin reader a specimen of his poetry in the margin which is a tetrastich incribd to the learned fath mark benevent to whom the edition of holkoth upon the sentences printed by j treschel anno      is dedicated and of which himself was the corrector in which verses he desires him in a most elgant manner to excuse the faults still remaining in it jam portum optatum per inhospita saxa secuti prendimus ex alto prospiciente deo siqua tamen lacerae portent inculta carinae humane ignosces marce diserte vale   he was no less skillful in restoring of corrupt manuscripts than careful in printing of them with the greatest accuracy so that some of his erratas have contained but five words in printing the work of any living author he always followed the copy exactly and he tells us in his preface to his edition of angelus politianus curavimus  ut quam minimum ejus scripta quasi degenerent ab origin imitantes sane non tacendi imo semper laudandi hominis aldi m r diligentiam  that he endeavored to imitate the laudable diligence of aldus manutius and to print from his copies with the utmost exactness this made not only the learned very ambitious to have their works printed by him but the most eminent booksellers of paris were glad in order to have him for their printer to associate themselves with him among whom john petit sworn bookseller to that university and one of the most famous of that age caused several noble editions to be printed by him as the calepini dictionarium octo linguar      origin opera latin   vol fol      some of which beautifully printed on vellum are still to be seen in several libraries of that city with many others he had other associates besides petit viz andreas bochard dionys roce geofrey marneff and many others all eminent men in their way thus he continued printing and writing with great applause and reputation till the year      in which he died some authors indeed have affirmed that he died anno      because they knew of no works printed by him after that year chevillier gives us two particulars which fix the year of his death beyond dispute the first is the last book printed in his name viz alphonsus a castro contra haereses fol      and peter lombard in epistolas pauli fol ann      pro haeredibus jodoci badii mense decembri both which editions he saw in the sorbon library he used to put the following latin verse to the first page of his impressions  aere meret badius laud auctorem art legentem sometimes this  era meret badio tersa atque impressa per ipsum or thus  era meret badio nomenque decusque parenti some impressions have only era meret badio  his mark was the draught of a printing house with the words praelum ascensianum upon the head of the press the glory and credit of which died not with him but continued above    years in his own family for badius whose love to learning and in particular to the art of printing was conspicuous through his whole life prevailed upon himself to breed up his only son conrard badius to the business of printing after he had perfected him in the greek and latin tongues and in several other branches of literature conrard became so famous upon all these accounts that the learned henry stephens has thought fit to transmit to us an elegant latin epitaph made upon him which the reader may see in de la caille p     badius had likewise a brother named john who became an eminent printer and left a considerable number of good editions behind him and as if this had not been enough to have three out of his family brought up to the art of printing he married his three daughters to three of the most eminent printers in paris robert stephens michael vascosan and john de roigny the two former of these are too celebrated to need a panegyric here and the last took his fatherinlaws mark succeeded him in his printing house with great reputation and signalized himself by the elegancy and correctness of a great number of editions which came from his presses he left a son named michael who did not prove much inferior to his father or grandfather  we find two epitaphs on this great man the one in henry stephens book de artis typographicae querimonia anno      which is as follows  jodoci badii epitaphium hic liberorum plurimorum qui parens parens librorum plurimorum qui fuit situs jodocus badius est ascensius plures fuerunt liberis tamen libri quod jam senescens coepit illos gignere aetate florens coepit hos quod edere his other epitaph is to be seen upon his tomb in st bennets church at paris where he lies buried it is as follows  on this side is the picture of badius  d

hujus aedis sacrae d benedicti  praefectus  badius lived at the sign of the three wolves in st jamess street and his house was so much frequented by learned men of all nations who for conversations sake were forced to use the latin tongue that his daughters had obtained such knowledge of it that no conversation passed in that language but they understood it the same has been affirmed of some of his domestics he was one of the sworn printers of the university of paris as appears by the inscriptions to his epistles didicatory ex officina nostra literaria in academia parisiensi etc  accuratione ascensii in nobilissimo parisiorum gymnasio  ex aedibus nostris in parisiorum academia etc    as well as by the order which he received from the rector of it by virtue of his oath of obedience and fidelity to it to print the censure made by that body against luthers doctrines  before i conclude this article of that noble printer it will be necessary to give the reader a caution which he gives us in the title of his calepin corrected augmented and printed by him in      that some vile printers had put his name to several editions never published by him for which reason he desires the reader to see that his mark be to them least they be deceived by those impostors it seems these plagiaries were more modest than some italians and others who scrupled not to counterfeit both the name and mark of his contemporary aldus  though we have but one impression of his extant done at lions which city he left about the close of the century to which we have confined the lists of impressions yet i hope the reader will excule our transgressing those limits in the account of his life and excellent character as we have done in that of other eminent printers who have outlived that epoch any considerable time the edition spoken of is as follows  gulielmi ockam opera fol per jodoc badium ascensiunt lugdun       as badius is the last considerable printer that made his entrance into the province of printing within this century and of all the other cities and places which have received that art before the close of it a small number excepted we shall abridge the remainder of this history and content our selves with giving our readers only their names and number of their works that we may have the more room to open the scene of the last promised twenty years viz from   00 to    0 in the two last chapters of this ii book  the rest of the primers of the city of lions are as follow   0 john de wingle of picardy   edit from      to          claudius gibolet   edit          nioholas wolf   edit from      to          john dyamantier   edit   00     john bachelier   edit   00     gaspard ort   edit   00  and    peter schenck   edit   00     claudius de huschia a latin bible with outs without date with above twenty more without printers names  article iii the cities of geneva brussels coscence and pavia      i shall not trouble the reader with a needless description of those cities their productions in the art of printing being so inconsiderable as barely to deserve a place here especially the three first     geneva produced four editions from      to      without printers names     brussels two edit from      to    0 without printers names     coscensa two editions the first by octavian salamonio de manifredonia      the other without the printers name of the same date as the former     pavia in latin papia a noble city and university of lombardy received the art of printing about the same time with the three foregoing according to the date of her first known edition and her productions were somewhat more considerable than theirs her first printer was  francis de s petro of whom we have but one edition dated         antony de carcano   edit   dated      the last         andreas boneti   edit         christopher de canibus   edit         john antony birretti   edit all         francis de gyrardengo   edit all         gabriel de crassi

 caen ceulen cenzano and quilembourg    0    goude in holland between hague and utrecht where gerard de leen or de lene printed from anno      to    0 after which he removed to antwerp and printed there till      as shall be shown in its place we have but six editions of his printed at goude the first is a dutch bible fol      the last is dated          zwol a city in lower germany between the rivers isel and vider we find   editions printed here from      to      all without printers names     caen in latin cadomum an episcopal city and university and the capital of normandy had two sworn booksellers viz peter regnault and richard mace but whether many printers or whether they had their books from some other place we find but two editions printed here viz horatii epistolae    0 and alberti magni compend theologic veritat   00     ceulen our annalists are at a loss where to find this place i imagine it to be the city of cologn which the printer might not know how to spell right neither do the germans write it much unlike it we find but one impression in low dutch it is called splegel der sassen met de glossen daarop fol    0     quilembouro in holland where the same dutch edition was printed in the same year and no other as i can find     genzano corn beughen in his incunab typogr mentions an edition of joannes annius de futuris triumphis contra saracenos fol and dates it from gentiae    0 de la caille mentions the same edition of the same year and dates it from genzano father orlandi is not sure that gentiae and genzano are the same place but if it is he tells us that it is a place in the roman territories more famous for an excellent wine in great request at rome than for this obscure edition which is the only one we have printed there the same author mentions also a single edition viz laurent gilelmi de saona rhetorica printed at villa s albani    0 but whether it be our st albans in england which had the art much sooner or any other town of that name beyond sea of which there are a great many in almost every province is not easy nor of great moment to determine  article vi lignitz hasselet reggio and montroyal         lignitz in silesia in which was printed the following book fr hermani dialogus lignis without the printers name          at hasselet a place unknown was printed recollectorium ex gestis romanormm fol hasseleti orl          regio a city in lombardy belonging to the marquess of este rich ancient and populous had the art of printing from    prosper odoard and   albert mazali      of whom we have   edit the two first      the last         bartholomew bottonus alias bruschi of reggio   edit         dionys bertoch who wrought first at treviso next at venice then at modena settled at last at reggio where we find   edit of his from      to         francis mazala of reggio   edit from      to          montroyal in latin mons regalis in the kingdom of sicily and near the city of palermo where dominic de nivaldis and his sons printed an edition of aesops fables in latin verse fol          at wartsburg in latin herbipolis was printed missale in usum ecclesia herbipolensis impress herbipoli fol       this book the earl of pembroke told me he saw at oxford it has a latin privilege at the end impowering mr isorius ryfer to print those missals and to adorn them with rubricks we have already taken notice that this book had been set down in the list of archbishop lauds books for a ms which is the reason it has not been mentioned by any of our annalists  article vii the cities of pisa aquila erford and langres         pisa is an ancient rich and populous city of tuscany where the art of printing got but small footing and encouragement it is very likely that the wars which raged in several parts of italy from the time of the arts being brought to it might be a great cause of the small progress it made in this as well as many other otherwise considerable cities of italy we find but   editions printed here the three first dated           and      are without printers names the only one that has is antonii parnormit libri iv dictorum factorum etc fol by gregory de gente pisis          at aquila an episcopal city in the territory of abruso distant about sixty miles from rome was printed an italian version of plutarchs lives by adam de rotwill a german who styles himself stampatore excellent aquilae       orlandi tells us page     that mr robert frebairn now the kings printer in scotland and a particular friend of mine showed him among some of his curious annotations upon editions which he had seen the first part of the aforesaid lives printed at aquila ann      but said he never could see the second part which was afterward added to the first the credit of this entirely depends upon that gentlemans observation but our author says that he never saw any other part but this which we have given nor heard of it from any but him     at erford a large city in germany erected into an university ann      and subject to the elector of mentz was printed lutreus de anima erford          at langres an episcopal city in burgundy the people of which were called lingones by lucan claudian etc and still reta in that name we find the following edition viz  jo de turrecremeta ord praed card expositio super psalterium impress per johan fabri lingonensem       it has no places name only la caille and after him orlandi have supposed it from the printers appellative to have been printed at langres however the reader may find the same printer at turin from anno      to      and at lions from      to      orlandi dates the same edition from turin by the same printer where i think it more properly belongs  article viii gaunt and memining         gaunt in latin gandavum is too well known by most readers to need a description here were printed the two following editions without the printers names    guillelmus parisiensis de rhetorica divina  to gandavi orl        boetii de consolatione philosophiae lib   cum s thom aquin comment fol ibid    at memining a city in swabia between ulms and ausburgh we find six editions printed from ann      to      all without printers names  chap xii the rest of the cities and places which began to print before the year   00 with an account of the books printed there article   the town of soncino      soncino is a town or castle in the duchy of milan between brescia and cremona and famous for being the place in which the first hebrew books were printed the christians had hitherto esteemed such a design too expensive and impracticable it being scarce possible to find artists in those early days who could cut punches exactly enough in that difficult and unpracticed character another difficulty which seemed to them almost unsurmountable was that to cast the letters with the points and accents would multiply the cases to an excessive degree and to print without points accents etc would have infallibly prevented the sale of their books because few at that time except the jews could read without them and to cast the points and accents by themselves and interline them as now seemed then perhaps wholly impracticable we have seen under the article of aldus manucius that he procured a fone of hebrew types but though the jews had already printed at soncino and elsewhere for above twelve or fifteen years which might have given him an insight into their method of printing in that language yet he found it so difficult that he made but little use of them and i can find nothing done by him in that kind but an hebrew alphabet which chevilier tells us is preserved in the sorbon library the jews therefore as they were the fittest for such a province were the first who set about it what encouragement they might receive from the christians in such an undertaking i cannot affirm yet it is probable they might in a great measure depend upon that and without leave from the pope and the dukes of milan they dared not have attempted it soon after the jews had propagated this art into several cities of italy such as brescia bologna rimini fano pesaro and even as far as constantinople and salonica in all which places they inscribed their editions as done by some of the family of soncino the christians who now began to print in hebrew in most cities of europe in italy at venice cremona mantua verona ferrara leghorn padua naples etc in england london and oxford in germany basil frankford cologn etc in france paris lions etc with some cities of spain holland poland etc set up some ingenious artists who engaged in that province though it must be owned that the editions of the jews were far preferable to those for beauty and correctness however there were few impressions of this kind printed any where but by these jews of the sontino family till after the year   00 mr mattaire ann typog vol   p     makes a curious observation after father le long which is that in all the books that he had seen printed in this tongue before that year as often as the name of god occurs in the text they made use of the letter daleth instead of he thus for instance they printed  for  and  for  for which no reason can be assigned  i must not omit giving the reader an account which we meet with in buxtorf the father of a book that he tells us was in the possession of joseph scaliger of a much older date than those of soncino it was an hebrew grammar entitled mahala scevile haddas written by r moses kimchi which buxtorf says had been printed in sicily     years ago habuit josephus scaliger impressum in sicilia ante annos     these words buxtorf the son did not alter when he reprinted his fathers book at basil anno    0 in  vo this if it be true will oblige us to seek much higher for the origin of hebrewprinting than the year      which is the time wherein rabbi gedaliah and after him the learned bartolocci have affirmed it to have begun for if we substract     years from      in which buxtorf wrote it will bring us to the year      chevilier p     tells us that he saw a third edition of this grammar printed at ortona in the kingdom of naples in the second year of charles king of sicily and jerusalem i e anno      which shows that there must have been two editions of it before and cornelius a beughen in his incunab typog p     mentions an old hebrew edition printed at bologna anno      with this title r obadia sephorno lux populorum liber hebraicus sic dictus bononiae      but as he does not tell us in what library he met with it and as we have not a sufficient certainty of the truth of the dates of this and the other book mentioned by buxtorf i can see no reason for departing from the epoch of our latest annalists to assign a new one upon uncertain grounds  the first jew who obliged the world with hebrew impressions was  moses the son of rabbi israel nathan       a native of spire in germany whose family multiplied so much and received such encouragement in this undertaking that they spread themselves over several parts of italy and printed many noble editions with vast success and applause among these a son of this moses named rabbi gerson after he had printed several works at brescia of which we have given an account went and set up a press at constantinople some time before the close of this century and continued printing there till ann    0 some of his sons removed to salonica and other cities of the ottoman empire where they met with the same success but as their works at least as far as we know of them were done after the year   00 i shall not give the reader a list of them but confine myself to those printed in italy before that time the editions at soncino are as follows    minchah happenini   to soncini anno mundi      which answers to our         bechinal olam hebr ibid         prophetae priores hebr absque punctis cum com r david kimchi fol ibid         ikkarim per r joseph albo ibid         biblia hebraica cum punctis per abraham fill rabb hhajim fol ibid

of that name received the art of printing in      and though it produd but few impressions before the year   00 and yet it is become one of the most famous cities in germany for the numbers of books printed there the first printer who settled there was    mark brandt  of whom we have only the following edition viz  albicii archiepiscopi pragensis praxis medendi  to per marcum brandt lipsiae        at the end of the pentateuch are these words  et absolutum est opus ministerii viginti quatuor sapiens ad docendum legem in israel excellens and illustris josua selomo ideat semen producat dies vitae

question whether it be not the same with this of soncino       rambam is an abbreviation of rabbi moseben maimon as abenezra is of abrahambenexra etc   gregory boeticher   edit         wolfgang

under the article of nuremberg where he followed the business of printing and correcting till the year      after which he removed to leipsick and became rector magnificus of that university the only book we find printed by him here is the historia longobardica but our german author not having given us the date of it no proper rank could be assigned to it in this list  article iii vienna and urbino         vienna not the capital of austria as orlandi thought but a city in dauphiny had two printers viz    peter schenk of whom we have only the following edition labuse de cour fol par pierre schenk    conrard celtis   edit   00     at urbino a city in italy famous for being the native place of that excellent painter raphael sancius sirnamd from it urbin was printed the following book without the printers name  pauli middleburgensis episcopi semproniensis practica de pravis constellationibus ad maximilianum caesarem urbini       article iv antwerp heidelbergh cremona and harlem         antwerp a large rich and populous city in flanders did not much signalize itself in the art of printing in this   th century but made ample amends for it in the two following having produced some of the finest and largest editions of any place in the world and by the number of its printers among whom were the famous bellers raphelengius plantin morellus gumelers mevosius verdufen and many more all too well known to the learned to need a digression here in their praise the first known printer here was    gerard leu or de leeu       who printed first at goude in    0 whence he came to antwerp we have but four editions of his extant from      to         adrian de liesvelt   edit         nicolas kesler of basil where he wrought from      to      betwixt which times we find a latin bible fol

hist without the printers name though this is all our annalists mention yet a learned gentleman assures me he has seen two editions more printed here one was fracastorius and the other vida  the only printers of this city as yet known are the two following viz    bernardine de misenti of pavia   edit       and   caesar de parma   edit       we have seen misenti under the article of brescia ann         harlem a city in holland sufficiently known to those who have read the first part of this history for the great controversy started in favor of it and for the number of her champions who have endeavored to deck her costers tomb with the trophies of this noble art has produced so small a number of works during this   th century if we allow it the donatus speculum etc done upon wooden blocks so much boasted of by the dutch writers though their title even to these has been shown to be as precarious as that of mentz that the reader no doubt will be surpised that we have not been able to find but one book printed there before   00 viz  de proprietatibus rerum libri xviii opus theologicum and philosophicum fol       article v abbeville and toledo        abbeville a city in picardy had two famous printers and booksellers settled there for a small space viz john du pre and peter gerard of whom we have but one edition printed here after which they removed to paris as has been said  s

we have seven editions from              dionys bertoch whom we have seen already under the articles of venice treviso and reggio and under several names did at length conclude the century at modena we have two editions left of him from      to   00     at boisleduc in latin boscumducis a strong city in brabant was printed one edition viz  praecepta xx elegantiarum grammaticarum   to          at

editions still extant one without date viz l florus de gestis romanorum and ciceros clausulae epistol      but whether he was the same with that sigismund who sirnamd himself de libris and for whom dominic de lapis printed several books at bologna anno      or some other is not easy to determine these two are all the books which i could find printed at siena before the close of the century     at hagenaw a city in alsatia in upper germany but now under the french king we find the following edition dated      but without printers name viz  joh de garlandia cornutus sive disticha exametra

likewise some other works done here without printers names from      to   00  article viii the cities of lisbon and sevil         lisbon in latin ulyssipo the metropolis of the kingdom of portugal did not signalize itself by any productions in this kind if we except the two following ones which being both in hebrew might be done by some of the family of soncino mentioned before they are as follows

is without the printers name the last by john pfeil  i must not omit acquainting the reader that there are still above twenty editions which being without dates places or printers names were not reducible to our former lists though they are supposed to have been printed before the close of the   th century the reader may find them at the end of mr mattaires annals vol   with such remarks as that diligent author could make upon them  i shall conclude this chapter with this observation that the art of cutting upon wooden blocks having past from the printers to the engravers of cuts they began to intersperse them among their works so that we find many histories both sacred and profane adorned with wooden cuts which though already mentioned in the lists of impressions under every city yet we shall subjoyn here altogether at least the most considerable of them    the speculum or mirror of our salvation in latin and another in low dutch    the speculum morientium or mirror of a dying person    the history of st johns apocalypse  all these are challenged by the dutch writers in favor of harlem    meditationes in figuras quas romae in templo s mariae supra minervam pingere    curavit jo de turre cremata romae anno      and      fol    fasciculus temporum printed at louvain      and afterward both here and elsewhere fol    valturius de re militari at verona         passionale van jesu und mariae leben at strasburgh      geneva    0    aesopi fabulae fol at naples      and elsewhere afterward   0 dialogus creaturarum in low dutch at goude          the bible in high dutch fol at nurembergh          la mer des histoires   vol with     cuts at paris          le process de belial etc translated out of latin into french  to at lions         0     albamasar arab astrolog flores astrologiae at ausburgh      and elsewhere     sebastian brants navis stultifera at basil           and          hortus sanitatis at mentz          revelationes s brigittae fol at lubeck      and elsewhere     terentius  to at lions      strasburgh          opus libri chronicon fol at ausburgh        0 guil coursins siege of rhodes in latin at ulms          poliphili hypnerolomachia fol at venice      and elsewhere  it must be owned that the design and performance of these and many more of that sort were very rude and uncouth as all must acknowledge who have seen them which is rather owing to the covetousness of the booksellers who chose to employ the cheapest hands than to any want of excellent artists in that kind for soon after the very infancy of printing we meet with a great number of these engravers whose performances were vastly superior to the best of those in the foregoing list of this number were andreas martegna in mantua maso finiguerra in florence bon martin in germany michael volgemut and albert durer at nurembergh israel vanmecheln at mentz hans schauflich at nordeling and many more some of whom though they were excelled by their successors in the following century yet were all excellent masters and whose names and works will be still valued by all skilled in that art engraving upon wood became afterward no small ornament to the art of printing not only for the fine cuts with which the editions were interspersed but likewise for the front head and tailpieces initial letters etc which in time became in great vogue it proved also of great use in books of architecture geometry prospective and others which require a considerable number of demonstrations figures etc in all which cases the wooden ones are much more expeditious being contrived of the same height with the letters and so imposed locked up and printed with them at once whereas the copper ones must be printed off by themselves and with a different press which makes this method more tedious and expensive  chap xiii of some eminent printers from anno   00 to    0 their improvements to the art and their encouragement from the great and learned with a catalogue of their most considerable impressions in the oriental tongues etc i have in the introduction to this second book given the reader my reasons for extending this history so far beyond the year   00 and i presume that he is now fully satisfied that it would have been imperfect if i had stopped there since the far greatest part of those printers who signalized themselves either for their learning or their industry in improving every branch of printing appeared not till the close of that century or the beginning of the next and consequently he must have known little of those persons to whom the world is particularly obliged for the vast improvements to this art upon this account i have continued in the preceding chapters the history of several famous printers to the end of their lives though some of them survived even this epoch many years but we omitted to give a list of their works beyond   00 because that would have swelled this volume exorbitantly and those impressions are less scarce than those of the former century we shall add nothing therefore to their history but proceed to do justice to the merit of those who though they entered not this province till after the beginning of the   th century yet may be justly esteemed contemporaries with the former  it is not however to be expected that we should prosecute the same method as in the former chapters by showing the progress of the art through every city much less by giving an account of every particular printer and the number of their impressions since such an history how succinct soever would be too large for a single chapter our design is therefore only to mention the most considerable printers and to point out the great improvements which each of them made to this art the encouragement they met with and the noble impressions in all languages particularly the hebrew chaldee arabic etc the first of which had been justly essayed before   00 but the other scarce attempted with an account of the undertakers and assistants in that difficult province for as to the beauty of the characters whether roman or greek they were brought to such a degree of perfection in the preceding century by the italians and french as hardly admitted of much additional beauty  to proceed in order we should begin with the germans to whom we owe the art though the italians were the authors of those improvements which the former were too indolent in imitating for the oriental tongues and even the greek which the italians had made a very considerable progress in was still much neglected by them so that except amerbach and froben at basil in switzerland which can scarce be called a part of germany who printed an hebrew psalter and erasmuss greek testament with his latin version of it anno      we meet with but three eminent persons who attempted to print in the eastern languages the first is john schott of strasburgh anno      who printed lucians dialogues of the gods in greek with the latin version of othomar nachtgall with the title page in red and some ornaments on the margin of the greek text and an errata at the end by the compliments which the translator makes him in the preface he seems to have been a very good printer he printed for george maxill about five years before his rebus or mark is in the table at the end of this book the second is eucharius cervicorn i e hartshorn at cologn who printed some greek editions the first anno      is the hours of the blessed virgin mary the seven penitential psalms and some litanies and prayers in greek with one or two more after his types are tolerable but the edition somewhat faulty the third is john potken of the same city who published there a psalter in hebrew greek latin and aethiopic anno       to this person traveled into india aethiopia egypt etc in order to become master of the chaldiac or aethiopic and translated the psalter into that language and published it with the other versions he promised in his preface to perform something likewise in the arabic if he should meet with sufficient encouragement but i do not find that he executed this as for the printer of this psalter his name is no where to be found in the book  this is all i know of that has been attempted by the germans in that kind though to do them justice in another respect they were industrious in printing latin works that were very voluminous particularly the decretum gratiani printed by henry eggestein at strasburgh which exceeds all that have been since printed for bulk and vincentii speculum by john mentel in ten large volumes fol in the following century they have been no less diligent and published a very considerable number of impressions  italy follows in course where though great numbers of editions of the ancient greek and latin writers as well as of the modern were published yet the hebrew arabic etc seemed almost wholly neglected it is true that there had been as we observed two hebrew editions at lisbon in portugal one anno      and the other anno      and that the jews of soncino had printed several hebrew volumes there from      to the close of the century and having dispersed themselves into other cities of italy continued printing their own books in that language but with respect to the christians no direct attempts were made that way till daniel bombergh an antwerpian set up a printing house for hebrew at venice his first work was the hebrew bible anno       to reprinted by him several times and particularly anno      in which year he likewise printed his bibliae hebraea rabinica in fol containing the hebrew text of the bible the masora and targums of onkelos jerusalem and jonathan r joseph sirnamd the blind and other rabbis comments etc which he dedicated to leo x but though bombergh took a great deal of pains in this impression and was himself a good master of the hebrew which he had learned of foelix pratensis a learned italian who persuaded him to undertake this edition and assisted in correcting it yet the jews set no value upon it but rabbi chajin prevailed on him to print another in   vol in fol which he did anno      and which was reprinted anno      it is not my business to enquire into the merit of those editions yet i cannot but observe after several great critics that the jews have always succeeded better in works of this kind than the christians as being more used to the niceties of the tongue especially in its points and accents bombergh continued printing in hebrew near forty years and all his works were highly esteemed on account of the beauty of the character and impression their correctness the fineness of the paper and the number that he printed which jos scaliger tells us amounted to above four millions of crowns of gold he made use of the most learned jews for his correctors his greatest work was the talmud printed anno    0 in xi vol fol f bartolocci observed that after his death hebrewprinting declined exceedingly  the next improvement of this art was by printing polyglot works and herein the city of genoa first obliged the world peter paul porrus a native of milan but inhabitant of turin an eminent printer undertook to print the impressit miro ingenio petrus paulus porrus genuae in aedibus nicolai justiniani pauli praesidente reipub genuensi pro serenissimo franc rege praestanti viro octaviano fulgoso anno christianae salutis millesimo quingentesimo sextodecimo mense viiiibri petrus paulus porrus mediolanensi taurini degens pentaglot psalter of augustine justinian bishop of nebo anno      in the house of nicholas justinian paul at genoa it was in hebrew arabic chaldaic and greek with the latin versions glosses and scholia which last made the  th column in fol  since i wrote this i have seen a fine copy of it upon vellum at my lord pembrokes on which i shall venture to make the following observations viz  that it is a complete masterpiece in that kind  the different disposition of the columns are very regular and neat and kept up to their exact proportions nor having one double line in the latin versions nor are any chasms or white lines seen throughout the work so that i dare affirm that to this time i have never seen a work so well contrived and so completely finished the hebrew is printed with all the points both orthographical and musical the greek and roman is very neat but above all the arabic allowing for its antiquity surpasses all i have ever seen of the kind and that nothing may be wanting to complete the whole the presswork and ink both rubricks and black excels any thing i have seen except durands rationale printed by the inventor faust in      which book i have also seen in my lords library  the arabic was the first that was ever printed and this the first piece of the bible that ever appeared in so many languages for that of potken at cologn was not published till two years after and wanted the arabic the reader might reasonably imagine that this work met with deserved encouragement yet the reverse appears from the just complaints of the author for f le long in his account of the polyglot bibles p    tells us that he justinian caused no less than  000 copies to be printed off presuming that such a work would not only procure him a vast reputation but likewise prove very gainful to him the profits of which he designed to bestow upon some of his family who were then in want he fancied that it would infallibly meet with a kind reception and that all rich prelates and princes would think themselves obliged to encourage it and reimburse and enable him to proceed with the other parts of the bible for this he promised in his preface to the psalter and about twenty years after in his annals of the republic of genoa he proposed to add the whole old testament in all those languages to the new one which was preserved there done after the same manner and this he would undoubtedly have performed had he not been unfortunately drowned in his passage to the isle of corsica the following year but continues le long he justinian was deceived by his too great credulity every body applauded the work but few proceeded further than that scarce a fourth part of what he had printed was sold off he says afterward that this psalter being of no use to any except the learned he found it impossible to reimburse himself the expense he had been at because besides the  000 copies upon paper he had about fifty printed upon vellum which he presented to all the kings whether christians or infidels vid matt annal typ tom ii par   p     sub not c  it is well that the authors disappointment did not discourage both him and others from attempting the like glorious performances though we do not find any more works of that prelate in the oriental tongues yet i have met with the following one printed at paris in      which convinces me that he published more of them and in particular that which is mentioned in it it is entitled liber job ad hebraicam veritatem restitutus duplici latina versione una vulgata altera ex hebreo augustini justiniani  to i e the book of job restored to the hebrew text with a double version of it viz the vulgate and another from the hebrew by augustine justinianus  to but when and where justinian printed the book of job in hebrew and latin i can no where find as for porrus the printer of the psalter above mentioned though he was paid by the bishop who employed him yet it is probable he ventured no more upon that province for we do not find that ever he printed any thing more in those languages though he returned to turin and printed for several years after his mark or rebus was a leak with a p on each side alluding to his name peter paul porrus as was the custom of that time to find some beast bird plant etc that had analogy to the persons surname in order to form a rebus as appears from the table of them at the end of this book  the next considerable work is the bible of that great mecaenas cardinal ximenes archbishop of toledo printed at alcala de herares in spain in latin complutum from whence it is called the complutentian bible but before we leave italy i shall just mention some other printers who though they did not excel in this kind yet obliged the world with many noble volumes in latin and greek of this number was andreas azulanus fatherinlaw to the great aldus of venice who succeeded him in that printing house and kept up the credit of it for several years his acquaintance with the members of the learned assembly at alduss house as well as with his other foreign correspondents and his own extraordinary learning enabled him to print many noble editions which it is not my design to give an account of here since they may be seen in mr mattaires annals vol ii  the juntas at florence a noble family of printers some of whom we have spoken of under the heads of florence rome venice and lions signalized themselves in the preceding and this century particularly those of florence were famous for their beautiful and correct editions in greek and latin  the lilly was their rebus with this motto nil candidius i e nothing is whiter to which they sometimes added the initial letters of their names and sometimes printed them at length there were two of them at genoa viz philip who began to print in      and continued till      about which time he is supposed to have died and bernard junta but whether a brother or kinsman to him i cannot determine the former having cause to suspect that his works might be pirated according to the custom of those times obtained a patent from pope leo x of a ten years privilege for all the greek and latin editions which he should print from that time as the former are all very curious and highly esteemed i shall give a list of the most considerable of them which is as follows    basilii magni liber de exercitatione grammatica  vo ann        ausonii sophistae praeludia and hermogenis rhetorica  vo        musaeus batrachomyomachia oppiani halieutica  vo        novem comoediae aristophanis  vo        apollon de constructione  vo        theodor gazae grammatices introductionis lib    vo        dion areopag opera  vo        xenophontis opera sol        plutarchi vitae parallelae graec etc fol       0 philostrati icones and heroie etc fol         aristidis orationes fol         sophocles cum scholiis graecis  vo         homeri opera  vo this is the last book which he printed the next viz florilegium diversorum epigrammatum etc  vo being printed by his heirs  i shall mention but one more printing house in italy viz at the quirinalcollege at rome under the care of the famous angel gallotius and protection of pope leo who was the founder of that college and printing house and among other marks of his favor gave them a privilege of ten years for all their impressions some of which were extraordinary fine and correct and revised by the learned constantine lascaris often mentioned in this book of which number were the porphyri quaestiones homericae and de nympharum antro etc and a very ancient latin translation of homer both printed in      sophocless scholiast      and others of great value  i shall now return to that famous bible of cardinal ximenes as i hinted before commonly called the complutensian bible which is the only considerable one published either in spain or any other part of europe before that time it consists of six large volumes in fol the first of which contains the new testament in greek and latin finished in      the second is a hebrew and chaldee vocabulary of all the old testament with some other dissertations finished may         the third is the pentateuch in hebrew greek and chaldee with a latin version of each the fourth is a second part of the old testament and contains the books of joshua judges and ruth the two books of samuel of kings and of the chronicles with the prayer of manasseh in hebrew and greek with their latin version the fifth is the third part of the old testament in hebrew and greek with the latin version and contains the books of esdras nehemiah hester job the psalms proverbs ecclesiastes canticles wisdom of solomon and ecclesiasticus the apocryphal part of hester only in greek the sixth is the fourth and last part of the old testament in the same languages as the former and contains the prophecies of isaiah jeremiah with the lamentations at the end baruch ezekiel daniel with the history of susannah and of bell and the dragon hosea joel amos obadiah jonah michah nahum habakkuk zephaniah haggai zachariah malachi with the three books of the maccabees these four last volumes were finished ann      july the  0th though mr mattaire says that the whole six volumes were not published till the year    0 every page both of the old and new testament is divided into three columns in the old the first column contains the hebrew text the middle the vulgate latin and the third the greek of the septuagint besides the chaldee which is placed in the inner margin with the version of it opposite to it the vulgate is printed with gothic letter  the only objection against this work is that the printers made use of a sort of false letter to fill up the spaces whenever any of the versions run to a greater length than the text that there might be no line shorter than another nor any blank spaces in the column the new testament is in a very plain large character without ligatures abbreviations or accents though that of the septuagint is different the reason of which they give in the preface to the following purport that since all the ancient greek authors whether sacred or profane were originally written without them they were unwilling to introduce any thing into those holy books which it is certain was neither originally in them nor of any use toward the understanding of them but with respect to the septuagint which is but a translation they thought it unnecessary to be too scrupulous about it  this work was printed by arnold william de bracario in the university of alcala de henares in spain at the charges and under the direction of that learned prelate whose merit in this respect can never be sufficiently extolled alphonsus zamora tells us that he gave no less than four thousand crowns of gold for seven hebrew manuscripts and it would be difficult to determine the sums which the greek chaldee and latin manuscripts cost him as for the learned men whom he sent for from all parts of europe and asia to assist him in this undertaking malincrot tells us they were very numerous of whom we shall mention some among the greeks were demetrius cretensis antony nebrissenus lopes de astuniga and terdianus pintianus who were all professors of the greek and latin tongues and famous for their works of the hebrew professors were alphonsus medicus a native of alcala paul coronellus alphonsus zamorali and john vergera to the last of whom was committed the translation of several books in which he restored a great number of texts which were wholly unintelligible in the vulgate latin these with many of the most considerable men of the university of alcala were engaged by the cardinal with very large salaries in this work for the space of    years viz from   0  to      soon after which he was prevented by death from executing several other glorious designs a larger account of this work may be seen in malincrot p   0 and mr mattaires annals p     etc  while i am upon the subject of polyglots i must not omit one great advantage which the art received from it and which it hitherto wanted viz that of printing in columns by which the text and version are so easily disposed that the reader may at one view satisfy himself in any scruple that may arise either from a word wrong printed or misunderstood in the one by casting his eye immediately on the other this is particularly necessary in greek works and their versions in which when there happens to be some fault of impression as it is almost impossible both text and version should be faulty in the same word the one may be easily corrected by the other chevillier gives us many remarkable instances of this from page   0 to     i shall only mention one of them in which the printer or corrector makes aelian call all the greatest and noblest men of greece errant liars through every part of their lives omnes graecorum clarissimi proestantissimique viri per totam vitam in extrema mendacitate versati sunt a reproach which neither the author nor translator ever dreamed of fixing upon that nation but upon a careful examination of the greek text the word appears to be  and consequently it should have been printed mendicitate i e poverty instead of mendacitate lying which escaped the correctors observation  there is another convenience in this method viz that it obliges a translator to be more concise and to paraphrase less since the exorbitant length of his version would be visible at first sight i have already taken notice of alduss method of printing the text in one page and the version in the other but he was not followed in it by any printer that i know of whereas as soon as they had taken the hint of these columns from the polyglot psalter and bible it was immediately followed by most printers and the famous badius in his edition of angelus politianuss works anno      printed all the epigrams and versions after this manner how plain soever the advantages of this method may seem yet several men of learning have decryd it and particularly antony muretus and jos scaliger have complained that this way of printing the greek and the version in two columns had been the cause of the former being wholly neglected  besides books in two languages the columns are very necessary in large folios and sometimes in large quartos where the lines run to so great a length that they puzzle the reader who is apt to read the same line over again or perhaps to skip the next unless he constantly keep his finger moving from one to the other which is easily remedied by dividing the pages into two columns this method has obtained almost from the middle of the   th century and is entirely owing to that of printing the sacred books in several languages and columns this shall suffice concerning this work printed in spain in which i find but two printers more of any note viz john peter bonhomin at lisbon anno      where he printed a spanish book entitled ordinationes etc fol in gothic and john de porris at salamanca perhaps a relation of peter paul porrus who printed the psalter at genoa mentioned before  i come now to speak of the french printers whose merit though late became at least equal with that of italy or any other kingdom in all respects henry meibomius a german historian owns  quod scribendi genus ut moguntiae in germania inventum ita apud italos excultum and in gallia demum persectum est chronic riddaggbusens tom   p   0  that the art of printing which was invented at mentz in germany and improved in italy was at last perfected in france which is sufficiently evident from the impressions of henry stephens in hebrew greek and latin were there no other printers to be produced in favor of that kingdom but this courtry has given greater encouragement or abounded more in excellent printers than that and considering the care the university of paris whose power and authority over printers and booksellers we have given an account of under the article of paris had continually over them and the many signal marks of their favor joined to the genius of the nation we shall not wonder at the pefection which they brought the art to though somewhat later than their neighbors for we may remember that badius one of the first who signalized himself in this province did not begin to print till almost the close of the last century nor come to paris till the beginning of this hitherto though the roman character and the elegant manner of printing introduced by the italians were here exactly imitated and in some cases excelled yet with respect to the learned languages especially the eastern they were much neglected throughout france and though the noble greek impressions of aldus had raised an universal desire of reviving that tongue yet the french were backward in introducing it till they began to be contemned by the italians who were become every where masters of it the only pieces printed by them in that tongue till that time were some quotations so wretchedly performed that mr mattaire tells us they were rather to be guessed at than read the character was rude and uncooth without accents etc for which badius makes an apology and desires his readers to impute those errors and omissions to the scarcity of types and want of compositors who understood in that language franc tissard a person completely skilled in greek and hebrew and qualified for such a task revived those tongues and prevailed upon the parisian printers to introduce them having printed several books in those languages whereas before this the expense of importing them from venice was so great that it deterred many from the study of them at first he addressed a pathetic discourse to the scholars of paris upon that subject in which he represents how contemptible their neighbors in italy thought them what epithets they gave their nation such as barbarous proud and ignorant who pretended to give laws to italy the most learned and polite nation of the world whilst themselves were not contented to despise the muses at home but must make excursions over the alps to disturb them in their beloved abodes there he exhorted them to retrieve the honor of their country and to apply themselves immediately to the study of those languages he promised them his own and other learned mens assistance and tells them that he had caused some greek books to be printed which though cheap would be great helps to them in that study in short he laid before them such powerful motives and convincing arguments that he at length raised a desire in them of rivalling their neighbors for learning his extraordinary merit soon procured him the esteem and friendship of the great who jointly assisted this noble design among whom was the duke de valois afterward king of france and sufficiently known by the name of francis i the great patron of learning who received him into his family and protection  the first greek book which tissard caused to be printed at paris was entitled  containing the sayings of the seven wise men of greece pythagorass golden verses phocylidess ethic poem and the verses of the erithrean sybil upon the last day with a greek alphabet and some other inconsiderable pieces it was printed in  to anno   0  by giles gourmont and dedicated to the prince de valois and the archbishop of thoulouse this work was so well received that he caused the same printer to dispatch three more books in that language the same year viz   homers   to or the battle of frogs and mice   hesiods   to    or chrysolarass greek grammar  to this last has a tetrastich written by cb rouseau to acquaint the world that francis tissard caused the first greek editions to be printed at paris primus parrhasia graiae nova gloria linguae tissard was a native of amboise in latin ambaca for which reason the poet calls him here ambacus ambacus argivum concinet urbe melos quo duce morales sophiae amplexabere leges hoc igitur stabili pectore fige memor  which tissard himself took care to transmit to posterity in some epistles prefixed to the books above mentioned in these he likewise informs us of the difficulties which he met with in procuring printers who would engage in this new province that they all alleged there was neither a sufficient number of greek matrices and characters in paris for such a work nor any compositors that understood or could read that language that the expense of setting up such a printing house must be very great as well as the danger of losing both their labor and money cum incussorum sibi hoc munus hanc provinciam assumere vellet nemo nullus non id laboris subtersugeret  characteres praeterea grae cos nobis hactenus defuisse vidi ad eorum quoque aliquot scalpendos and postmodum liquefaciendos and denique ad cos impressioni aptandas tradendosque ut aiebant sumptibus  opus esse ad haec ea non intelligere ne legere quidem ejusque insolentes sateri  notwithstanding this tissard stopped not here but resolved to bring the hebrew into vogue and to this end caused a font of hebrew letters to be cast and the following year printed an hebrew alphabet and grammar with a greek alphabet and some hymns in greek and latin at the end which book he dedicated to his great patron francis prince de valois giles gourmont who had printed his greek works likewise undertook the hebrew it is printed with his name and though there is no date to it yet it is plain it was publisha in the year aforementioned however as he was the first who merited the title of greek and hebrew printer to the city and university of paris and has published several other greek works after the year   0  viz the idyls of theocritus some of lucians works a second edition of chrysolarass grammar in      the gnomologia and alduss greek lexicon of      much enlarged in      the grammar of theod gaza in      etc i thought my self obliged to do justice to his merit he used to put his coat of arms at the beginning or end of his books and sometimes at both with this french motto tossed ou tard pres ou loing a le fort du foible besoing i e sooner or later far or near the strong stand in need of the weak with his name giles or aegidius gourmont his mark sometimes was the three crowns of the kings of cologn with the   th verse of the   th psalm i have been young and now am old etc in hebrew and greek under them he lived overagainst the college of cambray in the square of that name and his books are much valued by the lovers of antiquity especially at paris he continued printing till after the year      as for the learned tissard as we find nothing printed by him after his hebrew grammar he is supposed to have died about that time  however he did not want a successor of equal merit to carry on this work for jerome aleander a person so well skilled in hebrew greek and latin as to speak them with as much fluency as his own language was sent for by lewis xii from italy where he professed the greek and latin tongues with universal applause his reputation was so great that the elector palatine sent his own brother wolfgang de bavaria to be instructed by him and the learned vatablus who had been formerly his scholar was proud to assist him in some of his works and take care of their correction whenever aleander was hindered by sickness or avocations as soon as he came to paris he employed gourmonts presses in printing those greek works which we mentioned just before in speaking of that printer the king failed not of giving him immediate encouragement for he settled on him a pension of  00 crowns of gold with many other marks of his favor so that he was chosen principal of the college of the lumbards and in      rector of the unversity with general applause though he had not yet taken his doctors degree there at last he was made library keeper to the pope a bishop and nuncio and then cardinal by clement vii i shall only add that he was one of alduss learned academy and that under his care the greek and hebrew tongues were so well settled in france as to flourish there ever since  but it must be owned that those editions of gourmont were very far from perfection since the types were ill shaped the punches ill finished and the matrices worse sunk besides which defects they had not cast a sufficient font of types and were for that reason obliged sometimes to stop till a form was worked off and distributed before they could go on another defect in those types was that the accents not being cast to place between the letters as now but by themselves and so composed in intermediate lines as the hebrew points are done at this time they were often placed over the wrong letters and frequently confounded one for another through the unskilfulness of their compositors tissard complains of this more than once but tells his readers that they were taking all proper means to remedy those defects and hopes in time that those characters would be brought to as great a perfection there as in italy and indeed we find that the success of gourmonts impressions under all these disadvantages excited other printers in that city to procure better types workmen correctors etc not to mention that beautiful font of small greek which king francis i caused to be cast at his own charge in which they succeeded to admiration and soon published much finer editions than those of gourmont we shall only mention some of the most considerable though they all came out later than    0 except angelus politianuss epigrams printed by badius in      already spoken of in this chapter and his edition of guillelmus budaeuss greek epistles  to in    0 after this peter vidoue or vidaeus master of arts and an eminent printer printed beraults greek lexicon in fol and or apollos hieroglyphics  vo in greek and latin in      and      gourmont printed homers first and second iliad  to with wolmars short notes and the greek lexicon of magnus chaeredamus and in      gwinlers greek syntax  vo anno      simon colinaeus or de colines printed sophocles tragedies and in      the new testament these with a few inconsiderable ones more were all that came out in greek during the space of    years viz from tissards first impression in   0  to      which i have mentioned here though they run beyond our period to show how slow their first progress was though their advances afterward were prodigious chevilier from whose list i have extracted the best part of these editions has carried it on to the year    0 and the reader will find both in this piece and the remainder of it several remarkable works omitted by mr mattaire in his annals particularly the greek lexicon and the new testament above named however as chevilier tells us that he saw them all in the sorbon library i thought proper to mention them  the reader perhaps will be surpised to find nothing attempted by the parifians in the polyglot way whilst the italians germans and spaniards set them so fair an example but whatever be the reason of this neglect it is certain that if we except the psalterium quincuplex of mr faber or fabry printed in fol   0  by henry stephens in hebrew latin and french with the psalterium vetus and conciliatum in five columns and reprinted by him in      and again at caen cadomi in normandy by peter olivier in      i can find nothing of that kind during the greatest part of this century however it must be acknowledged they have made the world ample amends in the next in which antony vitre printed that noble work known by the name of monsieur le jays polyglot bible in      which being of too late a date and so well known to the learned i shall only say of it that as sar as relates to the printing part for as to the authors merit with respect to learning it is not my province to enquire into it has not yet been equaled by any work published in any nation either for beauty of character or elegancy of disposition fineness of paper or richness of embellishment in all which mr le jay who was at the charges of the impression spared neither cost nor labor in order to render it a master piece of that kind here i must draw a veil over my own country which is greatly injured if it did not contribute to the ruin of the undertaker of this glorious work an intimate friend at paris sent me word that the sheets of mr le jays polyglot was unfairly procured from the press at paris before the work was published and by the editors of the english polyglot improved and published so soon after as to reduce mr le jay almost to want after his having expended above  000 l sterling to complete his work but as it is unpleasant to relate i shall proceed  as for the other printers who flourished at paris during this space of  0 years since my design is only to mention those who were eminent for improvements unattempted in the former century i have but few to add to the preceding the first in rank and merit is henry stephens the father of that numerous family of printers whose learning and impressions for near  00 years have been celebrated by much better pens and particularly by mr bail and theod janson abroad and by mr nichols collier but much more fully by the laborious and learned mr mattaire in his vitae stephanorum and annals typograph i shall therefore content my self with giving a short account of their great progenitor henry as far as relates to my present subject he began to exercise the art of printing about   0  in company with wolfgang hopyl a noted german printer at paris of whom we have given an account in the foregoing century he had afterward several other partners viz john petit dennis roce john de brie and john hongel all eminent printers we have already spoken of his polyglot psalter which for ought i find was the only piece he did in that way as for the greek it was so little in vogue in his time that he printed but little in it he used two sorts of characters for the latin viz the gothic and roman both good in their kind it were superfluous to tell the reader that he was a man of great skill in the learned languages and wrote several curious pieces in elegant latin he was extremely correct in his editions so that their faults are so few as scarce to deserve an errata yet he always readily acknowledged the smallest number of them as appears from his edition of erasmuss apology against latomus in which he confesses locis aliquot incuria nostra aberratum est that some saults escaped him through neglect though the whole was but twenty hi chief correctors were peter porta volgatius pratensis john solidus of cracow in poland and beatus rhenanus as he was sworn printer of the city of paris instead of a mark or rebus he used to put the arms of that university to his impressions which is the escutcheon of france with a hand from the clouds holding a book several other printers of that city followed his example in this he died in    0 leaving among other children three sons who became very eminent vid mattaire vit steph the two first robert and francis in printing and charles in physic  his successor was simon de colines or colinaeus who married his relict and educated his two sons before mentioned and with them raised the reputation of his printing house higher than their father could whilst the learned languages were in their infancy there i shall only add that robert became so great a proficient under his father and fatherinlaw that he was able to manage that great printinghouse at the age of    and that one of his editions of the new testament in   o ann      printed in a very fine greek character and very scarce is affirmed to be without a fault this deserves notice because there is another of his likewise in   o      which has an errata at the end and is frequently sold for the other i cannot but observe that to this robert stephens we owe the invention of dividing the chapters of the bible into verses found out by him on a journey from paris to lions as we are informed by theod janson de vit stephanorum printed at amsterdam ann      page    the great advantage of which is obvious to every person  before i dismiss the city of paris i cannot forbear mentioning a most curious and elaborate work which though not printed till the year      yet both for its singularity and its having been begun many years before ought by no means to be omitted i mean the book entitled champfleury written by the famous godfrey tory printer and bookseller of the city of bourges at the sign of the broken pitcher and printed by giles gourmont likewise printer and bookseller at paris under the following title  chamfliury auquel est contenu le art and science de la deue and vraye proportion des lettres attiques quon dit autrement lettres antiques and vulgairement lettres romans proportionees selon le corpse and visage humain  the author who for his learning had been some time before chosen president of a college in burgundy and had translated and published several learned works out of greek and latin ever since the year      was afterward admitted sworn printer and bookseller to the king and to the university of paris but became most famous for the curious work abovementioned in which he endeavors to demonstrate the due proportion of letters from those of a human body and face as appears by the title as it would spin this chapter to too great a length were i to give the reader a more particular account of this scarce and singular piece i shall content my self with referring him to mr mattaires annals typogr vol ii part   from page   0 to     where he will find such particularities both of the book and its author as he will think worth reading if he has any taste in this way  i have already dwelt so long upon the subject of polyglots the most considerable improvement of the art in this century and upon the city of paris the most celebrated in france for productions of that kind that i shall scarce have room to speak of lions rouen toulouse caen etc which have produced many excellent works if not in the polyglot way yet in all branches of the art i shall confine my self therefore to those printers who have cultivated the greek or oriental tongues and refer the rest to mr mattaires annals where the reader may see their merit and the list of their impressions  the city of lions has been always the next in rank to paris in every branch of printing and if we consider that it received less encouragement from their princes and the learned the latter choosing to reside at paris where there was a greater probability of advancement we shall wonder that lions was so little inferior to paris and may remember that it produced many valuable impressions during the last century however the reader must not expect any productions in greek much less in hebrew and the polyglot kind during these  0 years or long after since he has seen the slow progress of those languages at paris and with respect to the latin and modern tongues they are foreign to our present purpose i shall therefore only say that the lions printers published many editions of the classics etc law books and especially latin bibles there being scarce a year past for a long time in which they did not print two or three of them of different versions and some with very fine rubricks and other curious embellishments the most remarkable printers of them were james sacon or sachon who printed some works of the fathers and one time two latin bibles in one year james mareschall john moylin and nicholas de benedictis  the city of rouen in latin rothomagium and caen follow next but their productions for these twenty years and after are so inconsiderable if we except a latin bible in  to anno      and the psalterium quincuplex of faber aforementioned which was printed in the latter anno      both by peter olivier and a latin bible in the former that i shall insist no longer upon them with respect to the other cities of france which received the art either before or after the close of the last century their impressions are still less considerable i now pass therefore to holland and flanders where the reader will be surpised to see the art rather sunk and lost than improved in the preceding century we find several cities in holland as utrecht      delph      goude      harlem      and leyden      received and cultivated the art yet now we meet not with a single edition done in any of them nor find that any other city received it during those twenty years as for flanders and brabant it is manifest they have been less negligent than the dutch for the city of antwerp entertained one or two printers who published three or four books during this space the most considerable of which was the new testament in latin and dutch in  to anno   0  and the university of louvain had an eminent printer theodore martin who having printed at his own native town of alost till the end of the   th century removed to antwerp where he published some latin editions and at length came hither and continued printing till      or perhaps longer his impressions in this city are not indeed very remarkable for their bulk beauty or number i find but nine or ten most of which are schoolbooks either written or published by erasmus yet his most considerable work is the latin testament in  vo anno      if it was printed by him as is probable since we find no other printer here during this space though f le long mentions not the printers name  as for the other cities which received the art before   00 as bruges alost brussels gaunt boisleduc etc we find so profound a silence among the annalists and historians as makes me suspect that it either ceased entirely there or that their produce was not worth preserving unless we suppose that they were lost in the war of which this country was the seat in those times which is evidently the case of other countries especially of those upon the rhine switzerland etc some eminent authors have told us that they purchased some of those valuable pieces which had been plundered by the soldiers during the wars out of the libraries of the monks and others if this be fact it is strange that louvain which calls itself the maiden city because it was never taken by any foreign power should not have preserved some more valuable impressions than those of theod martin just mentioned however to do justice to the low countries and holland especially i must say that how negligent soever they were at first in this respect they have sufficiently obliged the world since by their improvements to this art nor need i tell the reader how much they have excelled the english in the goodness of their paper beauty and variety of characters and in elegance and correctness of composition in short how they have equaled any nation of europe in every branch of printing since in the second volume we shall show what improvements they have made to the mechanic part of it and in particular to the printingpress chases etc the former of which is so complete as scarce to admit a greater degree of perfection  here i cannot but observe the strange vicissitudes that have attended this art since its first invention we have seen how diligent the italian nation has been in improving it what quick progress they made in it and to what a degree of perfection they brought it even before the close of the   th century whereas scarce any nation in europe has neglected it more within these hundred years having suffered their elegant roman and italick to degenerate and are become very careless in their compositions ornaments etc so that they are almost inferior to any country in all the branches of printing the french on the contrary who did not introduce the fine venetian roman italick and greek till late in the   th century have been allowed the best printers till elzevir arose since which time the dutch who were by far the latest of any nation in europe in bringing it to the perfection which their neighbors had have been lately superior to all i shall say but little of england where every reader is already sensible what rank our printers here deserve with respect to other countries but it is with the utmost regret that i observe our nation which took so much pains to have the art brought over in its earliest days and cultivated it with so much application should have been so far excelled by the french and dutch printers and even by those of our own nation who lived a century and a half ago but were the reader conscious of the disadvantages we labor under and the small profit we reap from our labor he would rather be apt to wonder that any of us have been able to keep it up to that degree of perfection it is still in i could easily make it appear from whence these difficulties arise this complaint which is far from being new the latin reader will find elegantly expressed above   0 years ago by cornelius kelian one of the great plantines correctors in an epigram of sixteen verses which i have subjoined at the bottom of the page typographus mercenarius art mea varias excudo typographus arts ars tamen haec tenues artifici addit opes rite characteres ad justam redigo normam constet ut ex aequis pagina versiculis incisas nigra fuligine tingo figuras callosa prelum volvo trahoque manu eece iterum hesternus ruihi adest labor actus in orbem quas struxi formas destruo and inde struo diruo and aedifico vigilatus transigo noctes sollicitam cruciat cura premitque labor verum quid prosunt curae durique labores cum misero pateat semita nulla lucri noster alit sudor numatos and locupletes qui nostra redimunt quique locant operas noster alit sudor te bipliopola tuique consimiles quibus est vile laboris opus   however this i may modestly say for our selves that whenever we have met with sufficient encouragement we have demonstrated our capacity by printing as beautiful and correct impressions as any of our neighbors  but to return from this digression which i hope will merit the readers pardon i shall now mention some cities in other kingdoms which received the art after the   th century and conclude this chapter with some remarks on the success of it in other parts of the world  hitherto we have not seen that any printer ventured farther north than the empire of germany as for the kingdoms of poland sweden denmark etc they imported books from germany and other countries and transmitted any works thither which they wanted to have printed i can find no city in those parts except cracow the metropolis of poland that received it so soon as    0 and even in this we have but one inconsiderable impression done in      viz a diary of sigismund the king of polands nuptials printed by one jerome victor in  to i shall therefore pass over to turkey were we find some of the dispersed jews of soncino and particularly rabbi gerson who as we gave an account under the article of that place brought the art to constantinople whilst others settled at thessalonica and other parts of which we have but a small account and carried on the business of printing with good success but it must not be supposed that the turks invited them or any other printers thither much less that they gave them any other encouragement than a large toleration on the contrary we have shown in a former chapter how sultan bajazet ii published an edict in      against the use of printed books under pain of death which edict was afterward confirmed by selim i his son the encouragement therefore which they received was from the christians and jews the latter undoubtedly were pleased to have their own books at a more moderate rate than when they were only transcribed and the former being willing not only to have the old testament printed by them more correct than the editions of christian printers but likewise to have it dispersed among the turks indians etc who were wholly ignorant of those important truths contained in it spared no cost to purchase them besides this their targums talmud and other rabbinical learning were brought up by the christians to furnish themselves with what arguments they could against that poor infatuated people out of their own books and perhaps this might be the main motive which induced those two sultans to publish so severe an edict against printing any books in the turkish language since the aversion of that nation to almost every branch of learning and especially the religious is sufficiently known  i find however but three editions of the sacred books printed in that emperors territories during these twenty years viz at constantinople    the book of tobit in hebrew without points in  to in         the book of esther in hebrew with the commentary of rab isaac armah  to       and at thessalonica  the book of psalms proverbs job and daniel in hebrew with the commentary of r rasi in fol in   00 besides these three editions which are all that mr mattaire has given us out of father le longs bibliothec sacr chevilier page     mentions some others which i shall here subjoin viz    one at constantinople in   0  chevilier does not tell us what it is    jad khasakkah fol ibid   0     josippus ben gorion fol    0  the two last m simon tells us he made use of in his critical history of the old testament    berescith rabbah of rab bar nachman fol constantinople       this book is now in the sorbon library  though these be all that we can yet find to have been printed in turkey from   00 to    0 yet i cannot persuade myself that they were all which the jews printed there but am apt to believe that they were bought up by the eastern christians jews etc and carried to the remote parts of asia and africa whilst the jews of soncino and others were grown so numerous as to supply those countries with works of that kind however that be i do not find that this art made any further progress in these parts of the world during this space or at least that those authors who have represented its advances greater have been much depended on by those that wrote after them and therefore i think myself obliged to stop here  i have already transgressed my proposed limits as often as the life of any eminent printer has extended beyond them or any material occurrence happened worthy of the readers notice agreeable to which liberty i shall now close this chapter with some remarks on the success which attended the art though at some distance of time from the year    0 first it is observable that it has extended itself to africa and america not indeed at the invitation of the natives especially of america but by means of the europeans and particularly of the spanish missionaries who carried it to the latter for their ends where it has throve though not flourished ever since the romish society de propagando fide gives us an account of printinghouses being set up in the cities of goa rachol in the country of salsetta manella the metropolis of the philippine islands etc in the first of which were printed the two following works viz doctrina christiana lingua malabarica tamul et litteris malabaris in collegio goano      this edition was in scaligers possession and is now among those which he bequeathed to the university of leyden the other is part of confuciuss works printed likewise at goa in      a copy of which is now in the emperors library at vienna we find also some printinghouses set up about this time in the city of lima capital of the empire of peru and in several cities of the kingdom of mexico i shall only add that our honorable society for the propagation of the gospel in foreign parts having heard of the good success which mr zidgenbalgh and mr grundler two danish missionaries sent to the coast of tanquebar by his danish majesty had in converting a great number of the natives of that country to the christian faith were pleased to send them the whole apparatus of a printing house with proper workmen and large quantities of paper which they thankfully received and immediately set to work having since printed a fine quarto new testament prayerbooks catechisms etc in portuguese and several eastern languages and characters for the promoting of their pious design  to return again to europe the printers who first introduced the art into muscovy about    0 were less successful that nation was too little friendly to learning to give it any encourgement and even suffered both the printing house and its whole apparatus to be burned and destroyed without ever enquiring after the authors of the mischief the famous thevet historiographer to henry iii of france and a great traveller gives us the following account of it as for the art of printing they the muscovites had not the use of it till    0 when it was discovered to them by a russian merchant who bought a number of types etc with which many neat editions were printed nevertheless as they are a very superstitious nation and apt to raise scruples without any foundation in which they imitate their followers of the greek church some of them hired several fellows privately to burn all their characters apprehending that printing might make some change or confusion in their religion and yet not the least enquiry or prosecution was made after this either by the prince or his subjects but since that time they have admitted it into their metropolis of moscow and elsewhere in the last century though they print but little and sell at excessive rates  i have already hinted that the emperor of ethiopia and monarch of those christians that are commonly known by the name of abyssines who is falsely called by some writers prester john wrote a letter in      to don manuel king of portugal and another in      to his successor john iii which letters are to be seen in the hispania illustrata translated by paul jovius tom   p           in which he desires those princes to send him some of the most curious artificers of europe and in the latter he says thus i entreat you my lord and brother to send me some workmen to carve images to cast books make swords and all sorts of weapons likewise masons carpenters physicians surgeons apothecaries coiners of gold and silver and persons who understand how to extract gold silver and copper out of the mines to cover houses with lead to make shields and muskets and in short all sorts of necessary workmen what success these letters had and whether king john answered his request in any of these particulars i cannot determine but the second tome of the abyssine history by job ludolph or rather the commentator upon it informs us that when abba gregory abyssin saw the library of father alphonso mendez a jesuit whom the pope had sent into ethiopia in quality of patriarch in      he could not forbear extolling that art which had produced so many books and esteeming it as a sacred invention worthy to be placed among the regalia of the greatest princes existimasse typographiam seu sacrum quoddam inventum inter regalia principum haberi vide chevil p      by this it seems that printing had been wholly unknown to them at that time and consequently that it was never sent thither by the king of portugal or any other however our knowledge is very imperfect of those remote parts of africa and even of those which are nearer as morocco fez etc we can only say that it is certain they received the art early from their neighbors the spaniards or portuguese and encouraged it for a considerable time yet whatever be the reason scarce any footsteps of it now remain if we believe mr s olon the french kings ambassador to the king of morocco who in his present state of that empire printed in      assures us that there is scarce one printing house left in it he adds that it is a piece of religion among them not to suffer any corn horses or books to be exported and that their fondness for books is the greater by reason of their scarcity since there is hardly a press in the whole empire  we read of some attempts made by the missionaries in persiae to introduce printing there which proved ineffectual i shall say nothing here of the kingdoms of china and japan nor of their manner of printing having already spoken of it upon another account in the first book of this history  chap viii of the abuses of the art of printing it would have been very wonderful if the encouragement which that art received from the great and learned should not have induced at the same time some persons whose ignorance and avarice would not permit them to aim at that degree of perfection which they saw others arrive at to engage in base methods of enjoying the fruit of their ingenuity and diligence without the trouble of imitating them in it we have already given occasionally some accounts of these practices in counterfeiting the works names and marks of the best printers who have been obliged to remonstrate against them to the world for as soon as they had published a curious and correct edition with prodigious charge and labor some of these pirates immediately printed another after it though in every respect inferior to the former and either by underselling defrauded them of the reward of their care and expense or by counterfeiting their names and marks destroyed their reputation by these abuses they were obliged to make many fruitless attempts in order to suppress these counterfeits and at last to have recourse to the higher powers for privileges and patents the only effectual way to prevent such practices we have likewise hinted that some of these pests of learning have imposed upon the world by selling their impressions as done at venice or some other famous place or pretending they were printed characteribus venetianis with venetian characters etc though they were the production of some obscure place and printer whose only aim was profit  another abuse consequent upon this was the counterfeiting of dates for when by the care of a froben a badius or some other eminent printer the world was so far apprizd of these counterfeits that the authors of them could not vend their impressions they immediately reprinted the title page perhaps with some alteration put a new date and sometimes a new name to it and so passed them off for new editions to recommend them the more to the buyers they generally asserted them to be newly revised diligently compared with the best mss corrected in above  00 places and the like it was with great difficulty that these abuses were detected in such a manner as to make the world aware of them the complaints of the learned and their vain efforts to remedy such inconveniences are too well known to be mentioned here i shall pass to another equally shameful and dangerous abuse viz printing of lewd infamous books of which the learned gerson among many others complains with great zeal and mentions particularly a romance entitled the romance of the rose composed in   00 of which he said that if he was the master of the last copy he would rather choose to burn it than part with it at any price si esset mihi liber romancii de rosa qui esset unicus and valeret mill pecuniarum libras comburerem potius quam venderem  pastor fido is a poem almost universally known which we are told by j nicius erith caused many virgins and married women to prostitute their honor yet great numbers of a much more pernicious nature have been published in those times i shall only mention one which i esteem a masterpiece in that kind heightened by the art of engraving that it might be a consummate piece of the most scandalous lewdness in nature george vasari in the lives of the italian painters gives us this short account of it that julius romanus the most celebrated painter of his age invented above fourscore designs which he caused to be engraven on wood while peter aretine a great libertine and atheist composed a sonnet for each of the prints this vile performance was published about the year      i shall conlude with vasaris character of it io non so qual fusse piu o brutto le spettacolo de i desegni di giulo ali occhio ole parole dell aretino a glerechi vite ad pittori part   p  0  that he knew not which was most brutish and shocking the design of julius to the eye or the verses of aretine to the ear this same avarice which prompted printers to undertake such infamous works as the foregoing induced them to abuse their art in another respect viz in printing scandalous and defamatory libels to the shame of their profession and the regret of the virtuous as printing and the reformation begun about the same time the former was prostituted by the meaner sort who printed the vilest forgeries on each though that which was uppermost acted most flagrantly when the other was obliged to work covertly but as this and the last do not so properly fall within my province as a printer i shall content myself with having just mentioned them with abhorrence of such practices and return to some other abuses  the next arose from want of good correctors for persons of that class were thought too chargeable by many printers who therefore made use of illiterate fellows whom they could hire much cheaper or which often happened used none at all it will easily be imagined what a number of wretched editions the world must have been pestered with by this sordid neglect however as books were not yet so plentifully propagated as to suffice the number of students there wanted not persons either dull or poor enough to purchase them especially upon a small abatement of the common price this made some printers designedly suppress the errata which would have inevitably endangered the sale of such books though others were obliged by the authors or editors to print them at the end of their works the reader will no doubt be surpised to hear of some of them so prodigiously large as to be scarce credible we have a remarkable instance in the works of john francis picus de mirandula printed at strasburgh for the first time in   0  by john kroblouch a man of some note and at the charges of matthias schurrer another eminent printer of that place who styled himself master of arts this edition was so faulty that the author was obliged to make an errata of fifteen pages in filio though the book was but a thin small folio were i to trespass the bounds of this period i could mention some which amounted to fourscore and eight pages even in venice itself where bellarmin who had been very unsuccessful in the former impressions of his polemick works sent them in order to have them more correctly printed though quite the reverse happened rome paris lions etc have been no less complained of upon this account the learned mich fernus who with prodigious labor had collected and revised the works of bishop campanus was so provoked to see them so incorrect that he put an errata in the edition of rome with this surprising title at the head vix ex stulto demens idemque ex de  libros romae primas imprime corruptorum recognitio  if you have a mind to show yourself completely foolish and mad print your books at rome first etc gaguinus was not less displeased to see his history of france printed at paris with such a vast number of faults that he thought it impossible to add an errata to it he therefore sent it to lions to be reprinted and tells the bishop of mascon to whom he entrusted the revising of it that he wished he could get all the  00 copies of the first in order to burn them the like complaints against the printers he repeats in another edition at paris in      and wishes these incorrect and mutilated editions could be condemned to perpetual oblivion galatinuss book de arcanis catholicae veritatis printed at ortona by jerome soncino in      was so wretchedly maimed by the printer that the author inveighed vehemently against all printers in general accusing them in his   th book of adulterating and corrupting the best copies though ever so accurately written in such a manner that it is impossible to mend them but the printers sufficiently revenged themselves on him by reprinting though long after his death the pugio fidei written by raymund martin a dominican friar in    0 against the jews in which edition they unjustly accuse galatinus of having taken the best part of his book out of this though galatinus does ingeniously own in his preface that he had taken the greatest part of his book out of it paul middleburgh a learned dutchman of the university of louvain and afterward bishop of fosembrona in italy having wrote a treatise about keeping easter which he called paulina gave it to a printer of his own metropolis named octaviano petrucio to be printed but he committed it to the care of an ethiopian youth wholly ignorant of the business and who probably made his first trial upon it so that in spite of all the accuracy of posthumous who corrected it it was so maimed and incorect that the author was obliged to complain publicly against such ignorant and careless printers who says he in the preface to the errata of that very book invert the letters change and transpose whole syllables from the end of one word to the beginning of another and put one word in the text instead of another he might have added that they have sometimes omitted not only words and lines but whole paragraphs and chapters or else misplaced them extremely we have in the last chapter given an account of rob stephens who was certainly an excellent printer and yet however it happened m le clerc tells us bibl an and mod page     that he has an edition of the bible in  vo printed by him in a small character containing the vulgate and the version of leo juda with vatabluss notes in which there is a chasm of one whole sheet though the figures of the pages follow each other exactly so that there wants from part of the   to half of the   th chapter of the prophet zachary if so great a man could over look so important a mistake what could be expected from those who valued neither their own reputation nor that of their authors being actuated only by the views of gain his son henry stephens afterward wrote a poem of about   0 latin verses entitled querimonia artis typographicae de illiteratis quibusdam typographis propter quos in contemptum venit a complaint of the art of printing against some ignorant printers upon whose account it is fallen into contempt at the end of this are some latin and greek epitaphs in honor of the most learned printers till that time in this complaint he tells us that the corruption of so many editions was entirely owing to the gross ignorance of the printers some of whom he knew that could not tell the letters of their names proh pudor haud rarus numero reperitur in illo nominis ignorans prima elementa sui  the reader would in all probability be tired if i should mention the tenth part of the complaints which we meet with in the writings of the greatest men of that time against the avarice ignorance and negligence of the printers some of which are so sharp as to call them beasts and drunkards the offspring of wild centaurs and of vulcan s untamed cyclops but i shall choose to give some more diverting instances of their own and their correctors ignorance and neglect  john chapius tells us of a change and transposition of words which rendered the sense wholly unintelligible in his sext decret printed at paris in    0 where under the title de dolo et contumacia he found these words et nuntio ella cum creditur ex de appiurato parati instead of et nuncio jurato creditur ex de apella cum parati henry stephens in his preface to his querimonia just mentioned tells us of an ignorant corrector whom he knew who wherever he met with the word procos used to correct it porcos and change the word exanimare into examinare he mentions others who altered a word they understood not for one more common and known thus in the second epistle of the first book horace says nunc adbibe puero pectore verba puer but the word adbibe not being understood by them they substituted that of adbibe which was more obvious to them yet even this absurd correction is still retained in some more modern editions to this i believe we owe another correction in the same poet where they have changed sectis unguibus into strictis unguibus whereas horace only meant the kind fair ones pared their nails close when they encountered with the youths least the scratches which decency and formality obliged them to give them when they played too rudely should enter deep enough to hurt them chevilier speaks of a book printed by guido mercator at paris in      in which there is a flagrant error in the very frontispiece for the title is elegantiarum viginta praecepta it may be objected that this was an oversight but the contrary is plain since it is printed so in the next leaf and at the end of the book expliciunt elegantiarum viginta praecepta parisiis per guidonem etc so that it evidently arose from their ignorance of the latin tongue nor is this to be wondered at when erasmus tells us in his preface to the  th edition of his adages in      that some of the printers of rome venice and germany scarce knew how to read this same author likewise wrote  0 or    years before this to his friend schurrer a printer of strasburgh john de savigny had been so ill used by these drunken and ignorant printers as he styles them in a work of the learned bishop of gaieta which he published in    0 that he took the most effectual way to make them trumpeters of their own ignorance by couching his reproaches in such terms in greek and latin as were not understood by either printer or correctors his words are these in istos haud abstemios  a clitorio font long remotissimos cudatur faba let the blame be laid upon those drunken and illiterate printers who are equally remote from learning and politeness we shall conclude this subject with one instance more after the bishop of aleria had published his edition of plinys natural history in the dedication of which he tells the pope that he had spent nine whole years in correcting it though he believed nine more would scarce suffice to make a perfect edition hermolaus barbarus corrected almost five thousand faults in it several other learned men engaged in the same province and in particular john caesareus corrected about four thousand faults in his edition printed at cologn by eucharius cervicornus a famous printer of that city in      as he acquaints us in the preface but the composer and corrector suffered a prodigious blunder to go uncorrected in the frontispiece of that book wherein the reader is told that this new edition is corrected in no less than four hundred thousand places  opus hoc locis non paucioribus quam quadringentis millibus emaculatius atque olim nunc demum in lucem prodire  it is surprising that a book should be corrected in so many places since the last edition of it but when the reader comes to the preface he finds but four thousand and the printer put quadringentis millibus instead of quatuor millibus  when it was found that neither the remonstrances of the learned nor their sarcasms continually printed against such printers could prevail upon them to be more diligent and procure better correctors several countries took methods of putting a stop to this growing evil spain was i think the first which showed the example by a way to make the composer and corrector more careful in their respective provinces it was ordered that before a book could be sold it should be examined by censors appointed for that purpose and compared with the manuscript and that all the faults of the impression should be set down in the first least after which they were to write underneath that the book the faults of the impression above noted excepted was faithfully printed this certificate had generally the following title in spanish esta este libro bien impresso y correcto conform a su original de mano en madrid etc signed n n it was sometimes printed in latin where they could not obtain such an order they followed the spanish method as far as they could thus jo ravisius textor professor of rhetoric at paris made a kind of affidavit that he had corrected all the errata of the dialogue of henry hutten entitled aula printed at paris in      by antony aussurd who put under the title page textor emaculavit the same method was followed by henry stephens who in his edition of the pimander of hermes trismegistus printed in   0  published by james fabry destaples has set down the names of the correctors in these words parisiis ex officina henrici stephani recognitoribus mendasque ex officina eluentibus jacobo solido cracoviensi and volgatio pratensi anno   0  we could trace this method as far as the beginning of the   th century which had this good effect that those books in which the correctors had put their names were always preferred to those where no mention was made of any there were afterward better regulations obtained from the higher powers in every kingdom in order to abolish these pernicious abuses but as they do not come within our epoch we shall forbear mentioning them  the reader will excuse me if i so far digress from my subject as to give an instance or two of the dangerous consequences which had like to have happened to two eminent writers of that age to the one by the addition and to the other by the substraction of a single letter the first is of erasmus who in his paraphrase on chapter    v of s matthew where s peter says tu es christus filius dei vivi had written non suspicione proferens sed certa and indubitata scientia prostent illum esse messiam a prophetis promissum singulari more filium dei etc by which last words he only meant as he afterward explained it that christ was the son of god after a particular manner different from that which was common to men but it happened that in his basil edition printed by froben the letter a being added to more made it have a quite disserent sense hereupon noel beda a famous divine of paris and enemy to erasmus failed not to take him to task for that expression and charged him with having affirmed that christ was only the son of god by adoption and by a particular love of god toward him fingulari amore and not his eternal son etc soon after which the divines of paris published a censure of that proposition to the following tenor that it gave a false sense to the words of the evangelist and a handle to men to think wrong of the divinity of the son of god as nestorius had done for that christ was not the son of god by any particular love of god toward him nor by any adoption or favor but that he was originally and necessarily so erasmus cleared himself by saying that it was a fault of the impression and appealed to his original and former edition of the same paraphrase in which they would find the word more instead of amore but he was too much suspected by those gentlemen to be easily believed either in this or any other case  the other happened to the learned dr flavigny author of some letters against mr jays polyglot in which two learned maronites had been employed by mr jay viz abraham echellensis regius professor of syriac and arabic who had given the text and latin version of those two languages of the book of ruth and gabriel sionita professor of the same languages the former of these had committed a great many errors in his translation as well as in the text of that book nevertheless he attacked his brother maronite and charged him with some mistakes in his part of the work hereupon dr flavigny who knew them both equally guilty undertook to rebuke the aggressor and in a letter to him echellensis made use of these words of our savior quid vides fstucam in oculo fratris tui why beholdest thou the mote in thy brothers eye etc it happened unfortunately that the first letter of the word oculo being either taken up by the balls or dropped out of the sorm or some other way lost after the first proofs had been corrected gave a very harsh sound to it and made it seem a profane jesting upon that sacred book echellensis in his answer took notice of this and calls him a sacrilegious and jewish perverter of the holy text and without acquainting him with his faults tells him that such an abominable correction of the text was too foul for his pen and only worthy the writings of a flavigny in short he spends near a whole page in the most opprobrious language against him that the height of malice and resentment could inspire an inveterate antagonist with dr flavigny was a long time before he could discover the cause of this accusation and in all probability might have been still longer ignorant of it had not a friend of his showed it to him in the printed copy for in the two first proofs the word was printed perfect the result was that the author being recovered of his surprise threw the fault upon the corrector appealed to his original and to the two first proofs protested his innocence and abhorrence of such an action and took a solemn oath in order to clear himself chevilier who relates this story tells us that flavigny some time before his death happened to mention this and though it was above  0 years after this transaction he could not forbear expressing the highest indignation against his printer and corrector these instances sufficiently demonstrate the dangerous consequences of neglect in correcting to the author of any book especially in divinity  before i dismiss this article of the incorrectness of the press i cannot but mention some of the greatest printers who when any of their editions have happened to be incorrect have made an ingenuous confession of and apology for it that the commonwealth of learning might not receive any disadvantage by it nor the authors suffer in their reputation through their neglect i shall begin with martin schurrer of strasburgh allowed by erasmus to be a person of learning who printed in   00 the treatise de patientia of bapt mantuanus but as he had committed the care of it to a negligent and ignorant corrector he found himself obliged to add an errata of a page and half to it which he prefaces in the humblest terms imaginable maluimus potius pudore nostro fatendo plecti quam tacendo respublica literarai suo damno nostra peccata sint  i rather choose says he to take the shame of them upon myself by confessing my fault than to let the republic of learning suffer by my concealment of it of this kind is the apology which the same printer makes for the errors of impression in an edition before mentioned viz the works of picus de mirandula wherein he desires the reader errores chalcographis non authori adscribito fatemur ingenue culpam nostram that he would not attribute those errors to the author but to the printer who frankly confesses his fault such erratas not only make some kind of reparations to the authors but oblige likewise an honest printer to be more careful for the future henry stephens has often taken the same method and owns that some errors have crept unawares into some of his editions locis aliquot incuria nostra aberrotum est  i should digress too far if i should instance in all those printers who have followed so good an example it is sufficient to say that none of those eminent ones of whom we have given an account in this whole book have ever been ashamed of acknowledging the faults of their works when they had any share in them i shall close this with a pleasant way which the abovementioned stephens took to correct a fault in his edition de praesagiis in morbis acutis of hippocrates anno      it is obvious to every scholar that the first syllable in the word febris a fever or ague may be either long or short but he having through inadvertency spelt the word with oe which made it absolutely long he corrects himself for it by saying febrem longam sibi chalcographus delegit tametsi febris correpta sit minus periculosa that the printer had foolishly chosen a long fever when a short one was much more eligible as being less dangerous  but after all that has been said concerning the baseness negligence and ignorance of some of the printers of those times it must be owned that many a negligent and ignorant author when he has been admonished of his errors has not scrupled to throw them upon the printer and corrector which i esteem another abuse of the art of printing i could give many instances of it were i not apprehensive of betraying too great a fondness for our profession however any judicious reader will easily perceive by the largest erratas which we have mentioned that the authors had as great a share in them as the printers and correctors chevilier who cannot be suspected of partiality to the latter has excused them in many cases and shown that the fault was rather to be imputed to the former but he has furnished me with an instance of this which i believe he little thought of in the case of a learned divine of the university of paris whose works having been censured by that body and he refusing to retract them he was expelled that university but was afterward prevailed upon to recant after his death a paper was published in his name in which the blame was laid upon the protestant printers to whom he had entrusted the work i shall relate the story exactly after chevilier though somewhat abridgd and leave the reader to judge whether the wrong persons were not unjustly blamed i hope the singularity of the fact will sufficiently excuse me though it is of later date than our prefixed period  rene benoist d d curate of s eustace at paris made a french version of the bible which he caused to be printed in fol ann      by three eminent booksellers of that city this book immediately met with many opposers who censured it as heretical and erroneous alleging that it was only the geneva translation in which the author had softened those expressions which were most shocking to the roman catholics the divines of that university having met several times agreed to censure the book which they did accordingly july         the same censure was renewed and subscribed to by seventy three doctors of that faculty and approved viva voce by above one hundred and twenty more about   years after gregory xii confirmed the censure and condemned the book by a brief dated nov        during this benoist absolutely refused to submit in spite of all the endeavors of that body to persuade him to it at length they agreed upon expelling him that university as an obstinate heretic and the sentence of his proscription was written in great letters and set up in the common disputationhall of the university by which he was as it were executed in essigie however henry iv took him into favor made him his confessor and promoted him to a bishopric but the pope refused to grant him his bull at last his seniority entitling him to be chosen dean of the faculty they all refused their votes unless he would submit to their former censures which he was at length obliged to do by a recantation in which he condemns his version and rejects some parts of it as being falsely attributed to him this was not done till the year      i e    years after the publication of it  in   0  a little before benoists death came out a book in  vo entitled a declaration of rene benoist concerning his translation of the bible and annotations thereupon in which he declares  that the ground of all his sorrow was the treachery of the corrector composer and pressman who had been entrusted with the impression of his bible that the copy which he had given them was a printed one here chevilier notes that it was a geneva one upon which he had made his corrections and erasements which were not so fully erasd but that they might be easily read that some of the journeymen they did not dare publicly to attack their masters who would in all probability have cleared themselves were of the geneva leaven and printed nothing in the first and second proofs but what was in his copy but when they came to the third which he did not see they substituted instead of his corrections the words or notes which he had erasd some instances of which the author of the book gives and which the composer and pressman in confederacy had maliciously falsifyd  that it were tedious to enumerate all such pieces of treachery but that the result of it turned to his reputation notwithstanding his unsuccessful attempts to bring those journeymen to punishment  that his books had been sold under his name though he had disowned them  that the censure of the university and the confirmation of it by the court of rome which had condemned the work and not the author was the consequence of this imposture etc    i shall not enter into a detail of the reflections which chevilier makes upon the calvinist printers as he calls them nor enquire whether this declamation was really penned by benoist or fathered upon him or if the former whether it might not be extorted from him a practice not unusual with the divines of that church i shall only observe that were the case as it is related in that pamphlet it is scarce credible that the doctor could have been  0 years unapprisd of it especially when the censures and libels continually published against him sufficiently pointed it out to him and if he knew it can it be imagined that he would have continued so long under all that scandal and the persecution of his enemies when he might have easily cleared himself of the one and so put a stop effectually to the other upon the whole whoever the author of this declaration is this story evidently confutes itself and is no other than one of their pious frauds on which it is not my province to animadvert any further than the credit of our profession is concerned  before i close this chapter it will be necessary to remind the reader that this second book being wholly confined to the history of printing in other parts of europe what relates to our nation being the subject of the next book i have given none but foreign instances of the corruptions and abuses introduced into this art  it is not therefore to be concluded that it has been free in any case from them in england since we have imitated our neighbors in these bad as well as in their other good examples and therefore as these abuses have been equally common to us and them i shall not repeat them in the english part but only request the reader once for all to remember that we have had our share as well in the disadvantages under which our art has labored as in the advantages and improvements which it has received  appendix an account of a newly discovered edition printed by john guttenberg at stratzburg in      communicated to me by and now in the possession of the right honorable the earl of pembroke the reader may be pleased to recollect that i have throughout the first book of this history constantly endeavored to fix the glory of the invention of printing upon john faust and that of the improvements of it upon his worthy soninlaw peter scheoffer exclusive of john guttenberg notwithstanding the testimony of some few writers who have ascribed the first discoveries to the latter i did likewise offer it as a probable conjecture of the ingenious mr maittair that guttenberg having been cast in a lawsuit at mentz for nonsolvency of his quota might retire to stratzburgh and there teach john mentel what he had been able to learn of fausts art we had not till then the least ground to conjecture that he ever practiced it himself no annalist that ever i could meet with ever mentioning or perhaps dreaming of any edition printed with his name but since then the noble lord abovementioned unwilling to rest satisfied with conjectures has spared no pains or cost to inform himself whether there was any impression extant done by guttenberg and has at length procured this curious one which his lordship has been pleased to communicate to me the reader i doubt not will be highly satisfied to find that instead of contradicting any thing i have advanced upon that subject it rather confirms it all beyond any possibility of doubting  the book is the dialogues of st gregory in latin it has no titlepage but begins abruptly with the subject itself only at the end of it are these words  explicit liber quartus dyalogor   gregorii then follows in red letters  presens hoc op  factum est per johan guttenbergium apud argentinam anno millesimo cccclviij i shall now beg leave to make a few remarks on this curious piece and to show how manifestly it confirms all my former conjectures    it is very rude and comes vastly short of those of faust and scheoffer and the great and almost constant difference of the shapes of the same letters shows it to have been done upon wooden blocks after the manner of the paginae conglutinatae mentioned above page    and seq there is however this difference and improvement in it that it is not printed with the same that is with the common ink which made them incapable of a reiteration i e of being printed but upon one side but with the new invented sort which was a mixture of oilvarnish and lampblack and will bear printing on both sides this therefore shows that he had only got an insight into the first discovery but was an utter stranger to the last and more useful one of separate metaltypes which faust had probably kept concealed from him    supposing it to be the first piece that ever he did as it probably was if not the only one of that kind it was printed in      i e about three years after the lawsuit and his falling out with faust so that it took him up all that time in cutting his blocks and getting the rest of the apparatus of a printingpress making of trials maculatures etc after he was settled at stratzburgh    it is printed one year after the psalter of mentz which was done in separate metaltypes and wherein faust and scheoffer assume to themselves the whole glory of the invention so that had guttenberg had the least pretension to it he would not have failed doing himself justice by altering the style of his colophon and telling the world what share he had borne in this noble discovery that his silence was not owing to his honesty is plain from his refusing to pay his dividend of the charges much less to his being ignorant of the publication of fausts psalter because mentz and stratzburgh being both situate upon the rhine and not above  0 leagues asunder it was morally impossible he should not have heard of it on the contrary it is likely that having seen it and observed it to be printed with fusile types he might just finish this rude edition of his and then stop his hand until mentel and he had fallen upon the same way of casting them    this piece is printed upon the same paper that faust did use which is marked with the heifers head and horns and might either be his share of the paperstock which they divided at parting and which he took away with him or else might be designedly imitated by him to give a credit to his work upon the whole its having neither titlepage running title signature nor directionword and being altogether a rude piece of workmanship does plainly show it to have been of the nature of the first essays of faust and that it is by no means antedated  a catalogue of some of the most eminent persons authors and editors etc who condescended to prepare mss and to correct for the press during the   th century with the character of some of the most considerable of them at basil for john amerback    john capnio alias reuchlin an eminent lawyer who had studied at paris under the famous john de lapide doctor of sorbonne at whose request he wrote three books de verbo mirifico he wrote another treatise which he entitled oculare speculum for which the universities of cologn mentz louvain and erphord condemned him of heresy and judaism and made pressing instances to that of paris to do the same to prevent which reuchlin wrote to the doctors of sorbonne and reminded them that he had been lapidanuss disciple and that the university of paris was his dear mother but as all his rhetoric could not prevent his book being censured by the paris divines he calls her afterward an unnatural stepmother he was one of the most diligent promoters of the study of hebrew of which himself was a good master though he did not learn it of lapidanus as some have imagined but from a jewish rabbi called jacob jehiel loans to whom therefore he directs a letter inscribed as follows johannes reuchlin praeceptori suo jacobo jehiel loans judaeo etc it is likely therefore that after his squabble with those universities he retired to basil where he became corrector to the great amerback who was himself a very learned man and had taken his degrees of master of arts in the university of paris

beat rhenanus adds in his vita erasmi that he was a man of such extensive reading and profound erudition that there was nothing so obscure and intricate which he could not render plain and easy by his eloquence ald manucius does likewise commend him very highly not only for his vast learning but also for his indefatigable diligence and accuracy in comparing and correcting ancient manuscripts both greek and latin and fitting them for the press upon which account the care and correction of that noble edition of the etymologicon magnum printed at venice by zacbary caliergius in      was committed to him  for benet locatelli ibid  mauricius de hibernia afterward bishop of tuamo  at vincentia for herman levilapis  aeneas wolpius prior of the convent of the holy cross  i have only mentioned some of the most famous for their learning and diligence besides whom there were many more who though of an inferior class in comparison of the former yet were all men of letters and vastly superior to those which printers have been forced to make use of in process of time it must be also remembered that many of those printers of the   th and part of the   th century were men of great learning and parts and indefatigable industry able to prepare their manuscripts for the press and to correct their own works such were the great amerback at basil who was master of arts in the university of paris froben his worthy partner and successor ant coburger at nurembergh aldus manucius and azulanus at venice jodocus badius at lions and paris and many more of whom we have given an account in this history and yet it is observable from this table that those who were the most capable of correcting their own works did still entertain the greatest number of correctors  however i must not omit acquainting the readers that those great persons whom we have mentioned in this list were not properly correctors in the sense we now understand that word that is men retained by a proper salary to perform that function but editors or authors and correctors only of their own works or if at any time they were prevailed upon to oversee any curious edition it was done rather out of curiosity than for gain for it is certain that every printer had besides a corrector of an inferior rank to revise and correct every proof if he did not do it himself before they were sent to those great men whose corrections were generally of a higher nature what makes me mention this distinction is the grief which the famous erasmus conceived at his being upbraided by count carpi and more particularly by jul staliger with having served as corrector in alduss printing house and the pains he took to clear himself from that imputation every body knows that erasmus had ventured to print a dialogue entitled ciceronianus in which he endeavored to show that cicero was more cried up than he deserved at which scaliger was so enraged that he wrote a vindication of that great master of eloquence in two different orations which he soon after printed in the last of which he addresses himself to erasmus in words to this effect did not you get a livelihood by correcting aldus s proofs and were not those errata we meet with in them more owing to your drunken carelessness than to the printer do they not smell stronger of your drunken cups than of the composers dullness he afterward affirmed that he met with aldus one day at mantua who told him that erasmus was wont to dispatch as much business in one day as other correctors did in two and to solace himself the rest of the time with drinking of good malmsy wine erasmus was so galled at this oration that as merula tells us he bought and burnt all the copies he could possibly get of it and that he succeeded so well that there was not one to be met with however in his answer to count carpi he says that he was so far from correcting for aldus unless it were his own works that he refused that office to some eminent cardinals who desired him to revise the laft proofs of some works then printing that if he took any thing else in hand whilst he staid at venice it was not for lucre but out of curiosity and acquaints us that aldus had a constant corrector to his press named seraphim and then adds can he be called a servant who revises only his own works for i never did any thing else for aldus whose printing house i used only for my convenience he has likewise been supposed to have corrected for theodore martin at louvain but it is likely that it was in the same manner and on the same foot as he did it at venice i had not dwelt so long on this nice distinction were it not that those annalists who have mentioned these great and learned men as correctors have not sufficiently taken notice of it besides it ought to be considered that there is a vast difference between printing and correcting the works of ancient authors after a number of manuscripts which have been mutilated and spoiled by every hand through which they passed and printing the works of a modern author after his own manuscriptcopy who is at hand either to revise it or to be consulted upon any difficulty the former province requires persons of the greatest learning abilities and most indefatigable application in reading and comparing their manuscripts in order to distinguish between the genuine meaning of an author and the blunders of his transcribers whereas the latter may be supplied by a person of moderate parts and industry as therefore they have been the greatest promoters of learning i hope the reader will not blame me if i have endeavored to do them all possible justice and to distinguish them from those lazy and ignorant ones who have been and are still justly reckoned the common pests of it  the end of the second book the editor to the reader soon after mr palmer s death i was desired to see what was still wanting to complete his history of printing according to his first proposal and what materials he had left behind i found upon enquiry that five sheets of this last number were already printed off but that the third sheet in course viz q q was left unfinished being partly composed and partly in manuscript most likely in expectation of that curious edition which the r h the earl of pembroke was then in search after which has been mentioned in the appendix to this second book and this seems to have been the cause of his delaying this last number so long that his last sickness prevented his publishing it  the reader will no doubt be as much surprised as i was myself at finding the last page of the second book and the first of the third book so differently numbered and that there is a retrogression from     to     but as the signatures of each sheet do follow in their regular course i am fully persuaded that it must have been an oversight either of the compositor or of the author which we hope the reader will easily forgive especially considering that there is not any thing wanting to complete this second book and that the materials he left behind do even exceed his computation for filling this suspended sheet however as there were but three sheets thus misnumberd having been printed off long before the authors death i have ventured to set all the remaining ones in their due order to avoid the confusion that would otherwise unavoidably happen in the index and hope the reader will be kind enough to do the same with his pen to these three following sheets those who know what a tedious sickness mr palmer did labor under during the last two years of his life will pass by so inconsiderable an oversight in consideration of what he has done when he enjoyed a better state of health as for the rest of this history we hope to find the materials in so good an order that there will be little to do but to print after his manuscript excepting where the noble lord abovementioned or some of his learned correspondents have communicated some new discoveries too curious to be passed by and this furnishes me with an opportunity of adding a new authority to what has been before advanced concerning the first invention of printing by john faust at mentz omitted by mr palmer and since communicated to me by an ingenious friend of his it is a paragraph extracted out of fox s book of martyrs printed in      page     wherein that learned author gives an account of the first discovery of that art in all the main particulars exactly agreeable to what has been advanced in the first part of this history and is to this purpose that about the year    0 or as others affirm      and    0 one john faust of stratzburg and since a citizen of mentz found out the way of printing by engraving upon metals and by degrees improved it to cutting of single words and at length single letters that after some essays he communicated his discovery to john guttenberg and peter scheoffer and these three being first sworn to inviolable secrecy made some considerable improvements in it that guttenberg did at length with john mentel publish the art at stratzburg which was soon after brought to greater perfection by some eminent printers in other places and in particular by ulrick han or gallus at rome etc from this short account it is plain that our english author had his intelligence from much better hands than many of the writers that have been quoted on that subject and it is no small pity that he who has so exactly informed himself with what had been done at mentz had not given us also an account of the introduction and progress of the art here in england we might then have found a much more satisfactory account of it than the reader will find in the next book from all that mr palmer could possibly procure from other authors and records however as to this testimony i doubt not but he would have been glad to have given it an honorable place in his first book had he been apprised of it but it is not much to be wondered at that a book of martyrs should be one of the last pieces of history wherein one would have looked for it what dr fox says of their cutting or engraving upon metal and not upon wood as mr palmer and others have since more truly affirmed can be only looked upon as a pardonable mistake in the former who could not be expected to be a judge of things of this nature whereas what the latter advances may be surely relied on not only because it was in his own province and that he neither wanted opportunities nor spared any pains to inform himself aright in all those curious particulars but also because his modesty would not suffer him to rely upon his own judgment till he had it confirmed by other eminent masters in the art of printing lettercutting etc  book iii of english printing and printers chap i of the arts being first brought to england all our english historians and chroniclers who have touched on this subject before richard atkins viz stowe baker howel etc have proceeded only upon conjecture or common and fallacious reports or perhaps the first of these forementioned authors led the rest into these mistakes that printing was not invented till the year      nor brought into england till anno      that at the abbey of westminster the first presses were set up that dr islip abbot of westminster first introduced the art into england and that england had it at least  0 years before any other city of europe except mentz and harlem the falsity of several of these particulars sufficiently appears from the first book of this history and the others are manifestly disproved since i have seen a book in the earl of pembrokes library printed at the university of oxford anno      however their mistakes were unavoidable in those times because they were ignorant of several material particulars and of the first editions which were absolutely necessary to determine the true periods of the invention and introduction of the art into england  but in      richard atkins esquire published an account of the forementioned edition and an old manuscript chronicle preserved at lambeth in the archbishops palace in his original and growth of printing printed by order of the right honorable mr morris secretary of state the design of this book which is little more than an invective against the company of stationers is to prove that printing is a branch of the royal prerogative and a flower of the english crown this chronicle however of which a friend of his whom he does not name sent him a copy is far from being of undoubted authority since it is liable to these exceptions   that neither atkins nor his nameless friend pretend to have seen the original much less to have compared the copy with it   they give no account when and by whom this chronicle was written and how it was bequeathed to the lambeth library   no author that i know of besides atkins mentions this chronicle in lambeth library except those who quote it from him though that author hoped that his book would occasion the discovery and publication of it in time for public satisfaction p     it is not to be found there now for the earl of pembroke assured me that he employed a person for some time to search for it but in vain   it gives an account of some particulars altogether inconsistent with the more authentic accounts which we are now masters of with respect to the circumstances of the first discovery of the art so that we may suppose that whoever the author was he has taken some part of his account from common report and from the dutch who have laid claim to this invention i might add that atkins has so interspersed the chroniclers account with his own observations that it is very difficult to distinguish them exactly however imperfect and precarious as it is since it gives us the most probable and clear account of this important affair i shall here set it down as i find it in the author abovementioned after which i shall endeavor by reconciling some inconsistencies in it explaining several particulars and adding some necessary remarks upon the whole to lead the reader if not to a certain at least to the most probable account of this matter  the chronicle is as follows  thomas bourcher archbishop of canterbury moved the then king henry  th to use all possible means for procuring a mold for sotwas then called to be brought into this kingdom the king a good man and much given to works of this nature readily hearkened to the motion and taking private advice how to effect this design concluded it could not be brought about without great secrecy and a considerable sum of money given to such person or persons as would draw off some of the workmen from harlem in holland where john guthenberg had newly invented it and was himself personally at work twas resolved that less than one thousand marks would not produce the desired effect toward which sum the archbishop presented the king with three hundred marks the money being now prepared the management of the design was committed to mr robert turnour who then was of the robes to the king and a person most in favor with him of any of his condition mr turnour took to his assistance mr caxton a citizen of good abilities who trading much into holland might be a creditable pretense as well for his going as stay in the low countries mr turnour was in disguise his beard and hair quite shaven off but mr caxton appeared known and public they having received the said sum of one thousand marks went first to amsterdam then to leyden not daring to enter harlem itself for the town was very jealous having imprisoned and apprehended diverse persons who came from other parts for the same purpose they stayed till they had spent the whole one thousand marks in gifts and expenses so as the king was fain to send five hundred marks more mr turnour having written to the king that he had almost done his work a bargain as he said being struck between him and two hollanders for bringing off one of the workmen who should sufficiently discover and teach this new art at last with much ado they got off one of the under workmen whose name was frederick corsells or rather corsellis who late one night stole from his fellows in disguise into a vessel prepared before for that purpose and so the wind favoring the design brought him safe to london  twas not thought so prudent to set him on work at london but by the archbishops means who had been vice chancellor and afterward chancellor of the university of oxon corsellis was carried with a strong guard to oxon which guard constantly watched to prevent corsellis from any possible escape till he had made good his promise in teaching how to print so that at oxford printing was first set up in england which was before there was any printingpress or printer in france spain italy or germany except the city of mentz which claims seniority as to printing even of harlem itself calling herself urbem moguntinam artis typographicae inventricem primam though it is known to be otherwise that city gaining that art by the brother of one of the workmen of harlem who had learned it at home of his brother and after set up for himself at mentz  this press at oxon was at least ten years before there was any printing in europe except at harlem and mentz where also it was but new born this press at oxford was afterward found inconvenient to be the sole printing place of england as being too far from london and the sea whereupon the king set up a press at st albans and another in the abbey of westminster where they printed several books of divinity and physic for the king for reasons best known to himself and council permitted then no law books to be printed nor did any printer exercise that art but only such as were the kings sworn servants the king himself having the price and emolument for printing books  thus far the chronicle or our authors extract from it for as i observed before he distinguishes not his own from the chronicle nor acquaints us whether it be literally copied from the chronicle or an abstract of it nor whether it mentions any other transactions besides that of bringing printing to england i shall therefore follow him no further at present but examine the truth of the several particulars of this account yet previous to this i shall observe that we have the like account of this affair in antony wood s history and antiquities of the university of oxford printed in      i e ten years after atkins had published his piece from which the forementioned author seems to have taken his account wholly in many particulars of which he has been confuted by several writers as shall be shown immediately to return to atkinss book which is unknown to foreigners and seen but by few in england the author of that chronicle is mistaken in several points   in supposing harlem or harlein as he calls it to be the place from whence corsellis came it is not probable that the art was invented there especially by guttenbergh and in the year      since it appears the psalter was prinat mentz by faust two years before that besides the several books printed on wooden blocks again if the book mentioned by atkins and wood to have been printed at oxford anno      be the first book printted there it is plain that city had not the art ten years before any other because i have lately seen a book printed at strasburg by john guttenberg in      as i have already hinted in the postcript of the foregoing number besides strasburg it was at venice the monastery of sublaco ausburgh rome and france before      if it be urged that there might be other books printed before that at oxford or that it required some time to get all the necessary materials of a printing house the same pleas will equally serve for those other places now mentioned lastly if we admit guttenbergh to have carried the art to holland which we shall show hereafter to be extremely probable it will be still false that mentz received it from the brother of one of his workmen these are the inconsistencies and contradictions to plain facts now certainly known which derogate from the authority of this chronicle and of those that follow it we shall now endeavor to clear these inconsistencies or at least to show how the author of it was led into these palpable errors and from thence to discover the real truth of the whole transaction  we have already hinted at the probability that he rather followed the reports spread about from holland than made a strict enquiry into this subject this will appear more plain from the following considerations   we hinted in our  st book that during the infancy of the art faust and schoeffer and together with them guttenbergh carried on the business with all possible secrecy till the former being obliged to discover it at paris for his own safety and the latter having broke the partnership and gone to set up the art elsewhere it was thought of no further use to conceal this invention   the reader may call to mind that we advanced a probable conjecture of mr mattaires that guttenbergh being cast at law and sentenced to reimburse his moiety and pay the charges of the suit went away to strasburgh to evade the sentence which is now confirmed by the book printed there just now mentioned where not thinking himself fafe from further prosecution he might really come down to harlem and there instruct coster or some others in the art this seems to be more than probable not only from the chronicles mentioning guttenbergh and not coster as inventor of the art but likewise from his dating the invention nine years later than it was discovered which must be ascribed to its not having been known at harlem till the year      though it had been practiced at mentz from the year    0 or soon after as has been sufficiently shown before  again if we consider that holland and the low countries were the only places of germany into which we traded whereas the city of mentz which lies very far in the continent was then little known to us we shall not wonder that our first accounts of the original of printing should be taken from the dutch agreeable to their violent claims to the invention of it and their scandalous stories invented to deprive faust of his discovery for the chronicle acquaints us that the city received it from a fugitive servant of guttenbergh who had learned it from his brother then working with him and went to set it up there there remains one single difficulty still why the chronicle attributes the invention to guttenbergh when all their writers make no mention of him but ascribe it wholly to their countryman coster to solve this if we suppose this account given to the author by frederick corsellis or even by mr caxton or turnour which is very probable we may justly presume that they spoke as they were informed on the spot agreeably to the account which guttenbergh gave of himself and of his invention which the dutch dared not to contradict till after his death or departure from holland when they assumed the whole discovery to themselves and represented coster as the sole inventor exclusive of every other pretension i have dwelt longer on these circumstances because they notoriously demonstrate that those contradictions to plain facts universally known and assented to by all but the dutch writers confirm the authority of the rest of the chronicle since they are exactly drawn from the legends of that nation which were then generally believed over all the low countries and were the only accounts that our merchants and particularly the two gentlemen employed by the king could procure concerning the original of printing and it is not improbable that what the chronicle mentions of the imprisonment of several persons at harlem on suspicion of a design to steal the art might be done rather out of fear least any of those strangers should rob them of their honor by exposing the vantiy of their pretensions since themselves could not be ignorant of what was done at mentz long before that time  before i dismiss this chronicle which as i observed was unknown till mr atkins published it i shall give an account which i found in a manuscript now in my possession which seems to be much older than the year      when mr atkins published his account and which a few circumstances excepted entirely agrees with that of the chronicle the part relating to the introducing of printing into england being very short i believe will be acceptable to the reader and is as follows  the rise and progress of printing in england  the art of printing was first brought into england in the time of hen vi at the charges of the archbishop of canterbury bourchier who employed one turner master of the robes to the king and one mr caxton a mercer of london but using the trade of a merchant to go to harlem to endeavor to bring over some of the workmen that had then newly practiced the art there who prevailed upon some of the underworkmen to come over with them into england and to teach them their trade as soon as they were landed they were conveyed under a guard to the university of oxford for fear they should run back again and there they set up a press about the year      as appears by several books that were printed there about that time the names of those workmen were rood an almayn or german and winken de word and the charges of the journey cost the archbishop   00 marks as appears by several papers and memorials relating to this matter that are still extant in the library at lambeth shortly after there was a press set up at the abbey of st albans which continued till the dissolution etc  the remainder being foreign to this chapter shall be communicated in some of the following to which it more properly belongs i need not observe that this manuscript ascribes all the honor of this transaction to the archbishoshp whereas the chronicle assures us that the king contributed the greatest sum toward it the date mentioned in my manuscript is a year before the oxford edition came out  it may be here objected that the year      cannot bring it within the reign of henry vi who had been deposed six years before but i answer that the manuscript does not assert that the dutch printers came not into england till that year but that their press was not set up till then and though this happened in another reign yet it will still be true that king henry caused them to be brought over whilst he was upon the throne though the civil wars and his being deposed put a stop to their proceedings for six or seven years we shall have occasion to remark further upon this in the next chapter as for its complementing the archbishop with having been at the whole expense of the journey it may be ascribed to want of better information or partiality to that prelate who might still be in great esteem under king edward whilst the good king henry was stripped of the royal dignity and wholly neglected with respect to the two printers mentioned there the first is probably the same theodoric rood who printed afterward by himself and of whom we have but two editions printed at oxford in    0 and      of which we shall give a further account in the next chapter whether he came along with corsellis as an underworkman is difficult to determine  i am of opinion that winken de word came not to england till some years after though he might easily be confounded by the author of the m s with the other on account of his dutch name and of his having signalized himself afterward by the number and elegance of his editions which he printed both under caxton and by himself thus it is ain that the few records which we have agree in the following particulars that archbishop bourchier solicited king henry vi to procure the establishment of the art of printing in this kingdom that the king not only consented but contributed largely to it that turner and caxton were employed in this design that it cost   00 marks to execute it that it was happily effected during the reign of henry vi i e before the year      since in the beginning of that year he was deposed by edward iv and lastly that oxford was fixed upon by the king and archbishop to set up the first press in and make the first essays of this art which city therefore shall be the subject of our next chapter  chap ii printing at oxford by frederic corsellis some english authors and particularly mr howel are of opinion that the first trials of this art were made in the ambry belonging to westminsterabby where mr caxton afterward carried on the business with good success for a considerable time as shall be related in its place but as they affirm this upon the supposition that the abbot of that place islip was the person who procured the art to be brought to england whereas the chronicle abovementioned which they knew nothing of asserts the contrary in both these respects i think it more reasonable to follow it than those writers nor indeed is it probable that any but a crowned head or some persons employed by him would venture upon such a dangerous project besides this account of the chronicle is confirmed by the edition of      mentioned in the preceding chapter of which we shall speak more fully hereafter for though this comes short in date of the last year of henry vi by seven or eight years yet it is older by at least as many than any impression of caxtons at westminster as far as has been yet discovered add to this that according to their supposition that mr caxton learned the art from the workman brought over from holland we must necessarily suppose the latter to have made several essays and printed a volume or two at least before the former could be perfect enough in it to engage in that province but i am far from thinking that caxton either learned the art from him or even came over to england with him since it is much more probable that he dispatched mr turnour with corsellis thither and carried on his commerce as well as his studies beyond sea i am inclined to this opinion by a passage in the preface to the second book of his history of troy which he tells us he translated from the french at the desire of the duchess of burgundy the kings sister which translation he says he began at bruges anno      continued at gaunt and finished at cologn anno a thousand four honderd lxxi hence it is plain that he was still traveling in flanders and germany three years after the first edition printed by corsellis at oxford nor does it appear that caxton came presently after to england but stayed to write a third book in the last mentioned place cologn as he informs us in these words  the third book of the destruction of troy  i have now good leyzer in cologn  i have delibered in my self being  to take thislaboure in hand it is unreasonable to imagine that a man of his years of which he complains in the same preface saying that age crept on him daily and feebled all the body should come along with the dutch printer and learn the art from him and then go traveling again having one book to translate and another to write viz his fruits of time i am of opinion therefore that he learned the art at least got a good insight into it abroad and perhaps at cologn though he might make himself master of the practical part of it after his return into england  thus far therefore it is plain that caxton had been on his travels some time when corsellis printed that first edition at oxford that the latter was the first printer in england and that oxford was the place where the first press was set up the chronicle gives these reasons why that printer was sent thither   because it was an inland town out of which it would be less possible for him to escape than from london or any place near the sea   archbishop bourchier who had been vice chancellor and was then chancellor of that university may be supposed to have had a more than ordinary regard for it and in consequence of that to have prevailed upon the king to honor it with the first press to these we may add the two following viz   that an university was the most proper place for such a work because it would still be under the eye and direction of the learned men there who could make choice of the best works to be printed the best mss to print from and the most skilful persons to correct them   the city of london and almost the whole kingdom being disturbed and divided by the earl of marchs party and the court engaged in opposing his measures an university was a much safer and quieter place to lay the foundation of this art in than any other in the kingdom corsellis therefore and those to whom he was to discover the secret having sworn fidelity to the king and his successors and being admitted into the number of the kings servants and household began to exercise this art as soon as they had got all things ready for it how long they were thus employed in their preparations and what progress they made after i shall next enquire  the reader will have just cause to admire that if they began so soon as the latter end of henry vis reign viz before anna      they should have published no work yet discovered till seven years after viz      and that there are but three editions extant between that time and the year      the edition of      included and what is still more admirable that from that year to      which is above  00 years thee is not one volume to be found printed at oxford though the art flourished in several other parts of england as will appear in the progress of this history this last particular i can by no means account for but the other i mean their slow progress at first is easily solved by what has been hinted before viz the troubles which were then breaking forth and fell upon the king and court as well as his deposition which happened immediately after their first settlement in that university together with the opposition made continually by his queen and friends against his victorious rival besides if we consider that the printers were sworn servants to the crown and consequently incapable to act without the kings special order or at least his license whilst henry their patron was out of power and the reigning monarch otherwise employed it will be very easy to account for these delays and the small progress which they made in those troublesome times we may likewise with great probability suppose that most of their works were such as were adapted to those times of superstition as prayerbooks manuals legends etc which perished soon after the reformation  it must be owned indeed that the author of the chronicle so often mentioned tells us that as soon as corsellis had performed his promise and instructed a sufficient number of others in the art it was thought proper to disperse them some to westminster others to st albans etc yet it is still very surprising that so considerable a place as oxford could not detain one of them by a sufficient encouragement however it is plain that except theodoric rood a german and native of cologn who very probably came over with mr caxton from thence and of whom we have discovered but two editions there are no other footsteps of printing in this university extant from that time to      nor any tolerable account among the writers of those times for such a wonderful scarcity but this is not the only thing which the reader will be surpised at with relation to the slow progress which printing made at oxford  i have in the former book given an account of vast improvements made to that art in foreign countries and to what a degree of perfection the italians and french in particular had brought it not only with respect to the exquisite beauty and variety of characters richness and elegancy of composition etc but likewise by their introducing the learned and eastern languages as greek hebrew arabic etc into their printinghouses even before the year    0 and printing several curious polyglot works in all these tongues besides the latin but though i have extended this english history thirty years further than theirs viz to the year    0 yet the reader must not expect to find any thing of this nature done in england during that time our first printers though excellent men in their way contented themselves with printing in their own tongue and if they ventured sometimes either upon latin or french their productions in those languages were few and inconsiderable but with respect to greek and hebrew either through want of due encouragement from the learned or of courage in them it is certain they never attempted any thing of that kind till a long time after  the reader may remember with what difficulty the parisian printers were prevailed upon to venture upon such works what objections and obstacles they raised against so expensive and hazardous an undertaking yet a learned frenchman so far prevailed with some of them that he had the pleasure of seeing several of his own works printed in those languages the reception of which soon encouraged them to proceed in several noble undertakings but the case was far different in england for the learned dr wakefield having made an oration in      to recommend the study of the hebrew and arabic tongues and show the usefulness and necessity of them was obliged to publish it maimed and imperfect wanting near a third part because as he tells us the printers of that time had no hebrew types though it was printed by wynken de word one of the most eminent printers in europe of that age printing in greek made no great figure in england before the   th century and the most learned work which we have to boast of was the polyglot bible of dr walton mentioned at the latter end of the last book which was not printed till after the restoration by mr thomas roycroft of whom i shall say more hereafter  except this i dont find any footsteps of any works in the polyglot kind but what were small and inconsiderable however we like the dutch have sufficiently since attond for the slow progress which our ancestors made in those noble branches of printing  i shall now give an account of the editions before mentioned between the years      and         sancti hieronymi expositio in symbolum apostolorum  to without the printers name  oxon       this ancient piece begins with the following title incipit expositio sancti jeronimi in symbolum apostolorum ad papam laurentium at the end are the following words explicit expositio sancti jeronimi in symbolo apostolorum ad papam laurentium impressus oxonie and finita anno domini mcccclxviii xvii die decembris there is one in the bodleian library given by the learned bishop barlow who wrote with his own hand in the first page that this exposition was not st jeromes but rufinuss rufini est haec expositio non hieronymi and in the last page he wrote as follows  stephen bateman doctor of divinity and chaplain to hen carry ld hunsden upon bartholomaeus de proprietatibus rerum the book was writ in latin anno      translated into english in      in the last he tells us that bartholomeus was first printed in english in      and then he adds  at which time printing began first in england the   th year of hen vi but he is manifestly mistaken for this foregoing book was printed in      at oxford at least two years before this remark of dr bateman has another gross mistake besides that observed by bishop barlow which is that the year      was far from being the   th of henry vi who had been deposed  0 years before the   th year of that kings reign was the year      in which it is probable some foundations of printing had been laid in england though for the aforementioned reasons we meet with nothing done in that kind till eight or nine years after we shall affirm nothing concerning this english edition of barth de propriet rer though it is reasonable to suppose it printed at oxford since we have no other account of it but this manuscript note of bishop barlow    leonardus aretinus in aristot ethic comment oxon       i think twill not be amiss to insert here what is wrote before these two books which are in the pembroke library it is as follows  here are the only two books to be seen by corsellis the first printer at oxford though there are other copies of the first of the second we know of only this these are printed on the same shaped letters as the rationale and catholicon by faust vulgarly doctor faustus the civil wars in edward ivs time might probably hinder the progress of the press the third book viz    aegidius de romd alias aegidius columna romanus archiep bituricens ord eremit s aug de peccato originali  to oxon       was printed about the time of the second and it is probable this was printed by corsellis for the next printer at oxford was rood as appears by the following book    the destruction of troy in latin by guido de columna by t r oxon    0  there is also one more printed by rood at oxford mentioned by orlandi viz    alexandri ab hales angli sententiosa atque studio digna expositio super tertium librum de anima impressum per me theodoricum rood road de colonia xi october in alma universitate oxon       both corsellis and rood are mentioned by our historians to have been brought over by caxton caxton with sir richard whetehilt were sent after he brought in the art by edward iv to settle a commerce with the duke of burgundy in      vide rymers faedera  thus much for oxford in the infancy of the art  chap iii westminster mcccclxxiv westminster being the most considerable place on several accounts and particularly for its productions and the great applause with which mr caxton carried on the business of printing there for above    years we have for this reason given it the priority yet hope i shall be excused for this digression concerning st albans which has been far less eminent on this account and as a history of the two books printed there i shall here relate as i found it wrote before the book of miscellanies printed at st albans in the pembroke library it is as follows  it is agreed that corsellis was the first who printed in england and that oxford and st albans were the two first places the types as may be seen in my lords books at oxford were like those of faust the types of this at st albans are like the dutch spieghel junius argues for the first printing to be at harlem from the dutch spieghel but it appears from what is writ before the five books called paginae conglutinatoe that the latin one of this dutch was before it the which he had not seen neither does it conclude where it was printed however this book of st albans affords an argument which junius could not then know of that the dutch letter might be before    0 and it favors what atkins says of a press brought over from harlem in the time of henry vi who died in    0 this is the same letter and we read that frederick corsellis did at st albans instruct an old learned schoolmaster to print and corsellis was of a considerable age when theodoric de rood of colen succeeded him at oxford by whom we have two books printed the first as old as    0 already taken notice of it has been a doubt whether they first printed at st albans or at oxford the oldest book of st albans with a date is here but we cannot prove this book of miscellanies to be older than the dissolution of the abbeys by k henry viii till when a press remained and the first letter used as late as    0 such a year appearing in this book we know of but one more book at st albans the which my lord also has it discovers that there was another press set up at st albans after this with the letter of the spieghel because that is printed with caxtons types and has as caxtons books have the two improvements of indenting paragraphs and dividing words by hyphens at the ends of the lines the printers of this with the letter of the spieghel continued to print as they began without the two improvements even after the press of caxton though even here that press used his improvements this other book is dated      in words at length at the end of the book of hunting besides the arms of that monastery which are at the end of the whole book spelman in his aspilogia quotes the whole book as wrote by juliana barnes and is so referred to by bale in his scriptores though she appears to be the author only of the piece of hunting the treatise in that book of coat arms is only a translation of upton de re militari that printed by caxton at westminster in      was a second edition of this book of this with the types of the spieghel there is a second edition in      printed by winken de word it consists of miscellanies and has something very remarkable as the old trial in k henry vis time at leicester not taken notice of in our great collection of statetryals of the cardinal of winchester impeached by the duke of gloucester before the house of lords in which appears the names of the mitred abbots among the lords spiritual and temporal and the form of the clerks entering as they came in and at different times took the oaths the names of the thirty six churches in london and suburbs that were not parochial also of the hundred and eighteen parish churches and their patrons in this is the nut brown maid supposed by chaucer as skeleton confirms by having had a copy given him by lidgate monk of bury mr prior has made a paraphrase on it and has also printed it from the old english but knew not that it was by chaucer besides in his each verse is divided into two as the first verse ends with among and the second ends with it is etc  also in his woman and man is printed at the beginning of each stanza here they are supposd as they speak also the last stanza which makes twelve lines by his division is wanting  thus far we have copied from my lords manuscript notes before his books of st albans we now proceed to westminster and here it is requisite to observe that dr islip abbot of westminster having very liberally promoted this art and encouraged mr caxton to whom he assigned that part of the abbey supposed by some of our historians to be the ambry or eleemosinary as a confirmation of this opinion mr newcourt in his repertorium tom i page     has it thus st anns an old chapel over against which the lady margaret mother to king henry vii erected an almshouse for poor women which is now turned into lodgings for the singingmen of the college the place wherein this chapel and almshouse stood was called the eleemosinary or almonry now corruptly the ambry aumbry for that the alms of the abbey were thee distributed to the poor in which islip abbot of westminster erected the first press for bookprinting that ever was in england about the year of christ      and where william caxton citizen and mercer of london who first brought it into england practiced it this might occasion the report that this abbot first brought printing to england at his own charges this notion of his introducing the art into our nation which has prevailed among several of our writers is not only contradicted by the author of the chronicle but seems to be groundless on this account that if there had been any truth in it mr caxton would have been obliged in gratitude to have taken notice of this singular piece of merit of his friend and patron in some of the prefaces to his works  i have followed the same method in this book as i did in the former dating the places according to the oldest edition extant that bears any certain date though i am not ignorant that some of them may come short of being the first that were printed there mr bagford whose papers are now in the possession of the right honorable the earl of oxford at wimpole in cambridgeshire tells us in a proposal he published for a history of printing that caxtons first impression seems to be that of game of chess in      because it carries that date in the device as the reader may see under his picture at the front of the second volume though he owns there was another impression of it without that device as well as several other of his works without any date at all however the oldest that has a certain date ought in reason to fix our epoch according to our method  william caxton      mr caxton was born as he writes himself in the weeld of kent where the broadest english is spoken but as fuller in his english worthies asserts he was born at caxton in hertfordshire being perhaps lead into that error by his surname since it was the custom of that time for persons to denominate themselves from the place of their birth i think it will be necessary to subjoin his own account of himself in this respect from his preface to the recule of the historyes of troy translated by him out of the french of raoul le fevre priest  when i remember myself of my unperfitness in both languages  in france was i never and was born and learned mine english in kente in the weeld where english is spoken broad and rude  i have continued for the most part in the countries of brabant flanders holland and zeland  the duchess of bourgogne sister of the king of england when she had seen v or vi quairs found default in mine english which she commanded me to ammand and to continue and make an end of the residue  whose command i durst not disobey  thus far mr caxton and i cannot but observe that the faults of his english are owing more to his long continuance abroad than to the place of his birth which will easily appear from an accurate observation of his language and manner of spelling which discover the foreigner more than a broadspoken kentish man his education was owing to his mother and extended no farther than to read and write which he says procured him a good maintenance mr bale tells us indeed that he understood the latin tongue which is plain from his translations out of that language but as he does not mention it as a part of his youthful education it is very probable that he did not apply himself to the study of it till a long time after he was bred a mercer of the city of london and became a conjurys thereof i have indeed through the favor of mr crump at mercers hall searched their book of freemen but could not find his name there there was one richard caxton made free about that time whether it was a relation of his or a mistake in transcribing his christian name i cannot be sure of but however as he calls himself a mercer of london we have no reason to doubt it as he styles himself in his preface to cato that is a sworn member of that company which in those days consisted of very considerable merchants trading more particularly into the low countries and some of the maritime parts of germany to these he was frequently sent but never had the fortune to visit france though he became so good a master of that language as to translate several volumes into english of which we shall give an account hereafter his travels likewise so well accomplished him in the high and low dutch that upon the account of this and his knowledge of those countries and their trade the king chose him as a fit person to undertake the bringing printing to england this task how difficult and hazardous soever he acquitted himself with great integrity  mr caxton besides his accomplishments as a merchant acquired a great deal of politeness partly by his travels for  0 years and partly by his frequent residence at the court of the duchess of burgundy sister to king edward iv who caressed and patronized him very much for in the preface abovementioned he tells us that he was a servant to her grace and received of her a yearly fee and other many good and great benefits he was likewise a favorite to several of our kings particularly henry vi edward iv richard iii and henry vii and highly esteemed by the prime of our nobility and especially by the duke of clarence the kings uncle to whom he dedicated some of his works the countess of derby king henry viis mother the earl of rivers arundel with many others as he was a person indefatigable and ambitious of applause as well as earnest in promoting the glory of his own country he read incessantly the histories of his own and other nations which at proper times he digested into order at his return to england he became acquainted with a learned schoolmaster of st albans supposed by some writers upon good grounds to have been the printer of juliana barnes this person having laid the foundation of a complete body of english history kept a constant correspondence with mr caxton and was assisted by him in his translations but being prevented by death from finishing his work mr caxtom procured his papers examined and reduced them to order and compared them with the best authors he could get as livy st austin gildas beda isidorus cassiodorus geoffrey of monmouth william of malmesbury martin cansulanus and others from whom he also extracted many considerable passages which he added to the history this work he entitled fructus temporum or the fruits of time in seven books to which he subjoined a chronology the history begins with the giants the first supposed inhabitants of this island and concludes with the   d year of edward iv viz ann      what share our author had in this performance and how great a part was done by the schoolmaster is impossible to determine this book was often reprinted and much valued at that time yet though it is the most considerable piece which mr caxton published we have several others written and printed by himself which are as follow   an appendix to trevisas english translation of randulphs polychronicon   book   the image of the world   book   the description of great britain   book   the life of edward the confessor   book   the history of king arthur    books and some others all in english the appendix to trevisa is continued from the year      in which the supplement of trevisa to the polychronicon ends to the year    0 in which he wrote it the learned mr seldom indeed ascribes the whole to trevisa but besides that caxton takes the supplement and other additions and interpretations to himself but it is plain as dr nicholson observes that trevisa according to that supposition must have wrote near a hundred years after his death those which he translated out of latin and french are as follows  out of latin   vegetius de re militari or of the art of war   books   joannita of the game of chess   books   the history of the destruction of troy   books   bonaventure of the life of christ   book   the history of lombardy   book   john tinmouths sanctilogium britanniae epitomized by capgrave from french   the siege and conquest of jerusalem by geodfrey of bologne dedicated to king edward iv   the royal book entitled in french le livre royal besides these there are several others in the list of his printed works subjoined to the account of his life he printed likewise some books in french as la legende doree etc and some in latin as vita patruum and boethius de consolatione philosophiae etc this catalogue of his works as an author i have taken from pitts and bale the latter of whom gives him the character of vir non omnino stupidus nec ignavia torpens neither a perfect dunce nor abandoned to laziness i shall more readily assent to the judgment of a much later and more judicious writer dr nicholson who says of bale p     that he gives the account of men and their labors at random and of caxton p   0 that the opportunities he had of being acquainted with the courttransactions of his own time would encourage his reader to hope for greater matters from him but that his fancy seems to have lead him into an undertaking with respect to his fructus temporum above his strength there is one thing very observable concerning this excellent printer and author that he translated printed corrected illuminated and bound all his books within his own office or printing house as he printed long before the method of adding the errata at the end of books was in use so his extraordinary exactness obliged him to a great deal more trouble than can easily be imagined for he tells us in the preface to some of his books that his chief care after a work was printed off was to revise it and mend all the faults with his own hand with red ink which being done to one copy he caused some of his journeymen to do the same throughout the whole impression which he afterward compared with his first sheet to see that they had not omitted any of his corrections it is true they did not print off so large a number of books as now for   0 or  00 were thought a large impression but even that number made it very tedious to correct throughout though this was practiced by several eminent printers of other nations till they found out the way of printing the errata in some blank leaves of the book  mr caxton having made himself a perfect master of the art of printing not at oxford under fred corsellis as some authors imagine but during his travels beyond sea as will appear hereafter came and settled at westminster where abbot islip as some say his friend and patron assigned him one of the chapels belonging to the abbey as we have before quoted from newcourt as being retired and free from interruption and from this or some other chapel it is supposed that the name of chapel has been given to all printinghouses in england ever since and notwithstanding it is by some reported that it was set up in the chapel there i can trace no footsteps of its having been practiced in that place my manuscript beforementioned says that a press was set up in westminster abbey by abbot islip in the little ambry where william caxton was master mr bagford assigns the house in the ambry which was formerly the kings head as the place where caxton carried on his printing but had i been early enough in my enquiry before twas pulled down as mr bagford was i flatter my self i could have found some remains i have great reason to think it had been a printing house by having been informed that some persons found among the rubbish some remains of printing materials but through ignorance of the curiosity of them they are either lost or destroyed as i have given my reasons against the arts being practiced in the chapel at westminster i rather think that our technical terms in printing such as a printing house being called a chapel and where printing is gray in one place and too black in another the gray is called a friar and the black a monk i think i say that these terms took their original from the arts being practiced in other religious houses besides that at westminster for it is evident by the book hereafter mentioned printed in the exempt monastery of tavistock in devonshire by dan thomas richard monk of the said monastery that several of the religious orders exercised this art perhaps in some outer chapel which being dedicated to some saint was only used once a year on the anniversary of that saint  the reader will find that printinghouses were set up in several cities and towns in england where they had any considerable religious house thus we see the abbey of st albans had printing there very soon as before noticd nor was this the only religious house where printing was practiced and that very early for time has discovered to us several others such as tavistock as aforesaid worcester canterbury ipswich which were chosen for that purpose we have already hinted that the first printers were sworn servants to the crown and in particular mr caxton not only printed as such but all his impressions were recommended either by the king or princes of the blood or by some eminent patron amongst the nobility who bore the charges of the whole the types with which he printed were peculiar to himself and easily distinguished from any other being a mixture of secretary and gothic in shape the size great primer he had several eminent workmen under him particularly winken de word a dutchman and rich pynson a citizen of london who afterward printed for themselves many valuable pieces which shall be mentioned in their proper place they likewise used a letter peculiar to themselves which as i shall take notice differed from their masters and was more refined and modernizd mr caxton besides his other valuable qualifications was a person of exemplary piety and strictness of life he continued printing from before the year      to      as is evident from the end of the vita patrum and hiltons scale printed or rather finished in that year by winken de word mr auditor jett deceased assured me that he was buried in st margarets church westminster and that he saw the remains of his tombstone but i have not as yet been able to find it  the list of his works

really the printer of it or only the author and the book printed by some other is what i cannot determine unless i could have seen the book  those that follow are without date    liber festialis  this edition though i have given it no higher rank upon the account of its having no date does yet manifestly appear to me to have been the first book extant of caxtons printing i have seen it at my lord pembrokes library and compared it with those of the game of chess his three books of the history of troy and his polychronicon all which have been severally looked upon as his oldest edition by one annalist or other and find in it these two unquestionable marks of antiquity above the other three viz   the types on which it is printed appear to be entirely new though they be the very same which he used in all his other works whereas in the others they seem to be more used and worn   this edition is the only one whose lines are not spaced out to the end this being an improvement and elegancy introduced by him in imitation of foreign printers whereas all the first editions had the same defect with this  as for the three books of the history of troy the second is that which i imagine to have been printed first i have seen it very perfect in several libraries but the first and third i never could meet with any where but in the noble library above mentioned and even here they are somewhat imperfect the first book wanting a few leaves at the beginning and the third at the end however they all bear alike the mark of antiquity and are unquestionably done with caxtons types the oldest book i could ever meet with that bears a date is his second edition of the game at chess in      as may be seen by the catalogue above and what inclines me to believe it to have been the first of that kind is that the same date    is continued in his following works that are dated to which he sometimes added the two initial letters of his name as in the mark or rebus here subjoined  n b w c stands sor william caxton and the figure between for    i e      the reader will plainly perceive the   and the other is a figure of   as made at that time william caxtons printers mark  we have met with but five editions without date though we have ventured to add several more upon the authority of mr maunsel and other authors who we think may be relied on    the game of chess part of caxtons preface to the game of chess in the hands of maurice johnson esquire is as follows and when i so had acheved the said translacion i did do set in emprynte a certain no more of them which anon were

over with mr caxton and was his servant and journeyman he succeeded him in his printing house as appears from some of his first impressions done by him as he tells us in the house of mr caxton it is difficult to assign the exact time when he came to england whether with frederick corsellis as my manuscript affirms or some years after which is more probable after mr caxtons death he carried on the business and finished some volumes begun by his master as the canterburytales and hiltons scale of perfection this last mr mattaire dates in the year      and mr bagford      who gives it as the first impression done in winken de wordes name i have chosen to follow mr bagford who was very exact as far as he could procure materials for i have not yet met with the book my self though the list of this printers works is very large yet i am certain there are many more either lost or still latent in some libraries for he was a person of vast industry and received all imaginable encouragement so that he published several volumes in one year though we meet with some considerable chasms in others during which time we cannot suppose him idle he left westminster and set up his printing house in fleet street at the sign of the sun in the parish of st bride i cannot determine the year of his removal though his first impression there was done anno   0  he printed several latin as well as english volumes but no greek as i can find he continued printing with great applause till the year      if not beyond that time at his death he left a sum of money for an annual obiit for his soul to the parish of st brides of which he was an inhabitant he was a person of great accomplishments in learning as well as strictness of morals and though he was the immediate successor of caxton yet he improved the art to a very great perfection at his first setting up for himself his first care was to cut a new set of puncheons which he sunk into matrices and cast several sorts of printingletter which he afterward used as caxton used but two sizes double pica and great primmer viz  begun and finished by me simple man w c  begun and finished by me simple man w c  winken de word gave a greater scope to his fancy and formed such a variety of sorts and sizes of letter that for several years after him none of his successors attempted to imitate him therein if he was the manual operator in cutting and casting in his own foundinghouse it is an incredible improvement which he made to the art but if he had his letter from any other printer abroad though it robs him of this glory yet his excellent method of disposition composition and presswork shows him to have far excelled his master and even to rival any of of his contemporaries abroad there is one circumstance that induces me to think that he was his own letterfounder which is that in some of his first printed books the very letter he made use of is the same used by all the printers in london to this day and i believe were struck from his puncheons  the first is the two lined great primmer black  by me winken de word  the next is the great primmer black  this work was finished by me winken de word  he is the first english printer who introduced the roman letter in england which he used with his gothic or black letter to distinguish any thing remarkable as we do the italic with the roman at this time his letter is different from most other printers and is cast so true and stands so well in line as not to be excelled by any ever since in his gothic and roman letter he fell in with the custom of those times by using abbreviations even in his small sized letters one circumstance i would observe is that he is the only printer i can find in england that used very small bodyd letters in the infancy of the art and he was fond even to the very last of using his master caxtons rebus of which we have given a specimen at the bottom of page   0 upon the whole he was a very curious laborious and indefatigable printer and i doubt not but time will add to his character by bringing to light some noble testimonies of so great a man which for want of i am obliged to say so little here he is the first printer i have yet discovered who began to print the yearbooks he and his successor richard pinson lincolns end manuscriptlibrary being inprinted above  0 yearbooks which are in scribd libri manuscripti   the

eleven grammars by winken de word this curious piece is in the lord pembrokes library and has some observations written on a blank page at the beginning which are to this effect the eleven grammars printed by winken de word who was the  d printer in westminster he lived afterward within the walls of london at the sign of the sun in fleet street richard pinson afterward his worthy successor and he printed above  0 yearbooks which are in lincolns inn manuscript library they being inscribed libri manuscripti he was soninlaw to caxton who first printed at westminster in the almonry beyond westminsterschool these eleven grammars were all printed above  00 years before lilys grammar and appear to be the foundation of his  we shall have occasion to give a further account of these yearbooks when we come to speak of r pinson who continued printing them a considerable time after winken de wordes death as for the eleven grammars they are in one volume in the form of a very small quarto and neatly printed and it is judiciously observed that they were printed above a century before that famous one of lylly which has been thought and is still by those who never heard of this edition to be the first grammar that ever was printed in england  from this large catalogue of winken de wordes works it is plain that he must have been an indefatigable printer and that the chasms that frequently happen in some years must be owing to the books being either lost or as yet undiscovered but more probably the former and whoever considers that the greatest part of them were either schoolbooks classics prayerbooks etc besides a vast number of popish ones which might daily perish soon after the reformation and of how short duration the former are in the hands of schoolboys and devotees such as that age abounded with will rather wonder that so great a number of them have escaped the common fate of such performances so that we may justly conclude that the preservation of these books is more owing to the character and excellency of the printer than of the authors and to the neatness and correctness of the work rather than the goodness or usefulness of the subject after he was removed from westminster to london we do not hear of any other printers at the former if there were any they were such whose works and memory in all probability died with or soon after them  the city of london mcccclxxxi though richard pinson be the first known printer that set up his press in this famous city and all former annalists have ranked it in their list from his first edition      yet father orlandi has since discovered to us a much more ancient one which was printed in london anno      that is    years before the former which makes me hope that time may still discover more if not of older date yet at least to fill up the chasm between this and the first of pinson for it is scarce to be supposed that westminster should begin so soon to encourage the art as we have seen in the last article and that london should wholly neglect it however be that how it will it is certain that if it was but slow in receiving it it made ample amends for it afterward and that pinson and de word when he removed thither gave a new life to it so that in a little time there were several considerable printinghouses set up in the most convenient parts of this large metropolis wherein it has flourished and improved ever since some of those eminent printers received likewise great encouragement from the crown particularly by patents for printing of bibles and other works of which i shall give an account under the names of the printers to whom they were granted  n b as caxton printed all his works in the old letter and w de word in a mixed character of roman and black we have distinguished their works in the two former catalogues from those that follow by printing them in italic but as the roman types became by this time more common we shall give the list of the following printers works in that character  this ancient and curious edition above mentioned is as follows valdesius super psalterium londini       i richard pinson anno mccccxciii richard pinson alias pynson is the first known printer in the city of london no edition having been hitherto discovered except that anonymous one mentioned above of older date than his dialogue of dives and pauper in      besides as we have about    editions of his that are without date we may more reasonably suppose that they were printed before than after this year in which he began to put a date he was brought up under mr caxton as well as winken de word and being become a thorough master of the art went and set up a press of his own at temple bar as the inscription of his first edition shows the friendship which he had contracted with de word whilst these two wrought under caxton was so far from being disturbed by any mutual emulation or rivalship that it continued to their death and it is thought that after their masters death pynson prevailed upon him to leave westminster and to come and settle nearer to him which he accordingly did what makes this more than probable is that the last edition of caxton is dated as we have shown anno   0  and the first that de word printed in london as far as we have been able to discover is dated   0  these two were joined in the printing of the kings yearbooks as long as de word lived which were afterward continued by pinson and this is a sufficient testimony of his having been an excellent printer were there nothing else to assure us of it for it is not to be supposed that he would have associated himself to any other pynson styles himself printer to the king in some of his editions probably from a grant he had for the printing of those yearbooks above mentioned for we neither find that he printed any bibles or other books for which patents were granted by the crown i dont find that he used any rebus but he either printed his name at length or else only the two initial letters r p the list of his works is nothing so copious as those of his associate though he continued printing at least    years as appears from the dates of his first and last edition which makes me conclude that a great part of them are lost those i have been able to recover are as follow    dialogue of dives and pauper upon the x commandments emprinted by

winken de word and others after his death some with the dates of the year and month in which they were printed and his name at the end and some without either however it must be observed that a great part of the oldest of them have the name  guilelmus rastell written at the head by which we conjecture that they only printed them for him for rastel was printer to the king and a very considerable person at that time and in great credit at court upon the account of his having married sir thomas mores sister so that it is very likely he had the privilege of printing all these royal books and gave them a sanction by prefixing his name to them whilst the others only acted under him what seems to confirm it is that those earlier ones with pynsons name mention only ex officina pynsoniana whereas in those of later date he calls himself printer to his majesty in which office he probably succeeded rastell who died according to dr nicholson an      thus at the end of the  d edition of

richard grafton citizen of london from an indifferent author and historian became a famous and eminent printer among other of his works under the former character we have his abridgement of the chronicle of england in which he is a constant borrower from the bulkier work of edward hall recorder of london who wrote the history of the wars between the houses of york and lancaster wherein the reader will find little worth notice if we may believe dr nicholson than the fashions and changes of dress in each kings reign as grafton was not over judicious in the choice of this author so neither was he in the compiling of his abridgement in so much that the learned buchanan in his history of scotland does not scruple to call him a very headless and unskilful writer though he has had the honor of being quoted by stow and other historians  the occasion of his turning printer was his being pitched upon to procure an edition of william tyndal alias hickins version of the new testament and afterward of his bible revised and corrected by miles coverdal a learned franciscan friar well learned in the hebrew greek and latin tongues some impressions of the former had already been dispersed about england and elsewhere but were bought up by tonstal bishop of london and sir thomas more and been burnt at st pauls cross and it was very dangerous to undertake the reprinting of such a work in london upon that account this made grafton and his associate edward whitchurch resolve to get it done at hamburgh whither they likewise sent coverdal to correct the press this proved a very expensive work and the impression of the bible alone cost them  00l a great sum in those days when it was brought over into england it met with great opposition from the romish priests they having some time before obtained a royal proclamation to prohibit and abolish that among other heretical books and had not bonner bishop of hereford bought up the greatest part of the copies in order to destroy them the undertakers must have been infallibly ruined this edition is supposed to have been printed anno       his new testament met with worse fate of which we have an authentic testimony extant in the library of the honorable earl of pembroke viz two editions of it printed at antwerp in the same year viz anno      one of which has a preface prefixed to it to justify that edition from the other of the same year printed under his name but strangely mutilated and misprinted a more particular account of which is given in the introduction to wickliffs bible lately published  finding that a version of the bible was as much desired by the favorers of the reformation as it was cried down by the enemies of it they ventured to print a second edition of it under the patronage of archbishop cranmer and the lord cromwell but tyndal having been by that time burnt as a heretic in flanders and his name growing then somewhat ignominious they thought fit to publish it under the name of matthewss bible though tyndal is affirmed to have finished all but the apocrypha as some or as far as nehemiah as others affirm grafton having finished the printing of it presented it to his two great patrons by whom at his request it was likewise presented to the king to whom it was dedicated it had these words in red letters printed at the bottom of the title page set forth with the kings most gracious license but as they were suspected to have been foisted in grafton obtained leave to have it further licensed under the privy seal soon after this it being observed how acceptable an english bible was to the people some persons formed a design to print it in a smaller volume in order to undersell graftons which obliged him to apply to cromwell and to obtain a patent from the king that none should print it for three years and for the better sale of this that noble man did likewise procure him an order that every curate of a parish should be obliged to have one and every abbey six of them so that this second impression wherever printed was very soon bought up  grafton and his partners in the work observing that there was still a call for them resolved to reprint it a third time and in a larger volume but without these notes and prologues which they observed had given some offense paris was the place pitched upon to print it at and cromwell who favored the enterprise procured letters from king henry to the french king to permit a subject of his to print the english bible in the university of paris because of the goodness of the french paper and workmen bonner then ambassador from england to the court had likewise orders to assist the undertakers of that good work in all reasonable suits bonner obtained not only the desired license but likewise letters patents for printing this bible and for conveying it safe over to england this edition being thus encouraged went briskly on to the end but bonner who never liked the work and did only promote it to make his court to cromwell found means to obstruct it privately notwithstanding the kings patents  accordingly anno      the printers were taken up and charged with heresy by order of the faculty and coverdale the corrector grafton the head printer and other englishmen who contributed to the charges of the impression were sent for but they foreseeing the consequences fled away as fast as they could and left the whole impression which was just finished and consisted of   00 copies behind them this was immediately seized by the lieutenant criminal and ordered to be burnt except some few which he sold through covetousness for wastepaper which were afterward bought up again being about four fats or chests full  my lord pembroke favored me with the sight of an english bible printed in gothic characters an      without place or printers name with these words at the end  the end of the new testament and of the whole bible  to the honor and praise of good was this bible prynted and fyneshed in the year of our lord good a m d xxxvii  but whether this is one of them that were printed at paris or one of the former edition i cannot determine but it is more probable to be the latter because it has a concordance of the most remarkable texts of scripture against the errors of popery whereas as i observed before they had suppressed most things of that nature in the paris one but let this be of what edition it will it is very probable that the concordance proved the cause of the almost total destruction of it in so much that i question whether there be any other copy of it left except this above mentioned however grafton and his associates by cromwells encouragement went soon after to paris and got the presses letters and workmen and brought them over to london and so set up for printers themselves which they never intended before and began to reprint the same bible which they finished in      an account of which you will find in the following list of graftons works  we find a patent in rymers faedera vol    p     from king henry viii appointing him and his partner whitchurch to print the book of divine service but as i have not been able to meet with the book i have not inserted it in the list the patent is dated jan        grafton styled himself typographus regius his mark or sign was an appletree springing up out of a tun or ton as they spelled it then alluding to his name graftton with this motto suscipite insitum verbum jacob   he had likewise a cipher over the tun with the two initials of his name one in another thus richard graftons printers mark  his works are as

thought that the date had been misprinted i e      for       at cambridge m d xxi this university seems to have given but small encouragement to the art of printing either by the earliness of its reception or the continuance of it there mr maittaire tells us that he has not been able to meet with any thing printed there of earlier date than      and all that either he the late mr bagford or any of my correspondents from thence have been able to procure is only four editions all printed in the same year by john siberch and one in      without printers name though probably done by him this

editions of the most ancient printers such as printed only from manuscripts as i have seen in my lord pembrokes library etc but am glad to find that mr maittaire has been beforehand with me in favoring the world with it in his annals typographici  in the conclusion of the second book of this history page     i ventured to affirm after orlandi and other annalists that the invention of ingraving began much about the same time with that of printing but i have been since convinced that the former began much earlier from a curious collection which my lord pembroke was pleased to show me in which the whole progress of that invention is set down in writing under each print having therefore obtained his lordships leave to copy it from his own book and to give it a place in this work i think i cannot better conclude this history than by obliging the curious with this valuable collection  an appendix to the general history of printing of books being an additional history of the rise and progress of prints which are incusd exactly copied from the r h the earl of pembrokes curious book of those prints in which each piece has its own particular account of its manner etc in manuscript in a right progressive order as follows    antonio pollaiololo not      ob      baldinucci says that he engraved the battle at florence about    0 and that andrea montegna graved his triumph at rome soon after his being there they both graved upon pewter the former printed his name on it thus opus antonij pollaiololo florentini    israel van meckenem his own effigies    this israel van meckenem is by some authors called van mecklin and mentz and moguntin lomazero says he was the first that engraved he was master to bon martino who was master to albert durer whose first print was a copy after this of israels an      and as baldinucci says israel did not engrave till he had seen the triumph of ant montegno anno      which is the oldest date that any author has mentioned and the termination being spanish shows that the art spread very soon    a m was as is supposed andrea de murano      this print is upon that mixed metal on which goldsmiths used to engrave their first proofs it is now likewise used by other artists founders call it the hard metal and printers the typemetal though the latter has a greater proportion of iron the other materials are lead blocktin and regulus of antimony albert durer began by copying of old prints as you will see when you come to him this print is older than that of      which stands by it which was taken to be the oldest of any one with a date by the author who mentions this for want of knowing of that as for the year      above mentioned it agrees with the time in which a de murano flourished and baldinucci speaks in one place as if other authors were uncertain how near   00 the invention of prints was yet he seems to say that maso finiguerri was not long before pollaiololo who followed baccio baldini who imitated maso the inventor of prints by taking off some from engraved silver work to see the impression but unless he did so some years before this print must be older    andrea montegna n      an      the next after pollaiololo who engraved in italy his best works were after the antique but this first is none of the nine which he composed from the antiques    the sixth in order of his painting this is his original print they have since finished within these outlines the prints that are commonly sold for it    this was printed when they used the smoke of a candle instead of mpblack ink    mich angelo on silk this is only from a drawing the painting of which has much more in it and is to be seen in my lords gallery this is the first print that is not upon paper    the suavius was the first print done on two copper plates this print besides the blue ground has the figure of old time clipping cupids wings after this perrier did engrave this and then the five more on three copper plates as carpi did upon wood   0 the head of lutma the father done with the hammer the black and white disposed contrary to mezotinto per janum lutma     in this john lutma has added graving to the hammering     jacobus lutma mixed etching with engraving     venus and mavors mars by joannes collaert this is the only print that ever was graved on steel     dominico campagnola the first that printed with red on a black ground     this manner which was invented in germany differs from all prints because the ink rises upon the paper     this done by j s as in the shield came from venice the lines are not engraved but made by points     four mezotintos varying from the common manner of those prints in this the figure our savior on the cross is engraved the rest is done in mezotinto the other three are each in a different color     mr tailor a painter who improved the printing of stuffs in holland he invented this art of printing in colors and mr le blond though he might take the hint from this has further improved it by printing his pieces so as to look like painting the first that he did in this kind was after the baroccio in my lord pembrokes gallery     the first print of martin schn al chon as the french write and pronounce it and called bon martino by the italians bon being a kind of a translation of schn which in the highgerman signifies sine beautiful martin was master to albert durer but learned his art at first by copying after the print next to it of israel van meckenem   0 israel van meckenem this is the only one of his that has the places name viz tzu at boackholt     the first print of albert durer      which is a copy after israels he engraved this also upon pewter  albert durer not    0 ob      was famous for cutting on wood and all other manners of ingraving as may be seen by these four that follow viz   st engraved on pewter which was his first manner   d cut on wood and on three planches   d engraved on copper in which he was the first and the best and was imitated by mark antonio   th etched being the first of that kind     maso finiguerra a goldsmith at florence the inventer of prints though he made no print till after a pollaiololo albert durer copied this so as to stand the same way as the original they stand each by the other in the book     albert durer made this piece in imitation of the oldest print which was graved anno          this bears the oldest date of all his whether on wood or copper this is also dated   0  but the mark differs from his usual mark     if hugo carpi was the inventor of printing upon three planches he must have been very young for he was but    years old when a durer did this in      which is the head of ulricus varbuler very large from three planches with his own name to it albert durer     the first print etchd upon iron by a durer     another of his of anno      in which he perfected the art of etching on iron even before parmigiano though this last in italy is affirmed to have been the first etcher     albert durer before his he used a mark the manner of this  that of his master     the first print on copper by a durer with his mark before he began to date this is his first manner   0 this is without crossstrokes melaines manner is a fine improvement of this     this piece is dated   0  and bears the oldest date either on copper or wood     one of   0  this adam and eve were the chief of his last manner vastly neat and imitated by marc antonio in germany this is reckoned more scarce than his st jerome     the st jerome this the bolonia edition of vasari calls la maraviglia or the prodigy of art     the last piece that durer engraved it is the head of erasmus and is dated          a crucifix engraved on a golden head of the emperors cane it was sold for   0 gilders and is the only print taken from gold that of an caracci is only from a silver salver my lord has it there is but this one print of it which he took off as a proof before it was gilt     the famous bagpiper by lucas van leyden this is the original which was sold for  0 duccatoons the copy which stands next to it is pretty scarce these two and that on the gold cane were on one cartoon in the arundel collection  n b incused is the proper term to signify those plates which bear the ink between the lines of the graving as excused is of those that have it on the face of the line thus the prints in the paginae conglutinatae were excused but those of albert durer incused he being the first inventor of this manner as being cheaper and easier cut than upon copper  the following is a list of xvi volumes of drawings and prints in the same library relating to the same subject as the former and copied from the manuscripttitles of the books themselves these drawings and prints consist but of a very few in comparison of many numerous collections for here are chiefly italian designs and only one of each master to see the variety of manners except of the most noted italian masters a pretty many and all of such italian painters as also themselves graved etched or cut in wood of original drawings here are but two volumes of   0 italian painters except a few who were also esteemed

could find well or ill preserved as for entire books graved there are very many but here are only those of italian painters antiquities excepted as for loose prints only    volumes as follows  in the first   volumes of prints are above   00 each by a different master ending with edelinck andran and their disciples engraving and etching being brought to perfection by them  vol iii but the first of
