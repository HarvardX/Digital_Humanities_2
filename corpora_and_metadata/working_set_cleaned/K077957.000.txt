act i scene a room enter philadelphia with a letter followed by jeffrey phil i should believe mr cuningham very constant if i had faith enough to credit this letter jeffry what complaints are here but it is the style that all young lovers write   jeff pray madam believe me you know i am a man of integrity i cannot dissemble let him write what he pleases if he did not love you do you think i would tell you so   phil when he has opportunity i must confess he says kind things to me   jeff take my word madam my master is not like other men  unless he loves a lady and loves her passionately too he never troubles himself to compliment her much   phil never yes jeffry sometimes you know he compliments my aunt   jeff that is a convincing proof of his love to you you cannot think him reduced to the necessity of making love to an antiquated piece with design to know her otherwise than to obtain the happiness of seeing you but i shall tell him madam    phil tell him i have received and read his letter   jeff is that all madam   phil all yes are you not content with that   jeff any indifferent person that had hands and could but read would have done as much as that   phil well tell him then

hardly tell him she loves him yet   pru alas she is but a novice let me alone with her i will order the business so that if thy master be discreet and passionate enough in his expressions he wins her heart i will warrant you   jeff he can say nothing to her but that damned aunt of hers is harkning to it still what pleasure can she find in love at fifty   pru fie jeffry you must say five and twenty   jeff i wonder any woman can have the impudence to live and trouble mankind after that age   pru there never was a woman so old but she retained a good opinion of her self   jeff then she dresses her self so fantastically that all may see she strives to appear young in defiance of nature she is more gaudy in that she calls halfmourning than a young bride is on her weddingnight the devils in her if she believes any one can love her it is jeering her but to be commonly civil to her   pru a little flattery fires her she believes all that is said to her and he that does not make love to her and compliment her shall not be twice admitted to her house   jeff o reverend beauty on my conscience if i would grease her chops with a few compliments she would mump and smile upon me   pru no doubt on it   jeff when shall my master have an opportunity to speak freely to philadelphia   pru mr lovemore is thy masters friend and is better beloved here than he imagines you must persuade him to amuse the aunt that mr cuningham may have convenience to court the niece   jeff mr lovemores tired with playing that part so often he is cloyed with the aunt and swears he will have no more of her   pru i am sure her niece and i endure much more tell him twill be charity in him to relieve us   jeff twill be hard to persuade him to it   pru this old lady of mine has languishd for a young husband ever since sir oliver laycock died she cares not what estate he has or what religion he is of so he be but young and lusty where is the great viscount sans terre thy master told her of methinks he is long a coming   jeff some cross unlucky business hinders him   pru she has lately received some letters that have given a full account of him   jeff so much the worse what is it   pru they say his fortune is not very much but he is greatly born and very pleasant and that he is so great a lover of music he has not a servant but can sing or dance or play upon some instrument you may know when he is come by the noise the fiddlers will welcome him to town for all from westminster to wapping pay him homage   jeff would he were but married to her prudence   pru whether he marries her or not is not our business jeffry let him but fool with us till thy master has gained her niece and then our work is done   jeff well we have had enough of thy old lady laycock let us now talk of our own affairs speak do thou love me prudence   pru a pleasant question do you doubt it now   jeff if you would have me credit you swear it   pru sure you are jealous jeffry   jeff youre somewhat near the matter i know

come for my answer now   pru but does not one of em love you madam   lady i have some reason to believe he does mr lovemore has spared no pains to persuade me to quit my widowhood   pru i have been told madam that widowhood is a gift heaven seldom bestows but on its favorites you are rich and know how troublesome marriage is for my part i believe the fairest hair the beautifulst curls do not become your forehead so well as bando did but every one madam knows their own necessities   lady i confess widowhood has its conveniences but if marriage be a trouble to some it is a pleasure to others prudence   pru you had the experience of it thirty years how did you like it madam they say sir oliver laycock loved your ladyship   lady for all that he was jealous and what is worse was old   pru very well therefore you resolve to have a young one now madam   lady you cannot blame me for that can you prudence   pru oh no it is well known youth is comfortable but methinks you should take one a little nearer your own age madam a very young man may be too treacherous for you madam   lady why is my age so visible   pru no madam with a little help of art you have some remains of beauty still you have something about your eyes as pleasant now as others have at twenty   lady it is a very malicious world we live in prudence they are so apt to censure and speak of any single woman that one ought to marry to avoid that scandal   pru some that are young are forced to marry to avoid detraction others would rather all that is ill should be said of them than to have no notice taken of em i knew a young lady that pined to a consumption because she lived three years about the court and never had the honor to be lampoond the truth is none that are beautiful and young can avoid envy but few are so malicious to speak against the old   lady there is no age exempt from scandal prudence when we are young they say we sell our selves when old we are forced to hire to buy our lovers   pru you know what they say madam of the old marchioness your friend that was so admired so courted in her youth who when she found she was forsook by all was forced to hire a player by the quarter how soon the poor fellow was tired too how like a sheepbiter he looked after the first two months   lady this london is a very wicked place it is impossible to live without scandal here   pru i am afraid they will say as much of you madam if you bargain for a husband to covet one that is both young and rich is too much in conscience madam   lady thou know prudence wealth is not the thing i seek   pru then madam the business is done the viscount sansterre shall be your husband madam   lady ah prudence if he were but as handsome as    pru ah madam that is too much   lady why may not i wish for it

you   lady for all this i should think my self very happy if i were certain of mr cuningham or mr lovemore   pru a little jealousy will inflame em they will be more pressing when the viscount comes   lady but yet methinks cuningham and my neice    pru what madam   lady are always whispering   pru he only compliments her madam she is too young to make love seriously   lady with your favor there is no trusting to that to my knowledge there are those younger than she that understand what love is but too well   pru that is true madam but philadelphia is so innocent that no man can make love to her but to divert himself here she is madam   enter philadelphia lady what does she come for i will send her packing quickly   pru consider what you do madam how can mr lovemore entertain your ladyship unless his friend may divert himself the while with rallying with your niece   lady for all that i could wish    pru pray trouble not your self trust me i will watch her madam   phil will your ladyship go to eatons the coach is at the door   lady no i will not go yet   phil if you stay long madam the best point will be sold before you come   lady no matter ha what ails the girl how

begging pardon   britt it is very well he offends and i must ask pardon   sir peter no matter for that you hear he denies it and it is enough if a gentleman unsays what he has said   britt so that if

hand  i will bring all off pretends to tell her fortune  this line seems to point out some unexpected cross and this line thwarting the line of life signifies a retired life and this joining with it shows you will be in danger of ending the latter part of your days in a nunnery widow behind them   widow how mr cuningham can you tell fortunes   cun i understand a little palmistry madam and can give a ghess at physiognomy   widow it is very well  when i entered first i thought you had been making love to my neice i am glad to find it otherwise but where is the viscount   pru in the next room

phil  exit with phil and pru cun what will become of me now aside   widow well mr cuningham i have longed for some time to be alone with you that i might speak more freely to you   cun madam it is too great an honor   widow i wonder sir you never think of marrying   cun madam as yet i dare not think on it   widow oh dear sir pray why so   cun because i have not well considered it and i have been told it is a dangerous undertaking without having well thought beforehand   widow pray sir why should you think so  i will vow it is an odd thought sir for one of your understanding why sir i will tell you  i have had three husbands and yet i have no great reason to complain though in my last husbands time i had not altogether that real satisfaction as i had with the other two for to deal freely with you sir my husband sir oliver laycock though he was a very wellbred man yet he had his humors sometimes and would be a little given to jealousy so that i seldom led a quiet hour when the fit was upon him but in my first husbands days sure never woman lived so happy i would not abeen unmarried to have had all the riches of the earth laid at my feet but when i married with sir oliver and had once seen his temper nothing i had in the world but what i would a given to a been free again and indeed in my passion i often vowed never if please heaven sir oliver died to marry any more   cun twas rashly done  but no doubt were there that man fitting to merit your favor and equally deserving your person and your estate and one whom your ladyship could like you might perhaps be persuaded to break your vow and venture once again   widow i will swear i hardly think it and yet one dont know how one may be tempted though if i were to be persuaded and i will not forswear any thing i know not any one that can so soon persuade me to it as you mr cuningham   cun death and the devil what have i brought upon my self aside  oh madam you make me blush  but madam how could you with honor put off the viscount who you know loves you and is come on purpose to marry you   wid why i intend him for my niece you must know who no doubt will be much better pleased with the change for to say truth mr cuningham i have always had more than a common esteem for you and for your behavior and have long since resolved that if i do alter my condition you are the man alone i have placed my thoughts upon   cun you make me blush madam  would i were a league underground or in any hell but this aside  you cannot sure to her   wid i vow it is true and yet    cun hear me but speak madam   wid it is odd that love should overpower people at so strange a rate   cun but i should be unjust to my friend who i know loves you dearer than his life   wid oh dear who is that i beseech you sir   cun mr lovemore madam   widow mr lovemore i will swear i dont believe it   cun oh madam it is but too true as will appear i am afraid when he knows you place your affections on any other man   widow i will vow you much surprise me mr cuningham but how came you to know it   cun often has he begged me to bear him company in some lonely place where he would sigh and tell such things of his distressed passion as would have moved the most obdurate heart and when i asked him why he did not acquaint your ladyship with his love he would sigh with arms across as if his heart would force its way through his breast and cry oh that is my grief my friend i cannot  dare not tell her for should i attempt it once and meet her scorn for oh thou know her vow i should be for ever lost  then ran over a thousand tales of love so soft so moving and how he prized you that cannot be expressed by any except one who loves like him   widow truly sir if it be so    cun if it be so were your ladyship to observe his distracted throes you would pity him   widow but why should he not declare it to me   cun that is what i tell him madam  urging that your ladyship  but mum who have we here   euter
