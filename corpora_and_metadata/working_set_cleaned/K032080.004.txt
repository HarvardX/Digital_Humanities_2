the frontispiece of the fourth volume  the existence of this species being only proved by a solitary specimen various conjectures have arisen amongst conchologists respecting it some have been inclined to admit it as an undoubted species and others as a mere accidental variety of growth of the linnaean murex antiquus how far we may be authorized to abide by the former opinion must rest with the critical naturalist  to argue that it cannot be a distinct species because only one shell of the kind has been hitherto found is absurd since the existence of many other species has been asserted upon the evidence of a single specimen only and its relation to murex antiquus is not so obvious as might he at first imagined it certainly approaches it in the general outline but the tidges of murex antiquus is most completely raised into tubercules whereas those of carinatus are perfectly smooth and even nor is there that strict correspondence in the angulations of the contour in general that should induce us to consider it a variety of murex carinatus  in deciding a question of some moment to the english conchologist it has been thought advisable to give an additional plate of murex antiquus by which the difference between the two shells may be more easily discriminated we must however observe that the latter is not absolutely known as a british shell it is a native of the north seas and has been supposed to inhabit some of the remote northern islands of the british dominions the murex antiquus of pennant is a very different shell and by no means allied to that of linnaeus

narrow depressure behind the beaks ano evidente sed angusto which is not in the other the grooves in our shell are not so deep as sulcis profundioribus implies but they are both deeper and wider than

known to attain a much larger size than in northern climates they are found in immense beds and adhere to other substances or to one another by means of a beard of a strong and silky texture which the fish throws out the muscle affords a rich and palatable food though they are not deemed wholesome by many people who after eating them are sometimes afflicted with great swellings and convulsive motions with eruptive blotches shortness of breath and even with delirium these dreadful effects are usually attributed to some malignant poison in the little pea crab which is occasionally found in the muscle and may be accidentally eaten with it others think it is in consequence of swallowing the silky byssus or beard and again many deem the muscle itself poisonous it is however pretty generally agreed that they affect some constitutions more than others and that much depends on the state of the body at the time of eating them the disorder may be cured or at least its malignity mitigated by administering to the affected person a spoonful of vinegar some recommend sweet oil or salt and water da costa observes that sudorifics vomits oils etc are the usual remedies and the dutch give two spoonsfull of oil and one of lemonjuice or in defect of that a little more vinegar well shaken together and swallowed immediately  the muscle is the prey of many kinds of fishes and

character in any of those shells that have occurred to notice on our own coasts have thought it most advisable to retain the name mr pennant had previously given it  gmelin seems to be under some doubts respecting this shell for he entirely omits the linnaean granulata among the species of this genus  sabella belgica of gmelin which some have conjectured to be the s tubiformis of pennant is undoubtedly different according to klein and martini  our shell is of an elegant form and remarkably delicate it consists of two coatings the inner one of which is composed entirely of grains of sand

there does certainly exist among conchologists a strange discordance of opinion respecting the species of arca before us some believing it to be the very shell which linnaeus described under the name of lactea and others maintaining the contrary dr solander and dr pultney were persuaded that linnaeus intended a shell in some particulars not unlike this but specifically different the same shell in fact which lister figures no    in his conchology the opinions of two such respectable naturalists deserve every consideration but however we may be disposed to abide by their authority in some instances we cannot for the following reasons assent to it in the present  dr pultney premises his description by naming this species arca crinita a name which it appears dr solander had previously given to it in his catalogue of the portland museum he observes very justly that it is the a barbata of pennant but not the barbata of linnaeus refers to da costas figure plate    fig   and calls it in english the hairy arkshell his description is in these words a small oblong subrhomboidal shell in its recent state covered with a brown epidermis undemeath the shell is minutely striated in the longitudinal direction commonly not much larger than a horsebean i found one on the north shore at poole more than half an inch long and seveneights wide it is said to be more frequent on the shores of guernsey island but is very rare on our coasts this shell has commonly been described as the a lactea of linnaeus but that shell is much larger and is strongly striated in a reticulated manner  in the first place this does not so clearly agree with the linnaean description as might be expected in the early editions of the systema naturae linnaeus expressly describes his shell as being of a subrhombic form with obsolete decussating striae diaphanous with recurved beaks and crenulated margin and the only alteration in the specific character to the last edition of that work by gmelin is that the beaks and margins are not mentioned it hence is evident that dr pultney is mistaken in the linnaean lactea when he says it is strongly striated in a reticulated manner for linnaeus exactly describes it as having the reticulating striae obsolete and notwithstanding that the longitudinal striae in the shell found on our coast are rather prominent in some specimens they far more frequently appear altogether obsolete and are decussated by fine transverse striae precisely as linnaeus mentions there is another circumstance equally remarkable linnaeus exactly tells us his lactea is the size of a horsebean and dr pultney after observing that his british shell crinita are commonly not much larger than a horsebean adds that the lactea of linnaeus is much larger  that there may have been some erroneous references among authors to the two shells figured by lister no    and    of which we are not aware is not impossible but gmelin refers to list conch    a t guernsey for the linnaean lactea and that shell clearly corresponds both with our specimen and the shell described by linnaeus pectunculus exiguus albus admodum tenuiter striatis list  petiver is equally satisfactory mytilus garnseiae albus parvus tenuiter cancellata da costa is not so very clear nor is his figure expressive because it represents the transverse ridges too prominent chemnitz gives a larger specimen of it than any we have seen and notwithstanding his references to da costa and others may not be of the same species  the shell figured by lister no    which seems to have occasioned the confusion before alluded to it should be observed is described by gmelin in these words testa subrhomboidea decussatim striata alba natibus approximatis vulva cordata arca reticulata  hence it is presumed the shell found on our coast ought still to be considered as the arca lactea of linnaeus and that the shell which is strongly striated in a reticulated manner and so much larger and has been hitherto regarded by some as that species was never described or even noticed by linnaeus nothing can be more evident than that this is the opinion of his editor gmelin both from his references to the figures of lactea and by his giving a new name and character to that very shell in lister which has been mistaken for it and which he conceived linnaeus had omitted  this kind is generally considered as an inhabitant of dorsetshire devonshire and cornwall   plate cxxxvi helix arbustorum singlestreak snail generic character aperture of the mouth contracted and lunulated  specific character shell umbilicated unequal

inhabitant only of low rocky shores that lie within reach of the tide at high water and although it is composed entirely of broken shells and sea sand and those apparently very slightly agglutinated by the animals that form and inhabit it in its native element it acquires a considerable comparative degree of tenacity from the saline particles with which it is impregnated and is capable of resisting the reiterated dashing of the waves without material injury  in the more sheltered crevices of the rocks where the animal has ample scope to expand its sandy dwelling secure from mutilation the upper surface of a mass of these shells has a very elegant appearance the whole being beautifully foliated with the single or bipartite funnnel shaped lip which each animal forms at the opening of his cell this appearance is represented in the plate subjoined and is a circumstance the more deserving attention because it has entirely escaped the notice of mr pennant and perhaps of every other naturalist except mr ellis who in his history of corals figures it with a foliated surface under the title of tubularia arenosa anglica from a specimen brought from dieppe the latter does not however agree precisely in figure with any that have occurred to our notice mr pennant evidently represents a poor mutilated fragment in which the openings of the cells are shown like so many rounded perforations in a somewhat uneven surface and is just as it appears in masses on the seabeach that have been trodden underfoot or pieces that have been much worn and thrown loose upon the shore  these shells are three or four inches in length and where they are found are generally abundant but they seem to be very local mr pennant says it is found on the western coasts of anglesea near cricceth in
