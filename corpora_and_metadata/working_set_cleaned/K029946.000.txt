the castle of indolence an allegorical poem  written in imitation of spenser  by james thomson  london printed for a millar over against catherinestreet in the strand m dcc xlviii  the castle of indolence the castle hight of indolence and its false luxury where for a little time alas we lived right jollily  i o mortal man who live here by toil do not complain of this thy hard estate that like an emmet thou must ever moil is a sad sentence of an ancient date and certes there is for it reason great for though sometimes it makes thee weep and wail and curse thy star and early drudge and late withouten that would come an heavier bale oose life unruly passions and diseases pale ii in lowly dale fast by a rivers side with woody hill over hill encompassed round a most enchanting wizard did abide than whom a fiend more fell is no where found it was i ween a lovely spot of ground and there a season atween june and may half prankt with spring with summer half imbrownd a listless climate made where sooth to say no living wight could work ne cared even for play iii was naught around but images of rest sleepsoothing groves and quiet lawns between and flowery beds that slumbrous influence kest from poppies breathed and beds of pleasant green where never yet was creeping creature seen mean time unnumberd glittering streamlets played and hurled everywhere their waters sheen that as they bickerd through the sunny glade though restless still themselves a lulling murmur made iv joined to the prattle of the purling rills were heard the lowing herds along the vale and flocks loudbleating from the distant hills and vacant shepherds piping in the dale and now and then sweet philomel would wail or stockdoves plain amid the forest deep that drowsy rustled to the sighing gale and still a coil the grasshopper did keep yet all these sounds yblent inclined all to sleep v full in the passage of the vale above a sable silent solemn forest stood where naught but shadowy forms were seen to move as idless fancied in her dreaming mood and up the hills on either side a wood of blackening pines ay waving to and fro sent forth a sleepy horror through the blood and where this valley winded out below the murmuring main was heard and scarcely heard to flow vi a pleasing land of drowsyhed it was of dreams that wave before the halfshut eye and of gay castles in the clouds that pass for ever flushing round a summersky there eke the soft delights that witchingly instill a wanton sweetness through the breast and the calm pleasures always hovered nigh but whatever smackd of noyance or unrest was far far off expelled from this delicious nest vii the landscape such inspiring perfect ease where indolence for so the wizard hight closehid his castle mid embowering trees that half shut out the beams of phoebus bright and made a kind of checkered day and night mean while unceasing at the massy gate beneath a spacious palm the wicked wight was placed and to his lute of cruel fate and labor harsh complained lamenting mans estate viii thither continual pilgrims crowded still from all the roads of earth that pass there by for as they chauncd to breathe on neighboring hill the freshness of this valley smote their eye and drew them ever and anon more nigh till clustering round thenchanter false they hung ymolten with his siren melody while over the enfeebling lute his hand he flung and to the trembling chords these tempting verses sung ix  behold ye pilgrims of this earth behold  see all but man with unearnd pleasure gay  see her bright robes the butterfly unfold  broke from her wintry tomb in prime of may  what youthful bride can equal her array  who can with her for easy pleasure vie  from mead to mead with gentle wing to stray  from flower to flower on balmy gales to fly  is all she has to do beneath the radiant sky x  behold the merry minstrels of the morn  the swarming songsters of the careless grove  ten thousand throats that from the flowering thorn  hymn their good god and carol sweet of love  such grateful kindly raptures them emove  they neither plough nor sow ne fit for flail  ever to the barn the nodding sheaves they drove  yet theirs each harvest dancing in the gale  whatever crowns the hill or smiles along the vale xi  outcast of nature man the wretched thrall  of bitterdropping sweat of sweltry pain  of cares that eat away thy heart with gall  and of the vices an inhuman train  that all proceed from savage thirst of gain  for when hardhearted interest first began  to poison earth astraea left the plain  guile violence and murder seized on man  and for soft milky streams with blood the rivers ran xii  come ye who still the cumbrous load of life  push hard up hill but as the farthest steep  you trust to gain and put an end to strife  down thunders back the stone with mighty sweep  and hurls your labors to the valley deep  forever vain come and withouten fee  i in oblivion will your sorrows steep  your cares your toils will steep you in a sea  of full delight o come ye weary wights to me xiii  with me you need not rise at early dawn  to pass the joyless day in various stounds  or louting low on upstart fortune fawn  and sell fair honor for some paltry pounds  or through the city take your dirty rounds  to cheat and dun and lie and visit pay  now flattering base now giving secret wounds  or proul in courts of law for human prey  in venal senate thieve or rob on broad highway xiv  no cocks with me to rustic labor call  from village on to village sounding clear  to tardy swain no shrillvoicd matrons squall  no dogs no babes no wives to stun your ear  no hammers thump no horrid blacksmith sear  ne noisy tradesman your sweet slumbers start  with sounds that are a misery to hear  but all is calm as would delight the heart  of sybarite of old all nature and all art xv  here naught but candor reigns indulgent ease  goodnatured lounging sauntering up and down  they who are pleased themselves must always please  on others ways they never squint a frown  nor heed what haps in hamlet or in town  thus from the source of tender indolence  with milky blood the heart is overflown  is soothed and sweetened by the social sense  for interest envy pride and strife are banished hence xvi  what what is virtue but repose of mind  a pure ethereal calm that knows no storm  above the reach of wild ambitions wind  above those passions that this world deform  and torture man a proud malignant worm  but here instead soft gales of passion play  and gently stir the heart thereby to form  a quicker sense of joy as breezes stray  across the enlivened skies and make them still more gay xvii  the best of men have ever loved repose  they hate to mingle in the filthy fray  where the soul sowrs and gradual rancour grows  embittered more from peevish day to day  even those whom fame has lent her fairest ray  the most renowned of worthy wights of yore  from a base world at last have stolen away  so scipio to the soft cumaean shore  retiring tasted joy he never knew before xviii  but if a little exercise you choose  some zest for ease it is not forbidden here  amid the groves you may indulge the muse  or tend the blooms and deck the vernal year  or softly stealing with your watery gear  along the brooks the crimsonspotted fry  you may delude the whilst amused you hear  now the hoarse stream and now the zephirs sigh  attuned to the birds and woodland melody xix  o grievous folly to heap up estate  losing the days you see beneath the sun  when sudden comes blind unrelenting fate  and gives the untasted portion you have won  with ruthless toil and many a wretch undone  to those who mock you gone to plutos reign  there with sad ghosts to pine and shadows dun  but sure it is of vanities most vain  to toil for what you here untoiling may obtain xx he ceased but still their trembling ears retained the deep vibrations of his witching song that by a kind of magic power constrained to enter in pellmell the listening throng heaps poured on heaps and yet they slipped along in silent ease as when beneath the beam of summermoons the distant woods among or by some flood all silvered with the gleam the softembodied fays through airy portal stream xxi by the smooth demon so it ordered was and here his baneful bounty first began though some there were who would not further pass and his alluring baits suspected han the wise distrust the too fairspoken man yet through the gate they cast a wishful eye not to move on perdie is all they can for do their very best they cannot fly but often each way look and often sorely sigh xxii when this the watchful wicked wizard saw with sudden spring he leaped upon them strait and soon as touched by his unhallowed paw they found themselves within the cursed gate full hard to be repassed like that of fate not stronger were of old the giantcrew who sought to pull high jove from regal state though feeble wretch he seemed of sallow hue certes who bides his grasp will that encounter rue xxiii for whomsoeer the villain takes in hand their joints unknit their sinews melt apace as lithe they grow as any willowwand and of their vanished force remains no trace so when a maiden fair of modest grace in all her buxom blooming may of charms is seized in some losels hot embrace she waxes very weakly as she warms then sighing yields her up to loves delicious harms xxiv waked by the crowd slow from his bench arose a comely fullspred porter swollen with sleep his calm broad thoughtless aspect breathed repose and in sweet torpor he was plunged deep ne could himself from ceaseless yawning keep while over his eyes the drowsy liquor ran through which his halfwakd soul would faintly peep then taking his black staff he called his man and roused himself as much as rouse himself he can xxv the lad leaped lightly at his masters call he was to weet a little roguish page save sleep and play who minded naught at all like most the untaught striplings of his age this boy he kept each band to disengage garters and buckles task for him unfit but illbecoming his grave personage and which his portly paunch would not permit so this same limber page to all performed it xxvi mean time the masterporter wide displayed great store of caps of slippers and of gowns wherewith he those who entered in arrayed loose as the breeze that plays along the downs and waves the summerwoods when evening frowns o fair undress best dress it checks no vein but every flowing limb in pleasure drowns and heightens ease with grace this done right fain sir porter sat him down and turned to sleep again xxvii thus easyrobd they to the fountain sped that in the middle of the court upthrew a stream highspouting from its liquid bed and falling back again in drizzly dew there each deep draughts as deep he thirsted drew it was a fountain of nepenthe rare whence as dan homer sings huge pleasaunce grew and sweet oblivion of vile earthly care fair gladsome waking thoughts and joyous dreams more fair xxviii this rite performed all inly pleased and still withouten tromp was proclamation made  ye sons of indolence do what you will  and wander where you list through hall or glade  be no mans pleasure for anothers staid  let each as likes him best his hours employ  and cursed be he who minds his neighbors trade  here dwells kind ease and unreproving joy  he little merits bliss who others can annoy xxix strait of these endless numbers swarming round as thick as idle motes in sunny ray not one eftsoons in view was to be found but every man strolld off his own glad way wide over this ample courts blank area with all the lodges that thereto pertaind no living creature could be seen to stray while solitude and perfect silence reigned so that to think you dreamt you almost was constrained xxx as when a shepherd of the those islands on the western coast of scotland called the hebrides hebridisles placed far amid the melancholy main whether it be lone fancy him beguiles or that aerial beings sometimes deign to stand embodied to our senses plain sees on the naked hill or valley low the whilst in ocean phoebus dips his wain a vast assembly moving to and fro then all at once in air dissolves the wondrous show xxxi ye gods of quiet and of sleep profound whose soft dominion over this castle sways and all the widelysilent places round forgive me if my trembling pen displays what never yet was sung in mortal lays but how shall i attempt such arduous string i who have spent my nights and nightly days in this souldeadening place looseloitering ah how shall i for this uprear my moulted wing xxxii come on my muse nor stoop to low despair thou imp of jove touched by celestial fire thou yet shall sing of war and actions fair which the bold sons of britain will inspire of ancient bards thou yet shall sweep the lyre thou yet shall tread in tragic pall the stage paint loves enchanting woes the heros ire the sages calm the patriots noble rage dashing corruption down through every worthless age xxxiii the doors that knew no shrill alarming bell ne cursed knocker plied by villains hand selfopend into halls where who can tell what elegance and grandeur wide expand the pride of turkey and of persia land soft quilts on quilts on carpets carpets spread and couches stretch around in seemly band and endless pillows rise to prop the head so that each spacious room was one fullswelling bed xxxiv and every where huge covered tables stood with wines highflavourd and rich viands crowned whatever sprightly juice or tasteful food on the green bosom of this earth are found and all old ocean genders in his round some hand unseen these silently displayed even undemanded by a sign or sound you need but wish and instantly obeyed fairrangd the dishes rose and thick the glasses played xxxv here freedom reigned without the least alloy nor gossips tale nor ancient maidens gall nor saintly spleen durst murmur at our joy and with envenomed tongue our pleasures pall for why there was but one great rule for all to wit that each should work his own desire and eat drink study sleep as it may fall or melt the time in love or wake the lyre and carol what unbid the muses might inspire xxxvi the rooms with costly tapestry were hung where was inwoven many a gentle tale such as of old the rural poets sung or of arcadian or sicilian vale reclining lovers in the lonely dale poured forth at large the sweetlytorturd heart or looking tender passion swelled the gale and taught charmed echo to resound their smart while flocks woods streams around repose and peace impart xxxvii those pleased the most where by a cunning hand depainted was the patriarchal age what time dan abraham left the chaldee land and pasturd on from verdant stage to stage where fields and fountains fresh could best engage toil was not then of nothing took they heed but with wild beasts the silvan war to wage and over vast plains their herds and flocks to feed blessed sons of nature they true golden age indeed xxxviii sometimes the pencil in cool airy halls bade the gay bloom of vernal landskips rise or autumns varied shades imbrown the walls now the black tempest strikes the astonished eyes now down the steep the flashing torrent flies the trembling sun now plays over ocean blue and now rude mountains frown amid the skies whatever lorrain lighttouchd with softening hue or savage rosa dashed or learned poussin drew xxxix each sound too here to languishment inclined lulled the weak bosom and induced ease aerial music in the warbling wind at distance rising often by small degrees nearer and nearer came till over the trees it hung and breathed such souldissolving airs as did alas with soft perdition please entangled deep in its enchanting snares the listening heart forgot all duties and all cares xl a certain music never known before here lulled the pensive melancholy mind full easily obtained behooves no more but sidelong to the gentlywaving wind to lay the welltuned instrument reclined from which with airy flying fingers light beyond each mortal touch the most refined the god of winds drew sounds of deep delight whence with just cause this is not an imagination of the author there being in fact such an instrument called aeoluss harp which when placed against a little rushing or current of air produces the effect here described the harp of aeolus it hight xli ah me what hand can touch the strings so fine who up the lofty diapasan roll such sweet such sad such solemn airs divine then let them down again into the soul now rising love they fand now pleasing dole they breathed in tender musings through the heart and now a graver sacred strain they stole as when seraphic hands an hymn impart wild warbling nature all above the reach of art xlii such the gay splendour the luxurious state of caliphs old who on the tygris shore in mighty bagdat populous and great held their bright court where was of ladies store and verse love music still the garland wore when sleep was coy the arabian caliphs had poets among the officers of their court whose office it was to do what is here mentioned the bard in waiting there cheered the lone midnight with the muses lore composing music bade his dreams be fair and music lent new gladness to the morning air xliii near the pavilions where we slept still ran softtinkling streams and dashing waters fell and sobbing breezes sighed and often began so worked the wizard wintry storms to swell as heaven and earth they would together mell at doors and windows threatening seemed to call the demons of the tempest growling fell yet the least entrance found they none at all whence sweeter grew our sleep secure in massy hall xliv and hither morpheus sent his kindest dreams raising a world of gayer tinct and grace over which were shadowy cast elysian gleams that played in waving lights from place to place and shed a roseate smile on natures face not titians pencil ever could so array so fleece with clouds the pure etherial space ne could it ever such melting forms display as loose on flowery beds all languishingly lay xlv no fair illusions artful phantoms no my muse will not attempt your fairyland she has no colors that like you can glow to catch your vivid scenes too gross her hand but sure it is was never a subtler band than these same guileful angelseeming sprights who thus in dreams voluptuous soft and bland poured all the arabian heaven upon our nights and blessed them often besides with more refined delights xlvi they were in sooth a most enchanting train even feigning virtue skilful to unite with evil good and strew with pleasure pain but for those fiends whom blood and broils delight who hurl the wretch as if to hell outright down down black gulphs where sullen waters sleep or hold him clambering all the fearful night on beetling cliffs or pent in ruins deep they till due time should serve were bid far hence to keep xlvii ye guardian spirits to whom man in dear from these foul demons shield the midnight gloom angels of fancy and of love be near and over the blank of sleep diffuse a bloom evoke the sacred shades of greece and rome and let them virtue with a look impart but chief a while o lend us from the tomb those longlost friends for whom in love we smart and fill with pious awe and joymixt woe the heart xlviii or are you sportive  bid the morn of youth rise to new light and beam afresh the days of innocence simplicity and truth to cares estranged and manhoods thorny ways what transport to retrace our boyish plays our easy bliss when each thing joy supplied the woods the mountains and the warbling maze of the wild brooks  but fondly wandering wide my muse resume the task that yet does thee abide xlix one great amusement of our household was in a huge crystal magic globe to spy still as you turned it all things that do pass upon this anthill earth where constantly of idlybusy men the restless fry run bustling too and fro with foolish haste in search of pleasures vain that from them fly or which obtained the caitiffs dare not taste when nothing is enjoyed can there be greater waste l of vanity the mirror this was called here you a muckworm of the town might see at his dull desk amid his legers stalld eat up with carking care and penury most like to carcass parched on gallow tree a penny saved is a penny got firm to this scoundrel maxim keeps he ne of its rigor will he bate a jot till it has quenched his fire and banished his pot li strait from the filth of this low grub behold comes fluttering forth a gaudy spendthrift heir all glossy gay enameled all with gold the silly tenant of the summerair in folly lost of nothing takes he care pimps lawyers stewards harlots flatterers vile and thieving tradesmen him among them share his fathers ghost from limbolake the while sees this which more damnation does upon him pile lii this globe portrayed the race of learned men still at their books and turning over the page backwards and forwards often they snatch the pen as if inspired and in a thespian rage then write and blot as would your ruth engage why auhors all this scrawl and scribbling sore to lose the present gain the future age praised to be when you can hear no more and much enriched with fame when useless worldly store liii then would a splendid city rise to view with carts and cars and coaches roaring all widepourd abroad behold the prowling crew see how they dash along from wall to wall at every door hark how they thundering call good lord what can this giddy rout excite why on each other with fell tooth to fall a neighbors fortune fame or peace to blight and make new tiresome parties for the coming night live the puzzling sons of party next appeared in dark cabals and nightly juntos met and now they whispered close new shrugging reared the important shoulder then as if to get new light their twinkling eyes were inward set no sooner the morning star lucifer recalls affairs than forth they various rush in mighty fret when lo pushed up to power and crowned their cares in comes another set and kicketh them down stairs lv but what most showed the vanity of life was to behold the nations all on fire in cruel broils engaged and deadly strife most christian kings inflamed by black desire with honorable russians in their hire cause war to rage and blood around to pour of this sad work when each begins to tire they sit them down just where they were before till for new scenes of woe peace shall their force restore lvi to number up the thousands dwelling here an useless were and eke an endless task from kings and those who at the helm appear to gypsies brown in summerglades who bask yea many a man perdie i could unmask whose desk and table make a solemn show with tapetyd trash and suits of fools that ask for place or pension laid in decent row but these i passen by with nameless numbers more lvii of all the gentle tenants of the place there was a man of special grave remark a certain tender gloom overspread his face pensive not sad in thought involved not dark as soot this man could sing as morninglark and teach the noblest morals of the heart but these his talents were yburyd stark of the fine stores he nothing would impart which or boon nature gave or naturepainting art lviii to noontide shades incontinent he ran where purls the brook with sleepinviting sound or when dan sol to slope his wheels began amid the broom he baskd him on the ground where the wild thyme and camomil are found there would he linger till the latest ray of light sat trembling on the welkins bound then homeward through the twilight shadows stray sauntring and slow so had he passed many a day lix yet not in thoughtless slumber were they past for often the heavenly fire that lay concealed beneath the sleeping embers mounted fast and all its native light anew revealed often as he traversed the cerulean field and marked the clouds that drove before the wind ten thousand glorious systems would he build ten thousand great ideas filled his mind but with the clouds they fled and left no tract behind lx with him was sometimes joined in silent walk profoundly silent for they never spoke one shyer still who quite detested talk often stung by spleen at once away he broke to groves of pine and broad oershadowing oak there inly thrilled he wandered all alone and on himself his pensive fury wroke ne ever uttered word save when first shone the glittering star of eve  thank heaven the day is done lxi here lurked a wretch who had not crept abroad for forty years ne face of mortal seen in chamber brooding like a loathly toad and sure his linen was not very clean through secret loophole that had practiced been near to his bed his dinner vile he took unkempt and rough of squalid face and mein our castles shame whence from his filthy nook we drove the villain out for fitter lair to look lxii one day there chauncd into these halls to rove a joyous youth who took you at first sight him the wild wave of pleasure hither drove before the sprightly tempest tossing light certes he was a most engaging wight of social glee and wit humane though keen turning the night to day and day to night for him the merry bells had rung i ween if in this nook of quiet bells had ever been lxiii but not even pleasure to excess is good what most elates then sinks the soul as low when springtide joy pours in with copious flood the higher still the exulting billows flow the farther back again they flagging go and leave us grovelling on the dreary shore taught by this son of joy we found it so who whilst he staid kept in a gay uproar our maddend castle all the abode of sleep no more lxiv as when in prime of june a burnished fly sprung from the meads over which he sweeps along cheered by the breathing bloom and vital sky tunes up amid these airy halls his song soothing at first the gay reposing throng and often he sips their bowl or nearly drowned he thence recovering drives their beds among and scares their tender sleep with trump profound then out again he flies to wing his mazy round lxv another guest there was of sense refined who felt each worth for every worth he had serene yet warm humane yet firm his mind as little touched as any mans with bad him through their inmost walks the muses lad to him the sacred love of nature lent and sometimes would he make our valley glad whenas we found he would not here be pent to him the better sort this friendly message sent lxvi  come dwell with us true son of virtue come  but if alas we cannot thee persuade  to lie content beneath our peaceful dome  ne ever more to quit our quiet glade  yet when at last thy toils but ill apaid  shall dead thy fire and damp its heavenly spark  thou will be glad to seek the rural shade  there to indulge the muse and nature mark  we then a lodge for thee will rear in hagleypark lxvii here whilom liggd the esopus of the age but called by fame in soul ypricked deep a noble pride restored him to the stage and roused him like a giant from his sleep even from his slumbers we advantage reap with double force the enlivened scene he wakes yet quits not natures bounds he knows to keep each due decorum now the heart he shakes and now with wellurgd sense thenlightend judgment takes lxviii a bard here dwelt more fat than bard beseems the following lines of this stanza were writ by a friend of the author who void of envy guile and lust of gain on virtue still and natures pleasing themes poured forth his unpremeditated strain the world forsaking with a calm disdain here laughed he careless in his easy seat here quaffd encircled with the joyous train often moralizing sage his ditty sweet he loathed much to write ne cared to repeat lxix full often by holy feet our ground was trod of clerks good plenty here you mote espy a little round fat oily man of god was one i chiefly marked among the fry he had a roguish twinkle in his eye and shone all glittering with ungodly dew if a tight damsel chauncd to trippen by which when observed he shrunk into his mew and strait would recollect his piety anew lxx nor be forgot a tribe who minded naught old inmates of the place but state affairs they looked perdie as if they deeply thought and on their brow sat every nations cares the world by them is parceld out in shares when in the hall of smoke they congress hold and the sage berry sunburned mocha bears has cleared their inward eye then smoakenrolld their oracles break forth mysterious as of old lxxi here languid beauty kept her palefaced court bevies of dainty dames of high degree from every quarter hither made resort where from gross mortal care and business free they lay poured out in ease and luxury or should they a vain show of work assume alas and welladay what can it be to knot to twist to range the vernal bloom but far is cast the distaff spinningwheel and loom lxxii their only labor was to kill the time and labor dire it is and weary woe they sit they loll turn over some idle rhyme then rising sudden to the glass they go or saunter forth with tottering step and slow this soon too rude an exercise they find strait on the couch their limbs again they throw where hours on hours they sighing lie reclined and court the vapoury god softbreathing in the wind lxxiii now must i mark the villainy we found but ah too late as shall estsoons be shown a place here was deep dreary under ground where still our inmates when unpleasing grown diseased and loathsome privily were thrown far from the light of heaven they languishd there unpitied uttering many a bitter groan for of these wretches taken was no care fierce fiends and hags of hell their only nurses were lxxiv alas the change from scenes of joy and rest to this dark den where sickness tossed always here lethargy with deadly sleep oppressed stretched on his back a mighty lubbard lay heaving his sides and snored night and day to stir him from his trance it was not eath and his halfopend eyne he shut strait way he led i wot the softest way to death and taught withouten pain and strife to yield the breath lxxv of limbs enormous but withal unsound softswoln and pale here lay the hydropsy unwieldy man with belly monstrous round for ever fed with watery supply for still he drank and yet he still was dry and here a moping mystery did sit mother of spleen in robes of various dye who vexed was full often with ugly fit and some her frantic deemed and some her deemed a wit lxxvi a lady proud she was of ancient blood yet often her fear her pride made crouchen low she felt or fancied in her fluttering mood all the diseases which the spittles know and sought all physic which the shops bestow and still new leaches and new drugs would try her humor ever wavering to and fro for sometimes she would laugh and sometimes cry then sudden waxed wroth and all she knew not why lxxvii fast by her side a listless maiden pined with aching head and squeamish heartburnings pale bloated cold she seemed to hate mankind yet loved in secret all forbidden things and here the tertian shakes his chilling wings the sleepless gout here counts the crowing cocks a wolf now gnaws him now a serpent stings whilst apoplexy crammed intemperance knocks down to the ground at once as butcher felleth ox canto ii the knight of arts and industry and his achievements fair that by this castles overthrow secured and crowned were  i escaped the castle of the sire of sin ah where shall i so sweet a dwelling find for all around without and all within nothing save what delightful was and kind of goodness savouring and a tender mind ever rose to view but now another strain of doleful note alas remains behind i now must sing of pleasure turned to pain and of the false inchanter indolence complain ii is there no patron to protect the muse and fence for her parnassus barren soil to every labor its reward accrues and they are sure of bread who swink and moil but a fell tribe the aonian hive despoil as ruthless wasps often rob the painful be thus while the laws not guard that noblest toil ne for the muses other meed decree they praised are alone and starve right merrily iii i care not fortune what you me deny you cannot rob me of free natures grace you cannot shut the windows of the sky through which aurora shows her brightening face you cannot bar my constant feet to trace the woods and lawns by living stream at eve let health my nerves and finer fibers brace and i their toys to the great children leave of fancy reason virtue naught can me bereave iv come then my muse and raise a bolder song come lig no more upon the bed of sloth dragging the lazy languid line along fond to begin but still to finish loath thy halfwrit scrolls all eaten by the moth arise and sing that generous imp of fame who with the sons of softness nobly wroth to sweep away this human lumber came or in a chosen few to rouse the slumbering flame v in fairyland there lived a knight of old of feature stern selvaggio well yclepd a rough unpolished man robust and bold but wondrous poor he neither sowed nor reaped ne stores in summer for cold winter heaped in hunting all his days away he wore now scorched by june now in november steeped now pinched by biting january sore he still in woods pursued the libbard and the boar vi as he one morning long before the dawn pricked through the forest to dislodge his prey deep in the winding bosom of a lawn with wood wildfringd he marked a tapers ray that from the beating rain and wintry fray did to a lonely cott his steps decoy there up to earn the needments of the day he found dame poverty nor fair nor coy her he compressed and filled her with a lusty boy vii amid the greenwood shade this boy was bred and grew at last a knight of muchel fame of active mind and vigorous lustyhed the knight of arts and industry by name earth was his bed the boughs his roof did frame he knew no beverage but the flowing stream his tasteful wellearnd food the silvan game or the brown fruit with which the woodlands teem the same to him glad summer or the winter breme viii so passed his youthly morning void of care wild as the colts that through the commons run for him no tender parents troubled were he of the forest seemed to be the son and certes had been utterly undone but that minerva pity of him took with all the gods that love the rural won that teach to tame the soil and rule the crook ne did the sacred nine disdain a gentle look ix of fertile genius him they nurtured well in every science and in every art by which mankind the thoughtless brutes excel that can or use or joy or grace impart disclosing all the powers of head and heart ne were the goodly exercises spared that brace the nerves or make the limbs alert and mix elastic force with firmness hard was never knight on ground mote be with him compared x sometimes with early morn he mounted gay the huntersteed exulting over the dale and drew the roseat breath of orient day sometimes retiring to the secret vale yclad in steel and bright with burnished mail he strained the bow or tossed the sounding spear or darting on the goal outstripd the gale or wheeled the chariot in its midcareer or strenuous wrestled hard with many a tough compeer xi at other times he pried through natures store whatever she in the etherial round contains whatever she hides beneath her verdant floor the vegetable and the mineral reigns or else he scanned the globe those small domains where restless mortals such a turmoil keep its seas its floods its mountains and its plains but more he searched the mind and roused from sleep those moral seeds whence we heroic actions reap xii nor would he scorn to stoop from high pursuits of heavenly truth and practice what she taught vain is the tree of knowledge without fruits sometimes in hand the spade or plough he caught forthcalling all with which boon earth is fraught sometimes he plied the strong mechanic tool or reared the fabric from the finest draught and often he put himself to neptunes school fighting with winds and waves on the vexed ocean pool xiii to solace then these rougher toils he tried to touch the kindling canvass into life with nature his creating pencil vyd with nature joyous at the mimic strife or to such shapes as graced pygmalions wife he hewed the marble or with varied fire he roused the trumpet and the martial fife or bad the lute sweet tenderness inspire or verses framed that well might wake apollos lyre xiv accomplished thus he from the woods issued full of great aims and bent on bold emprize the work which long he in his breast had brewed now to perform he ardent did devise towit a barbarous world to civilize earth was till then a boundless forest wild naught to be seen but savage wood and skies no cities nourished arts no culture smiled no government no laws no gentle manners mild xv a rugged wight the worst of brutes was man on his own wretched kind he ruthless preyed the strongest still the weakest overran in every country mighty robbers swayed and guile and ruffian force were all their trade life was not life but rapine want and woe which this brave knight in noble anger made to swear he would the rascal rout oerthrow for by the powers divine it should no more be so xvi it would exceed the purport of my song to say how this best sun from orient climes came beaming life and beauty all along before him chasing indolence and crimes still as he passed the nations he sublimes and calls forth arts and virtue with his ray then egypt greece and rome their golden times successive had but now in ruins gray they lie to slavish sloth and tyranny a prey xvii to crown his toils sir industry then spread the

wrath  your happiness behold  then strait a wand he waved an antimagic power that has truth from illusive falsehood to command sudden the landscape sinks on every hand the pure quick streams are marshy puddles found on baleful heaths the groves all blackened stand and over the weedy foul abhorred ground snakes adders toads each loathly creature crawls around lxviii and here and there on trees by lightning scathd unhappy wights who loathed life yhung or in fresh gore and recent murder bathed they weltering lay or else infuriate flung into the gloomy flood while ravens sung the funeral dirge

moving scene was open laid that lazarhouse i whilom in my lay depeinten have its horrors deepdisplayd and gave unnumberd wretches to the day who tossing there in squalid misery lay soon as of sacred light the unwonted smile poured on these living catacombs its ray through the drear caverns stretching many a mile the sick upraisd their heads and dropped their woes awhile lxx  o heaven they cried and do we once more see  yon blessed sun and this green earth so fair  are we from noisome damps of pesthouse free  and drink our souls the sweet ethereal air  o thou or knight or god who hold there  that fiend oh keep him in eternal chains  but what for us the children of despair  brought to the brink of hell what hope remains  repentance does itself but aggravate our pains lxxi the gentle knight who saw their rueful case let fall adown his silver beard some tears  certes quoth he it is not even in grace  to undo the past and eke your broken years  nathless to nobler worlds repentance rears  with humble hope her eye to her is given  a power the truly contrite heart that chears  she quells the brand by which the rocks are riven  she more than merely softens she rejoices heaven lxxii  then patient bear the sufferings you have earned  and by these sufferings purify the mind  let wisdom be by past misconduct learned  or pious die with penitence resigned  and to a life more happy and refined  doubt not you shall new creatures yet arise  till then you may expect in me to find  one who will wipe your sorrow from your eyes  one who will soothe your pangs and wing you to the skies lxxiii they silent heard and poured their thanks in tears  for you resumed the knight with sterner tone  whose hard dry hearts the obdurate demon sears  that villains gifts will cost you many a groan  in dolorous mansion long you must bemoan  his fatal charms and weep your stains away  till soft and pure as infantgoodness grown  you feel a perfect change then who can say  what grace may yet shine forth in heavens eternal day lxxiv this said his powerful wand he waved anew instant a glorious angeltrain descends the charities towit of rosy hue sweet love their looks a gentle radiance lends and with seraphic flame compassion blends at once delighted to their charge they fly when lo a goodly hospital ascends in which they bade each human aid be nigh that could the sickbed smoothe of that unhappy fry lxxv it was a worthy edifying sight and gives to humankind peculiar grace to see kind hands attending day and night with tender ministry from place to place some prop the head some from the pallid face wipe off the faint cold dews weak nature sheds some reach the healing draught the whilst to chase the fear supreme around their softened beds some holy man by prayer all opening heaven dispreds lxxvi attended by a glad acclaiming train of those he rescued had from gaping hell then turned the knight and to his hall again softpacing sought of peace the mossy cell yet down his cheeks the gems of pity fell to see the helpless wretches that remained there left through delves and deserts dire to yell amazed their looks with pale dismay were stained and spreading wide their hands they meek repentance feigned lxxvii but ah their scorned day of grace was past for horrible to tell a desert wild before them stretched bare comfortless and vast with gibbets bones and carcases defiled there nor trim field nor lively culture smiled nor waving shade was seen nor fountain fair but sands abrupt on sands lay loosely pild through which they floundering toiled with painful care whilst phoebus smote them sore and fired the cloudless air lxxviii then varying to a joyless land of bogs the saddend country a gray waste appeared where naught but putrid steams and noisome fogs for ever hung on drizzly austers beard or else the ground by piercing caurus seared was jaggd with frost or heaped with glazed snow through these extremes a ceaseless round they steered by cruel fiends still hurried to and fro gaunt beggary and scorn with many hell hounds more lxxix the first was with base dunghill rags yclad tainting the gale in which they fluttered light of morbid hue his features sunk and sad his hollow eyne shook forth a sickly light and over his lank jaw bone in piteous plight his black rough beard was matted rank and vile direful to see an heartappalling sight meantime foul scurf and blotches him defile and dogs wherever he went still barked all the while lxxx the other was a fell despightful fiend hell holds none worse in baleful bower below by pride and wit and rage and rancour keend of man alike if good or bad the foe with nose upturnd he always made a show as if he smelt some nauseous scent his eye was cold and keen like blast from boreal snow and taunts he casten forth most bitterly such were the twain that off drove this ungodly fry lxxxi even so through brentford town a town of mud an herd of brisly swine is pricked along the filthy beasts that never chew the cud still grunt and squeak and sing their troublous song and often they plunge themselves the mire among but ay the ruthless driver goads them on and ay of barking dogs the bitter throng
