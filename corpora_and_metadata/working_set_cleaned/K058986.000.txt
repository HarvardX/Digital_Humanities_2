  the desert island a dramatic poem in three acts  as it is acted at the theater royal in drury lane  te dulcis conjux te solo in littore secum te veniente die te decedente canebat virg london printed for paul vaillant facing southamptonstreet in the strand mdcclx  price one shilling and six pence  advertisement the following piece is founded on the isola disabitata of the celebrated abbe metastasio in reading the performance of that great genius the present writer received so exquisite a pleasure that he contracted a passion for the subject and could not refrain from exercising his pen upon it in the prosecution of his plan he knew enough of the modern theater to perceive that it was thin of what our playfollowers call business and he was aware that on the stage it might prove to use miltons words very different from what among us passes for best the same remark was made by a friend of the authors who thought it hazardous to offer to a popular assembly a piece in which there were none of those strokes that generally succeed with the multitude cannot you said he throw in something here and there to season it more to the public appetite  suppose you were to change the title and fix the scene among the anthropophagi or among the men whose heads do grow beneath their shoulders  a few of those extraordinary personages exhibited on the stage will prove very acceptable  what think you of an irish servant in it  that certainly will insure success the more especially if you add some aerial beings and conclude the whole with a drunken song by the tars of old england  the author was sensible of the force of these observations but the great milton mentioned above stared him in the face with his reflections on the error of introducing trivial and vulgar persons which by all judicious has been counted absurd and brought in without discretion corruptly to gratify the people vide preface to samson agonistes  he therefore determined to preserve the integrity of his original design and to try what would be the effect of a simple fable with but few incidents supported entirely by the spirit of poetry sentiment and passion to combine these there qualities is indeed an arduous task and the author therefore does not flatter himself that he has entirely succeeded in so difficult an attempt  in justice to metastasio he thinks proper to inform the mere english reader that he has not been a translator on this occasion but has followed the impulse of his own imagination excepting in a few passages the italian poet gave the fable the present writer made his own use of it or in other words the groundwork or canevas as the french call it is metastasios for the coloring mr murphy is answerable  he could not but be surprised to find that on the first night the scene in the third act between sylvia and henrico was deemed equivocal there is always a sufficient number ready to ascribe to an author various meanings which he never had and see at cannons what was never there  to these gentlemen he returns his thanks but the species of wit which they are willing to allow him he begs leave publicly to disclaim the character of a girl who has never seen a man and who has been taught to think of such a being with horror is merely imaginary but the possible or poetical existence of such a girl being once established it is to be wished that the critics would agree what questions it is natural for her to ask on her first interview with a man metastasio makes her say  che vuoi da me un uom sei dunque andiamo insieme ah troppo ron trattenerli etc and these little touches so differently do we judge in england were thought abroad to be delicate strokes of the most elegant simplicity  he could wish it had been universally understood that it was not a tragedy he offered to the public but a dramatic poem that is to say a piece with some interesting situations to engage the affections but which affords more room for a picturesque imagination to display itself than is generally allowed to the more important concerns of real tragedy where the distress should be always increasing where the passions should be always rising to fuller and stronger emotions and where of course the poet ought not to find leisure for imagery and description had this been felt and acknowledged no body would have looked for another kind of entertainment than was promised and the smiles arising from sylvias dread of a man on the first discovery of him and her gradual attachment to him in compliance with natural instinct would never have been judged inconsistent with the color of the whole but if the author of the desert island has erred in this he has the consolation of having erred with the greatest poet now in europe  as many of the malevolent writers of the age have heretofore honored the author with their abuse and as he was apprehensive that they still remained under the oppression of their dullness and obscurity it was deemed proper to call them forth into daylight by exhibiting one general representative of them all on the stage for this he returns his thanks to the author of the prologue and if any needy booksellers or unhappy authors can find their account in taking further liberties with him he hereby declares he should be sorry not to have merit enough to provoke some of them and for their encouragement he adds in the words of the noble author of the characteristics that he will never reply unless he should hear of them or their works in any good company a twelvemonth after  lincolns inn jan       0 the author  prologue written and spoken

wild with joy  oh such an incident   constantia what incident my sweet   sylvia my little fawn my dear my loveliest fawn  for many days whose loss i have mourned for whose dear sake i have left no corner of the isle unsearchd  this moment over the dewspangled lawn with printless feet came bounding to me playful friskd about with inexpressive airs of glad surprise with eager signs of transport  big round tears stood trembling in his eye and seemed to speak his fond regret still mingling with his joy  constantia and is it that my love delights thee so    sylvia and can you wonder maam  yes that delights me transports me charms me  he is my darling care my dear companion my sweet little friend that loves me gambols round me watches still with anxious tenderness my every motion pants on my bosom leaps into my arms and wanders over me with a thousand kisses before this time he never once strayed from me  i thought i lost him  but he is found again and can you wonder i am transported thus  constantia oh happy state of innocence  how sweet thy joys simplicity ever yet the mind with artificial passions learns to glow ere taste has taken our senses to her school has given each wellbred appetite her laws taught us to feel imaginary bliss or elss expire in elegance of pain  sylvia nay now again youre growing grave  it is you give laws to appetite  forbid each sense to minister delight your eyes are dimmed with constant tears  the roses on your cheek fade like yon violets when excessive dews have bent their drooping melancholy heads soon they repair their graces soon recall their aromatic lives and smiling yield to sighing zephyr all their balmy sweets to grief youre still a prey still wan despair sits withering at your heart and every feature has your directions to be fixed in woe nay prythee now clear up  you make me sad   will you mama forget your cares   constantia forget  oh sweet oblivion thy allhealing balm to wretches you refuse  can i forget perfidious ferdinand  his tyrant form is ever present  the deluding looks endearing accents and the soft regards with which he led me to yon mossclad cave there to repose awhile  oh cruel man and you ye conscious wilds i call you false accomplices in guilt  the zephyrs bland that pant upon each leaf  the melody that warbles through your groves the falling fountains that at each deepning cadence lull the mind were all suborned against me all conspired to wrap me in the silken folds of sleep sudden i wake  where where is ferdinand i rave i shriek  no ferdinand replies  frantic i rove through all your winding glades  i seek the shore  no ferdinand appears  i climb yon craggy steeps i see the ship unfurling all her sails  i call aloud i stamp cry out  deaf as the roaring sea he catches every gale that blows from heaven and cleaves his liquid way   sylvia why will you thus recall your past afflictions   constantia ah what then thou wretched constance what were then thy feelings i rend my tresses  beat my breast in vain in vain stretch out these ineffectual arms pierce with my frantic cries the wounded air dash my bare bosom on the flinty rock then rise again and strain my aching sight to see the ship still lessening to my view and take the last last glimpse as far far off in the horizons verge she dwindles still grows a dim speck and mixes with the clouds just vanishing  just lost  ah seen no more  sylvia i prythee dont talk so  my heart dies in me  why will not you strive a little to forget this melancholy theme  the twilight gray of morn but faintly streaks the east the stars still glimmer through the whitning air the groves are mute yon alldevouring deep lies hushed the tuneful birds and the whole brute creation still sink in soft oblivious slumber wrapped forgetful of their cares  all  all but you know some repose  you pass the dreary night in tears and ceaseless grief then rising wild anticipate the dawn and here resume your doleful task or else ascend the height of yonder promontory there forlorn you sit and hear the brawling waves beneath lash the resounding shore your brimful eye still fixed on that sad quarter of the heavens where my hard father disappeared  constantia yes there my melancholy loves to dwell there loves to sit and pine over its hoard of grief to roll these eyes over all the sullen main in hopes some sail may this way shape its course with tidings of the human race  oh heavens could i behold that dear that wished for sight could i but see some vestiges of man some mark of social life even though the ship should shun this isle and court propitious gales beneath some happier clime yet still the view would cheer my soul and my heart bound with joy at that faint prospect of my fellow creatures but not for me such transport  not for me  dear native land i now no more must see thee condemned in everduring solitude to mourn from thy sweet joys society debarred  sylvia but to your happiness what is wanting here full many a time i have heard you praise the arts the polished manners and gay scenes of bliss which europe yields  yet ever and anon i from your own discourse can gather too that happiness is all unknown to europe that envy there can dwell and discontent the smile that wakens at anothers woe the heart that sickens at anothers praise the tongue that carries the malignant tale the little spirit that subverts a friend fraud perfidy ingratitude and murder now sure with reason i prefer these scenes of innocence tranquillity and joy  constantia alas my child it is easy to forego unknown delights  pleasures we have never felt   sylvia are we not here what you yourself have told me in europe sovereigns are  here we have fixed our little sylvan reign  the guileless race of animals that roam the lawns and woods are tractable and willing subjects  pay passive obedience to us  and yon sea becomes our tributary hither rolls in each hoarsemurmring tide his various stores of daintiest shellfish  the unbidden earth of human toil all ignorant pours forth whatever to the eye or taste can prove rare exquisite and good  at once the spring calls forth its green delights and summers blush glows on each purple branch the seasons here on the same tree with glad surprise behold each others gifts arise spontaneous fruits around us grow for ever here the zephyrs blow shrubs ever flowring shades embowring heavenly spots cooling grots verdant mountains falling fountains pure limpid rills adown the hills that wind their way and over the meadows play enamored of the enchanted ground  constantia what is this waste of beauty all these charms of cold inanimate unconscious nature without the social sense those joys my sylvia thou can not miss for thou have never known em  sylvia but still those beauteous tracts of europe which you so much regret are full of men and men you know are animals of prey i am sure that you yourself have told me so a thousand times   constantia and if i have my child i told a dismal truth  oh they are false inexorable cruel fell deceivers their unrelenting hearts no harbor know for honor truth humanity or love  sylvia well then in this lone isle this dear retreat from them at least we are free   constantia poor innocent i cannot but grieve for her  bursts into tears aside sylvia why fall afresh those drops of sorrow  pray you now give over   constantia my heart will break  i do not grieve my child  i cannot conceal my tears  they must have way   sylvia nay if you love me sure you will not thus make my heart ache within me   constantia no my sweet  i will not weep  all will be well my love  oh misery  i cannot  i cannot contain  the black ingratitude  weeps sylvia say is there aught that i can do mama to give you comfort  if there is tell me  shall i fetch my fawn dry up your tears and he is yours this moment  i will run and bring him to you   constantia sylvia no   sylvia nay do mama  i beg you will  you shall exit constantia alone alas i fear my brain will turn  the sun full sixteen times has made his annual course since here i have dragged a miserable being the victim of despair which long ever now to phrenzy kindling must have forced me dash my brain in madness on yon flinty rocks and end my pangs at once if the keen instinct of strong maternal love had not restrained my wild disordered soul and bade me live to watch her tender infancy to rear her blooming years with fond delighted care to tend each blossom of her growing mind and see light gradual dawning on her soul and yet to see her thus  to see her here cut off from every social bliss condemned like some fair flower that in a desert grows to breathe its sweets into the passing wind and waste its bloom all unperceived away it is enough to break a mothers heart let me not think on it  let me shun that thought sits down and sings i what though his guilt my heart has torn yet lovely is his mien his eyes mildopning as the morn round him each grace is seen but oh ye nymphs your loves never let him win for oh deceit and falsehood dwell within  ii from his red lip his accents stole soft as kind vernal snows melting they came and in the soul desire and joy arose but oh ye nymphs never listen to his art for oh base falsehood rankles in his heart  iii he left me in this lonely state he fled and left me here another ariadnes fate to mourn the livelong year he fled  but oh what pains the heart must prove when we reveal the crimes of him we love  reenter sylvia sylvia i cannot bring him now  in yonder stream that through its pebbled channel glides along softmurmring to the sea he stands to cool his beauteous form in the pure limpid rill but still he shall be yours   constantia to thee my child to thee he causes joy  but joy to me there is nothing now can bring  left by my husband by the false barbarous man   sylvia and yet this man you still regret mdash you must excuse me now  i vow i cannot but think midst all your grief all your reproaches your complaints against him that still this man this cruel fell deceiver has found  i know not why  within your breast some tender advocate to plead his cause  constantia no sylvia no my love is turned to hate   sylvia then dry your sorrows and this day begin a happier train of years  and lo the sun emerges from the sea  he lists his orb above the purpled main and streams abroad his golden fluid over the world  the birds exulting wake their notes  all things rejoice and hills and groves and rocks and valleys smile let me entreat you then forget your cares and share the general bliss  the sun is seen to rise at a distance as it were out of the sea constantia once more all hail thou radiant power who in your bright career or rising or descending have beheld my neverceasing woe  again thou climbst in orient glory and recallst the cares and toils of man and beast  but oh in all your flaming course your beams will never light upon a wretch so lost so cursed as i am  sylvia and yet my mother    constantia mine are pangs my child strokes of adversity no time can cure no lenient arts can soften or assuage but i will not grieve thee sylvia  i will retire to some sequestered haunt  there all forlorn i will sit and wear myself away in thought  exit sylvia alone alas how obstinately bent on grief is her whole mind  the votarist of care in vain i try to soften her afflictions and with each art beguile her from her woe i chide entreat caress and all in vain and what to me seems strange perverse and wondrous the more i strive the more her sorrows swell her tears the faster fall fall down her cheek in streams so copious and such bitter anguish that i myself at length i know not how catch the soft weakness and oerpowrd with grief flow all dissolving in unbidden tears assist her heaven  her heart will break at last  i tremble at the thought  i will follow straight and still implore beseech try evry way to reconcile her to herself and me but see look yonder what a sight is there what can it mean that huge enormous mass that moves upon the bosom of the deep  a floating mountain  no  a mountain never could change its place  for such a monstrous bulk how light it urges on its way  how quick how rapid in its course  what can it be   i will towered the shore and from the pointed rock that juts into the waves at leisure view this wondrous sight and what it is explore  end of the first act act ii scene another view of the island with an opening to the sea between several hills and rocks  enter sylvia sylvia still i behold it  still it glides along through the tumultuous sea  and lo before it the waves divide and now they close again leaving a tract of angry foam behind it must be sure some monster of the deep for see  upon its huge broad back it bears expanded wings that spreading to the wind lie broad incumbent over the surge beneath   ah save me save me  what new forms appear what shapes of unknown being rise before me from yon huge monsters side they issue forth and bolt upon the shore  behold they stop and now with eager disconcerted pace precipitate rush forward on the isle  now amongst the rocks they wind their silent way ferdinand and henrico appear protect me heaven defend me shield me  ah hide me ye woods within your deep recess never may these monsters penetrate your haunts never trace my footsteps through your darksome ways behind the covert of this woodbine bower oh let me rest concealed  she retires ferdinand and henrico come forward henrico no trace appears no vestige here is seen of human kind it is drear it is waste and unfrequented all and hark  what noise  from yonder toiling deep how dreadful sounds the pealing roar  my friend my valued ferdinand twere best retire this cannot be the place   ferdinand oh my henrico this is the fatal shore  the wellknown scene yon bay yon rocks yon mountains from whose brows the imbowring forest overhangs the deep each wellrememberd object strikes my view answers the image in my mind preserved engraven there by loves recordinghand and never but with life to fade from thence  henrico and yet thy loveenfeebled soul may form imaginary tokens of resemblance this soil unbeaten seems by mortal step  ferdinand no my henrico no  this is the spot  my heart in every pulse confirms it to me this is the place the very place where fate began to weave the tissue of my woes oh i was cursed abhorred of heaven or else i never had trusted the contentious waves but kept my store of happiness at home  henrico repine not for an action that arose from filial piety  a fathers mandate required obedience from you   ferdinand to his summons i paid a glad attention  yet good heaven why in that early era of my bliss should then his orders come to dash my joys  oh i was blessed with all that rarest beauty with all that every venus of the mind the tender heart and the enlivened wit could pour delightful on the raptured sense of the young bridegroom whose admiring eyes still hung enamored on her every charm and thence drank long inspiring draughts of love unsated still  still kindling at the view  henrico thy fate indeed was hard   ferdinand heaven knows it was  each soft desire each joy refined was mine  the hours soft glided by and as they passed scattered new blessings from their balmy wings they saw our ever new delight they saw a blooming offspring crown our mutual loves the mothers features and her every grace in this our daughter exquisitely traced but to be torn from that supreme of bliss  my wife  constantia  and my beauteous babe here to be left on this untravelld isle to pine in bitterness of want  their bed the cold bare earth while the inclement winds from yonder main came howling round their heads until at length the friendly hand of death in pity threw his shroud upon their woes  henrico too sure i fear they are lost   ferdinand perhaps my friend perhaps when gasping in the pangs of death   when every beauty faded from her cheek  and her eye languishd motionless and dim perhaps even then in that sad dismal hour my name still hovered on her quivering lips and naught but death could tear me from her heart  henrico her tenderest thoughts no doubt were fixed on thee  ferdinand her tenderest thoughts oh no  her utmost rage  who knows henrico but she deemed me false deemed me a vile deserter from her arms she did  she must  each strong appearance joined to mark me guilty  oh that thought strikes deep it is scorpion stings into my very heart could she but think me so refined in guilt so exquisite a villain as to cause a moments anguish in that tender breast where all the loves where all the virtues dwelt  twere misery  twere torture in the extreme  and yet she thought me such  by heaven she did  accused me of the worst the blackest treason of treason to my love  stung with the idea she roamd this isle and to these desert wilds poured forth her lamentable tale  who knows but on some craggy cliff whole nights she sat raving in madness to the moons pale gleam until at length all kindling into phrenzy clasping her infant closer to her breast with desperation wild from off the rock headlong she plunged into the roaring waves while her last accents murmured faithless ferdinand  henrico distract not thus your soul with fancied woes she could not think thee faithless thee whose mind whose every virtue were so well approved  ferdinand still will i hope she did not  oh she knew i made that voyage in duty to a father a while we steered a happy course until beneath the burning line from whence the sun in straight direction pours his ardent blaze on every feverd sense a storm arose sudden and wild as if a war of nature were thundering over our heads  full twenty days it drove us headlong on the dashing surge far from our destined way until at length in evil hour we landed on this isle  sylvia returns and peeps from behind a hedge sylvia methought i heard a sound as if they both held mutual converse  yonder lo they stand  they do not follow me  what can they be   ferdinand there is the spot just where yon aged tree imbrowns the plain beneath on which the villains the unrelenting band of pirates seized me  there i received my wound and there i fought till my sword shivered in my hand  worn out oppressed by numbers powrless and disarmed they bore me headlong to the beach in vain piercing the air with horrid cries in vain back towrd the cave where poor constantia slept with her loved infant daughter in her arms straining my ardent eyes  my eyes alone for oh their cruelty had bound my arms and tears and looks were all i then could use  sylvia the voice but indistinctly strikes my ear would they would turn this way   ferdinand fettered tied down they dragged me to the vessel  bore me hence  in vain our ship pursued  in vain gave chase  formed with detested skill the guilty bark in which they plunged me gliding oer the main outstrippd their tardy course  they steered away far to their regions of accursed bondage far from constantia far from every joy a doting husband and delighted father feels in mixed rapture with his wife and child oh i could pour my plaints  but i will not wound thy ear my friend with further lamentation  henrico would heaven i could remove the cause   ferdinand alas that cannot be  thou can not bid return the irrevocable flight of time recall the moments of our young delight annul and render void what once the hand of fate has from it is stores of woe poured down upon me  sylvia half concealed why will they stand with looks averted thus i long to see their countenance and mein  ferdinand but yet thou best of friends yet grant me this assist my search  oh let me roam around this fatal shore  the isles circumference circles a scanty space  we cannot lose each other here  do thou pursue that path that leads due east  this way i will bend my course  henrico by heaven there is no task of hardihood of toil or danger but i will try for thee for thee my friend  to thee i owe my life and that more precious boon my liberty thou have released me from the galling chain from slavrys bitter pressure  twas thy skill that formed the plan of freedom seized the vessel and made your friends the partners of your flight  for thee i will roam around  but oh i fear our search will prove in vain   ferdinand too sure it will  and yet it is the doom of love like mine to dwell for ever on the sad idea of the dear object lost to visit often a lonely pilgrim every well known scene each haunted glade where the loved object strayed to call each circumstance of passed delight back to the soul in fond excursions seek the dear lamented shade  then oh my friend then let me taste that sad that pensive comfort range through these wilds ascend each craggy steep try in each grotto in each gloomy cave if happily there remain some vestige of constantia exit henrico on yonder beach well meet again  farewell   sylvia conceal thee sylvia  ah  it comes this way  then let me seek the covert of the woods where nods the brownest horror there lie safe from the unusual sight of these strange beings exit henrico solus how cruel is my friends condition  doomed for ever to regret yet never find the object of his soul  his early love he lavished all on her  with her it goes to the dank grave and leaves him hapless here to die a lingering death  yet still i will try bv every office friendship can perform to heal the wound that preys upon his life exit the back scene closes and presents a thick wood then enter sylvia sylvia what have my eyes beheld  my fluttering heart beats quick in stange emotions  from yon grove of tufted trees i saw this nameless being walk over the russet heath  it is face appeared confessed to view  it cannot be a man  no lines of cruelty deformed his visage  were it a man his untamed savage soul would strongly speak in each distorted feature  this was all pleasing amiable and mild a gentle sorrow brightning into smiles such as bespoke a calm yet feeling spirit sat on its peaceful brow and oer it threw a gentle gleam of sweetness and of pain  it cannot be a woman neither  no  the dress accords not with that mode which often my mother has described  whatever it be attraction dwells about it winning smiles assuasive airs of tenderness and joy i will seek my mother  she perhaps may know these forms to me unusual  by this row of darksome pines my steps all unperceived may gain the place where with assiduous hand she works and teaches the rude rocks to tell her mournful elegy  what mean my feet  why stand they thus forgetful of their office  why heaves the involuntary sigh  and why thus in quick pulses beats my heart  my eyes a misty dimness covers  in my ears strange murmurs sound  my very breath is lost  what can it be  i know thee fear  it is thou that causest this  and yet it cannot be fear  fear cannot thrill with pleasure through the veins knows not this dubious joy  these grateful tremblings  i cannot guess what these emotions mean nor what this busy thing my heart would want let me seek shelter in my mothers arms exit scene changes to the first view of the island where constantias inscription is seen enter ferdinand ferdinand no  never more shall these fond eyes behold her lost lost my poor constantia lost  in vain i search these gloomy woods  in vain call out her honored name to every hill and dale my eyes are false or on the craggy base of yonder rock some instrument appears the mark of human kind  takes it up a broken sword oh all ye heavenly powers  the very same  this once was mine  unfaithful to it is trust it failed me at my utmost need  i see the well known characters the very words that formed it is motto  it is it is the same  oh were constantia found  what do i see all over with hair the flinty rock bestrewd  these were her decent tresses  these in anguish she tore relentless from her beauteous head up by the roots

breathing statue midst these shapeless piles   ferdinand henrico there  read there   henrico letters engraved  he reads to himself as far as she ended her deplorable life alas my friend  they gaze speechless at each other for some time then ferdinand falls the storm of grief oerpowrs his feeble spirits now rouse thy strength my ferdinand and bear this load of sorrow like a man   ferdinand i do

look there  there stands the black the horrid roll of guilt denounced against me lo the dread characters  let me peruse the whole sad record of this bitter woe still deeper drink and gorge me with affliction he reads friend whoever thou art pity my wrongs but against my husband for love like mine cannot forget where once with delight it fixed i charge you never meditate r  revenge she meant to say  the words begun  but death untimely stopped her hand  oh misery she thought me false and yet could love still  the wound now pierces deeper  had she loathed me abhorred me cursed me twere not half the torture this angelgoodness causes  and to lose her to lose a mind like here is that thus could pour such unexampled tenderness and love amidst the keenest anguish  on the earth measure thy length thou wretch accursed  there lie for ever lie and to these woods and wilds howl out thy griefs in madness and despair  henrico i feel i feel thy sorrows  oh my friend  cruel event  your tears alas are just  then let them flow and let me mingle mine  your gushing sorrows may assuage your grief this storm of rage attempring into peace  ferdinand who talks of peace  let phrenzy seize my brain  come moonstruck madness with thy glaring eye and clanking chain come shoot thy kindling fires into my inmost soul  blast every thinking power raze each idea out  tear up at once the seat of memory  no  leave me that  still leave me memory to picture forth constantias lovely form that i may sit with unclad sides upon some blasted heath and gloat upon her image  see her still see her whole days with fancys gushing eye and gaze on that alone   henrico arise my friend and quit this fatal shore   ferdinand and quit this shore but whither turn  ah whither shall i go  where shelter me from misery  this isle shall be my journeys bound   henrico what can thou mean  ferdinand never again to draw the vital air but where my love expired  to feed my soul with these sad objects this sepulchral tale even to the height of yet unheard of anguish to print my pious kisses on the rocks to bathe the ground which her dear footsteps pressed with the incessant tears of burning anguish to make these wilds all vocal with her name till this cold lifeless tongue shall move no more  henrico by heaven you must not think   ferdinand farewell  farewell  consult thy happiness  for ever here by fate i am doomed to stay  alas constantia  to perish with thy infant here  no friend to close thy ghastly orbs  thy pale remains on the bare earth exposed without the tribute of a fond husbands tears over thy dead corse  without the last sad obsequies  yet here i still will raise an empty sepulcher there shall no cold unconscious marble form in mockery of imitated woe bend oer the fancied urn myself will be the sad the pensive monumental figure distilling real anguish over the tomb till wasting by degrees i moulder down and sink to silent durst   henrico what man could do already youve performed   ferdinand prithee no more  i will about it straight  this place affords materials for the work  thither i will bring whatever can deck the scene  constantia yes i will appease thy discontented shade then follow thee to yonder realms of bliss exit henrico solus his vehemence of grief bears down his reason he must not linger here  his stay were fatal  force will be necessary  to our boat i will hasten back and call some trusty friends to drag him from this melancholy shore  end of the second act act iii the same scene continues enter sylvia through the befriending gloom os arching bowers through walks where never sunbeam pierced at length i have gained this deepencircled vale  ah me i feel strange tremors still  she is not here  mama  where can she be  her mournful task waits for her lingering hand  my dearest mother  she answers not  what noise is that  methought i heard some steps advancing  it is my fawn that rustles through the forest glade  he stops and looks then runs and stops again to take a fearful gaze  he too perhaps has seen these unknown beings  yonder lo he stands in mute expressive wonder  heaven protect me  through this close path that gradual winding leads on to plains to woods and verdant lawns embosomd in the rock i will journey up  the day now glows intense but by the rills that through embowring groves come purling down i often can lay me and enjoy each breeze that plays amid those craggy scenes  a noise from yonder interwoven branches  ha  ye guardian angels save me  see see there  that thing again   enter henrico henrico what beauteous form in these forlorn abodes attracts my wondering eyes   sylvia ye heavenly powers retiring from him henrico it swims before my fight  whatever thou art virgin or goddess  oh a goddess sure  thou goddess of these mansions  for thy looks beam heavenly radiance with propitious ears accept my supplication   sylvia ha  it speaks  it speaks  what do thou mean   henrico oh say what place what clime is this  and what art thou that thus adornst this lonely mansion   sylvia will you first promise to come no nearer  henrico with devotion as true as ever pilgrim offered up in holy fervor to his saint  i promise  sylvia how gentle it is demeanor  tell me now what thing thou art  henrico one born to misery  a man whom fate   sylvia a man  art thou a man  henrico i am   sylvia oh heavens  a man  protect me  save me  runs away henrico nay fly me not  a sudden impulse here bids me pursue  forgive thou unknown fair that with soft violence i thus presume to force thee measure back thy steps again he brings her back sylvia force me not thus inhuman barbarous man  what have i said  oh worthy generous man thus on my knees i beg  have mercy on me   i never did you harm  indeed i did not   henrico arise raises her thou lovely tenant of these woods and let me thus  thus as befits the man whose mind runs over with rapture and surprise whose heart throbs wild with mingled doubt and joy thus let me worship this celestal form this heavenly brightness to my wondering eyes that sheds such influence as when an angel breaks through a flood of glory to the sight of some expiring saint and cheers his soul with visions of disclosing heaven  sylvia he kneels  he kneels to me  how mild his very look  how soft each word  are you indeed a man   henrico i am sweet saint  and one whose heart is prone to melt at each idea beauty prints on his delighted sense and sure such beauty touched by the hand of harmony adorned with inexpresive graces well may claim my lowliest adoration and my love  sylvia this language all is new  but still it has i know not what of charming in it that gains upon die listening ear  if this be falsehood  then falsehood can assume a pleasing look  henrico why those averted eyes  sylvia what would you have  henrico oh if thou art as gracious as you are fair say have you seen constantia when and where and how did she expire   sylvia constantia lives  why did thou say expire  my mother lives lives in these blessed abodes   henrico ah gentle sylvia  so i will call thee  daughter of constantia oh fly and find her out  mean time i will seek the afflicted ferdinand   sylvia what do thou say  can he can ferdinand be here  that false perfidious barbarous man  can he be here  henrico he is my fair nor barbarous nor false fortune that made him wretched could no more anon you will know the whole to waste a moment in confrence now and longer to suspend the meeting of this pair who now in agony bemoan their lot were barbarous indeed  sylvia but may i trust him will not he do her harm  henrico he will not my beauteous fair   sylvia is he like you   henrico his goodness far transcends me   sylvia then i think i will venture to comply  let us go together   henrico oh i could tend thy steps for ever hear soft accents warbling from thy vermeil lip watch thy mildglancing eye behold how grace whatever you do which ever way you bend guides each harmonious movement but this hour is friendships due then let us instant fly through different paths  thou to seek out constantia and i to find her husband  happily so their meeting will be speedier  farewell i will bring him to this very spot  adieu for a short interval adieu my love  sylvia farewell  another word  pray what is your name  henrico fair excellence henrico i am called  sylvia pray do not tarry long henrico   henrico why that pleasing charge my sweet  sylvia i cannot tell but as youre leaving me each step you move my spirits sink a melancholy gloom darkens the scene around and i methinks helpless in solitude am left again to wander all alone a dreary way  henrico oh i will come again thou angel sweetness yes i will come and at that lovely shrine pour out my adoration and my vows yes i will come to part from thee no more a moment now farewell  exit sylvia alone farewell  be sure you keep your word  he is gone and yet is with me still  absent i hear and see him in his absence  still his looks beam with mild dignity and still his voice sounds in my ear delightful  what it means this newborn sense this wonderful emotion unfelt till now and mixed of pain and joy i cannot guess  how my heart flutters in me i will not perplex myself with vain conjecture whatever the cause the effect i feel is pleasing constantia is heard singing within the scenes oh heavens what noise  it is my mothers voice again she pours her melancholy forth as sweetly plaintive as when sad philomel beneath some poplar shade bemoans her young and sitting pensive on the lonely bough her eye with sorrow dimmed she tunes her dirge warbling the night away while all around the vocal woodland and each hill and dale ring with her griefs harmonious  hark  that way it sounds  all gracious powrs direct me to her exit a short song is heard within the scenes then enter constantia constantia from walk to walk from glade to glade over all the seagirt isle over every mountains top i roam from place to place but oh no place affords relief to me  the sun now leads the sultry hours and from his burning ray each living thing retires yet i endure his fiercest rage the fever in my mind heeds not external circumstance and time witholds his medicinal aid  the trees and rocks themselves his powerful influence own  all but my grief  that each succeeding day sees in my heart fresh bleeding as at first delay not thus ye cruel fates but come and wrap me in eternal rest  till then let me pursue my melancholy task works at the inscription enter ferdinand ferdinand away with their illtimed officious care i will none of it  it is cruelty not friendship  it is misery protracted it is with art inhuman art to lengthen out the life of him who groans in torment  no  they never shall compel me back to a base world again   i have lived enough  my course is ended here  for here constantia lies  ye heavenly powers what means upon yon consecrated ground that visionary form with lifted arm and gleaming steel that seems in act to carve the ragged stone   constantia what is it i hear  a voice a groan  from whence  ha seeing ferdinand ferdinand it is it is her ghost her discontented sade that hovers still about this place  constantia avaunt thou airdrawn shape of that perfidious  ah she faints away ferdinand leave me not thus  oh ever gracious ever gentle say  it is gone  in sullen silence gone enter henrico henrico quick let me find him to his raptured ear laying hold of ferdinand give the delightful tidings  ha  ferdinand and thus i sink at once and follow my beloved falls into henricos arms henrico he faints  he faints  the chilling dews of death distill through every pore  my ferdinand awake arise and hear the joyful sounds of happiness restored  his eyes unfold to seek fair day light and now close again as if they sickend at the view   ferdinand forbear and let me die   henrico constantia lives  she lives once more to fold thee in her warm embrace  ferdinand i saw her fleeting ghost  sullen and pale it vanished from my sight   constantia haunt me not thus thou cruel tyrant form  coming to herself henrico whence is that voice oh heavens  constantia there  she too entranced lies stretched upon the ground   ferdinand where is constantia oh let me fly to her embrace  it is she  it is my wife  it is constantia  still  oh ecstasy of bliss  she still survives   constantia it is mere illusion all  the false creation of some deceitful dream   ferdinand it is real all  again i fold her thus  the known embrace has thrilled it is wonted transport to my heart my life my soul thy ferdinand is come  constantia and come thou then inhuman as thou art come thou again to wreak thy falsehood on me  ferdinand by heaven i never was false  dash not my joys with thy unkind suspicion of my love while thus transported far above the lot of human bliss i press my lips to thine inhaling balmy sweets and all my soul runs over with joy with wonder and delight  constantia did thou not meanly leave me here a prey  ferdinand and can constantia deem me then so base can she believe me such a vile betrayer  can thou   constantia on this unhospitable shore left as i was   ferdinand oh misery  thou wert while i was dragged by an insidious band of pirates savage bloodhounds into bondage but witness heaven  witness ye midnight hours that heard my ceaseless groans how her dear image grew to my very heart  constantia and have thou then been doomed to slavery  ferdinand i have  constantia and groaned this long long time beneath oppressions hand  ferdinand ever since these eyes have gazed delighted on thee the bitter draught of misery was mine  constantia and were thou true indeed  ferdinand by heaven i was  constantia and have i then accused thee  have i poured a thousand strong complaints against thee  called high judging heaven to witness to my wrongs told all these wilds these rocks these woodcrownd hills of injured truth and violated love falsely i talked unjustly i complained of injured truth and violated love my ferdinand was true  again it is given with his loved form to glad these eyes to rush with eager transport to his fond embrace to cling around his neck and growing to him pour the warm tears of rapture and of love they embrace enter sylvia sylvia i heard my mothers voice  what do i see in a mans arms  embracing and embraced  ferdinand is that my sylvia  oh it must be

father did not leave me sylvia  no  he could not prove deliberately false his heart was unsusceptible of fraud   anon you will know it all   henrico mean time my fair banish thy fears and let me with this kiss on the white softness of this lovely hand for ever dedicate my heart  sylvia oh heavens what must i do mama   constantia requite his love with fair return of thine   sylvia must i do so the

glad consent shall own thy rival claim and every youth touched by the graces of thy native beauty shall join to make thy form the public care  sylvia i cannot quit this island  cannot leave these woods these lawns these hills and deepning vales these streams oftvisited each well known haunt where hand in hand with innocence i have strayed and tasted joys serene as in the air that pants upon yon trembling leaves   ferdinand such joys for thee shall blossom in thy native land and new delights arise there cultured fields wave with the golden harvest commerce pours each delicacy forth there stately domes attract the wondering eye there cities swarm with busy throngs intense and smiles around a scene of active cheerful social life thither i will lead thee sweet   sylvia and yet my heart misgives me much  does not contention there and civil discord render life a scene of care and toil and struggle  does not war from foreign nations often invade the land with all his train of misery and death  ferdinand thy lovely fears are groundless  ours the land where inward peace diffuses smiles around and scatters wide her blessings  there a king  my friend comes later thence and tells me all there reigns a happy venerable king dispensing justice and maintaining laws that bind alike his people and himself from that scource liberty and every claim a freeborn people boast flow equal on and harmonize the state while in the eve and calm decline of life our monarch sees a royal grandson still to higher luster each day expanding emulous to trace his grandsires steps to copy out his actions and bid the ray of freedom onward stretch to ages yet unborn  sylvia and do the people know their own happiness  ferdinand they do my sweet pleased they behold their native rights secured their commerce guarded and the useful arts that raise that soften and embellish life all to perfection rising with a sense of their own blessing touched with one consent they pour their treasures and exhaust their blood in their kings righteous cause and albion thus raises her envied head thus every threat of foreign force each menace of invasion from a vain vanquished disappointed foe like broken billows on her craggy cliffs shall murmur at her feet in vain   sylvia methinks i long to see this place   ferdinand my sylvia yes thou shall return  propitious gales invite  come then constantia  oh what mixed emotions heave in this bosom at the sight of thee   constantia i too run over with ecstacy of joy and tears must speak my happiness  i long to utter all my fond fond thoughts  to tell the story of my woes and hear of thine while at each word our hearts shall melt within us and thrill with gries with tenderness and love  ferdinand the tale shall serve us in our future hours of tender intercourse to sweeten pain to calm adversity and teach our souls to bend in love in gratitude and praise to the allgood on high who thus befriends the cause of innocence who thus rewards our suffering constancy whose hand though slow thus leads to rapture through a train of woe  finis
