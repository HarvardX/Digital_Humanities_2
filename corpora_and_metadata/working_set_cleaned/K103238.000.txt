calculations to determine at what point in the side of a hill its attraction will be the greatest etc  by charles hutton ll d and f r s  read at the royal society nov          london printed by j nichols successor to mr bowyer  m dcc lxxx  calculations etc to nevil maskelyne d d f r s and astronomer royal royal military acad sept         dear sir as the experiment of determining the universal attraction of matter which you lately conducted with so much accuracy and success is of so great importance and curiosity that it may probably be hereafter repeated by the learned in other countries and in other situations and as the utmost precision is desirable in so nice an experiment i have composed the enclosed paper to determine the best part of a hill for making the observations so as to obtain the greatest quantity of attraction  i have no doubt sir that the determination of this point will appear of some consequence in the opinion of one who has the improvement of useful knowledge so much at heart and if the manner in which it is here made meet your approbation i shall desire the favor of your presenting it to the royal society  i have the honor to be etc    the great success of the experiment lately made by the royal society on the hill schehallien to determine the universal attraction of matter and the important consequences that have resulted from it may probably give occasion to other experiments of the same kind to be made elsewhere and as all possible means of accuracy and facility are to be desired in so delicate and laborious an undertaking it has occurred to me that it might not be unuseful to add by way of supplement to my paper of calculations relative to the abovementioned experiment an investigation of the height above the bottom of a hill at which its horizontal attraction shall be the greatest since that is the height at which commonly the observations ought to be made and since this best point of observation has never been any where determined that i know of but has been variously spoken of or guessed at it being sometimes accounted at and sometimes at of the height of the hill whereas from these investigations it is found to be generally at about only of the altitude from the bottom    let abceda be part of a cuneus of matter its sides or faces being the two similar rightangled triangles abc ade meeting in the point a and forming the indefinitely small angle bad then of any section bced perpendicular to the planes abd and ade the attraction on a body at a in the direction ab is equal to the constant quantity s s where s  sin bac and s  sin bad to the radius    diagram  for first since the magnitude of the flowing section is every where as a b  and the attraction of the particles of matter inversely as the same or as  a b  therefore their product or a b a b  or   a constant quantity is as the force of attraction of bced  then to find what that quantity is put ab  a and bc  x then bd or ce the distance between the two planes at the distance ab is  as now the force of a particle in the line ce is as  ac  in the direction ac and therefore it is as ab  ac  in the direction ab consequently the force of the whole lineola ce in the direction ab is abce  ac  and therefore the fluxion of the force of the section bced or f is  and the fluent gives  for the attraction itself    to find now the attraction of the whole rightangled cuneus on a body at a in the direction ab  since the force of each section is s s by the last article therefore the force of all the sections the number of them being ab or a is ass  s ab bc  ac the force of the whole cuneus abceda  diagram    to find the attraction of the rectangular part abcd on a in the direction ab abcd being one side of the cuneus and ad its edge  put ad  bc  b and ab  x then the force of any section as bc being always as s s by art   the fluxion of the force or f will be  and the fluent is  the attraction of abcd  diagram    to find the attraction of the rightangled part bcd of a cuneus whose edge passes through a the place of the body attracted  put ab  a bc  b bd  c da  d  a  c dc  e ac  g and dp  x then the force of any section pq being still as s s the fluxion of the force of the part dpq is  and the correct fluent when x  c is  the force of a body at a in the direction ab  diagram    to find the attraction of the rightangled part bcd on the point a  using here again the same notation as in the last article we have  the correct fluent of which when x  c is     to apply now these premises to the finding of the place where the attraction of a hill is greatest it will be necessary to suppose the hill to have some certain figure that position is most convenient for observing the attraction in which the hill is most extended in the east and west direction supposing then such a position of a hill and that it is also of a uniform height and meridional section throughout the point of observation must evidently be equally distant from the two ends but instead of being only considerably extended i shall suppose the hill to be indefinitely extended to the east and to the west of the point of observation in order that the investigation may be mathematically true and yet at the same time sufficiently exact for the beforesaid limited extent also it will also come nearest to the practical experiment to suppose the hill to be a long triangular prism so that all its meridional sections may be similar triangles let therefore the triangle abc represent its section by a vertical plane passing through the meridian or one side of an indefinitely thin cuneus whose edge is in pg or rather pbcgp the side of one cuneus and page the side of another their common edge being the line pg perpendicular to the base ac p being the required point in the side ab where the attraction of the section abc  indefinitely thin cuneus shall be greatest in a direction parallel to the horizon ac and then from the foregoing suppositions it is evident that in whatever point of ab the attraction of abc is greatest there also will the attraction of the whole hill be the greatest  diagram    now draw hpdef parallel to ac and ah pg by cf perpendicular to the same then it is evident that at the point p in the direction pf the attraction of pbcgp is affirmative and that of page negative but pbcgp is  pbd  bde  pfcg  efc and page  phag  pha therefore the attractions of pbd bde pfcg pha are affirmative and those of efc phag negative  put now by  a ai  b ic  c ab  d bc  e ac  g  b  c and pg  x the altitude of the point p above the bottom also let s  the sine of the indefinitely small angle of the cuneus to rad   and   then by art   the attraction of pbd is s pd bd  bp  sb x a x d of pha is s ph pg  pa  sb x x d   by art   the attraction pfcg is s pg x h l pfpc  pg  sx x h l ag bx qq ax pgah is s pg x h l phpa  pg  sx x h l b d a   by art   the attraction of efc is   lastly by art   the attraction of bde is   these quantities being collected together with their proper signs and contracted we have  for the whole attraction in the direction pe    having now obtained a general formula for the measure of the attraction in any sort of triangle if the particular values of the letters be substituted which any practical case may require and the fluxion of this attraction be put  0 the root of the resulting equation will be the required height from the bottom of the hill   0 but for a more particular solution in simpler terms let us suppose the triangle abc to be isosceles in which case we shall have d  e and g    b    c and then the above general formula will become  for the value of the attraction in the case of the isosceles triangle where q  is  and the fluxion of this expression being equated to 0 the equation will give the relation between a and x for any values of b and d by a process not very troublesome     now it is probable that the relation between a and x when the attraction is greatest will vary with the various relations between b and d or between b and a let us therefore find the limits of that relation between which it may always be taken by using two particular extreme cases the one in which the hill is very steep and the other in which it is very flat or a very small in respect of b or d     and first let us suppose the triangular section to be equilateral in which case the angle of elevation is  0 which being a degree of steepness that can scarcely ever happen this may be accounted the first extreme case here then we shall have d    b  a  and the formula in art  0 will become s x   a r x   x x h l   a  r x  x  a x  x h l a  r x a x for the value of the attraction in the case of the equilateral triangle in which r is      or if we take x  na where n expresses what part of a is denoted by x the last formula will become  for the case of the equilateral triangle     to find the maximum of the expression in the last article put its fluxion  0 and there will result this equation  the root of which is n        which shows that in the equilateral triangle the height from the bottom to the point of greatest attraction is only   00th part more than of the whole altitude of the triangle and this is the limit for the steepest kind of hills     let us find now the particular values of the measure of attraction arising by taking certain values of n varying by some small difference in order to discover what part of the greatest attraction is wanting by observing at different altitudes     and first using the value of n        as found in the   th article the general formula in art    gives sa x  0    00 for the measure of the greatest attraction     if n    0 or x    0 a the same formula gives sa 0 x          h l            h l         sa x  0 0     for the attraction at   0 of the altitude which is something less than the other     if n    0  the formula gives sa 0 x          h l        h l       sa x  0       for the attraction at   0 or of the altitude less again than the last was     if n    0  the formula gives  for the attraction at half way up the hill still less again than the last   0 if n    0  the formula gives sa 0 x           h l        h l       sa x  0     for the attraction at   0 or of the altitude from the bottom being still less than the last was and thus the quantity of attraction is continually less and less the higher we ascend up the hill above the       part or in round numbers    part of the altitude let us now descend by trying the numbers below    and first     if n     the same formula in art    gives sa x          h l           h l        sa x  0       for the attraction at of the altitude and is very little less than the maximum     if n    0  the formula gives   0 sa x         h l          hl         0 sa x          h l         sa x  0       for the attraction at   0 or of the altitude and is something less than at of the altitude     if n    0 the formula gives sa 0 x           hl            h l         sa x        for the attraction at   0 of the altitude still less than the last was and lastly     if n  0 or the point be at the bottom of the hill the formula gives  for the attraction at the bottom of the hill which is between and of the greatest attraction being something greater than but less than of it     the annexed table exhibits a summary of the   0   0       0    0          0  0         0   0  0 0        0     000  0    00 0  0                0  0              0             0            calculations made in the preceding articles where the first column shows at what part of the altitude of the hill the observation is made the second column contains the corresponding numbers which are proportional to the attraction and the third column shows what part of the greatest attraction is lost at each respective place of observation or how much each is less than the greatest     having now so fully illustrated the case of the first extreme or limit let us search what is the limit for the other extreme that is when the hill is very low or flat in this case b is nearly equal to d and they are both very great in respect of a consequently the formula for the attraction in art  0 will become barely  the fluxion of which being put  0 we obtain  hence therefore  and  which shows that the other limit is    00 that is when the hill is extremely low the point of greatest attraction is at    00 of the altitude like as it is at    00 when the hill is very steep and between these limits it is always found it being nearer to the one or the other of them as the hill is flatter or steeper     thus then we find that at of the altitude or very little more is the best place for observation to have the greatest attraction from a hill in the form of a triangular prism of an indefinite length but when its length is limited the point of greatest attraction will descend a little lower and the shorter the hill is the lower will that point descend for the same reason all pyramidal hills have their place of greatest attraction a little below that above determined but if the hill have a considerable space flat at the top after the manner of a frustum then the said point will be a little higher than as above found commonly however of the altitude may be used for the best place of observation as the point of greatest attraction will seldom differ sensibly from that place and when uncommon circumstances may produce a difference too great to be entirely neglected the observer must exercise his judgment in guessing at the necessary change he ought to make in the place of observation so as to obtain the best effect which the concomitant circumstances will admit of
