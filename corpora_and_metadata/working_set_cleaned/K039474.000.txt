forces of envy malice and detraction i must at the same time fairly confess my victory over the enemy was owing i believe as many other victories have been more to the art and prowess of my officers

tale from norman williams age simple and unadorned attempts the stage our silly bard more simple than his tale thinks on your polished manners to prevail what in those barbarous days were counted crimes are slips of course in these enlightened times let not your ancestors too rude appear though firm in friendship and in love sincere love then like glory did each heart inflame beauty was virtue and to win it fame now lovers lose their mistresses with grace as at new market they would lose a race where if in hopes they seem a little crossed it is for the money of the match that is lost when tilts and tournaments called forth the brave the fame of spotless innocence to save each gallant knight preferred his love to life for then the greatest blessing was a wife to prove their chastity the dauntless fair would walk through flames nor singe a single hair nay some so chaste so cold to all desire not only escaped it they put out the fire but now no heroes die for loves sweet passion and fiery trials are quite out of fashion ye sons of frailty  you whom rage devours for yo this night the muse exerts her powers with crimson hands pale cheeks and bloodshot eyes she bids the furies in

which to shorten the scenes were omitted in the representation  act i scene matildas tent with a view of the distant country matilda bertha matilda i thank thee gentle bertha for thy goodness if aught could sooth the anguish of my soul or raise it from the horrors of despair to hope and joy twoud be thy generous friendship but i am sunk so deep in misery that comfort cannot reach me  bertha talk not thus my sweet matilda innocence like thine must be the care of alldirecting heaven already has the interposing hand of providence redeemed thee from the rage of savage war and sheltered thee within this calm asylum mercias potent earl the noble morcar will protect thy virtues and if i err not wishes but to share his conquests with thee  matilda o my friend often times the flowery path that tempts our wandering steps but leads to misery what thou fondly deemst my souls best comfort is its bittrest woe earl morcar loves me to the generous mind the heaviest debt is that of gratitude when it is not in our power to repay it  bertha often have i heard thee say to him thou owst thy honor and thy life  matilda i told thee truth beneath my fathers hospitable roof i spent my earlier happier days in peace and safety when the norman conquror came discord thou know soon lit her fatal torch and spread destruction over this wretched land the loyal ranulph flew to williams aid and left me to a faithful peasants care who lived sequestered in the fertile plains of rich northumbria there awhile i dwelt in sweet retirement when the savage malcolm rushed on our borders  bertha i remember well the melancholy hour confusion raged on every side and desolation spread its terrors round us how did thou escape  matilda a crew of desperate ruffians seized upon me a helpless prey for o he was not there who best could have defended his matilda then had i fallen a wretched sacrifice to rbutal rage and lawless violence had not the generous morcar interposed to save me though he joined the guilty cause of foul rebellion yet his soul abhorred such violation at his awful voice the surly ruffians left me and retired he bore me half expiring in his arms back to his tent with every kind attention there strove to sooth my griefs and promised soon as fit occasion offered to restore me to my afflicted father  bertha something sure was due to generous morcar for his aid so timely given  matilda no doubt but mark what followed in my deliverer too soon i found an ardent lover sighing at my feet  bertha and what is there the proudest of our sex could wish for more to be the envied bride of noble morcar first of englands peers in fame and fortune  matilda never trust my bertha to outward show it is not the smiles of fortune the pomp of wealth or splendour of a court can make us happy in the mind alone rests solid joy and true felicity which i can never taste for o my friend a secret sorrow weighs upon my heart  bertha then pour it in the bosom of thy friend let me partake it with thee  matilda generous maid know then for naught will i conceal from thee i honor mercias earl revere his virtues and wish i could repay him with myself but blushing i acknowledge it the heart his vows solicit is not mine to give  bertha has then tome happier youth   matilda another time i will tell thee all the story of our loves but o my bertha did thou know to whom my virgin faith is plighted thou woudst say i am indeed unhappy  bertha could matilda bestow the treasure of her heart on one unworthy of her choice  matilda unworthy no i glory in my passion for the best the loveliest of his sex o he was all that bounteous nature prodigal of charms did on her choicest favorite ever bestow his graceful form and sweet deportment spoke the fairer beauties of his kindred soul where evry grace and every virtue shone but thou will tremble bertha when i tell thee he is earl morcars  brother  bertha ha his brother the noble edwin often have i heard my father   matilda did lord edrick know him then  bertha he knew his virtues and his fame in arms and often would lament the dire effects of civil discord that could thus dissolve the ties of nature and of brethren make the bittrest foes if right i learn lord edwin is williams firmest friend and still supports his royal master  matilda yes my bertha there i still find comfort edwin never was stained as morcar is with foul disloyalty but stands betwixt his sovereign and the rage of rebel multitudes to guard his throne if nobly fighting in his countrys cause my hero falls i shall not weep alone the king he loved and honored will lament him and grateful england mix her tears with mine  bertha and does earl morcar know of edwins love  matilda o no i would not for a thousand worlds he should suspect it lest his fiery soul should catch the alarm and kindle to a flame that might destroy us all  bertha i know his warmth and vehemence of temper unrestrained by laws and spurning at the royal power which he contemns he rules despotic here  matilda alas how man from man and brother often from brother differs edwins tender passion is soft and gentle as the balmy breath of vernal zephyrs whilst the savage north that curls the angry ocean into storms is a faint image of earl morcars love it is rage it is fury all when last we met he knit his angry brow and frowned severe upon me then with wild distracted look bade me beware of trifling with his passion he would not brook it  trembling i retired and bathed my couch in tears  bertha unhappy maid but time that softens every human woe will bring some blessed event and lighten thine  matilda alas thou know not what it is to love happily thy tender heart has never felt the tortures of that soulbewitching passion its joys are sweet and poignant but its pangs are exquisite as i have known too well for o my bertha since the fatal hour when edwin left me never has sweet peace that used to dwell with all its comforts here eer deigned to visit this afflicted breast  bertha too plain alas i read thy sorrows grief sits in sad triumph on thy faded cheek and half obscures the luster of thy beauties  matilda talk not of beauty it is our sexs bane and leads but to destruction i abhor the fatal gift o would it had pleased heaven to brand my homely features with the mark of foul deformity or let me pass unknown and undistinguished from the herd of vulgar forms save by the partial eye of my loved edwin then had i been blessed with charms unenvied and a guiltless love  bertha where is thy edwin now  matilda alas i know not it is now three years since last these eyes beheld their dearest object in that humble vale whence as i told thee malcolms fury drove me there first we met o how i cherish still the fond remembrance there we first exchanged our mutual vows the day of happiness was fixed it came and in a few short hours he had been made indissolubly mine when fortune envious of our happiness and williams danger called him to the field  bertha and since that parting have ye never met  matilda o never bertha never but in thought imagination kind anticipator of loves pleasures brings us often together often as i sit within my lonely tent and cast my wishful eyes over yonder plain in every passing traveller i strive to trace his image hear his lovely voice in every sound and fain would flatter me edwin still lives still loves his lost matilda  bertha who knows but fate propitious to thy love may guide him hither  matilda gracious heaven forbid consider bertha if the chance of war should this way lead him he must come in arms against his brother oh it is horrible to think on should they meet and edwin fall what shall support me and if victory smiles upon my love how dear will be the purchase by morcars blood then must i lose my friend my guardian my protector  every way matilda must be wretched  bertha is there ought in berthas power  matilda will thou dispatch my friend some trusty messenger with these  away gives her letters i will meet thee in my tent  farewell exit bertha matilda alone mean time one hope remains the generous siward  he might save me still his sympathetic heart can feel for the afflicted  i have heard such is the magic power of sacred friendship when the impetuous morcar scatters fear and terror round him he and he alone can stem the rapid torrent of his passion and bend him though reluctant to his will and see in happy hour he comes this way now fortune be propitious if there be as i have heard an eloquence in grief and those can most persuade who are most wretched i shall not pass unpitied  enter siward siward ha in tears matilda what new grief what cruel foe to innocence and beauty thus could vex thy gentle spirit  matilda can thou ask the cause when thou beholdst me still in shameful bonds a wretched captive friendless and forlorn without one ray of hope to sooth my sorrows  siward can she whose beauteous form and fair demeanor charm every eye and conquer every heart can she be wretched can she want a friend whom siward honors and whom morcar loves o if thou knewst with what unceasing ardor what unexampled tenderness and truth he doats upon thee sure thou might be wrought at least to pity  matilda urge no more my lord the ungrateful subject but too well i know how much thy friend deserves how much alas i owe him  if it be earl morcars wish to make me happy why am i detained a prisoner here spite of his solemn promise he would restore me to my royal master or send me back to the desiring arms of the afflicted ranulph who in tears of bittrest anguish mourns his longlost daughter surely my lord it ill becomes a soldier to forfeit thus his honor and his word  siward i own it yet the cause pleads strongly for him if by thy own too powerful charms misled he deviates from the paths of rigid honor matilda might forgive thou know he lives but in thy smiles his loveenchanted soul hangs on those beauties he would wish to keep for ever in his sight  matilda indulgent heaven keep me for ever from it o my lord if ever thy heart with generous pity glowed for the distressed if ever thy honest zeal could boast an influence over the man you love o now exert thy power assist direct and save thy friend from ruin and matilda there are my lord who most offend where most they wish to please such often is the fate of thy unhappy friend when he pours forth his ardent soul in vows of tenderest passion it is with such rude and boisterous violence as suits but ill the hero or the lover  siward i know his weakness know his follies all and feel em but too well he loves with transport and hates with fury warmed with fierce desire or strong resentment his impetuous soul is hurried on till reason quits her seat and passion takes the looselyflowing rein then all is rage confusion and despair and yet  removed the veil of error he will weep his faults with such a sweet contrition as would melt the hardest heart to pity and forgiveness o he has virtues that may well atone for all his venial rashness that deserve a sovreigns love and claim a nations praise virtues that merit happiness and thee why will thou thus despise my noble friend his birth and fortune with the rank he bears amongst the first of englands peers will raise thee as far above thy sex in wealth and power as now thou art in beauty  matilda o my lord it is not the pride the luxury of life the splendid robe and glittering gem that knits the lasting bonds of mutual happiness where manners differ where affections jarr and will not kindly mix together where the sweet harmonious concord of the mind is wanting all is misery and woe  siward by heaven thou pleadst thy own and virtues cause with such bewitching eloquence the more thy heart alarmed by diffidence still urges against this union with my friend the more i wish to see him blessed with worth like thine  matilda my lord it must not be for grant him all the fair perfections you already see and i could wish to find there is a bar that must for ever disunite us  born of norman race and from my earliest years attached to williams cause i love my king and wish my countrys peace that king my lord whom morcar wishes to dethrone that peace which he destroys had he an angels form with all the virtues that adorn his sex with all the riches fortune can bestow i would not wed a traitor  siward call not his errors by so harsh a name he has been deeply wronged and souls like his must feel the wounds of honor and resent them alas with thee i weep my countrys fate nay wish perhaps as well to williams cause and englands peace as can the loyal daughter of gallant ranulph and would therefore joy to see matilda lend a gracious ear to morcars suit thy reconciling charms might sooth his troubled soul might heal the wounds of bleeding england and unite us all in one bright chain of harmony and love the gallant edwin too  matilda ha what of him know thou that noble youth  siward so many years have past since last we met by different views and our unhappy feuds so long divided i should not recollect him but report speaks loudly of his virtues he no doubt if yet he lives   matilda yet lives  why what my lord  siward you seem much moved  matilda forgive me but whenever this sad idea rises to my mind of brother against brother armed my soul recoils with horror  siward it is a dreadful thought would i could heal that cruel breach but then thou might do much the task is left for thee  matilda for me alas it is not in my power  siward in thine and thine alone o think matilda how great thy glory and how great thy praise to be the blessed instrument of peace the band of union twixt contending brothers thou see them now like two descending floods whose rapid torrents meeting half overwhelm the neighboring plains thy gentle voice might still the angry waves and bid their waters flow in one united stream to bless the land  matilda that flattering thought beams comfort on my soul amidst my sorrows bear me witness heaven could poor matilda be the happy means of reconcilement could these eyes behold the noble youths embracing and embraced in the firm cords of amity and love o it would make me ample recompense for all my griefs nor would i more complain but rest me in the silent grave well pleased to think at last i had not lived in vain  siward cherish that virtuous thought illustrious maid and let me hope my friend may still be happy  matilda i wish it from my soul but see my lord earl morcar comes this way with hasty steps across the lawn i must retire farewell you will not forget my humble suit  siward o no i will do all that loveliest innocence and worth like thine deserve farewell mean time remember siwards every wish the bliss of morcar edwins life the public peace and englands welfare all depend  on thee exit matilda siward alone there is no alternative but this my friend must quit matilda or desert the cause we have rashly promised to support  perhaps the last were best  both shall be tried  he comes  enter morcar morcar o siward was not that the fair matilda whom you parted from  siward it was  morcar what says she the dear cruel maid is she still deaf inexorable still  siward you must not think of her  morcar what say thou siward not think of her  siward no root her from thy heart and gaze no more i blush to see my friend so lost to honor is it for a man on whom the fate of england may depend to quit the dangerous post where duty calls and all the business of the war to sigh and whine in corners for a captive woman resume the hero morcar and subdue this idle passion  morcar talk not thus of love the great refiner of the human heart the source of all that is great of all that is good of joy of pleasure  if it be a weakness it is a weakness which the best have felt i would not wish to be a stranger to it  siward let me entreat thee if thou valuest life or fame or honor quit matilda  morcar yes i thank you for your council it is the advice of cold unfeeling wisdom kindly meant to make me prudent and to leave me wretched but thus it is that proud exulting health is ever ready to prescribe a cure for pain and sickness which it never knew  siward there too thou errst for i have known its joys and sorrows too in early life i lost the partner of my soul ever since that hour i bade adieu to love and taught my soul to offer her devotions at the shrine of sacred friendship there my vows are paid morcar best knows the idol of my worship  morcar i know and love thee for it but o my friend i cannot force this tyrant from my breast even now i feel her here she sits enthroned within the foldings of my heart and he who tears her thence must draw the lifeblood from me my morning slumbers and my midnight dreams are haunted by matilda  siward to be thus the slave of one that scorns thee o it is base mean and unworthy of thee  morcar i will bear that scorn no longer thou have roused me siward i will enjoy the glorious prize she is mine by right of conquest mine i will assert a victors claim and force her to be happy  siward that must not be it ill becomes the man who takes up arms against a tyrants power tadopt a tyrants maxims force and love are terms that never can be reconciled you will not must not do it  morcar must not who shall dare oppose me  siward honor conscience love the sense of shame your virtue and your friend whilst i have life or power i will not see matilda wronged  morcar you are her champion then it seems her favored happy friend perhaps her fond admirer too illfated morcar i see it but too well i am lost abandoned alike betrayed by friendship and by love i thank you sir you have performed your office and merit your reward  siward unkind reproach did i for this desert my sovreigns cause my peaceful home and all its joys to serve ungrateful morcar why did i rebel the haughty william never injured me for thee alone i fought for thee i conquered and but for thee long since i had employed my gallant soldiers to a nobler purpose than loitring thus in idle camp to hear a lovesick tale and sooth a mad mans phrenzy  morcar you could away and leave me then withdraw your boasted aid and bid northumbrias sons bend to the tyrants yoke whilst i alone defend the cause of freedom and my country here let us part remove your loiterers and join thusurper  siward mark the difference now betwixt blind passion and undaunted friendship you are impatient of the keen reproof because you merit i can bear it all because i have not deserved it  enter an officer officer good my lords forgive this rough intrusion but the danger i trust will plead my pardon as i watched from yonder tower a dusky cloud appeared as if from distant troops advancing soon i saw their armor glitter in the sun with rapid motion they approached each moment we must expect them here  siward why let em come already i have ordered fit disposal of all our little force away good osmond be silent and be ready exit officer now my friend thou art as welcome to thy siwards breast as dear as ever  when the man i love walks in the paths of error i reprove him with honest freedom but when danger comes upon him i forget his faults and flee with all a lovers ardour to his rescue his sorrows and his wants alone remembered and all his follies buried in oblivion  morcar thou have disarmed me now this pierces more than all the bitter poison of reproach which thou have poured upon me o twas treason against the sacred majesty of friendship to doubt thy honor or suspect thy virtue thou will forgive but when the wounded mind is torn with passion every touch is pain you should not probe so deeply  siward twas my duty but come no more of that the foe advances if we succeed as my prophetic soul foretells we shall  i have some comfort for you  if not well borrow courage from despair and die like men thou standst upon the rock of danger and the yawning precipice opens before us i will snatch thee from it or leap the gulf and perish with my friend  the end of the first act act ii scene a fortress belonging to morcar edwin alone in chains edwin it is the will of heaven and must be done the hardfought field is lost and here i am a prisoner in my brothers camp alas that fortune thus should guide me to a foe whom most i wished to shun we little thought the troops by morcar led had this way bent their illdirected course but providence has so ordained perhaps to heal the wounds of civil discord o unhappy edwin for what art thou reserved no matter what since fate deprived me of my dear matilda whom i for three long years have sought in vain life has been irksome to me this perchance may end it  for who knows if nature yet may live within the conqurors breast to plead a brothers pardon yet he knows me not but soon he must  ha who comes here earl siward  the second in command to whom oerpowerd by circling foes and fainting with my wounds i yielded up my sword if fame say true he bears a mind too great to look with scorn on the oppressed or triumph over misfortune  enter siward siward stranger whoever thou art be comforted thy fate has thrown thee into noble hands who know thy merit may i ask thy name  edwin i am a poor abandoned wretch the sport of fortune one whose least affliction is to be a captive and from every eye would wish to hide the story of my fate too soon my name and sorrows will be known  siward respect is ever due to misery i will not urge thee further all i hope that generous pity could afford to sooth calamity like thine by my command has been extended to thee here awhile you must remain a prisoner but ever long i hope to greet thee by a fairer name and rank thee as our friend  edwin your genrous orders have been obeyed and i acknowledge it with grateful heart may i not ask the fate of him who fought so nobly by my side that brave old man  siward the gallant ranulph   edwin yes my fellow captive  siward he is safe and free  edwin ha free thank heaven  siward the generous morcar urged by my entreaties pardoned and released him though much our soldiers murmured and demanded his life and yours a sacrifice they said due to the manes of their slaughtered friends but mercy has prevailed  edwin what ever becomes of an unhappy wanderer like me for your kind treatment of the aged ranulph accept my thanks it was a precious boon morcar may find me not unworthy of it to day i am his captive but tomorrow may see me his deliverer for know my royal master the victorious william with eagle swiftness soon will follow me with twenty times your force as this shall prove or true or false so deal with me remember i warned you of it  siward and remember thou that i with joy receive the welcome news welcome to me for i am williams friend  edwin thou can not then be mine or englands foe with such a heart as thine so nobly formed to feel for the afflicted satisfied for thou seem of williams royal right what could engage thee in this foul revolt this base rebellion  siward what but the great bond of kindred souls inviolable friendship the only solid bliss on this side heaven that doubles all the joys of human life and by dividing lessens every woe  edwin who knows but this days sad event may prove the happy means to heal a nations wounds and sooth our jarring factions into peace  siward had morcar thought with me land since that end had been obtained but morcar is   edwin inexorable so i have heard and therefore little hope to change his nature o could he be wrought to sweet oblivion of his wrongs to bury his deep resentment mine should be the task a task heaven knows i would with joy perform to reconcile offended majesty to soften all his errors plead his pardon and give my sovereign one brave soldier more  siward when next we meet i trust it shall be so mean time let me prepare him for the change retire a while  ever long well send for thee for every moment i expect him here thy freedom and thy happiness shall be my first concern for thou have well deserved it  edwin farewell be quick in your resolves the time requires it and be wise ever it is too late exit edwin siward alone i hope we shall this welltimd victory if rightly used may smooth our way to peace now morcar all thy happiness depends upon thyself alone now friendship raise thy powerful voice and force him to be happy he will he must  he comes   enter morcar siward my conquror welcome  morcar thrice welcome to my arms my noble siward at length we meet in joy the day is ours thanks to thy friendly aid  siward we must not boast twas hardly purchased and has cost us dear you followed em too close  morcar i own twas rash my youthful ardor urged the keen pusuit too far and but for thee i had been lost in war thy arm protects me and in peace thy councils guide o how shall i return thy goodness thou were born to save thy friend  siward away i will not be thanked i have done my duty and if thou think thyself indebted for it repay me not with flattery but with love ever since my soul with thine congonial met in social bands and marked thee for her own thy interest and thy happiness have been my first ambition and when thou art blessed with all thy soul can wish for siward then and then alone will have his full reward  morcar o unexampled faithfulness and truth but say my siward is our loss so great  siward the flower of half our troops but it is not now a time to weep for i have glorious tidings that much import thy happiness  morcar ha what  siward know that amongst our captives i have taken a noble prize will make us full amends for every loss  the gallant ranulph  morcar ha matildas father then i am satisfied the wily chief by heaven he shall repay me for her unkindness give him to my rage to my resentment to my injured love where is he siward  siward i have set him free  morcar ha free thy illtimed metey has betrayed our cause the tyrant would have ransomed him with half his kingdom  siward still thy rapid passions oerpowr thy reason what if it should serve a better purpose smooth thy paths to bliss and gain matilda for thee  morcar o my friend my siward do not flatter me by heaven her kind consent would give my ravished soul more true and heartfelt happiness than could a thousand victries over the proud usurper  siward know then i gave him liberty and life on these conditions  that he should withdraw his powers from williams aid and never more assist his cause the time would come i told him that he should know to whom he owed the boon and how he might repay it  morcar that was kind indeed my siward that was like a friend o thou revivst my drooping heart but tell me did my matilda let me call her mine did she acknowledge did she thank thee for it  siward o i assumed no merit but to thee and to thy generous unexampled love did i attribute all she sighed and wept poured forth a thousand blessings on thy head   morcar and do thou think my siward that one ray of hope remains  siward the clouds already vanish the prospect brightens round thee haste and seize the lucky moment when the generous mind is soothed by obligation soon it opens to the mild dictates of humanity and softens into sympathy and love  morcar o siward coudst thou teach me but to win that lovely maid   siward the task is half performed already and my friend shall soon be blessed one thing and one alone remains to fix her doubtful heart if yet a doubt remains  morcar o name it siward if it is in the power of wealth to purchase or of victory in the fair field of glory to acquire it shall not long be wanting  siward it requires no price but such as morcar well can pay no victory but the victory over thyself and thy own passions  give up thy resentment make peace with william and matildas thine  morcar matilda mine and must i purchase her at the dear price of honor with the loss of all my soul holds dear my countrys welfare my word   siward away whilst prudence warranted our honest zeal i was the first to aid thy just revenge but valor illadvisd and illexerted in a hopeless cause degenerate into rashness you mistake the pride of honor for the pride of virtue  morcar and woudst thou have me bend beneath the yoke of ignominious slavery quit the cause of heavenborn freedom and betray my friends  siward i would have thee just and happy  we have been successful let us now be generous whilst we have something to bestow nor wait till fickle fortune from our brows shall tear the blasted wreath and leave us naught to give too long already have we sacrificed at proud ambitions altar to revenge now let us offer at the shrine of peace and sacrifice   morcar to love and to matilda it shall be so  the struggles past  away my siward haste and tell her i obey her laws her king her master shall be mine i have no will but here is and in her eyes will read my duty  yet a moment stay what will my brave companions of the war my fellow soldiers say will they approve this unexpected change  siward i know them firm in their obedience and resolved to act as you command  but i will see em strait and urge such powerful reasons as may best secure them to our purpose fare thee well  morcar siward thy kind anticipating care prevents my every wish  but say my friend where is the gallant chief whom we subdued who fought so hardly and so nobly fell  siward in yonder tent a wretched prisoner still he counts the tedious hours a heavy gloom sits on his brow as if some deepfelt sorrow oppressed his noble mind  we must release him  morcar thou know my siward thrice we had oerpowrd his troops and thrice his single valor turned the fortune of the day since first i trod the paths of glory never did i behold such deeds of valor wrought by mortal hand i almost envied though i conquered him he wore his beaver up nor could i trace his features but he bears a noble form know thou his quality or name  siward not yet he seems industrious to conceal them both from every eye  morcar some deity protects him as its peculiar care for as i raised my sword against him whether the soft passion that triumphs over me had unmannd my soul i know not but bereft of all its power my nerveless arm dropped ineffectual down and let him scape me  siward it is most true i saw and wondered at it when you lest the field with desperate rage he rushed intrepid on and seemed to court his fate till circling foes compelled him to resign and yield his sword  morcar away i burn with ardor to forgive to free and to embrace him fly my siward let him approach he could not wish to meet in happier hour the master of his fate for now methinks i could be reconciled to every foe away my siward haste and send him to me  siward treat him like a friend he may be useful such distinguished merit must have its influence he commands no doubt the royal ear and may procure such terms as william may with honor yield and we without a blush accept exit siward morcar alone farewell and now how stands the great account can i acquit myself or shall i be condemned before thy great tribunal allrepaying justice but fair matilda wipes out every stain it is she commands me to forgive and she must be obeyed i am not the first apostate from honors cause the tyrant love has made my friend too urged the change  guards bring in edwin chained he is here  strike off those ignominious chains  he has deserved a better fate guards unchain him stranger who ever thou art turning to edwin thy gallant bearing in the unequal conflict for we had twice thy numbers has endeared a soldier to a soldier vulgar minds to their own party and the narrow limits of partial friendship meanly may confine their admiration but the brave will see and seeing praise the virtues of a foe  edwin aside o powerful nature how thou workst within me  morcar still silent still concealed perchance thou fear knowing thy rank and name i might recall my promised pardon but be confident for by that sacred honor which i hold dearer than life i promise here to free and to protect thee did thou hide from me my deadliest foe should williams self appear before me he who has so deeply wronged me so long opposed nay should i hear the voice of that adventurous rash misguided youth whom yet i cannot hate  my cruel brother i could forgive him  edwin discovering himself then  behold him here  morcar edwin amazement by what wondrous means mysterious providence do thou unfold thy secret purposes i little thought when last we met what heavnprotected victim escaped my sword  edwin with horror i recall the dreadful circumstance throughout the battle i knew and carefully avoided thee  morcar o edwin how on this propitious day have victory fame and friendship fortune love and nature all conspired to make me blessed we have been foes too long  of that no more my edwin welcome once more to thy arms receive a brother  edwin yet a moment stay by nature touched the same accordant string that vibrates on thy heart now beats on mine but honor and the duty which i owe the best of kings restrains the fond embrace i wish to share and bids me ask if yet in morcar i behold my sovreigns foe if it be so take back thy proffered freedom take back my forfeit life i would not wish to be indebted for it to  a traitor  morcar perhaps i may deserve a better name perhaps i may be changed  edwin i hope thou art for this i came for this i yielded to thee to tell thee williams strength is every hour increasing if thou mean to make thy peace now is the crisis   morcar edwin stop nor urge such mean unworthy motives as alone could thwart my purpose morcar cannot fear but morcar can be generous for know before i saw thee here i had resolved to sheath my sword and be the conqurors friend for o there is a cause   edwin whatever the cause the effect is glorious now thou art again my brother here let us once more unite the longdisseverd cord they embrace morcar and never more may blind resentment faction party rage envy or jealous fear dissolve the tie and now my edwin blushing i confess not to thy tender care for morcars safety to friendships council or to reasons voice owe we this wished for change a female hand directs and wills it  edwin ha a woman  morcar yes if such i ought to call that form divine which triumphs here who rules my every thought my every action guides in yonder tent a beauteous captive dwells who has enslaved her conquror she demands the sacrifice she would not give her hand to williams foe and therefore only morcar is his friend  edwin i could have wished that this important change were to the hero not the lover due  morcar i am above deceit and own my weakness but thou shall see her  yes my edwin thou shall bear the welcome tidings to my love thy presence will bear witness to the change thy freedom and the joyful news thou bringst of our blessed union will confirm it to her will thou my edwin   edwin do not ask me what i must refuse i would do much to serve a friend and brother but a task of joy ill suits a soul oppressed with griefs like mine o i could tell thee  but twoud be unkind when thou art entering on the paths of bliss to stop thee with my melancholy tale  morcar what ever thy griefs i pity and hereafter may find the means to lessen or remove them mean time this tender office may divert thy sorrows nay if thou denyst me edwin i shall not think our union is sincere  edwin then be it so  morcar i will send a trusty slave that shall conduct thee to her soon i mean to follow thee  away  begone and prosper but o my brother if thou have a heart that is not steeled with stoic apathy against the magic of allconquring love beware of beautys power for she has charms would melt the frozen breast of hoary age or draw the lonely hermit from his cell to gaze upon her  edwin know thy fears are vain for long long since by honors sacred ties united to the lovliest of her sex edwin like morcar is to one alone devoted and my heart is fixed as thine  morcar then i am blessed thy sympathetic soul with warmer feelings shall express my passion waked by the fond remembrance of thy own go then thy kind returning friendship prove go plead with all the eloquence of love and as thou do thy brothers anguish tell still on thy lips may soft persuasion dwell urge my fond suit with energy divine nor cease till thou have made the lovely captive mine  the end of the second act act iii scene matildas tent with a distant view of the camp matilda bertha matilda o bertha i have had such frightful dreams they harrowd up my soul  bertha it is the work of busy fancy in thy troubled mind give it no heed  matilda o it was more much more than fancy ever formed twas real all it haunts me still and every circumstance is now before me but i will tell thee all scarce had i closed my eyes to seek that rest which long had been a stranger when methought alone i wandered through a mazy wood beset with thorns and briars on every side the mournful image of my wretched state when from a winding walk the beauteous form of my loved edwin seemed to glide across and ran with haste to meet me but behold a tiger rushed between and seized upon him i shrieked aloud  bertha twas terrible  matilda but mark what followed for a gleam of light broke in and saved me from despair when cross the glade a generous lion as with pity moved at the unequal conflict darted forth and sprung with vengeance on the spotted beast who turned with fury on his natural foe and loosed my edwin he escaped and fled i waked in agonies  bertha be comforted the dream presages good some generous friend shall save him from the perils of the war and give him to thy longing arms again  matilda o never never  enter an officer officer noble lady one from williams camp by morcars orders sent would crave a minutes conference and says he bears some news that may be welcome  matilda ha from williams camp o flattering hope who knows but he may bring some tidings of my love tidings perhaps i may not wish to hear perhaps he comes to speak of edwins death or edwins falsehood  be it as it may i cannot be more wretched than i am conduct him hither exit officer o my fluttering heart look yonder how imagination forms what most we wish for see he comes  it is it is my edwin  save me bertha o as he enters she faints enter edwin edwin what do i see matilda here she faints am i deserted then abandoned lost betrayed by her i love she breathes she lives but not for me  for morcar for my brother  matilda to bertha where is he o it was delusion all the form deceived me had it been my love he would have flown with rapture to me  see he stands far off and will not look upon me  edwin i dare not  matilda is it thus we meet again is this the kind the tender faithful edwin  edwin art thou matilda speak for i am lost in wild astonishment it cannot be in morcars camp is this the lovely captive that i should meet  matilda allseeing heaven bear witness for me if from that sad hour when last we parted this devoted heart has ever wandered ever cast one thought or formed a wish for any bliss but thee despise me edwin slight me cast me off to infamy and shame  edwin i must i must believe thee yet it is strange  when thou shall know from whom i came and what my errand here thou will not call me cruel or unkind when i shall tell thee i am come to claim anothers right o heaven anothers right to my matilda to request thy hand for morcar  matilda for thy brother  edwin yes even now we parted  here he told me i should meet a beauteous captive little did i think it was matilda whom he long had wooed whose generous heart he hoped would now accept a convert made to loyalty by love she only waited for that blessed event with mutual ardour to return his passion can it be thus alas thy presence here confirms it but too well  matilda appearance often by strange events and causeless jealousy confounds the guilty with the innocent but sure my edwins noble mind disdains to cherish low suspicion it is a vice abhorrent to thy nature and matilda will never practice it on thee true love knows not distrust or diffidence but rests on its own faith secure and hopes to meet the truth it merits  edwin can this be the voice of falsehood  can those lips   matidla mistaken man could thou ever credit the delusive tale could thou believe i had so soon forgot my plighted faith but since i am suspected return and bear this answer back to morcar first say i thank him for the choice he made of thee to be the herald of his love for what is there matilda can refuse that edwin could request  edwin o that recalls a thousand tender thoughts   matilda go tell him too what ever i rashly promised but to gain a few short moments to preserve my king and save a fathers life i never meant to feign a passion which i coud not feel for i was destined to anothers arms to one who now regardless of his vows to poor matilda after three long years of cruel absence from her comes at last to doubt her honor and suspect her love  edwin o never never sooner will i doubt the powers of nature and believe these eyes can misinterpret every object here than think thee false o take me to thy arms and bury all my doubts  can thou forgive the jealous warmth of agonizing passion  matilda i can i must but say to what blessed chance am i indebted for this happy moment  edwin the chance of war i am a prisoner here and but for thee   matilda when i shall tell thee all that i have suffered since we parted last thou will not blame but pity poor matilda mean while be calm it is not now a time for idle doubts and visionary fears when real dangers threat i see already by thy imperfect tale what misery must soon await us when the fiery earl shall know this strange event  edwin and wherefore know it why not conceal our passion till some means of freedom offer  matilda i abhor the thought no edwin no the crisis of our fate approaches never let us stain our loves with crooked fraud and base dissimulation hark did thou hear a voice in yonder grove siward in confrence with the haughty earl behold them  see  they part  and morcar hastes with quick impatient step to know his fate now summon all thy powers  edwin i am prepared he comes a few short minutes will determine whether matilda plays the hypocrite or is deserving of her edwins love  enter morcar morcar at length i hope matildas satisfied edwin has told thee what a sacrifice my heart has made ambition glory pride and fierce resentment bend beneath thy power and yield the palm to allsubduing love yes thou have conquered i am williams friend the struggles past i have performed the task assigned and come to claim my just reward  matilda by virtuous acts the selfapproving mind is amply paid nor seeks a recompense from ought beside you have redeemed your honor turned to the paths of duty and discharged the debt you owe your country and your king england and william will be grateful for it what can you wish for more  morcar there is a prize more welcome far beyond what ever a king or kingdom can bestow  thy love   matilda my lord  morcar if to have saved thee from the brutal rage of pitiless ruffians if to have renounced a victors claim and be myself the slave of her i conquered if to have released my bittrest foe because allied to thee if after all my cruel wrongs to accept the proud oppressors hand can merit ought i am not quite unworthy of the boon  matilda the good and just my lord demand our praise and generous deeds will claim the tribute due the debt of humble gratitude but love love that must mark the color of our days for good or ill for happiness or woe it is not the gift of fortune or of fame nor earned by merit nor acquired by virtue all the rich treasures which or wealth or power have to bestow can never purchase that which the free heart alone itself must give  morcar give it with freedom then to him who most has studied to deserve   matilda you talk my lord as if the right of conquest could bestow a right more precious and a dearer claim but know for now it is time to throw aside the veil that long has hid from morcars eyes the secret of my soul and say at last i never can be thine  morcar ha never o recall that word  matilda i must not edwin knows there is a bar of adamant between that must for ever part us  morcar ha for ever distraction can it be take heed matilda i am not to be mocked thus o my brother did thou not hear her but astonishment has closed thy lips in silence  never mine and wherefore not be mine turning to matilda matilda because i am anothers  well i know our hapless sex so custom wills and arbitrary man is taught in fearful silence to conceal the honest feelings of a tender heart else wherefore should matilda blush to own a virtuous passion for the best of men  morcar a virtuous passion grant me patience heaven i am betrayed abandoned lost anothers some fawning slave some norman plunderer rich with the ravished spoils of english valor has snared her easy heart and tortured mine but i will drag him from his dark abode where ever he lurks he shall not scape my vengeance thou hearst her edwin  edwin aye who would not wish to hear the voice of nature and of love thus nobly pleading by the lips of truth  morcar amazement thou art linked with the vile slave that has unsurpd my right all all conspire to make me wretched  edwin why should morcar think that lovely maid would act beneath herself and make so mean a choice now on my soul i doubt not but the object of her love has earned the glorious prize and will be found deserving of it  morcar thou know him then  edwin i do know him as brave as noble as thyself one who would scorn however the outward act might seem unworthy of him to do ought that should disgrace his family and name a man he is of yet untainted honor of birth and valor equal to thy own though fortune frowns upon him  morcar now by heaven but that i know thy eyes were never blessed with my matildas charms i should suspect thou had betrayed the sacred trust reposed in thy false heart by unsuspecting friendship and were thyself the traitor  edwin think so still let fancy ever busy to torment the jealous mind alarm thee with the thought of seeing him whom thou have thus reviled stand forth and dare the proof suppose him here before thee ready to assert his claim his prior right to all the joys that love and fair matilda can bestow then look on me and know thy rival in  thy brother  morcar confusion horror misery o heaven can thou behold such complicated guilt such unexampled perfidy and yet with hold thy vengeance let thy lightenings blast the base betrayer o matilda false deceitful cruel woman  matilda it is the lot of unprotected innocence to meet the cruel censure which to guilt alone is due i have not deceived i have not betrayed thee and woudst thou listen to the artless tale i could unfold   morcar away i will not hear nor see nor think of thee deceitful villain was this thy kind concern for morcars safety was it for this that subtle edwin came a willing captive boasted williams strength and lured me no a base inglorious peace that like a midnight ruffian he might steal unseen and unsuspected on my love and rob me of matilda  edwin i abhor a thought so mean the bare suspicion stains with such foul blot my honor and my name i will not deign to answer thee my birth alone might prove to any sense but thine that i disdain it it is enough to say i am earl morcars brother  morcar i disclaim all ties of nature or of friendship with thee and henceforth hold thee as my deadliest foe as such i will pursue thee slave for know thou art my prisoner still  who waits there seize and guard this traitor  guards enter and seize on edwin matilda kneeling to morcar o my lord if ever soft pity touched thy breast if ever thy heart felt the warm glow of sympathetic grief for the unhappy do not let the rage of thoughtless passion urge thee to a deed of horror which too late thou will repent o spare a guiltless brother spare thyself the bitter pangs of sad remorse that soon shall harrow up thy soul when radient truth shall flash conviction on thee o forgive and pity   edwin rise matilda it is beneath the dignity of innocence to kneel before proud guilt and supplicate a tyrant  matilda rising i feel the just reproach  forgive me edwin henceforth i never will disgrace thy love by mean submission morcar if thou hopst for future peace or pardon set us free  morcar i will hear no more convey her to her tent  matilda edwin adieu if honor virtue truth and mutual love protect the innocent we yet shall meet in happiness  farewell exit matilda guarded morcar let none have entrance there but faithful siward would he were here that i might pour my sorrows into his friendly bosom o siward where art thou  ha he comes  enter siward siward my lord the troops flushed with their late success refuse all terms of peace with william and cry out for war and vengeance   morcar they shall have it now by heaven thou bringst me glorious tidings  well what more  siward they have discovered that the noble prisoner who had surrendered is thy brother edwin this has alarmed them they suspect you both of vile collusion to betray their cause and yield them to the tyrant if they say you mean them fair let edwin be confined and answer for the treason with his life  morcar and so he shall they could not ask a boon which morcar would more readily bestow already their request is granted  see the traitor is secured allseeing heaven thou see how justice will overtake the wicked  siward what can this mean since last i saw my friend how the fair day that shone so bright upon us is suddenly overcast  morcar alas my siward when thou shall know  but it is enough to say matildas false and edwin is  a villain  siward amazement can it be  morcar it is too true and i am lost for ever o matilda deceitful woman  siward it is not now a time for idle plaints consult your safety fly this moment to the camp  your presence there and that alone may quell the rising storm leave edwin to my care  morcar i go my siward safe in thy friendship i entrust to thee my just revenge yon mossgrown tower that hangs over the deep flood  it is under thy command  place double guard  he must not scape  his fate shall be determined soon what ever it prove it cannot be more wretched than my own exit mor edwin siward edwin pointing to the guards where is my dungeon my conductors here wait but your orders give em their commission for you it seems sir are to execute the friendly office do it and be happy  siward guards set your prisoner free  thou little know of siwards soul to think it joys in ought that gives another pain i have learnt too well in sad afflictions hard but wholesome school the lesson of humanity  edwin o generous siward if thou have a heart to feel for others misries pity mine and poor matildas she has not deserved a fate like this  siward alas it rives my soul to see the tender bonds of amity thus torn asunder by the very means i fondly thought for ever would unite them and the fair structure which my hopes had raised of love and friendship in a moment shrunk from its weak base and buried all in ruin if thou can prove thy innocence as yet i hope thou will for in that noble mien i read a conscious pride that would not stoop to ought that is base  still may i hope to heal these bleeding wounds and sooth him to forgiveness mean time be free give me thy sacred word the soldiers oath thou will be found when ever i call upon thee and yon tent alone shall be thy prison free to range around far as my guard extends  edwin accept my thanks the humble tribute of a grateful heart it is all i have to give the time may come when edwin shall repay thee as he ought  siward is there ought more which honor and the duty i owe my friend permits me to bestow that thou woudst as  edwin o grant me to behold that injured maid to take my last farewell then act as fate and morcar shall determine i give the pledge of safety thou requirst and will be found  speak will thou listen to me  siward of that well talk hereafter  come  within i will hear thy story  thou but know me yet as morcars friend hereafter thou may find i am still more the friend  of truth and virtue  the end of the third act act iv scene an apartment belonging to siward opening to a wood edwin matilda edwin thanks to the noble siwards generous pity for the distressed once more we meet matilda but only meet alas to mourn our fate to feel each others woes and to be wretched  matilda eternal blessings wait on him who thus could sweeten sorrows bitter draught and make captivity a blessing o my edwin a few short moments spent with those we love is worth an age of common life  edwin with thee indeed it is but we are on the verge of a dark precipice and every step is dangerous if morcar should return and find us here together we are lost for ever thou have seen and seen with horror the desperate rage of his tumultuous soul let us avoid it let us   matilda what my love thou art my guide protector guardian all i have to boast on earth o teach me where to find some blessed asylum for my woes and guide my footsteps to the paths of peace  edwin let me entreat thee then   matilda o speak thou know i have no will but thine  edwin then leave me leave this hated roof i have a friend within who shall conduct thee to the royal camp in safety bear this signet to the king he will protect thee and what ever fate decrees for me matilda may be happy  matilda o never never safety dwells with thee and thee alone without my faithful edwin the peopled city and the crowded court would be a desert to me no my love we will not part the same benignant power that led thee hither that beyond my hopes brought my lost edwin to these arms again will still protect that virtue which it loves  edwin did thou not tell me that this very morn thou had determined as the only means to shun my brothers love on sudden flight  matilda but then i should have fled in search of thee  edwin thou winning softness how shall i reward such unexampled tenderness and truth  matilda by flying with me come my love lead on i will follow thee to dangers and to death nor perils shall affright nor labors tire when thou art with me  edwin no it must not be  matilda why what should keep thee here  edwin the ties of honor  matilda and are they stronger than the bonds of love  edwin to siwards kind indulgence well thou know i owe this little interval of peace this transient gleam of happiness with thee and should i break my sacred word his life might answer for it woudst thou have me thus repay his kindness no my love i may be wretched but i cannot be ungrateful  matilda must thou return then to that hateful prison when morcar comes  edwin i must o think when i am pent within a loathsome dungeon who shall shelter then thy unprotected virtue no edwin there to succor thee who knows what brutal lust and power may dare to act on a deserted beauteous friendless woman distracting thought a monarchs vengeance then would come too late would make me poor amends for my matildas violated charms  matilda he cannot be so mean so base of soul or if he should i have a dagger here to save me from dishonor  edwin what by death dreadful alternative o hazard not thy precious life but seize the lucky moment which fortune gives us ever it be too late  matilda urge me no more already i have felt too deeply felt the pangs of absence from thee another separation would be worse than death and all its terrors no my love we are embarked on a tumultuous sea and must abide the fury of the storm the waves of angry fortune may overwhelm but shall not part us we will stem the torrent brave the proud oceans rage and gain the harbor of peace and happiness  or sink together  edwin thou have foretold the tempest and behold it rushes on us  enter morcar and harold matilda ha earl morcar here  morcar harold i thank thee thy intelligence was but too true turning to edwin traitor who set thee free they would have scapd my vengeance  false matilda it is thus i am rewarded for my love my illtimed mercy to a thankless brother back to thy dungeon slave guards drag him hence to prison and to death to the soldiers edwin or death or life are equal to me if i must be torn from my matilda but whatever thy purpose be speedy in thy vengeance nor delay the cruel work for know thy master comes william approaches  to revenge my cause  morcar but not to save thee  edwin then farewell matilda perhaps for ever  if we meet no more thou will remember  but i will not doubt thy honor or thy love i know thy truth know thou will act as best becomes thy fate whatever it be and worthy of thyself  matilda of thee my edwin rather say of thee yes i will copy well thy bright example i will not disgrace thy love with womans weakness but part without a tear i will but stay to tell thy tyrant brother how i hate how i despise him and then follow thee  morcar i will hear no more  begone  away with him exeunt guards with edwin for thee matilda   matilda what for me remains i know too well thy odious love reproach unmerited and threats which i despise thou think i have deceived thee  think so still enjoy thy error thou believst us guilty twill make thee happy now  perchance to find us innocent may be thy punishment hereafter  morcar aye twas a proof of innocence to fly thou and thy paramour together  matilda no i scorn a thought so mean could i have left my edwin long ever this i might have been beyond the reach of tyranny beyond thy hated power and safe beneath the wing of sacred majesty in williams care  morcar in williams care  matilda thy conquerors  for know the hero comes  to scatter blessings round him to heal his countrys wounds chastise rebellion and punish false perfidious slaves like thee  morcar by heavens she braves my wrath insults my weakness and triumphs over her slave  matilda there was a time when with an eye of pity i beheld thy hopeless love when i concealed my passion for the dear idol of my heart because i feared twoud make thee wretched but thy rage thy cruel treatment of a guiltless brother has cancelled all  morcar then mark me if thou hopst for edwins freedom shake off this vile passion yield thy proud heart to him who best deserves it and meet me at the altar  two hours hence i shall expect thee there  beyond that time he may not live to thank thee for thy bounty  matilda then let him perish  glut thy tyrant soul with vengeance bathe it in a brothers blood all ruffian all barbarian as thou art thou can not murder his immortal fame thou can not rob him of matildas love but know  when he for whom alone this pulse would wish to beat this lazy blood to flow within my veins when he shall be no more another life shall satiate thy revenge another victim shall attend thy triumph  morcar thou talk it nobly  it is the common trick the affectation of thy sex to boast a fancied firmness which ye never knew but with affrighted nature thou woudst shrink when death approaches  matilda put me to the proof if thou woudst punish edwin know he lives within this breast  strike home and pierce him there  morcar imperious woman thou defyst my power and let it crush thee if thy country bleeds in every vein if perjured edwin falls as soon he shall a victim to my rage thou art the murderer thou the paricide i stand absolved the guilt is all thy own  matilda if it be guilt to suffer keen reproach pain persecution terror chains and death for him i love rather than stain my soul with foul disloyalty i am indeed the guiltiest of my sex and well deserve the pangs i feel  morcar thoust driven me to the pit of black despair and i will drag thee down to share the dreadful ruin thou have made  matilda i know thy savage purpose but remember the hour approaches when thou shall repent this base unmanly triumph william comes hear that and tremble thou unnatral brother nor rocks nor caves shall hide thee from his vengeance inglorious and unpitied shall thou fall and after ages shall consign thy name to endless scorn and infamy immortal exit matilda morcar inexorable judge i stand condemned and shall await my doom but not alone or unrevenged shall morcar fall  henceforth i bid adieu to love and all his train of fond delusions  vengeance i am thine and thine alone thou daughter of despair destructive goddess come possess my soul with all thy terrors  yes it shall be so a few short hours are

thou have betrayed me was it not unkind to set my prisoner free to let him meet matilda and conspire against my life  siward impossible by heaven the artful story he told so wrought upon my easy soul i thought him innocent  morcar have thou not heard   siward from harold only an imperfect tale so strange i could not credit it  morcar alas it is all too true i am the veriest slave the meanest wretch that ever was trampled on by an imperious woman o my friend my siward i have naught on earth but thee shoudst thou forsake me in this hour of terror but sure thou will not  siward no what ever the will of wayward fortune may determine for us behold me ready to partake thy fate if we must sue for peace let siward bear the olive for thee if once more we cast the desperate dye of battle let me perish by morcars side come let us on together shake off this load of unavailing sorrow and seek the field there if we fall we fall with honor if we rise we rise to  glory  morcar talk not of glory to a wretch like me bereft of every hope there was a time when that enlivening call would have awaked my active spirit and this drooping heart bounded with joy but my matildas lost revenge alone  enter a messenger to siward with letters siward from walstcoff these it is well  retire exit messenger reads  how is this then all is lost he writes me here that williams fame in arms spite of his cruel and oppressive laws has raised him friends in every part already the northern rebels are dispersed and thousands flock to the royal standard to resist were madness  morcar and to yield were cowardice more shameful   siward what must we resolve on  morcar death the wretches only hope the wished  for end of every care but i would meet him clothed in all his terrors with his reeking spear dipped in the blood of an ungrateful mistress and a false happy rival then my siward shall thou behold me welcome the kind stroke and smile in agony  siward unhappy youth the storm beats hard upon thee but our fate will soon be fixed for william comes tomorrow  morcar tomorrow ha then something must be done and quickly too if william comes he comes to triumph over us then my siward who shall punish edwin who  shall wed matilda i cannot bear it  if thou love me siward for now i mean to try thy virtue swear by all the powers that wait on injured honor what ever my anxious soul requests of thee thou wilt not refuse it  siward by the hallowed flame of sacred friendship that within this breast since the first hour i sealed thee for my own with unremitted ardor still has glowed i will not  speak my morcar

again all powerful nature once more i am thine he shall not die  who is there  enter an officer my oswald fly fly to the tower this moment haste and save my brother  some base ruffian   officer if my lord you mean the noble prisoner there i fear it is too late this moment as i passed the citadel i saw a mangled corse drawn forth by siwards order   morcar slave thou lie away this moment bring me better news on peril of thy life exit officer who knows but heaven in gracious pity still may interpose and save me from the guilt it is not done it shall not  must not be  all is quiet yet i have not heard the signal the bell tolls hark he is dead my brothers dead  o cover me ye shades of everlasting night hide if ye can a murderer from himself ha see he comes his wounds are bleeding still his angry eyes glare full upon me speak  what woudst thou have matilda shall be thine he smiles and leaves me  he pauses and recovers himself twas but the error of my troubled soul o guilt guilt guilt throws himself down here will i lay me down and end my days in bitterness and anguish enter siward who is there ha siward here rises speak murderer speak where is my brother villain thou have snared my soul my honors stained my fame destroyed and my sweet peace of mind is lost for ever  siward matilda will restore it  morcar never never the price of blood no could matilda bring the vanquished world in dowry with her charms i would not wed her o could i recall one hasty moment one rash cruel act  but twas thy savage hand that   siward i received your orders twas my duty to obey them  morcar where slept thy friendship then thou know despair and madness urged me to it  but for thee  thy callous heart had never felt the pangs the agonies of disappointed love thou did not know matilda  cursed obedience how often has thy insolence opposed thy master and thy prince how often dared to thwart my will and execute thy own but when i bade thee do a deed of horror and shed a brothers blood  thou coudst obey me  siward away this is the trick of selfdelusion the common cant of hypocrites who rail at others guilt to mitigate their own i have been the mean the servile instrument of thy base vengeance but thou had prepared another a low ruffian to perform the bloody office i detest thee for it despise abhor thee  morcar thou were once my friend  siward henceforth i am thy foe  thou have destroyed the best of brothers and the best of men  morcar despised by siward  then my cup of sorrow is full indeed  but this shall  attempts to kill himself siward wrests the sword from him ha disarmed but coward guilt is weak as infancy it was not so before i murdered edwin  siward the murdrers punishment should be to live and shall be thine thou know not half thy guilt nor half thy sorrows i shall rend thy soul prepare thee for another deeper wound and know that edwin loved thee in his hand whilst mine was lifted up for his destruction i found this paper it is the counterpart of one he had dispatched to william read it and tremble at thy complicated guilt  morcar taking the paper what is here he pleads my pardon with the king ascribes my frantic zeal in edgars cause to illadvisd warmth and recommends his  murderer to mercy horrid thought i am the vilest most abandoned slave that ever disgraced humanity  o siward if thou have yet among the dying embers of our long friendship one remaining spark of kind compassion for the wretched morcar lend me thy aid to shake off the sad load of hated life that presses sore upon me  siward though you are no longer worthy of my friendship deaf to the cries of nature and the voice of holy truth that would have councild thee to better deeds yet has my foolish heart some pity for thee  after crimes like these there is but one way left  say will thou patient wait till i return  morcar i will  siward remember morcar you promised me  i have a draught within of wondrous power that in a moment lulls the tortured soul to sweet forgetfulness of all its woes i will haste and bring it thee twill give thee rest and peace exit siward morcar i hope for ever but where is the lost matilda who shall comfort that dear unhappy maid whom i have robbed of every bliss o save me from the sight ye pitying powers enter matilda she comes  distraction  matilda o my lord permit   morcar away  i know thee not  matilda not know me it is the poor distressed matilda who comes to ask forgiveness for the rage of frantic love the madness of despair that urged me to such wrath and bitterness of keen reproach but pardon  kneels generous morcar a womans weakness speak and make me blessed alas he hears me not  morcar matilda rise i pray thee leave me  weeps  matilda gracious heaven he weeps propitious omen o my lord those tears are the soft marks of sympathizing woe and seem to say i shall not plead in vain  morcar ask what thou will for know so dear i hold matildas happiness that here i swear if all the kingdoms of the peopled earth were mine to give i would lay them at her feet but much i fear they would not make her happy  matilda alas my lord matildas happiness is centered all in one dear precious jewel it is in thy keeping  edwin   morcar what of him  matilda is innocent  morcar i know it  matilda just and good he never meant to injure thee indeed he did not  morcar i believe it for his nature was ever mild and gentle  matilda good my lord you mock me  morcar no matilda speak go on and praise him i could talk to thee for ever of edwins virtues   matilda then thou woudst not hurt his precious life thou woudst not   morcar i would give a thousand worlds to save him  matilda woudst thou then my prayers are heard thou have forgiven all and i am happy speak is edwin free  morcar from every care  would i were half so blessed  matilda what mean you ha thy eyes are fixed with horror thy looks are wild what have thou done o speak  morcar matilda if thou come for edwins life it is too late  for edwin is no more  matilda and is my edwin slain  morcar aye basely murdered o twas the vilest most unnatral deed that ever   matilda blasted be the cruel hand that dealt the blow o may his guilty heart never taste of balmy peace or sweet repose  morcar but ever by the vulture conscience torn bleed inward still unpitied till he seek for refuge in the grave  matilda nor find it there  morcar it is well thy curses are accomplished all i feel em here within  for know  twas i i gave the fatal order and my friend my siward has too faithfully performed it  matilda siward impossible there dwells not then in human breast or truth or virtue  o unnatral brother  but i will be calm  morcar alas thy fate is happiness to mine for thou art innocent  matilda and soon i hope to be rewarded for it o my edwin matilda soon shall follow thee  thou think i am unarmed deserted doomed like thee to hated life but know i have a friend a bosomfriend and prompt as thine to enter on any bloody service i command draws a dagger morcar command it then for justice for revenge behold my bosom rises to the blow strike here and end a wretched murderer   matilda no that were a mercy thou have not deserved i shall not seek revenge in morcars death in mine thou shall be wretched  attempts to stab herself morcar lays hold of the dagger morcar stop matilda  stop thy rash hand the weight of edwins blood sits heavy on my heart o do not pierce it with added guilt  matilda no more i must be gone to meet my edwin who already chides my lingering steps and beckons me away  morcar yet hear me o if penitence and prayer if deep contrition sorrow and remorse could bring him back to thy desiring eyes o with what rapture would i yield him now to thee matilda  bear me witness  ha starts it is he  look up dear injured maid  he comes to claim my promise  matilda it is it is my edwin enter siward and edwin edwin runs and embraces matilda morcar o unexpected bliss what gracious hand   siward behold the cordial draught i promised you i knew thy noble nature when the storm of passion had subsided would abhor a deed so impious  it is the only time that siward ever did deceive his friend can thou forgive  morcar forgive thee o thou art my guardian angel sent by gracious heaven to save me from perdition o my brother i blush to stand before thee  will thou take from thse polluted hands one precious gift twill make thee full amends for all thy wrongs accept her and be happy he joins the hands of edwin and matilda then turning to siward that vile slave whom i employed   siward i guessed his horrid purpose watched every step and as the villain aimed his poniard at the guiltless edwins breast turned sudden round and plunged it in his own the bloody corse was dragged   morcar i know the rest o siward from what weight of endless woe has thy blessed hand preserved me  edwin o my matilda how shall we repay our noble benefactor much i owe to gallant siward but to morcar more tou gavst me life but my kind generous brother enhancd the gift and blessed me with matilda  matilda to morcar words are too poor to thank thee as i ought accept this tribute of a grateful heart these tears of joy and o may every curse my frantic grief for edwin poured upon thee be changed to dearest blessings on thy head  morcar alas thy blessings cannot reach me guilt may plead for pardon but can never boast a claim to happiness i only ask a late forgiveness if a life of sorrow and deep remorse can wash my crimes away let em be buried with me in oblivion and do not curse the memory of  morcar turning to edwin o edwin say can thou forgive the crime of frantic love of madness and despair  edwin as in my latest hour from heaven i hope its kind indulgence for my errors past even so my brother from my soul i pardon and pity thee  morcar then i shall die in peace  edwin talk not of death my brother thou must live to see our happiness complete to hear my sweet matilda pour forth all her heart in raprous thanks to thee and to thy friend and grateful edwin bless thee for thy bounties  morcar it must not be i know too much already of morcars weakness and matildas power they are not to be trusted no my edwin morcar shall never interrupt thy joys far from thy fight and from the haunts of men in some deep distant solitude retired to pious sorrow will i dedicate my short remains of wretched life and strive to make my peace with heaven and wronged matilda and if perchance in aftertimes some bard struck with the native horrors of my tale should bid the historic muse record it  let him by my example teach a future age the dire effects of loose unbridled rage teach thoughtless men their passions to control and curb the sallies of the impetuous soul lest they experience worse than morcars woe nor find a siward  to prevent the blow  finis preparing for the press a complete translation of the works of lucian from the greek  by thomas francklin the translator of sophocles  subscriptions to this
