source of heliconian stream thou teeming topic and thou lofty theme where art where nature leads the soul along and taste and commerce crown the copious song where vast variety the heart expands and giving grandeur opens wide her hands with natures noblest gifts regales the soul each part a paradise  a heaven the whole where health where vigor quaffs the winnowd air and drives far off the ugly fiend despair my muse o clifton would thy summits climb and hand thy beauties down to latest time to ages yet unborn thy charms display in numbers lasting as the lamp of day would inspiration prompt my proud desire the song and subject should at once expire how epic wonders here the soul delight there distant beauties strain the impassioned sight see rocks coeval with the world arise whose cloudswept groves seem waving in the skies by ages furrowed deep with timeplowd mien with adverse frowns with fracturd foreheads seen whilst neptune rolls his rapid tides between see wealth quick flying in the freighted gale see east see west expand the impatient sail here earth here ocean mountains rocks unite and in harmonious discord give delight there princely piles in classic taste expressed in grecian garb in roman grandeur dressed a line of palaces oerlook the town that with a jealous pride the prospect crown on different heights they stand in stately strife like rank and dignity in moral life in various climax court the attracted eyes the objects changing as the structures rise from pile to pile a prospect new appears and now the hills and now the river cheers see numerous ships with sudden glance shoot by the sails and streamers only strike the eye between the embracing banks for ever green they seem to move on land their bulk unseen by glad propitious gales impatient blown with rapid speed and motion not their own see next a dundry steeple on yon hill appear yon distant hill the proteus of the year from whose oftchanging look the watchful swain foretells the weather and avoids the rain the blue aetherial hills see last uprise in azure robe to meet the bending skies here pendent gardens with rich fruits appear the ripening bounty of the lavish year the temple raised above the group see sway and all the extended various view survey divine ambition in the choice is found nay taste itself marked out the sacred ground with holy pride the lofty seat to show and reign exulting over the world below where some on others look with scornful phlegm whilst others look with equal scorn on them with molehill malice dash the cup of life an inch in difference makes the mountain strife from proud comparison we quaff our all that source of human sweets or human gall at which the restless soul impatient pants begets her anguish and creates her wants oh frantic fallacy oh brainsick need shall thy sleek beaver make my bosom bleed thy better buckled belt make me repine or if thy nails be closer cut than mine shall i my lips with inward anguish bite if thy black kittens tail be tipped with white or if thy leeks than mine should greener grow and make thy fancied bliss my real woe envy in courts and cottages will dwell nay climb to heaven itself though born in hell in every living bosom lurks this pest but reigns unrivaled in the human breast on reasons throne usurps a thorny part and plants a thousand daggers in the heart the moral here and natural world we see in wise gradation and in just degree where all constructed for one systems sake a happy heterogeneous prospect make where reasons scale from class to class can fall and measure equal bounty dealt to all each lot can justly prize in fortunes wheel but not from what we have but what we feel from moral strains let my glad numbers soar and yon coincidence with speed explore where strong extremes produce a striking taste a gothic building by a greek embraced in contrast kind the feasted eye to fill and mark the summit of the social hill where goldney acts the meek the moral part and daily works new miracles of art where he like moses makes the water flow his gold the rock obeys but not his blow his gold that conquers natures hardest laws and fountains from the rocky center draws his well spent gold a twofold transport gives the garden gladdens and the labourer lives such toils refresh at once the heart and head give taste a banquet and the rustic bread make nature wonder at her thinwove mask and truth survey her own transparent task the masters pleasure with the improvement grows in all the rapture that a parent knows when wise discretion weighs the unerring coin and makes his pleasure with his prudence join then sweet ambition bids the heart begin for genius feels a paradise within and though at first her task may seem too hard the accomplished wonder is its own reward then fancy triumphs when by judgment led and wears the wellearnd wreath around her head without a blush her own bright work surveys improves the rapture and enjoys the praise a new creation lifts the admiring lid here nature looks abroad here art lies hid over the grand form her mantle meek she flings but ornaments are arbitrary things yet even there should fancy never stray from natures path or seek a wiser way art is but nature in her best array with simple elegance she smiling stands in blameless garb put on by goldneys hands him genius taught the tasteful eye to cheer with sober judgment whispering in his ear as wise discretion rules the realms of wit the happy medium here he happy hit where each bright incident performs its part with inward rapture melts the masters heart and each congenial guest with joy invades the fountains grottos and the clear cascades the tall parterres that lift the comely face and yield at once such majesty and grace with every growing beauty in its place a minor stow on cliftons crown we find in epic meekness like its masters mind here buildings boast a robe though rich yet chaste the robe of judgment and of ripened taste convenience here is mixed with manly grace yet ornament but holds the second place to human frames these structures seem akin with aspect fair while reason rules within these domes discretion decks and fancy cheers palladios style in pattys plans appears himself a master with the first to stand for clifton owes her beauties to his hand hence to the vale by mountain rocks secured by natures own immortal hand immured the vale where skreend avona sinks and swells that warping leads me to the hallowed wells i wander joyful with unbounded glee from all i raptured hear and raptured see to where sweet health her farsought balm bestows and beauty with rekindled fervor glows above this fountain of supreme delight two ponderous rocks surprise and please the sight with bending brows of nearer

orient realms bestow the cheek to vermil and relume the eye and make disease that pallid fantom fly from all his windings in the nerves and limbs when through the laxed tubes he lazy swims the sizy creeping tardy torpid flood that long in hesitating lakes has stood with loaded bane to blast the balmy blood with pining atrophy and spitting gore and all the wastings of the vital store with

us there with native charms thy continent regales with more true grandeur than at proud versailles where fiction natures loaded face belies with arbitrary masks and false disguise where simple truth

lovely lawn that spreads both far and wide where thinsprung trees expand their stately pride invites the eye with hospitable air there spring exults and summer loiters there thence to a sounding gloomy vale we walk where ecchos to responsive ecchos talk a deephid gurgling noise the car invades from craggy falls and murmuring cascades with vocal streams invisible that glide where jealous shades the hoarse musicians hide by nature taught to pour her notes along in sounds sonorous and in lofty song that all the aspiring theater can sill the sounds sonorous toss from hill to hill now up

before when death set out with each destructive ball bid bristol tremble and her temples fall from that black battery on brandon brow the mark of mischief then and horror now or waked by soaring larks from that sad dream the mariners glad voice the dawning gleam shake off the specter of delusive night enjoy the breeze and quaff the morning bright and call no more that retrospect to sight but follow fancy to the lunar sphere or mix with fairies that inhabit here deep in the bosom of the hill they hide or on the rainbows radiant circle ride or mount on gossomers in troops to play or bask like butterflies the morning ray often with their shapes they shift their insect sport in brandons deep alcove they keep their court with concert masquerade and rout and ball like human fantoms in the aerial hall the gliding shapes at musics soft command in measures move whilst echo forms the band in sounds remote from dull made mortal ears reflected from the music of the spheres assemblies drums and even cards are there with tunbridge toys with tea and chinaware with eyebrow pruners dentists those that dance the curlcomposing hand the fingered lance with fifty operators more from france are

swells they often swarm like bees about the wells the balmy breath of beauty there they sip like atoms fall on lysaghts fragrant lip from cheek to cheek from chin to dimple fly now on the pendant perch and now the eye now on the shape divine and air they gaze now clap their little wings and joyful praise in the gay dance they mingle with the throng and on the streams of music float along our stormy notes their filmy fabrics shake but bodies of condensed air they make they rob the rainbow and the etherial lawn the plaited clouds that deck the crimson dawn these to sharp fairy eyes appear from far like the first blushes of the morning star with all the tints that vernal breezes bring when nature wakes and flora leads the spring to household cares their thoughts they often apply but still on mortals keep a watchful eye the ways of men their wiser thoughts engage in registers laid up from age to age these records deep in adamant are cast as long as brandon nay the world shall last they still compare the present with the past to faithful lovers they still lend an ear the fairies love and have their loveplots here the pleasing pangs they often by turns endure like us they feel em

intrigue to virtue still a faithful shield they prove and in the sunbeam often like motes they move unseen unheeded by the yielding fair as honors lifeguard they do duty there when felon cupid and the foe draw nigh in fearful ambush when his arrows fly and honors on the very point to die their guardian task performed they silent glide to brandon back their subtle shapes they hide on folds of lillies and of roses lay their little heads to rest and dream till day or rushing rapid like a whirlwind forth they drive the dazzling dancers of the north those radiant bands their breath about can
