a true character of mr pope the second edition sir i have read over the libel which i received from you the day before yesterday yesterday i received the same from another hand with this character of the secret author of so much stupid calumny  that he is one whom god and nature have marked for want of common honesty and his own contemptible rhimes for want of common sense that those rhimes have found great success with the rabble which is a word almost as comprehensive as mankind but that the town which supports him will do by him as the dolphin did by the shipwrackd monkey drop him as soon as it finds him out to be a beast whom it fondly now mistakes for a human creature it is says he a very little but very comprehensive creature in whom all contradictions meet and all contrarieties are reconciled when at one and the same time like the ancient centaurs he is a beast and a man a whig and a tory a virulent papist and yet forsooth a pillar of the church of england a writer at one and the same time of guardians and of examiners an assertor of liberty and of the dispensing power of kings a rhimester without judgment or reason and a critic without common sense a jesuitical professor of truth a base and foul pretender to candor a barbarous wretch who is perpetually boasting of humanity and good nature a lurking waylaying coward and a stabber in the dark who is always pretending to magnanimity and to sum up all villains in one a traytorfriend one who has betrayed all mankind and seems to have taken his great rule of life from the following lines of hudibras  for it is easier to betray than ruin any other way as the earth is soonest undermined by vermin impotent and blind he is a professor of the worst religion which he laughs at and yet has most inviolably observed the most execrable maxim in it that no faith is to be kept with heretics a wretch whose true religion is his interest and yet so stupidly blind to that interest that he often meets her without knowing her and very grossly affronts her his villainy is but the natural effect of his want of understanding as the sowerness of vinegar proceeds from its want of spirit and yet says my friend notwithstanding that shape and that mind of his some men of good understanding value him for his rhimes as they would be fond of an asseinego that could sing his part in a catch or of a baboon that could whistle walsingham the grosser part of his gentle readers believe the beast to be more than man as ancient rusticks took his ancestors for those demi gods they call fauns and satyrs  this was the character which my friend gave of the author of this miserable libel which immediately made me apprehend that it was the very same person who endeavored to expose you in a billinsgate libel at the very time that you were doing him a favor at his own earnest desire who attempted to undermine mr philips in one of his guardians at the same time that the crocodile smiled on him embraced him and called him friend who wrote a prologue in praise of cato and teasd lintott to publish remarks upon it who at the same time that he openly extolled sir richard steel in the highest manner secretly published the infamous libel of dr andrew tripe upon him who as he is in shape a monkey is so in his every action in his senseless chattering and his merry grimaces in his doing hourly mischief and hiding himself in the variety of his ridiculous postures and his continual shiftings from place to place from persons to persons from thing to thing but whenever he scribbles he is emphatically a monkey in his awkard servile imitations for in all his productions he has been an imitator from his imitation of virgils bucolicks to this present imitation of horace  his pastorals were writ in imitation of virgil  his rape of the lock of boileau  his essay on criticism of the present duke of buckingham and of my lord rofcommon  his windsorforest of sir john denham  his ode upon st caecilia of mr dryden and  his temple of fame of chaucer  thus for fifteen years together this ludicrous animal has been a constant imitator yet he has rather mimickd these great geniuss than he has imitated them he has given a false and a ridiculous turn to all their good and their great qualities and has as far as in him lies burlesqud them without knowing it but after having been for fifteen years as it were an imitator he has made no proficiency his first imitations though bad are rather better than the succeeding and this last imitation of horace the most execrable of them all  for as a dog that turns the spit bestirs himself and plies his feet to climb the wheel but all in vain his own weight brings him down again and still he is in the self same place where at his setting out he was so in the circle of the arts does he advance his natural parts hud if you should chance sir to show this letter to any of your acquaintance who have perused his senseless calumnies they may think perhaps that we follow his example and retort slander upon him i desire that you would have the goodness to assure such that in the moral part of his character and all that relates to matter of fact there is no manner of rhetoric used all is exactly and literally true for which we appeal to those poetical persons with whom we have been most conversant in covent garden we have always been of opinion that he who invents or pretends or falsifies matter of fact in order to slander any one deserves an infamous punishment and we have always had before our eyes the following verses out of horace   absentem qui rodit amicum qui non desendit alio culpante solutos qui captat risus hominum famamque dicacis fingere qui non visa potest commissa tacere qui nequit hic niger est hunc tu romani caveto etc as to what relates to the person of this wretched libeller if in that there may be some trifling exaggerations yet even that is not designed to deceive or impose upon any to whom you mey happen to show it but is intended to lead them to an exact knowledge of the truth by a very little enlarging upon it  but if any one appears to be concerned at our upbraiding him with his natural deformity which did not come by his own fault but seems to be the curse of god upon him we desire that person to consider that this little monster has upbraided people with their calamities and their diseases which are either false or past or which he himself gave them by administering poison to them we desire that person to consider that calamities and diseases if they are neither false nor past are common to all men that a man can no more help his calamities and his diseases than a monster can his deformity that there is no misfortune but what the generality of mankind are liable too and that there is no one disease but what all the rest of men are subject too whereas the deformity of this libeller is visible present lasting unalterable and peculiar to himself it is the mark of god and nature upon him to give us warning that we should hold no society with him as a creature not of our original nor of our species and they who have refused to take this warning which god and nature have given them and have in spite of it by a senseless presumption ventured to be familiar with him have severely suffered for it by his perfidiousness they tell me he has been lately pleased to say that it is doubtful if the race of men are the offspring of adam or of the the worms a satire stanza   devil but if it is doubtful as to the race of men it is certain at least that his original is not from adam but from the devil by his constant and malicious lying and by that angel face and form of his it is plain that he wants nothing but horns and tail to be the exact resemblance both in shape and mind of his infernal father thus sir i return you truth for slander and a just satire for an extravagant libel which is therefore ridiculously called an imitation of horace you know very well sir that the difference between horace and such an imitation of him is almost infinite and i leave you to consider what influence such an imitation must have upon his readers of both kinds both upon those who are acquainted with that great poet and with those that know him not how contemptible it must render horace to the latter and his imitator to the former who when they shall behold the ghost of their old and their valued friend raised up before them by this awkard conjurer in a manner so ridiculously frightful when they behold him thus miserably mangled and reflect at once with contempt and horror upon this barbarous usage of him will not be able to refrain from exclaiming in the most vehement manner  qualis adest quantum mutatus ab illo etc they must think that their old and valued friend had a prophetic spirit and seemed to foretell the usage which he has lately received from this barbarian and his brethren when in the fourth ode of his third book he cried  visam britannos hospitibus feros but as for the other sorts of readers the readers who have no knowledge of horace but from this contemptible imitation what must they think sir of those great men who extol him for the second genius of the romanempire illustrious for so many great qualities which are to be sound in him alone must they not look upon all his admirers as so many learned idiots and upon the romanempire it self as a vast nation of fools  you know very well sir that as horace had a firmness of judgment and a sureness and truth of taste he never once formed a wrong judgment to himself either of the actions of men in general or of the particular worth and merit of authors he had an honor and a rectitude of soul that would have obliged him to die a thousand times rather than to write any thing against his conscience  pejuque letho flagitium timet he was capable indeed of being provoked to expose either a fool or a knave whom otherwise he might have suffered to have remained in obscurity but the most barbarous usage of his most malicious enemy could never urge him to slander that enemy from this force and clearness of his understanding and this noble rectitude of his will it has proceeded that all his censures are like so many decrees that have been all affirmed by posterity the only supreme court of judicature for the distribution of fame and infamy from which mankind can have no appeal that supreme impartial incorruptible judicature has the same opinions of persons and things and especially of authors that he had the same high value for tibullus for pollio for varius for virgil and the same contempt for bavius for maevius for crispinus for alpinus for fannius and for a thousand more  the same justness and fineness of discernment and the same noble rectitude of will appear in the french satirist which make the most considerable share of his merit and the most distinguishing part of his character if we will believe what he says of himself in his admirable epistle to monsieur seigneley you know sir that what boileau says there of himself is exactly true in fact the persons whom he has attacked in his writings have been for the most part authors and most of those authors poets the censures which he has passed on them have been confirmed by all europe but at the same time that judicious poet has been as liberal of his praise to his contemporaries who were excellent in their kinds as corneille racine moliere and la fontaine nay he was generous enough to defend racine and to support and strengthen him when a clamorous crowd of miserable authors endeavored to oppress him as appears by his admirable epistle addressed to that tragic poet  you and i both know very well sir that there has been never wanting a flood of such authors neither in england nor france who being like this imitator in every respect the reverse of horace in honor in discernment in genius have always combined to atack any thing that has apeard above their own dull level while they have hugged and admired each other authors who have thought to be too hard for their adversaries by opposing billinsgate to reason and dogmatical assertion to moral demonstration and who have been idiots enough to belive that their noise and impudence could alter the nature of things and the notions of men of sense  of all these libellers the present imitator is the most impudent and the most incorrigible who has lately pestered and plagued the world with five or six scandalous libels in prose that are all of them at once so stupid and so malicious that men of sense are doubtful if they should attribute them to the libellers native idiotism or to accidental madness  in all these libels the chief objects of his scandal and malice have been persons of distinguished merit and among these he has fallen upon none so foully as his friends and benefactors among these latter he has attacked no one so often or with so much ridiculous impotent malice as sir richard blackmore who is estimable for a thousand good and great qualities and what time has he chosen to do this why just after that gentelman had laid very great oblegations on him and just after he had obliged the world with so many editions of his excellent poem upon creation which poem alone is worth all the folios that this libeller will ever write and which will render its author the delight and admiration of posterity so that it is hard to determine whether this libeller is more remarkable for his judgment or his gratitude  i dare venture to affirm that there is not an author living so little qualified for a censurer as himself i know nothing for which he is so ill qualified as he is for judging unless it be for translating homer he has neither taste nor judgment but is if you will pardon a quibble the very necessity of parnassus for he has none of the poetical laws or if he has the letter of any he has it without the spirit whenever he pretends to criticize i fancy i see shamwell or cheatly in the squire of alsatia cutting a sham or banter to abuse some bubble the presace is full of gross errors and he has shown himself in it a dogmatical ignorant impudent second hand critic as for the poem however he may cry up homer for being every where a grecian  trumpeter in the original i can see no trumpeter in the translator but the king of spains but since his friends will allege it is easy to say this i desire it may go for nothing till i have so plainly proved it that the most foolish and the most partial of them shall not be able to deny it  as for what they call his verses he has like mr bays got a notable knack of rhiming and writing smooth verse but without either genius or good sense or any tolerable knowledge of english as i believe i shall show plainly when i come to the rest of his imitations as for his translation of homer i could never borrow it till this very day and design to read it over to morrow so that shortly you may expect to hear more of it i will only tell you beforehand that homer seems to me to be untranslatable in any modern language that great poet is just in his desings admirable in his characters and for the most part exact in his reasoning and correct in his noble sentiments but these are excellencies which may be already seen in the prose translations of him  the qualities which so admirably distinguish homer from most other writers and which therefore a translator in verse is particularly obliged to show because they cannot be shown in prose are the beauty of his diction and the various harmony of his versification but it is as ridiculous to pretend to make these shine out in english rhimes as it would be to emulate upon a bagpipe the solemn and majestic thorough basse of an organ  but you may suddenly expect more of this if what i have already said happens to entertain you  london may        i am sir your etc  finis
