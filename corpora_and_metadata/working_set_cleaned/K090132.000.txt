the fountain of health or a view of nature  wherein the causes of distempers are philosophically explained with the true rules for practice in several critical symptoms in both acute and chronical diseases  by henry burdon  malo enim invideri quam ingloria morte corripi vel rebus clarissimis obducere tenebras london printed for the author      to be had at his house in henrietta street covent garden  the preface since i present this book to the world in general without dedicating it to any person to protect me it may be necessary to say something in my own defense  what i write is from remarks on nature and practical observations with an intention to improve the method of curing diseases for the art of healing is in a declining way the practice of physic is become a perfect ceremony that strong beam which ought to support it is divided into different branches here is one man shall be a physician another a surgeon one an apothecary another a chemist etc thus in this present age each man sticks to his particular branch and thinks it scandal to meddle or interfere with any more than one part only but in former ages a man was not deemed worthy to be called a physician unless he was master of every one of these following arts  first physiology or a knowledge of human nature  secondly anatomy or a knowledge of the parts of human bodies  thirdly pharmacy and chemistry or the method of making all manner of medicines  indeed the first and principal point is judging and distinguishing the diseases and causes of diseases but it is impossible for a physician to be perfect in this point until he is perfect in anatomy and surgery for i call surgery the practical part of anatomy there being more experience gained from accidental practice and observations upon living bodies than from lectures and courses of anatomy over dead bodies  likewise it is as necessary for a physician to know the different qualities of medicines that he may be able to relieve the different disorders which human bodies are afflicted with therefore every practitioner ought to know the preparing of all kind of medicines for both internal and external uses because the maker of medicines or things of any kind is most able to know the power of such things as he himself has made  paracelsus called physic a short art meaning that when it is short and easy it is most perfect for where the practice is long and tedious the patient suffers and when writings are long and tedious the readers mind is no ways improved thereby but books are too commonly esteemed according to the fame of the author and when any thing new is published the first enquiry is who is the author instead of what has he wrote  although i say something in opposition to the present rules in physic i do not rise up against the physicians in general for i know some excellent men in practice whose methods i always observed to improve my own thoughts so far i am indebted therefore i will say nothing that shall offend the wise and worthy but against ignorance and envy there can be no defense since people will always have different tastes some persons like a surgeon for being diligent in dressing a green wound twice a day when certainly the oftener a green wound is opened the longer it must be before it heals because the air makes a wound more tender and hinders the fibers from uniting others like a physician under whose care they are always sick  and some people like to read books which confound their understanding i might name a certain author in great esteem who at his beginning takes up five pages in explaining the word disease now i will explain the meaning of the word disease in a few lines  suppose i find a person uneasy i may then say he has a disease because he is not at ease and so may we say of temper and distemper thus i would make the path of practice plain and easy therefore i will begin first with the nerves and senses by way of introduction  the introduction i have observed that several authors who have wrote upon the animal spirits without explaining themselves have been ridiculed and condemned for picking out an abstruse term to build an argument upon and as my thoughts may lead me to make use of that term i will tell the reader what i mean thereby in hopes it may in some measure defend me from calumny or at least vindicate other authors for certainly every man has an idea of what he writes indeed he may not measure it out to the understanding of every reader  therefore when i say the animal spirits i mean the principal seat of knowledge where the prime sense gives immediate judgment between pain and pleasure and these following gates lead thereto as seeing hearing tasting smelling and feeling  yet the mind or animal spirits can conceive either fear grief or joy without drawing it in by any of those organs but when one person infects another with either fear joy or pain it must then be carried to the prime seat of knowledge by some one of the five senses and when any hurt or surprise infection of fear or malignity of any kind reaches the animal spirits or the prime seat of sense from thence is shown an antipathy in all the nerves by a rigorous shivering and shaking of every muscle throughout the whole body and it is then as in holy writ that the keepers of the house shall tremble fears being in the way  now i must own the liquidum nervorum or rather the nerves themselves may properly be called the animal spirits  but nearer to the fountain head more crystal flows the silver stream for certainly the nerves are governed by the mind and force or quickness of thought as is plainly demonstrated when we catch a flying ball or when we defend our heads from a blow our arm is then moved by the nerves guiding the muscles yet the nerves are directed by the mind for although the performances and economy of the nerves are noble they are not designed by nature to contract or extend a muscle without order from the mind or prime seat of sense  moreover when it happens contrary to nature that any of the nerves contract a muscle without commission from the mind that muscle so moved is then cramped or in convulsion  therefore as the mind commands the nerves the mind or thought must be the animal spirit likewise the mind must be the throne of the soul  thus in pursuit of nature as one hard cause we overtake still harder stand before us so from cause to cause our thoughts are led even to that mighty power the sun by whose beams we live move and generate  without that warmth and lively light so mortal cold this globe would be that nature must in darkness fix and every thing that is living dye for the sun is natures lord the first power from god and the only cause of the course and changes of things on this earth  the moon has no influence over human bodies nor over any thing on this globe indeed the tide keeps time with the moon but it is because the moon and the earth both have the same circular motion to the sun  i would demonstrate how the tide is caused by the atmosphere pressing against the sea as the earth moves and how the wind and combustions of weather are caused by a fermentation in the atmosphere but it would be tedious here and keep me from what i propose which is chiefly to treat on distempers and human nature  of malignant fevers fevers commonly called malignant being in their nature most subtle and severe which prey upon the animal spirits some time before the blood is infected  this kind of fever does not proceed from contagious particles in the air nor is it infectious any otherwise than by our being afraid of it and thus it gets possession into the prime fancy or animal spirits by conceiving a fear of death within ourselves upon any slight illness or sudden surprise of danger and the most dangerous symptom is when the thoughts have drawn in an apprehension and dread of death upon the spirits for without this dread it is not a real malignant fever  the sick is seized at first with a shivering and coldness a weary pain and weakness throughout the whole body proceeding from that disorder upon the nerves and spinal marrow which render the sinews and muscles incapable of doing their offices likewise a continual reaching to vomit and a watchfulness upon the spirits which hinders him from sleeping although he is attended with a great drowsiness these are the symptoms of a malignant fever at the first approach before the blood is inflamed the patient should then by all means submit himself to his bed and not strive against nature for she will not be conquered  now a physician being called he prescribes according to his judgment for physicians differ in their methods of practice as they do in their opinions and full as much as human bodies differ in their constitutions some will boldly give purging medicines others give sudorisicks and some blister more and more even to the last gasp  i do not pretend to be a pilot i only wish the wanderer may know which path will mislead him as for blistering i cannot see why it should do any hurt yet i may reasonably make an objection since practice has convinced me that blisters afford no relief in real malignant fevers purging is an ignorant proceeding and dangerous for all sudden evacuations or immoderate discharges add to the rigor and anxiety of the mind therefore must tend to destroy life rather than save sudorificks are very proper if we use such as may bring on gentle sweats for if the sweats come on excessively nature will be reduced so low as to be past defending herself so critical are these malignant fevers and likewise if we find a difficulty in bringing the patient to sweat we must forbear heating medicines otherwise we shall put the blood into a violent ebullition and hurry the patient out of the world when perhaps if he had been supplied with a proper regimen yielding to nature he might have recovered by the help of gentle cardiack and diluting medicines the lapis contrayerva and testaceous powders repeated often and given in a julep of blackcherry water syrup of saffron and compound piony water will help to correct the acidity in the stomach and cherish the animal spirits for if we can find out how and where nature is oppressed we then must use means to set her free that she may on her own accord bring on such sweats as are not only necessary and wonderful but highly preferable to all that can be forced by art  the only sudorifick medicine that i ever found effectual in malignant and pestilential fevers is the elixir of vipers as i have set down in the chapter of inflammatory fevers in it there is a subtle virtue which never fails to bring on the moderate and necessary sweats and as if it were a specific temperates the animal spirits without augmenting the heat in the blood but it is impossible to set a rule to practice by in either acute or chronical diseases nor even how to order a proper regimen or a fit liquor for the patient in a malignant fever perhaps the physician may order chicken broth which certainly is very proper if the patient can drink as much as his fever requires but after he has drank one sort of liquor five of six times he bears so great an antipathy to it that his stomach will not take the same liquor any longer yet he is confined to it for several days this way of restraining the patient to one sort of liquor is barbarous if rightly considered for we should endeavor to find out which sort of liquor he likes and divert him with variety of liquors first one sort and then another by this means he will drink as much as is necessary proper liquors in fevers are broths sagetea sackwhey pectoral drinks white drink etc  moreover if the patient should have a longing or desire for a draught of small beer we should by all means let him have it with a piece of bread put into it burning hot this sometimes is of singular service by affording a satisfaction to the mind for every thing that is grateful to a person in a fever gives a courage and better enables him to endure his affliction  it may be of some weight to set down the qualifications of a good nurse one who is cheerful obedient and watchful not one that reads sighs and whispers in the room as if she was talking to a spirit but this i mention by the bye because the patient never sleeps in a malignant fever being so very watchful he only slumbers and when he hears any whispering he is affrighted and commonly starts up to listen so it infects his thoughts with fresh dreads and thus it hurts him because the malignity of this fever is rigor and fears upon the mind or animal spirits therefore i advise the nurse to speak out briskly or be quite silent likewise to move briskly or sit quite still  but as i was saying before how unseasonably proper remedies may be applied as in this fever bleeding may be of great service when the blood comes to too high a fermentation but if on the contrary we should bleed at the first approach of the disease we shall thereby conceal the fever upon the spirits and depress nature insomuch that the patient dies in a languid manner  nor do i digress by bringing in comparatively how improper it would be to give the jesuits bark in the cold shivering fit of an intermittent fever i might note several other proofs while i am treating of malignant fevers since the word malign alludes to all that is unfavourable severe and dangerous yet i will explain the nature of pestilential and inflammatory fevers the small pox and other distempers singularly and faithfully as far as i have observed by looking from one cause into another  of pestilential fevers pestilential fevers are in no wise more dangerous than the fever described in the foregoing chapter although the name may sound more terrible indeed pestilential fevers are very fatal in one respect by running through whole families and towns for several miles as if the air was loaded with contagious particles  i believe the wisest men that ever wrote were always lost by looking into the causes and nature of infection and as several authors have attempted it i will venture to give my opinion in hopes it may in some measure conduct those men into right notions that are capable of judging mine to be wrong  then in my way of thinking infection most commonly is drawn into human bodies by the power of sympathy and antipathy working upon the nerves or the mind as for example when one person complains to another that he feels an unwholesome rawness in the air the other whom he complains to will be apt to draw the same notion into his own mind likewise when one in company gapes or yawns for sleep others in the same company who bear the least sympathy to drowsiness will be soon seized with the like gaping or yawning besides it is worth observing how a dampness in a room just washed or damp linen hanging in a room will infect those who bear an antipathy thereto yet it very seldom hurts those who are in no wise afraid of such like dampnesses and also as the sweet notes and swells in music only elevates such souls as feel its charms so any particulr impureness in the air can only infect such bodies as are fit to receive that kind of impureness and thus it comes to pass that the small pox cannot infect those who have had the small pox before because their bodies are not capable of receiving that kind of infection and most certainly every ones body is not at all times in a disposition for admitting in a pestilential contagion and as nature has ordered that such fevers as begin with great violence by the same rule shall the sooner come to a crisis  a pestilential fever is attended with various symptoms from the beginning through the whole course but commonly at its first coming it seizes with great violence the head stomach and lungs the blood soon takes the flame in this fever and the heat being then in the greatest degree nature begins to strive to force out the enemy either by carbuncles biles eruptions in the skin or excessive sweats and sometimes a violent looseness which is the worst of all the foregoing symptoms and i can scarce believe that nature brings on a looseness of her own accord i rather think it is caused by forcing the sick to take some medicines or persuading him to eat some victuals his weak stomach cannot bear the patient finds relief from all the other symptoms for as the blood receives the fever the animal spirits are in some measure relieved therefore the physician must always endeavor to promote the foregoing symptoms since it is certain unless some of em concur the patient must die in a few hours by the animal spirits being overset with the violence of the fever  there commonly is a continual kecking in drawing in the breath which is a strong proof that raw and unwholesome air has made an impression upon the lungs by this disorder in drawing in the breath the stomach becomes very weak and unfit to receive many medicines therefore as alexipharmacks are most proper we must be very careful not to give such as are too loading  pestilential fevers require a great quantity of diluting liquors for which reason we must endeavor as much as possible to relieve the disorder in the stomach and lungs that he may be able to drink as much as is necessary  blisters are of great service in pestilential fevers for relieving both the head and lungs and to correct the stomach let the patient take the following draught every four hours  take salt of wormwood a scruple juice of lemons half an ounce mixed together in a large cup and stir it till it has done fermenting then put to it an ounce of barley cinnamon water as this draught must be repeated it will be convenient to mix up six times the quantity at once and divide it  if the fever or the heat in the blood should be very violent it will be necessary to keep the body open by glysters or gentle lenitives such as manna or a decoction made of tamerinds and senna of each two drams and salt of wormwood ten grains boiled in two ounces of water as soon as it boils take if from the fire and strain it off before it is quite cold this is an excellent cathartick yet if misapplied it is liable to do mischief  i have been told of bleeding to the quantity of an hundred ounces at once but they must know very little of anatomy that believe it yet i confess in my opinion when we bleed in pestilential fevers we ought to take a large quantity in order to assuage the heat or violence of the fever for by taking the common quantity which is about ten ounces we only depress the natural course of the distemper and prolong the grievances the patient lies under  the testaceous powders are hurtful in this fever by reason that the stomach abounds with phlegm and oily medicines are improper for no other reason than the stomach being weak and cannot bear em  thus the symptoms of every disease must always indicate what remedies and when they ought to be applied only let this be a standing rule what medicines soever are fit to be given in pestilential fevers ought to be made up in little quantities and repeated often  i should be glad to find out better rules but so critical and various are the symptoms in fevers that he may be deemed an exceeding good practitioner that does no hurt in them  of inflammatory fevers fevers under this denomination affect the body by a flux of inflamed blood falling on particular parts caused frequently by drinking cold liquors or some sudden coldness in the air at a time when the body is overheated so this inflammatory fever comes in either a pleurisy a quinzy or a st anthonys fire  these fevers are not without danger although the animal spirits be not infested with dread and malignity yet nature may be overset by the violent heat in the blood  in these kind of fevers it is necessary to keep the body open by cooling glysters and diluting purgatives for relief is given by all moderate evacuations bleeding in particular sweating is of great service only sudorificks are so very apt to inflame the blood but our method of practice is so common in those cases that i need not mention bleeding blistering and other applications my design is only to set down such things as have not been explained hitherto and such things as may be useful hereafter for which reason i will set down a fomentation for the part affected in a st anthonys fire which i have experienced and know to be valuable  take a pint of limewater make it boiling hot put to it a pint of rectified spirit of wine it will be of a right heat and must be applied thus wrap a linen cloth not woollen round or upon the inflammation so that the cloth may be four or five in thickness then pour this mixture through the cloth upon the inflamed part this repeated three times a day without taking off the cloth is much preferable to camphorated spirit of wine poultices or any kind of hot fomentation yet we must use inward means at the same time to cool the body and temper the fermentation in the blood  but it happens sometimes that these fevers are attended with all the ill symptoms of a malignant fever which is very fatal to the patient and renders the cure more difficult to the physician for although the blood being sizy indicates both bleeding blistering and other evacautions yet the rigor upon the animal spirits contradicts that way of proceeding because both bleeding and blistering depress nature and irritate the animal spirits and is apt to bring on greater rigor and dread therefore in a malignant pleurisy i will recommend an infusion of stonehorse dung made thus take six globules of the horse dung and pour upon it a quart of the pectoral decoction boiling hot let it stand to infuse in an earthen vessel close covered about an hour then strain it off this infusion both temperates and comforts the animal spirits and commonly keeps the patient in a gentle sweat for gentle sweats tend to a recovery but by excessive sweats nature is overset and the physician often deceived by the patient dying at a time when he thought him past all danger the foregoing infusion is to be drank frequently very hot about a quarter of a pint at a time  let the patient take about thirty drops of the elixir of vipers in a cup of the aforesaid infusion twice a day it is proper to keep his body open by glysters but not to purge upon any account until all the symptoms of malignity are vanished  if the patients stomach will bear to take a bolus make him up two scruples of edenborough treacle and six grains of salt of amber this must be given every six hours with a draught of the aforesaid infusion or any other diluting liquor quor after it for we must not confine him to the infusion of horse dung though it is wonderful in this case we must divert him with a change when he is tired of any one sort of liquor  as i have mentioned the elixir of vipers i will set it down before i go any farther that i may not be accused of quackery or designing this book an advertisement for my own interest  take the skins of vipers dried and powdered millepedes dried contrayerva roots in powder of each an ounce mix these ingredients into a past in a glass mortar with two ounces of spirit of salt tie the mortar close over with a bladder let it stand for five or six days then put it into a florence flask with four ounces of spirit of nitre dulcis let it stand to digest in the sun or a gentle sand heat ten or twelve days then press it out and filter it it must be kept in a bottle with a glass stopper for it will corrode and eat a common cork this medicine opens all obstructions in the body and wonderfully revives and cherishes the mind or animal spirits also causes perspiration and quickens vital motion  yet every professor of physic knows not when and how to apply a good medicine no more than every man in jack boots is fit to mount the managed horse  of intermittent fevers these fevers vary both according to the difference in constitutions and degrees of malignity therefore liable to be a quotidian a tertian or a quartan the most favorable sort is when it comes every day the next in degree is when it intermits one day and the worst sort of all is when the patient is well two days together and the third day has his fever  there is yet another sort which is commonly called a double tertian in this the patient is ill two days together and well the third this is thought the worst species of all intermittents but whosoever examins strictly will find it only a quartan ague wherein nature is by some means obstructed so that she cannot expel the malignity by sweats the first day so the fever remains two days together i have observed the patient to sweat the first day but not a discharge sufficient for a quartan ague which is not a jot inferior to either a malignant or a pestilential fever for the time it holds him in the shivering fit besides i have observed the sweats have not smelt sour and fetid until the second day therefore it ought to be called an irregular or a depressed quartan  it may be thought miraculous that intermittent fevers should go off and return so regularly at stated periods when one might reasonably have supposed the patient to have been quite freed from the distemper by the sweats at the termination of the last fit  now i am of opinion that the body draws in the infectious particles from the sourness of the sweats back again as soon as nature has thrust out such sweats so as i judge it in this fever the body is capable of admitting in such infection as nature at that time discharges through the pores so it returns again in as many hours as it requires to reach the animal spirits to cause a fresh disturbance and then the nerves again show the rigor and antipathy by shaking every fiber and muscle in the body  but let this be how it will intermittent fevers are so familiar to us that the cure is become very easy the only difficulty is when the bark purges which is commonly prevented by opiates yet the stomach is managed much better with preparations of sulphur for opiates by thickening the blood and causing a slowness of the internal motion bring on very often the rheumatism a dropsy or some other evil much harder to be cured than the intermittent fever  of the smallpox whenever the smallpox breaks out in any part it commonly takes a run through the whole place whether town or city and frequently several villages near each other for twelve miles round  the confluent sort is not a degree milder than a pestilential fever and is full as contagious among chose who have not had the smallpox before neither is the infection limited to the smallpox only for frequently when the fever comes to a crisis and the pustules begin to digest the purulent matter then diffuses out an offensive smell which will even infect those who have had the smallpox before but as their bodies are not liable to the smallpox the infection will beget a fever full as bad if not worse and notwithstanding ones body being incapable of admitting the very same sort of fever yet the infection may produce a fever of some other kind so great is the affinity in malignant and pestilential fevers one toward another  i can give one instance of myself in particular by lying in the same bed with a man who had a quartan ague his sweats were very sour and fetid to which smell i bore so great an antipathy that it infected me and had as i thought received an intermittent fever until the smallpox came out to convince me to the contrary i remember a child in the same house had the smallpox about ten days after me and this distemper went no farther so that it is plain the constitution of the air was not fit at that time for an infection of the smallpox no more than my body was in a constitution to receive in an intermittent fever  as i have compared the smallpox to pestilential fevers we should regard every symptom in the same manner for both bleeding and blistering ought to be used when nature is in danger of being overset by the violent kecking in drawing the breath or likewise the pain in the head and neck or other symptoms being too violent for nature to find out her true course for freedom  we ought never to force any thing upon the patient that he has any dislike to tho it is too common for the nurse to urge the patient to drink beyond his thirst either tare drink or some particular liquor which she has an opinion of which frequently brings on a vomiting and a looseness not by its quality but by the quantity he drinks for although a liquid be astringent if the sick drink more than nature can bear it must purge it self off  the patient as i said before in pestilential fevers must be diverted with such diluting liquors as best suits his desire in order to cherish nature that she may be able to do her part yet we have methods of relieving several bad symptoms in the smallpox but to set down what to apply when such a symptom appears and such a medicine in such a kind of disorder a man might write all his life time and his work would be imperfect at last and serve only to delude rather than instruct therefore an eye of judgment looking on the patient in this and all other diseases will conduct medicines more effectual than any rule set forth by the greatest author in the world  before i conclude upon this subject i ought to consider how it comes to pass that the smallpox are favorable to young children when their bodies are more liable to receive any kind of hurt or infection from the air by that tenderness in them yet we must allow that they are not so much subject to either sympathy or antipathy neither have they any dread or apprehension of death until the nurses begin to infect their tender thoughts with tales of frightful ghosts so that the smallpox is more favorable if the thoughts keep free from malignity and dread this is the best reason i can give at present but if time and practice introduce me hereafter to a better knowledge in this or any other distemper i shall be glad to publish it since my desire is to improve the art of healing as far as providence has given me a commission  of the measles the measles proceed from a rawness or heaviness in the air which clogs the pores of the body and hinders perspiration and is more apt to afflict children and young people by reason of a greater tenderness in them than in persons that are in years whose bodies are hardened to all alterations  the measles certainly is a fever although it does not so readily show itself by the tokens common in other fevers yet if we examine strictly we find it very nervous and violent by two symptoms in particular the first and most plain is the pain in the optic nerves which produces a discharge of sharp humor out of the eyes and when it happens that the patient has not this discharge the pain in the head and behind the eyes is more violent  secondly a pain and soreness in the kidneys with an inflammation in all the urinary passages whereby the water is in some measure suppressed and tinged of a reddish color and as one evil begets another so this grief in the kidneys and urinary vessels causes that violent sickness which always ensues and commonly lasts about eight or ten hours before it begins to abate then the rash comes out and for want of a free course of urine there commonly comes on a looseness at the same time so the patient begins to find some ease by intervals now the symptoms go off by degrees only the cough which began at first continues and may prove of ill consequence if not removed in time by proper means such as emulsions made with sperma ceti to be drank frequently and a mucilage made of quince seeds with some nutmeg grated into it and a little sugar to make it agreeable to be taken by a spoonful at a time as often as the cough is troublesome  let him take a paper of powder made of prepared coral and lac sulphur of each fifteen grains twice a day in a quarter of a pint of new milk these medicines will answer the end if continued for ten or fifteen days being made and applied as they ought i mean by having a due regard to the constitution of the patient and the symptoms of the disorders he may eat at the same time broths and any nourishing meats in moderation such as his fancy prompts him to he may drink for his common drink barley water and sometimes a draught of small beer if it is not too stale for the pectoral decoctions are of no service in this cough neither are the common linctuss made of oils and pectoral syrups  all heating medicines are hurtful from the beginning quite through the whole course of the disease and the vain pretense of striking the distemper out from the heart is without any grounds of reason or consideration  the patient must forbear all spirituous liquors and cordial medicines unless we find the spirits very much reduced by sweats and other evacuations and even then we should be very careful how we attempt to elevate since most medicines under the denomination of cordials are liable to encourage the fever to run beyond its natural measure and it is by this means that a hectic fever and a consumptive cough so often follows the measles and fever of this kind  a scarlet fever is of the very same nature and must be treated in the same manner  as the rash and measles are so apt to affect the lungs i will set forth the nature of a hectic fever coughs and consumptions in the following chapter keeping close to truth which is the principal virtue and ought to be the care of every author in physic  of consumptions consumptions which befall young people are always introduced by a hectic fever wherein the blood is too thin and spirituous and partly of a scorbutic quality  if we duly consider that the lungs are supplied with moisture no other way than by what perspires out of the diaphragma and pleura it is not so wonderful that a sharpness in the blood should afflict the lungs with that continual hecking and tickling cough since it is plain that the moisture within the thorax must consist of the serum and the most thin particles from the blood for both the diaphragma and pleura abound with minute sanguiferous vessels and as a consumptive cough is introduced by this heat or sharpness in the blood so this hectic fever is caused by victuals of too high nourishment and liquors too rich and strong for persons whose blood is apt to be too spirituous being in their youth and vigor  some people for want of a true idea will be apt to dispute this being the only cause of a hectic fever yet i am certain it is though it so often comes at the conclusion of other fevers it is not natural to succeed any of em but caused by the ill measures aforesaid neither is it difficult to cure if the patient can be regulated into a proper regimen such as panada muttonbroth made without turnips rice in any form jelleys flumery raw milk warm from the cow and all things that are cooling and healing  he musts abstain from salt meats rich soops and all victuals of high nourishment neither must he drink wines spirituous drams nor any kind of cordials  when the patient will set a resolution to diet himself in the foregoing manner we may promise a cure by the following method  first take away nine or ten ounces of blood then let the patient drink plentifully of emulsions made of the cold seeds with ten drops of the balm of gilead to every quart and let him take as often as the cough troubles him a spoonful of a mucilage made of quince kernels with some nutmeg grated into it and a little sugar to make it agreeable and no more for sugar is apt to cause too quick a fermentation in the stomach pearl juleps are of singular use being cooling and grateful he may drink common whey sometimes for a change it is very proper having in it an emollient quality he may take a gentle decoction of senna and rhubarb to open his body as often as there is occasion for it is necessary to keep him rather laxative than costive  the patient must use no violent exercise nor give a loose to passions of the mind for all rash motions or thoughts of revenge and all sudden surprises or thoughts of pleasure will cause remissive blushes in the countenance and sudden sharp sweats which remit and return as often as those passions affect him  this is the true nature of this kind of consumption which is by the vulgar commonly called the galloping consumption and indeed a very proper name if we consider that in this distemper nature is too much elevated and running her course unreind falls flat before she makes out half her length  of the phthisic etc now it is to be noted that old peoples blood may be made too rich yet not so apt to be spirituous and sharp but rather heavy and clammy therefore it produces in them the phthisic asthma or some such kind of disorder wherein the lungs are overloaded with a tough mucus or phlegm  in this case all spirituous liquors drank in moderation are proper and every thing that may quicken the fermentation in the stomach for this is a slackness of motion as the former is a quickness therefore riding and all brisk exercises of the body are proper in this case as they are hurtful in the former and as the other is from the force of eagerness and rashness in youth this the effect of heaviness in old age and although this sort of consumption is not of so sharp a nature yet it is much harder to cure notwithstanding the patient may be very much relieved by expectorating medicines even when he gasps for breath the tubes in the lungs being clogged and contracted by the viscid mucus or phlegm  the best and most effectual remedies are these following a linctus made of oximel of squills syrrup of balsam and linseed oil of each equal quantities let the patient take a spoonful every morning but when it happens that his stomach will not bear this linctus make up instead of it a mixture of gum ammoniacum two drams dissolved in six ounces of pennyroyalwater he must take three spoonfuls of this mixture every morning if it should purge him too much let him take less in quantity  an ounce of tincture of hiera picra with thirty drops of liquid laudanum to be taken every fourth night going to bed malt drink is hurtful because it is heavy and clogging therefore i advise him to punch made with oranges to drink moderately as his spirits require it  by this means the patient may be made so easy or at least relieved so far as he shall find very little inconveniency in it yet he may be afflicted with this sort of consumption i mean the phthisic and asthma above twenty years and even at last his death may be imputed to old age  in this place it may be observed that what man soever would prolong his course with nature this must be his rule depress her gently as there is occasion in his youthful years and cherish her as he grows old  i wish i could set forth the ideas i have of consumptions in a fairer light yet it may be understood from what i have said that every wheesing cough is not a consumption nor every hecking or tickling cough the phthisic  thus the virtue of a physician consists in judging exactly the nature of the distemper and the constitution of the patient and this was the advantage that doctor radcliff had in knowing his maker i mean he judged nature better than other men so sprang his unparalleled success  of the dropsy some physical writers have erroneously drawn other distempers to this title making three or four different sorts of dropsies  i beg their pardon for saying that no distemper is a dropsy but an overset of water that presses against the valves and contracts the passages which by nature are designed to receive or suck up that water which is in the abdomen in order to discharge it out of the body  a tympany cannot be called a dropsy because it is wind pent up without motion so it is called tympanum or a drum  and what is called a dropsy in the ovaria is a hurt by coition when the textures or animalculas of the seed are broken or imperfect which being received embraced and retained in the orchis draws to it the mucus or nourishment which attends and flows to the parts of generation in a natural and vital conception now this mucilaginous matter concocted by vital warmth becomes hard and tough it increases in bigness and grows every day more hard to cure  when we meet with any one under this misfortune we must depress nature by rough medicines which are cold and revulsive in order to give a sudden shock to the parts of generation for all warming medicines are hurtful in this disease because the warmth of nature glutinates all slimy matter to a toughness as a coldness of nature reduces it to a softness or a fluidity  thus a false conception resembles a natural one yet although this resemblance between a dropsy a tympany and a conception may deceive the eye it ought not to deceive the understanding  therefore a real dropsy is when the viscera and all the urinary vessels are stunned and obstructed which the patient feels by a heaviness and numbness in the abdomen and all the lower part of the body the bowels are relaxed and the peristaltick motion very slow by this slowness of the internal motion and weakness in the bowels and urinary vessels the water in the cavity of the belly has no its motion nor freedom to pass out of the body so it causes first the belly to swell and the legs soon after by the weight of this watery humor pressing downwards and the shortness of breath which always attends this distemper is caused by the cavity of the belly being so filled with water that it presses against the the diaphragma or midriff thus it contracts or straitens the chest or thorax which contains the heart and lights so that this pressure that the water makes against the midriff hinders the chest from expanding and the lungs from dilating sufficiently for respiration  i may with a good assurance object against the common proceedings in this disease since both reason and practice will defend me  the common method is rough catharticks and emeticks such as turbiths mineral panacea of antimony gamboelebor elaterium and such like medicines which by repetition relax and tear those vessels that are already weakened with the disease thus the patient is reduced into such a wea condition that it will be past the art of man to restore him notwithstanding he is flattered at first and thinks himself something better when his stomach and bowels are emptied by the aforesaid evacuations thus the physician and the patient are both deceived for want of knowing that every rough purge and straining vomit weakens the peristaltick motion and benumbs the viscera and all the urinary vessels that are designed to suck up the water when there is more in the belly than the necessary quantity  now it is worth the physicians while to consider that the bowels swim in this water the water is not in the bowels therefore if we aim at a perfect cure we must use diuretics and restorative medicines for as soon as the viscera and urinary vessels recover their strength and the bowels the warmth and natural motion the usual passages will then be capable of receiving the water and discharging it out both by urine and stool  i do not want to conceal any thing that might be depended upon to render my works more useful for the health and preservation of mankind although there are some particular medicines which i have found successful and know to be infallible if duly administered and the patient at the same time rightly managed but so various are the constitutions of human bodies and so particular are their tempers that if a medicine does not suit with their ways of thinking they can hardly be persuaded to take it and even then they will not repeat it because it does not take away the swelling all of a sudden as a woman at her full time with child is delivered of her bigbelly by a midwife  of the stone and gravel most jellys or mucilaginous matter fixed or lying in any part of the body without motion by vital heat becomes hard or tough and in time turns to bone or stone  so the stone being bred of slime which fixes itself in the urinary vessels is more subject to children than grown persons whose bodies are by nature stronger and more liable to cast off by evacuation that sort of slimy matter which petrifies by lying in the urinary vessels without motion  indeed the gravel is more apt to afflict grown people for as time turns most hard things to dust so the stone as it grows ripe begins to canker and crumble to sand and gravel which causes pain as it passes out through the urethra therefore it is a great mistake to think that the gravel breeds the stone for it is the stone that produces the gravel  we must be very cautious in giving diuretics for by their forcing quality the patient is very much tormented  a decoction of mallows emulsions and all oily medicines are necessary by mollifying and healing the fibers in the urinary passages but no medicine can be more effectual when the pain is violent than a turpentine glyster which gives ease by its unctuous and healing quality thus as often as the sharpness of the disease returns the patient may be made tolerable easy until time crumble the stone into particles small enough to come away without much pain  it ought to be considered that people in years are apt to have inflammations and sorenesses in the bladder and pelvis which are frequently mistaken for the stone  manna taken once in ten days is an exceeding good medicine for any soreness or ulcer in the bladder or kidneys and is also very proper even in the stone and gravel by preventing any inflammation in the kidneys for manna being opening and cooling gently carries off all corrosive humors from those parts  as i was objecting against forcing remedies i will further say that when we attempt to force nature we commonly obstruct her as is demonstrable to any skilful practitioner yet with care the stone may in a great measure be caused to crumble to pieces  i once thought myself master of this knack of dissolving the stone as i called it having had surprising success in three different children who were about five or six years old which puffed me up with vanity until i was called to a child of mr wests a carpenter in swan yard in the strand i was then very young and giddy headed assured em i could dissolve the stone and bring it away here i was disappointed the childs pain increased so much that they sent to another who had recourse to his knife and i was laughed at and despised and perhaps it was better it happened so for had i succeeded here i should have been more obstinate in my practice beyond reason since this i never would attempt to break the stone in the bladder though i confefs if i had a child of my own afflicted with it i would use all means before he should receive that hurt by lithotomy which they scarce ever perfectly recover  of the pox this disease has certainly been for time out of mind although it has shown itself of late years in sharper symptoms by reason of eating great quantities of sugar and foreign sweets which create a corrosive quality in the fluids and i really believe it was this distemper that in old times was called the plague of a leprosy and the hoary ulcer and was thought to be occasioned by the men cohabiting with their women in the time of natural purgations and to prevent these kind of disorders or uncleanness the elders made very strict laws to restrain the people at such times but if they had restrained every man to one woman only and likewise every woman to one man only it would then have had the desired effect for the pox was caused then as it may now by excess for excess of any thing is poison i mean excess in venery when one woman admits or is compelled to receive the seeds of several men one immediately after another though they are all sound men and the woman likewise sound and well yet the variety of seeds thus fermenting within the matrix will inflame and corrode the parts of generation  i need not set down the nature of a fresh clap because it is done by so many before nor the method of cure since people for the sake of saving their money will apply to any apprentice or quack who plies em off with rough medicines and puts even themselves to six times the expense that is necessary and the patient to sixty times the inconveniency for there are some symptoms at the first beginning which are very sharp and dangerous and prove of fatal consequence if not managed with both care and judgment  i have not had a great deal of practice in venereal cases yet i have met with some particular disorders which may be worth mentioning such as stubborn gonorrhaeas a continual pain or rather a tenderness upon the bone of the nose a flux of sharp humor from the ears an ulcer in the throat or uvula and such like disorders which i have met with in persons whose constitutions have in a manner been worn out by repeating mercurial medicines so often that at last they would neither purge nor salivate by reason of the glands being stunned and the mucus and natural moisture exhausted  in such like cases the cure consists in warming restorative medicines the patient at the same time must stick to a nourishing diet in order to cherish and strengthen nature for as the glands recover their true tone and the fluids their vital spirit the mercurial medicines which lie dormant will then begin to work their effect either by a continual purging or a gentle salivation this is what i can affirm from expecience which is a proof beyond reason itself  i would not have the world mistake me to think that i am exclaiming against mercury for i find it the most effectual and the easiest method of cure and indeed the safest if it is managed rightly and that hoarseness or disorder upon the lungs which so frequently ensues a salivation proceeds not from the mercury but from some mismanagement either in their diet or improper medicines given upon mercury under pretense of taking off the salivation for mercury is seldom mended by other medicines it is frequently made worse neither does the virtue of dietdrinks consist in the quality of the ingredients but in the quantity the patient drinks for suppose there should remain a corrosive quality in the body after fluing whether hot water is not as good an antidote as a decoction of the woods all that can be said it is not so agreeable and warming to the stomach  but however i am convinced that mercury if honestly prepared leaves no poison behind it if the physician will let it work off in its own easy manner yet as the lungs are refined by a salivation they become very tender and liable to be hurt by all cordial medicines or wines and any spirituous liquors there is not half so much danger of taking cold as is supposed for if i was to salivate a person at the hazard of my own life i would keep him no hotter han he himself found agreeable  of the gout juvenis voluptate abundans edit potatque senectute autem invadente vigor naturalis evanescet multis occupaturque moeroribus  so the gout proceeds from indulgencies we give ourselves up to when we find a slackness of desire for then we begin to fear a decay and with vain hopes of prompting ourselves to our former gaiety and vigor drink wines and spirituous liquors without a natural thirst or real desire and eat loads of rich victuals without the true rule of appetite  thus by overloading the stomach the fibers and pores or passages by which the nourishment steams or perspires out of the stomach into the lacteals are relaxed or dilated so that the nourishment which is drawn into the lacteals is too heavy and of a crude and clammy quality which distemper being communicated to the blood irregulates the motion of the artery and the nerve for there is a nerve lies close along with every artery and at every pulsation of blood from the heart these nerves give a jirk for a better expression i may call it a receptive or an assistive motion which draws along the pulsation of blood by the same motion at the same moment into every artery in the body for notwithstanding the motion of the heart being very forcible it could not drive the blood with that quickness into the extreme parts at every systole if it was not assisted by the nerve in the manner i have described  now the blood being heavy and clammy cannot circulate back again by the veins quick enough to receive the blood from the artery and when an artery is thus obstructed the pulsations come by pushes or thrusts striving for freedom yet the nerve keeps it is true motion and this irregularity of time and motion between the nerve and the artery tears some of the fine membranes which brace em together  now those membranes being tore by the aforesaid pushes or thrusts cause that violent pain and produce a kind of jelly which by lying in a continual heat grows hard so that in time it will resemble chalk stones which i confess is very surprising yet an egg shell is more like chalk being formed of a natural matter and a necessary heat as the gout stones are formed of false matter and supernatural heat  i am very certain that the gout may be cured where the patient will regulate his life and conquer himself to a proper diet  i might make a long discourse on the particulars from the experience i have had having been afflicted with it myself before i was two and thirty years old i confess i am partly ashamed as i impute the gout to the aforesaid causes yet i may tell it with some pride the conquest i have made in being entirely free from any symptom of it now  but i can hardly believe any one will restrain himself with so much resolution as i did therefore i need not set down the method i took with myself only advise the patient never to eat above a quarter of a pound of solid victuals at one meal although that quantity may be eaten every three hours neither must he drink above a quarter of a pint of liquor at one draught yet he may drink as often as desire prompts him so that his liquor be not too strong nor stale but rather new and upon the ferment for new working small beer and even parched peace are very proper likewise all windy things whatsoever that may in any measure quicken motion and circulation perhaps some persons may object against windy things for fear of the cholick yet it is without reason for the cholick cannot be cured without things that ferment in the stomach and quicken the peristaltick motion  in the gout it is necessary that the patient should drink plentifully so his liquors are proper for it is a kind of fever as we find when we are awaked out of our sleep with the pain and a rigorous disorder in the nerves throughout the whole body yet it is not safe to attempt a cure by the aforesaid method nor any ways to depress nature until the violence of the fit goes off therefore strong wines and all warming bitters are proper to defend the stomach while the patient has the fit upon him yet a strong decoction of camomile flowers drank hot every night going to bed is preferable to snake root or any other bitter whatsoever  i am not guilty of fancying one particular medicine universal or fit to be given in all distempers yet i will recommend the elixir of vipers in the gout it may be given even in the violence of the fit it secures the stomach by creating an inward briskness and thirst for a thirst is a very good symptom in the gout as a devouring appetite is a bad one before the fit comes on  it is very remarkable how the patient eats with a prodigious greediness a day or two before the fit begins but not with a natural hunger nor pleasure for when a man who is very hungry sits down calmly to a dish of soop or some such thing half digested he may feel in three or four minutes a sweetness and delight flow to each breast as the nourishment steams out of the stomach into the lacteal vessels and when a person debars himself from eating longer than ordinary nature then calls in the mucus from all the glands and the moisture in the muscles from all the extreme parts to support the heart and spirit that motion may not cease but still this suction of nature will reach farther for if a man was to be quite debarred from eating and drinking his life might be preserved considerably longer by a nourishing poultice made of bread moistened with wine and gravy and applied to each breast for the breasts are most capable of communicating a nourishment to cherish and support the animal spirits because there is no muscle or fleshy substance outwardly that has so near a communication to the heart and stomach here i make a  stop  with some doubt and discouragement i am reflecting on my own works been telling a friend a man in practice that i have spent a few hours in writing the natural causes and steps to the cure of several distempers who gave me a despisable sneer and told me that a great many fools are published of late and are as much ashamed of themselves when they come to see their thoughts in print as they were in love with their works whilst in manuscripts besides says he can a giddy headed young fellow of five and thirty be capable of matters in physic which ought to be from thoughts most solid and sublime  i confess the spirit that leads me is selfopinion and i believe no man writes without it and the stronger this spirit is in any author the more valuable are his works if there be but the weight of reason in his thoughts and the thoughts of several valuable and sublime things are lost for want of being comprehended and encouraged  thus i recover myself again from that reflection of youth and vanity with an assurance that if a man be ever capable of doing wonders it must be while he is in his prime before heavy days come when his senses grow slack and imperfect for then his sight his taste and smell deceive him  suppose a man whose sight is decaying was to give a description of a candle burning about six yards from him how must he describe it to us must he say there is a circle round it or streams of light or some such imperfection which he sees though he is sure it is not in the candle but in his sense of sight how is he sure because he remembers the candle burnt perfect when his sight was clear but the disorders in the eyes i shall preserve among some practical observations and experiments in anatomy which if i had a full authority i should be glad to publish with the causes of several other chronical diseases for my design is to set down the real causes of distempers and ill proceedings in several remarkable cases whereby many bad symptoms in several diseases may be shunned easier than cured yet wonders may be done in all distempers by a skilful physician and a careful nurse where the patient complies with rules necessary for his disorder  i cannot believe it the will of the almighty that a man shall be snatched away before he has run his due course with nature  for certainly when there is a conception it ought to come to a natural birth at a natural time and after a child is born if it is not hurt nor hindered it must grow to a natural strength and the course of life to be of a natural length therefore diseases are always caused by some hurt or ill rules of life  people cannot die in their youth unless nature be depressed or overset nature may be depressed even to death by hunger coldness or loss of blood and she may be overset by dread or surprise violent motion or excessive eating and drinking how often do we find nurses destroy young children by strong liquors or stuffing em to such a degree that nature is overset and they are seized with convulsions and die  yet it may be necessary sometimes to curb or rather depress nature at other times it may be necessary to cherish or rather prompt her so the course of life may in some measure be prolonged by management and care  but i am very sensible that nature will change and life must come toward a period for as desire abates we then begin to bow down our faces with care against the earth to see that we tread our steps in safety and when the marks of age are carried in the face of man he lies down to rest in grief slumbering in his fancy hears the bird of the night starts up in fear of that which is on high while thus he listens his ears and all the gates are open until his thoughts are overset with dread then the harmony ceases because the strings of music are slack thus the garrison is given up to the great conqueror and the soul to god that gave it  finis index malignant fevers page    pestilential fevers page    inflammatory fevers
