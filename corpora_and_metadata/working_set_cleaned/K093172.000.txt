an essay concerning the growth of empiricism or the encouragement of quacks  wherein the present state of physic in this kingdom is fairly represented with some reasons for the necessity of a regulation in the practice of it  humbly offered to the consideration of the queens majesty and the parliament of great britain  by fran guybon m d    hippocr lex  pudet haec opprobria nobis et dici potuisse and non potuisse refelli ov met london printed for r parker at the unicorn under the royal exchange and sold by j morphew near stationers hall      price   s  the preface the design of the following essay is briefly and plainly to represent the present state of physic in this kingdom and to demonstrate the necessity of a regulation in the practice of it and as i am fully persuaded such a regulation in physic would tend both to the honor of the nation in general and the good of her majestys subjects in particular so there seems no need of making any manner of apology for engaging in so very laudable an attempt i can for my own part sincerely declare to those whose chance it may be to have this essay fall into their hands that the design of it is entirely honest having assuredly no other view than that of doing service to the aggrieved which is the far greatest part of the kingdom no private consideration of what nature soever could have moved me thus to expose my self to the censures of the world especially in an affair for the intermeddling with which it is to be feared i may expect more reproaches than thanks for though i have often had it in my thoughts that a man could not do a better piece of service to the public than to demonstrate the necessity of such a regulation in physic yet the consideration of what a vast number of enemies he must consequently raise to himself did for some time i must confess deter me from the attempt i was very sensible what a multitude of people there are who not only subsist but enrich themselves by those very methods which i had undertaken to condemn and therefore very well knew that right or wrong i should not fail to meet with a legion of opponents but the love of truth and a hearty desire of contributing somewhat to the common good of mankind did at last outweigh and prevail with me above all other considerations  if then the following essay may but in some measure contribute to the removal of those pernicious encroachments which have been unhappily made upon the province of physic i shall have gained my end and shall despise any little censures or reflections which thereby i may possibly draw upon my self and though i am not at present conscious of any valid objections which can be made against what i have advanced yet do promise whatever they be if fairly and heartily proposed i will endeavor to answer them in the same manner for to conclude i have given the title of an essay to the following sheets because i have only touched upon and not exhausted the subject  the contents introduction page

excuses invalidated p    conclusion p  0 an essay concerning the growth of empiricism or the encouragement of quacks health being the greatest of natural blessings it is as needless to say any thing in its praise as to enlarge upon the usefulness of physic which preserves and restores it but as there is nothing which would more advance the usefulness of that divine art and is therefore of greater importance to the public good than a regulation in the practice of it so there is nothing consequently more recommendable to the consideration of the queen and parliament than the present state of physic in this kingdom the encouragement which quacks and empiricks have lately met with is not only so surprizingly great but so vastly detrimental that in the best of governments where civil and religious properties are so happily secured there seems nothing more wanting than some speedy and powerful expedient to restrain so growing an evil  but before i proceed to offer any of my reasons for the necessity of a regulation in the practice of physic or enter into a detail of the evil consequences deservedly to be lamented by all who have a just sense of them which attend the encouragement of quacks and empiricks twill not be improper to give the definition of or to let the reader know what i desire may be understood by the words the word quack says the gazophylacium anglicanum is of a dutch original signifies a frivolous and vain tatler and so is applicable to all persons of any profession who oftentatiously pretend to a great deal of skill and knowledge in matters which they are really ignorant of or do very little understand and by a quack or empirick i mean any and every one of those who pretend to practice physic without knowledge of the praerequisita to that most useful but most difficult art there are some it is true who would fain persuade us that the medical art is only to be promoted by experiments or observing what things are hurtful what beneficial in diseases that the study of nature and the knowledge of the body are only trifling curiosities and things altogether superfluous but it is agreed i am apt to think amongst the more intelligent part of mankind that there are several things perfectly and absolutely necessary to be known before a man can reason and make judgment either of the nature of diseases or the use of methods and medicines for the remedying them and therefore ought to be understood before he presumes to take the care of mens lives into his hands for how can he pretend to cure diseases unless he first apprehends what they are and in what they consist how can he rationally prescribe medicines if he understands not their operations or how can he expect any manner of advantage from them if he does not consider the relation between the disease and the operation and how can he be qualified to do any of these things unless he be first acquainted with the nature properties and functions of a human body the subject of his art and to which they relate and that this was the opinion of the ancient physicians is evident from the variety of medical introductions and institutions published by them for it was not in those days thought proper that the care of mens lives should be entrusted with persons till they were instructed in the methods of preserving them   abrotanum aegro non audet nisi qui didicit dare  hor epist but that there are several things absolutely necessary to be known by men before they ought to pretend to the practice of physic and which are what i mean by the praerequisita to the medical art will more fully appear by a particular enumeration of them viz the knowledge of  i the learned languages ii natural philosophy iii the animal economy iv pharmacology v nosology i the first of the praerequisita then which i shall mention is the knowledge of the learned languages for physic being the wisdom which is heaped up in the various labors and observations of the learned of all ages or the judgments of many men wound up as it were into one cum unius hominis vita ad omnium inventionem sufficere nequeat longi temporis observationes historia colligit ut ejus beneficio tanquam ex multis tot saeculorum hominibus unus efficiatur eruditissimus galen de subfigur empir cap    twill be found necessary in a physician to be versed in the writings of the ancients as well as the moderns and to be well acquainted with their rules cautions and remedies they having laid the first foundation of the most excellent art by both observing and describing the nature of diseases most of the diagnostick and prognostic signs of diseases are the result of their laborious and solid observations and will continue to be faithful guides to all that can make use of them as long as human bodies and nature it self remain nothing therefore can be more previously necessary to the practice of physic than an acquisition of the greek and latin tongues for as in those languages the art is delivered so without them the terms in the english translations are not possibly to be understood  ii the next of the praerequisita is natural philosophy for as the art of physic is only the natural knowledge applied to the preservation of health and life so whoever intend to apply themselves to that art will find it necessary to consider the human body the subject of their art as a mere natural substance before they proceed to the consideration of it as an animated being for though the human body as an animated being is strictly speaking the immediate subject of their care yet the peculiar properties of animated substances cannot well be distinguished or understood unless the common affections of matter be first known out of which the human as well as other animated bodies are composed and notwithstanding those particles of matter which are modified into a human body during that state are enriched with properties and perfections distinguishing them from all other beings yet there remain in them some affections common to other animated beings and some promiscuously to be found in all natural substances whoever therefore designs to apply himself to the art of physic ought to comprehend the general properties and affections of matter the origin and transitory nature of forms and qualities and how the parts of a human body considered as a natural substance may be moved before he begins to inform himself or indeed rightly can of the affections observable in a human body as animated or endued with life and this seems to have been the method by which novices were heretofore initiated into that art as appears by the institutes of galen rhases sennertus fuchsius etc as likewise in that they have blended and interwoven the philosophy esteemed in those ages with that most excellent art and have formed that proverbial saying  ubi definit physicus ibi incipit medicus but natural philosophy is not only absolutely necessary to form a right apprehension of the human body as a part or portion of matter but also to frame a true idea of medicines and their operations as will more fully appear under that head  iii the next of the praerequisita is the knowledge of the animal economy or the consideration of the human body as animated or endued with life and that as well in its natural or healthful as in its praeternatural or morbid state it being altogether necessary to understand the natural state of the body before the nature of a disease can be rightly comprehended the animal body is now known to be a pure machine and its actions and motions demonstrated to be the necessary consequences of its structure and as the actions of the body from which life and health do flow are the necessary consequences of its economy so likewise diseases and all their symptoms are nothing but alterations or disorders in it it demonstratively therefore follows that the greater the knowledge of the one is the better the nature of the other must be known and that a physician ignorant of the animal economy is ignorant of the structure and uses of the machine he undertakes to regulate the parts of animated bodies are aptly and usefully divided into solid and fluid anatomy or the art of dissecting the solid parts of animal bodies in order to an exact discovery of their situation structure uses etc as it is absolutely necessary to the knowledge of the animal economy so it has ever been justly esteemed one of the foundation pillars of physic nor indeed of less use is the doctrine of the fluids under which head i include a right apprehension of the general and particular properties of the animal fluids and of their different motions nature uses offices etc there are several other things also included in the knowledge of the animal economy and some few of them i shall just mention which though not strictly referable to either branch of the abovementioned division of the parts are yet equally necessary to be understood viz the different dependencies the parts have on and the different relations they bear to each other the powers of motion both voluntary and involuntary and sensation the general reason and nature of secretion the velocity of the bloods circulation with the reason of its differences at different distances from the heart the necessity of breathing after birth with the force of the air upon the blood in that action etc etc etc but an exact knowledge of the animal structure and economy will afterward appear more particularly necessary as well to explicate the virtues and operation of medicines as to ascertain the diagnosis and comprehend the aetiology of diseases  iv another of the praerequisita is pharmacology comprehending the knowledge   of simple natural medicines whether of the animal vegetable or mineral kingdom   of the several parts of pharmacy both galenical and chemical   of the general nature virtues and operation of medicines for as a man cannot be said to understand an art without understanding the instruments as well as the subject of that art so the human body being the subject and medicines the instruments of this art the knowledge of the one must consequently be as necessary as the knowledge of the other    by the knowledge of simple natural medicines i here mean that of the substances themselves as well as of their medicinal virtues and efficacies twould be altogether needless to wast any time in insisting upon the necessity of understanding this part of pharmacology for as without knowing the substances a man in his practice must wholly confide in or rely upon the gatherers and venders of medicines so indeed the knowledge of their virtues and efficacies without knowing the substances themselves seems to me if of any of a very dangerous use    pharmacy contains the manner of preparing and the method of making such simple substances into medicines and consists of several parts whether according to the galenical or chemical forms all the several parts of pharmacy and of chemistry in particular viz as it teaches the most compendious and efficacious preparation of medicines are and have been so often demonstrated to be so absolutely necessary to be understood by all who design for the practice of physic that as there is nothing in which men seem more agreed than in the necessity of understanding these things so it would be but loss of time to enlarge any further upon them i shall therefore conclude what i have to offer under this head with the following observation that since it is so necessarily incumbent upon every one who pretends to the practice of physic to understand all the parts of pharmacy there can be no objection made upon that account i mean against a physicians preparing his own medicines but either by ignorant or interested men but though this observation is sufficient to excuse the physicians for giving their own medicines which indeed is only resuming what their ancestors either out of pride or laziness left off yet it does not follow that there is any manner of apology to be made for the apothecaries intruding themselves into the practice of physic as will more fully afterward appear    under the third branch of pharmacology is comprised the knowledge of the general nature virtues and operation of medicines and as natural philosophy was proved to be necessary toward forming a right notion of the human body so twill be found as necessary toward comprehending the general nature virtues and operation of medicines for medicines being only natural substances only parts or portions of matter it is evident that their powers and properties are not only under the same common laws and rules which are observed in the other parts of matter but are also to be explained in the same methods and therefore medicines are not only natural substances but they also operate in a natural way  i e by different kinds and degrees of motion such natural substances loosing only their denomination and not their natures by being termed or applied as medicines by a due apprehension of these things and without which it is impossible for a practitioner in physic to be really useful or serviceable in his generation men will know what effects to expect and be prevented from a credulous expectation of effects which can in no wise proceed from them in a natural way medicines notwithstanding the materia medica is made up of so vast a variety of natural substances may in respect of their general virtues or operation be comprised under such as produce some evacuation or such as only effect some alteration in the body and not only natural philosophy but a due knowledge also of the animal economy is absolutely necessary toward framing a right notion of these things for unless men understand the structure and comprehend the uses and offices of the parts of the body it is impossible for them to know how or by what organs or in what regions parts or juices medicines perform their operations  v the fifth and last of the praerequisita which i shall mention is nosology containing whatever relates to the general nature signs causes etc of diseases for as the consideration of the human body in its natural or healthful state is by physicians only in order to the consideration of it in its praeternatural or morbid one so consequently there can be nothing more previously necessary to the practice of physic than whatever relates to the knowledge of the general nature signs causes etc of diseases    and first the want of a clear idea of the general nature of diseases must be a certain means of laying a necessary and afterward unalterable foundation of error and miscarriage in practice one would be tempted to think from the erroneous proceedings of unintelligent practitioners that diseases were really separate essences or i know not what substantial forms and as such entered and possessed the bodies of men whereas by a due consideration of their natures they will be found to be nothing different or distinct from the body but only changes or alterations in the modification of its constituent parts or different modes of indisposition in the same body    secondly the doctrine of the signs both diagnostick and prognostic is not less necessary to be thoroughly understood before a man undertakes the practice of physic than the general nature of diseases for as by a due knowledge of the diagnostick signs he may be instructed truly to distinguish one disease though never so much alike from another so through want of that knowledge one disease is very often mistaken for and treated as another how often for instance has a colica and a nephritis a fluor albus and a gonorrhaea a chlorosis and a phthisis been confounded so that the foundation of cure seems primarily to be laid in a right apprehension of the diagnostick signs of each distemper but here it ought to be observed that the better a man understands the animal structure and economy the more capable he will be both of comprehending and ascertaining the diagnosis and that a man ignorant of those things must necessarily mislead himself by the use of a common name and apply it to denote circumstances which are so far from being always alike that they will be sometimes found extremely different  and as to the prognostic signs of diseases though it be certain that the recovery of the sick is the great design of the medical art and undoubtedly more necessary than presaging the event of distempers yet the advances which have been made in the prognostic part of medicine as acquiring no small esteem and authority to the physician ought diligently to be collected from the observations of the ancients particularly of the divine hippocrates as well as from the writings of the moderns    thirdly the aetiology of diseases i mean more particularly as to the immediate and conjunct causes will be found as necessary to be known by every practitioner as either the general nature of diseases or the doctrine of the signs for if as is very evident in practice diseases even of the same denomination arising from different causes do administer different indications or indicate different methods of cure the aetiology must consequently be a grand source from whence rational indications can be drawn twere very easy to give instances in almost all the diseases incident to the human body but thinking it altogether needless because the medical writings are so full of them i shall conclude this head with observing that as an exact knowledge of the animal structure and economy is absolutely necessary to comprehend the aetiology of diseases so the modern improvements in anatomy have very considerably advanced the aetiological part of medicine  having thus with the utmost brevity demonstrated that there are several things perfectly and absolutely necessary to be known by men before they ought to pretend to the practice of physic my present design does not at all oblige me to enquire whether i have enumerated all the praerequisita to the medical art but from that enumeration of them which i have made and from what i have advanced under each of those heads may very fairly venture to draw the following conclusions viz  i that experience alone will not make a physician ii that the enumeration of the praerequisita to the medical art is a sufficient argument with what difficulty a due qualification for the practice of it is attained iii that it is a plain demonstration how unqualified the quacks are for exercising the profession they pretend to iv that it is an evident indication to the rational part of mankind who do and who do not and that the far greatest part of the practioners in physic do come under the denomination of quacks v that an apothecary can no more be said to be qualified for the practice of physic than any other mechanical tradesman i that experience alone will not make a physician for if there are as i have already proved several things absolutely necessary to be known by men before they can judge of the nature of diseases or remedies which are what i mean by the praerequisita to the medical art it evidently follows that experience alone i e experience without the praerequisita will not make a physician the art of physic then may very aptly and usefully be said to consist two parts viz the theoretical and practical and as there is nothing truer on the one hand than that the theory viz the knowledge of the praerequisita is as has been fully proved absolutely necessary to the practice so there is nothing more evident on the other than that the knowledge of the theory though previously necessary is only in order to and therefore useless without the practice for though it is impossible i affirm a man should make any considerable figure in the practice who is ignorant of the praeliminary arts which compose the theory of physic and if without the knowledge of those arts a man jumps as i may say into practice such a one is never to be trusted though he had seen thousands of patients and ten thousand prescriptions yet do i not as it is ridiculous to suppose that men should rest here or dwell upon the theory or that the speculative part of physic should teach them to cure all manner of distempers in their closets without a constant attendance on the sick without a diligent and unwearied observation on diseases a due apprehension of these things may be a means to determine the many unnecessary disputes concerning the preference of one part of physic to the other the knowledge of the one absolutely depending on and consequently being altogether as necessary as that of the other and as theory and practice so reason and observation ought not to be compared with or opposed to each other but joined together as mutually adorning and illustrating one another to the fully completing of a physician a man may be an advocate for experience and well apprizd of the usefulness of accurate observations and at the same time not discard the use of reason in physic true observations will never be found to contradict right reason nor will right reason exert it self in opposition to matter of fact but lest any of the empirical tribe should pretend to take shelter under authorities or to interpret what baglivi says concerning experience and observation in favor of themselves i have purposely read over all the works of that celebrated author and from innumerable passages in his writings think nothing more evident than that it is a literate and not an empirical experience which he contends for it is not experience without the praerequisita but such a well grounded experience as a man duly qualified for the practice of physic may daily with reason be supposed to acquire and it is as evident that what he has advanced concerning the importance of observation in the way of physic ought to be interpreted in that very sense for though he says that nothing so naturally tends to the improvement of physic as experiments and observations yet it is certainly true that he desires it might be understood as indeed it ought to be of experiments directed by the knowledge of the animal economy and of observations grounded on that and the other praerequisita so notwithstanding what dr sydenham declares viz vid epist ded obs med artem medicam haud rectius esse perdiscendam quam ab ipsius artis exercitio atque usu and vid tract de podagra p  0 edit lugd bat praxin esse medicinae profitentium lapidem lydium it is evident from passages enough in that worthy author particularly from the whole   st page of the last mentioned treatise that he never designed by what he says to advance an empirical experience or to preclude the necessity of understanding the praerequisita as there is nothing more ridiculous than to suppose all men capable of making a good use of experience or able to draw right conclusions from the motions of nature so quacks and empiricks who set out without either light or method must undoubtedly prove stupid and erroneous observators it being indeed impossible that men ignorant of the medical praerequisita should be capable of improving either themselves or the art by their experience and observations what therefore is daily said in praise of experience to which no one pays a greater deference than my self and in recommendation of experienced physicians ought to be understood with such a restriction as not to include the practitioners who never had opportunities of understanding the praerequisita how ridiculous then is the folly of those people who magnify an empirical experience or cry up a quack of whatsoever figure or fame for a man of experience which wanting a foundation cannot be of any real use and service either to himself or others  ii that the enumeration of the praerequisita to the medical art is a sufficient argument with what difficulty a due qualification for the practice of it is attained for if it be so absolutely necessary as has been already proved to understand the praerequisita to that art it is very easy to infer both what length of time and labor of thought the acquisition of so much knowledge will require it is not then a raw and superficial knowledge of receipts and medicines of diseases and their cures which will qualify a man for the practice of physic but a gradual advancement through all the abovementioned foundations of the art it is not to be supposed that the ars longissima should be so quickly acquired or the most difficult of sciences so instantly attained and this truth is not only confirmed by hippocrates in his very first aphorism   and in his enumeration of the necessaries which he requires to constitute a good physician  hippoer lex  but by the concurrent testimonies both of the ancients and the moderns yet notwithstanding what has been advanced concerning the praerequisita to the medical art and the difficulty of acquiring the knowledge of them it is very surprising to consider what a vast number of persons there are what would fain become physicians without labor and study and be saluted sons of apollo without any manner of right to the title but all and every one of those who are ignorant of the preliminary arts which compose the theory are but pretenders in physic do jump as i said into practice and are never to be trusted though they had seen thousands of patients and ten thousand prescriptions but i now proceed in the third place more particularly to consider  iii that the enumeration of the praerequisita to the medical art is a plain demonstration how unqualified the quacks are for exercising the profession they pretend to and if as has been proved there are so many things absolutely necessary to be known before a man can either reason or judge of diseases it evidently follows that a quack ignorant of those things is absolutely unqualified for that profession were but the matter indeed as impartially considered as it ought to be there seems nothing more ridiculous than to pretend to the practice of physic without a previous knowledge of them it being impossible but such people must make either improper dangerous and destructive or insignificant and useless applications it is not only true in fact that the most generous often prove the most deadly medicines if administered without judgment but it is an every days observation that those very things which have the reputation of being harmless and inoffensive if improperly applied do too often create very great mischiefs in the practice of physic there is required not only great labor of thought in searching into the several appearances and circumstances of diseases but also great strength of judgment in duly weighing and comparing them together and it is not here as in many other cases where experiments may be repeated without any great injury for this perhaps admits but of one single trial which possibly may terminate in the death of a man and one false step especially in an acute disease may be of the most fatal consequence physic it is true abounds with a very large number of excellent medicines but medicines being relations to human bodies can only be said to be good or bad as applied and like all other instruments to do either good or hurt according to the nature of the hand which uses them as there is nothing more conspicuous on the one hand than the useful effects of medicines when methodically and judiciously diciously administered so there is nothing more obvious on the other than the deadly effects even of those of the very first rank when used without either method or judgment can any thing then more fully demonstrate the vanity of empiricism than the daily experience how inefficacious and useless even the most celebrated specificks are without a judicious and methodical application for though a more noble specific than the cortex for instance was never known yet experience convinces us how frequently we are forced even in intermitting fevers to call in to our assistance the knowledge of the animal economy and by vomiting purging or other proper means to render that specific useful which would otherwise have been of no effect so that nothing seems more ridiculous than for a man to pretend to cure diseases though armed with the best of medicines without the knowledge of the animal economy and the nosological praerequisita it may as well be expected that a blind man should shoot flying or a deaf one tune an organ  i cannot therefore conclude this head without observing which indeed naturally flows from the foregoing considerations how unaccountably infatuated they are who apply themselves to any of the empirical tribe there being nothing so monstrous as their pretenses nothing but the no less monstrous credulity of those who employ them but  quos perdere vult jupiter prius dementat does any one man more deserve to be ridiculed than he who thinks his gold watch of too great value to be put into the hands of an under workman and at the same time trusts his body a machine of infinitely more curious structure with an ignorant pretender in physic can a man put a greater affront upon his reason or can he give an odder demonstration of his kindness to wife children or friends than to commit any of them to the care of such unequal managers in matters of far less moment men generally are more guided by the dictates of reason and not so easily imposed upon by any kind of empty pretensions if the title of an estate wherein they are concerned be never so little suspected they immediately apply to the best advice and will spare neither cost nor pains for a right information but which is the most unaccountable piece of folly imaginable are extremely less sollicitous about the care of their bodies than their estates  iv that the enumeration of the praerequisita to the medical art is an evident indication to the rational part of mankind who do and who do not and that the far greatest part of the practitioners in physic do come under the denomination of quacks i appeal to the rational part of mankind because they are the fittest judges in the matter for as they are capable of distinguishing who have and who have not had opportunities of understanding the praerequisita so they cannot but at the same time be convinced that the far greatest part of the practitioners in physic come under the denomination of quacks there is nothing more evident than that there are pretenders in physic who are so far from having any knowledge of the learned languages that they cannot write their own are so far from having made any searches into the vast collection of ancient learning that they never perused even the observations of the moderns are so far from understanding natural philosophy or the animal economy that they never had opportunities of learning anatomy or chemistry never saw a dissection or one process of the preparation of medicines what a melancholy reflection then is it that such a trade of deceiving should be carried on under the pretenses to so useful an art and to consider what a number of people there are who having no other foundation but impudence and ignorance bubble so many thousands out of their money and lives  v that an apothecary can no more be said to be qualified for the practice of physic than any other mechanical tradesman though the preparation of medicines according to the prescript is properly speaking the business of an apothecary and which preparation requires only the knowledge of the substances themselves and not of their medicinal virtues and efficacies yet let us suppose an apothecary endued with that knowledge also and let us consider how far it will qualify him for the practice of physic we will then suppose him to know that this medicine will purge this vomit and this produce other evacuations or perhaps only alterations in the body but as to know what is indicated is one thing and how to answer such an indication another so the knowledge of the virtues and efficacies of medicines will not at all instruct or direct him in the application of them for medicines being relations to human bodies can be only good or bad as justly or unjustly applied and therefore as i instanced though we suppose a man to know that such a medicine will undoubtedly purge i e solicit the bowels into that motion we call so yet whether this will be to the advantage of the person to whom it is given depends not on the mans knowledge of the medicines operation but on the fitness and disposition of the patients body to receive it again a man may know that there are some preparations of antimony etc which will always produce vomiting but though by the exhibition of a vomit a vitiated stomach is sometimes restored yet when the stomach is depraved from a cause which cannot be removed by vomiting it is plain that the use of such medicines cannot possibly effect its recovery and a great many more instances might be given in respect to the operation of medicines which only produce some alteration in the body the excellency then of the medical art consists in a right apprehension of the relation between the powers of the medicine and the circumstances of the disease now such a right apprehension of this relation as is sufficient to qualify a man for the practice of physic cannot possibly be acquird by the knowledge of medicines their preparation and virtues but of all the abovementioned praerequisita to the art and this single consideration of the relation between the medicine and the body as it distinguishes a regular from an empirical practice so it sufficiently exposes the vanity of confiding in receipts or nostrums and plainly demonstrates that the most celebrated preparations even of the philosophers by fire are not capable of curing diseases without a judicious and methodical application and that there can be nothing consequently more ridiculous than to suppose an apothecary capable of advising from seeing the prescripts of physicians if then the knowledge of the preparation of medicines if the knowledge of their virtues and efficacies nay if seeing the very prescripts of physicians will not amount to a qualification it demonstratively follows that an apothecary can no more be said to be qualified far the practice of physic having no other means or opportunities of acquiring the rest of the praerequisita than any other mechanical tradesman that small pittance of learning which is acquird at school if not afterward lost in the servile offices of the shop can claim no manner of consideration no the prolix and laborious study of physic ought assuredly to commence upon a more literate foundation and the knowledge of it is not possibly attainable but by an education of a quite different nature  twill be very pertinent to my present design and not unacceptable to my reader i hope to acquaint him how the apothecaries first crept into houses and introduced themselves into the practice of physic their officious visits were at first made under pretense of carrying the physic themselves which indeed might procure them the reputation of careful men tho by running on the errands it is plain they changed offices with their servants and left them at home to do the duty of their masters this gave them opportunities of insinuating themselves into nurses servants and other weak persons attending the sick and by their means of being admitted to give their opinions and thence under pretense of good husbandry for the patient to repeat the physicians bills without his order and at last to prescribe without his advice yet i am not i must confess for wholly laying aside this order of men they being in my opinion very useful and serviceable in their proper station and business which is the preparation of medicines according to the prescript of the physician but when an apothecary deserts his station in the shop neglects the business of his trade and runs about advising in all distempers he becomes an empirick and invades a profession which he cannot be supposed to understand can any thing be more astonishing than the levelling of a learned liberal science with a mechanic trade of the hand directed by that science i could wish the fools character had been preserved in our chronicles or that his features were now to be seen in his statue of brass who first sent for the handycraft labourer of the medicines to answer any questions concerning the nature of the distemper  there is certainly no more relation between the business of an apothecary and that of a physician than between the grinding of colors and the art of painting and therefore an apothecary who without knowledge of the praerequisita pretends to the practice of physic is altogether as ridiculous as a colourgrinder who without any skill in drawing should presume to manage a pencil the one may hear the patients examined make up the medicines himself and observe their effects the other may see the first strokes chalked out prepare the colors himself and afterward see his master at work yet neither of them without being first instructed in the various rules as well as first rudiments of the respective arts shall enter into the skill of either the physician or painter though they looked on them till doomsday what pity it is the imitations of both cannot be equally exposed to view that the unskilful management of the one might be as conspicuous as would be the ridiculous dawbing of the other  there is also another body of men i mean the surgeons who notoriously enough though not indeed so frequently in great towns as the apothecaries invade the profession of physic but as the rules abovementioned are sufficient to distinguish an empirical pretender from a qualified practitioner so by the application of those rules to the surgeons it is very easily demonstrable that they cannot but come under the denomination of quacks in physic  tho from what has been already advanced both concerning the praerequisita and the conclusions which have been drawn from the enumeration of them it may seem altogether needless yet i shall now proceed to offer three or four reasons more which will further demonstrate the necessity of a regulation in physic and those may be said to regard i the good of the public in general ii the universities in particular iii the art of physic it self iv the regular professors of it   i the first reason then for the necessity of such a regulation concerns the good of the public and is the loss of her majestys subjects and if i affirm that the encouragement of quacks tends as much to the dispeopling of the kingdom as the wars the computation must be allowed to be modest provided they kill as many in other parts of the kingdom as they do in those within the sphere of my own observation but the truth of this assertion will more evidently appear to any one who does but fairly consider the number of quacks with which every corner of this kingdom has the misfortune to abound for what but the most dismal execution upon the lives or the most dreadful destruction of mankind can be expected from such a prodigious number of men who understanding not what they profess may truly be said to be qualified as they are licensed to kill and though the most horrid slaughters are daily committed without any fear of punishment or reproof yet it is not a more melancholy reflection to consider what a vast number of men fall by the hands of these executioners than that the executioners themselves should escape the hands of public justice i am not able to express my indignation against such presumptuous homicides they ought to be extirpated if not at once yet by degrees as the wolves out of the kingdom  but to return i hope to be excused for whosoever is well apprizd of her powers may be pardoned for asserting that it is better trusting to nature than to an ignorant pretender in physic that physicians are only servants to nature and that she is morborum medicatrix are truths known to the ancients and confirmd by the irrefragable experience of the moderns and as nature alone will conquer some diseases and judiciously assisted the greatest part so nothing is a brighter demonstration of the greatness of her strength than that even the mismanagement of nurses apothecaries and other quacks is not able to hinder the recovery of very large numbers which fall under their hands the greatest part of the symptoms of diseases are the efforts of nature but which efforts being easily disturbed or soon opposed require the most strict and wary observance and without judgment we may sooner injure than assist her sooner oppress than relieve her a physician ought therefore religiously to observe and obey the motions of nature to look upon them as his surest guides in the cure of any distemper and to be advised according to them what to do and when and in what manner to proceed the art of physic is not understood till the artist comprehends in the words of my lord bacon quid natura ferat and faciat but if the calamities of the sick are increased by the very means which are used for their relief if instead of carefully assisting nature in her progresses to the preservation of life she be clogged with useless and insignificant or oppressed with dangerous and destructive applications i may justly conclude the condition of those people who have the misfortune to fall under such hands to be indeed a very deplorable one and the loss of her majestys subjects from the fatal mismanagement of so vast a number of quacks to be consequently so very great that the encouragement of them may truly be said to tend as much to the dispeopling of the kingdom as the wars  ii another argument for the necessity of a regulation in physic is that the encouragement of empiricism has already been a very great and will hereafter be a far greater detriment to the universities for it can never be supposed that men will be at the expense of sending their sons to any of the seminaries of good literature and ingenuous education when the honors and employments of a faculty may be obtained without it and there is so little distinction made between a regular and an extempore doctor the apothecaries and other quacks now openly avow their resolutions of seizing on the practice of physic and of excluding in time all the university physicians they give not only examples but also assurances of success to all the intruders into divinity and others of the pretended education in the liberal sciences it would indeed be no great matter of wonder or complaint were empiricks encouraged only by the ordinary sort of people or as the french call them the petits gens there being as i have often observed a sort of sympathy between understandings but it is very unaccountably surprising and a just matter of complaint that any of the distinguished part of mankind should venture even in dangerous cases to employ such illiterate and consequently ignorant pretenders and what still enhances my amazement is that any of those gentlemen and especially any of the clergy who have had the happiness of an university education should give any manner of encouragement to this sort of people they have all laid themselves under the highest obligations of preserving the honor and dignity of those fountains of learning and the physicians of the soul in particular being obliged to visit their parishioners in sickness ought not only to inform them that it is their duty but to press them also to apply to the physicians of the body whom the divine laws ecclesiast        as well as our own have appointed instead of either making use of empiricks themselves or advising others to make use of them i can never sufficiently deplore these indignities offered to our universities nor ever enough blame and condemn the abettors and promoters of them but am not without hopes that such growing mischiefs as these are will sometime be thought worthy the consideration of those in whom alone is lodged the power of redressing them  iii another argument for the necessity of a regulation in physic regards the art it self the encouragement of quacks and empiricks threatening the ruin of the profession as well as of the people twould be no very difficult task to demonstrate the certainty of the medical principles and consequently the real usefulness of physic to mankind but such an attempt does not at all seem necessary in my present design because it is not to be supposed that persons should apply themselves even to the most ignorant pretenders in physic unless such persons really thought they should receive some benefit from the directions of those to whom they did apply yet notwithstanding physic is undoubtedly established upon such principles as do wholly free it from those reproaches of uncertainty which it has often though falsely been charged with it must at the same time be confessed that the malignity of some acute and the stubbornness of some chronical diseases do often elude all the assistances of human art for the most judicious and the most experienced physicians can have no power as the wise man expresses it in the day of death but this can be no manner of objection to the certainty of the medical principles because it may happen and not proceed from any defect in the rules of the art it self for from a due consideration of the materials which compose a human body the elegancy of its structure and the continued flux of its parts it is very evident that it must necessarily be obnoxious to disorders which are diseases and sooner or later as necessarily to a dissolution which is death so that whoever is well apprizd of the wonderful fabric of the human body how curiously contrived and divinely fashioned a machine it is may consequently be rather amazed at our living so long than at our dying so soon but though it must be acknowledged that it is not in the physicians power at all times or in all extremities to retrieve or preserve his patients from the jaws of death since to die is an entail upon our natures yet it may with modesty be affirmed experience abundantly proving it that there is so much power in medicines and so much virtue in methods as to enable him if he but heedfully weighs and judiciously applies them to give ease to such as are in pain sleep to such as are wearied out with watching and strength to withstand the approaches of grim and dreaded death but a physician cannot i say be supposed capable of doing these things without a due consideration of circumstances and a judicious application of medicines for if medicines are promiscuously used in all constitutions or without regard to the circumstances of each case it is no wonder they so often deceive men in their expectations of success and therefore as the knowledge pf the praerequisita is the only means of qualifying a man for a successful practice in physic and consequently of advancing the credit and reputation of the art so the ignorance of quacks both of the nature causes and cure of diseases must necessarily produce so many and so gross mismanagements as cannot but extremely prejudice mankind in their opinion of the art their ill successes are doubtless imputed to the uncertainty of the art it self especially by the undistinguishing which is much the larger part of mankind and men from their lessened opinion of it will by degrees neglect to apply to any advice at all whereas the truly noble and divine art it self ought by no means to be charged with what is only to be imputed to the ignorance of those who pretend to profess it  besides it is a true and general observation that arts and sciences do improve and grow useful according to the encouragement of those who profess them but the frequent application to quacks and empiricks by men of all ranks and degrees even to the most exalted stations is so public and so vast a discouragement to the professors of physic that it may truly be said to threaten the very ruin and destruction of the art it self for as such a discouragement must necessarily lessen the number of the professors in physic so it will consequently obstruct the glorious progress of the art by hindering further inventions and future improvements in it and how incapable the illiterate pretenders in physic are of improving either themselves or the art has been already demonstrated we may then very fairly suppose there will be but few students in physic if after all the labor and pains of acquiring that knowledge and after all the expenses of a learned education their bread shall be taken off their trenchers as we say by every illiterate pretender what a most ingenious author observes upon another occasion is very applicable to this if we consider says he the expensiveness of the voyage which is made in search of knowledge it is very hard the undertakers should be plundered of what they bring home by privateers under the very canon which should protect them all which considerations are sufficient to show how far the encouragement of quacks and empiricks obstructs the progress of that glorious art which teaches the recovery as well as the preservation of health and consequently threatens the ruin of the profession as well as the people  iv the fourth and last argument which i shall offer for the necessity of a regulation in the practice of physic regards the physicians themselves viz that no profession is so invaded with unqualifyd pretenders as theirs i do not doubt but twill evidently appear that such an invasion is singular to the profession of physic notwithstanding what some have endeavored though without any color of reason to maintain it is well known that divinity and law have their palisadoes and intrenchements for who dare pretend in their pulpits or courts but those who are fairly initiated according to form and custom whereas the cobweb fences of physic are every day invaded any broken weaver tailor shoemaker or merry andrew dubbing himself a doctor extempore and setting up for a aesculapius so that quacking and alekeeping are now a days become the last employments to which men of decayed fortunes apply themselves to get bread and as none but those who are fairly initiated or admitted do presume upon the professions either of divinity or law so there is but one way of initiating or admitting persons into the exercise of them whereas on the other side men are admitted to practice physic by the most unreasonable and as they are at present managed i may with impunity i hope venture to say scandalous methods i mean by licenses out of the ecclesiastical courts but that the hardship of the physicians case may be set in the clearest light twill be necessary to enquire into the original end and design as well as present management of such ecclesiastical licenses i am well enough satisfied that their original end and design was very good and laudable the statute of hen     vid pultons statutes very pathetically expresses the inconveniences ensuing by ignorant persons practicing physic to the high displeasure of god great infamy to the faculty and the grievous hurt damage and destruction of his majestys liege subjects for all which reasons it enacts that the bishop of each diocese or his vicar general be empowered to examine all those except graduates who shall practice physic in that diocese but the wisdom of the same statute is no less remarkable in obliging either of them to call to him such expert persons in the said faculty as his discretion shall think fit for i hope i may venture to declare my opinion thus far that i cannot but think the gentlemen of those courts very unfit judges of a mans capacity to practice physic and therefore in    and    of hen     it is still i think more prudentially enacted that none shall practice in the country without a testimonial of his sufficiency from the president of the college of physicians and three of the electors i shall not here pretend to determine how far this posterior may be said to abrogate or null the prior act but the very end and design of these ecclesiastical licenses viz prevention of the inconveniences ensuing by ignorant persons practicing physic is not only as they are managed at present wholly frustrated but entirely perverted for they are now adays so far from preventing that they are the only means of bringing those mischiefs and inconveniences upon us which the statute mentions by admitting such shoals of unqualified persons to practice physic that the examination previous to admission was formerly strict and severe is as certain as that now a days persons are admitted without any manner of examination at all nay so far is the practice of these courts corrupted and the very end and design of these licenses perverted that they are now a days granted even from a testimonial of two licentiates can any thing then be more evidently apparent than the necessity of regulating these matters for though as i before observed the first end and design of these licenses was undoubtedly good and laudable and though they were not injurious and i am apt to think they were not originally designed to be or indeed really were to the regular physicians yet if the reason of a law ceases the law it self ought to be annulled but since the method of examination is so very much altered the original end and design of these licenses so manifestly perverted and they themselves become so vastly injurious both to the faculty and the regular professors of physic these very considerations are so many arguments a fortiori for the necessity of a regulation and now i appeal to the sensible part of mankin whether any profession be so invaded with unqualified pretenders as physic and consequently whether the physicians have not the greatest reason in the world to complain and to whom should they complain but to the legislature for doubtless it was one of the ends of parliamentary institution to receive the complaints and redress the grievances of the injured nay do we not find the legislature frequently interposing in other professions to prevent or remove grievances but what regard has there been to the most enormous ones in physic are not our lives worthy the care of the laws as well as our souls or estates  i shall now endeavor to obviate some objections which are generally made though indeed without any shadow of reason against what i have advanced and it has been objected in the first place that such a regulation would be an abridgment of the natural rights and liberties of mankind to follow those employments whereby they may get a livelihood i should be the most unwilling man in the world to advance any thing which has the least tendency to such an abridgment no i have the tenderest regard to their civil as well as religious properties but this objection would equally hold against the suppression of gaming and other disorderly houses of the royal oak and other such public nusances for if the good of the public ought not to be considered and preferred to that of private persons which i take to be an undeniable maxim in all governments the natural liberties of mankind may as properly be said to be abridgd by such a suppression as by such a regulation as i contend for the same answer will serve to some other objections which are much of the same nature and of no greater force than the former viz that the legislature is under no manner of obligation to concern it self in mischiefs which men voluntarily pull upon themselves that all flourishing governments will encourage their people some way or other to employ themselves that every man is sui juris and has a natural right of making use of any body he pleases and if he be satisfied with the risque he runs what has any one to say in contradiction to his humor  i now proceed to invalidate some excuses which are frequently made in extenuation of those practices which i have been condemning and a great many people i am apt to believe will think to clear themselves from the imputation of encouraging quacks and empiricks by saying that it is only in the beginning of diseases they apply to them that in cases of danger they generally have recourse to better advice and that this custom being so very common does not seem to need any manner of excuse but upon a stricter enquiry into this matter the custom of first sending for an apothecary or other quack will not i am apt to think appear the less ridiculous for being so frequent for as the beginning of a distemper is a very seasonable opportunity of assisting nature toward the recovery of health so the conduct of those people cannot be sufficiently condemned who neglect to improve that opportunity by not then calling in a judicious assistant but far more egregious is the folly of those who then apply themselves to any of the empirical tribe it being impossible as has been observed but such persons must make either insignificant and useless or dangerous and destructive applications and as the consideration of neglecting the improvement of this opportunity sufficiently condemns the application to those who are called safe men who as they say themselves will do no hurt if they do no good so the presumptuous tamperers on the other side may not only irreparably injure the patient but so quite change the face of a distemper as to render it very difficult if possible for even a judicious physician when called in to discover its nature but when a physician has the care of a disease from the beginning he is able to make right observations of the progress and alteration of its symptoms and consequently not only to form a surer prognostication of its event but more effectually to assist nature in the preservation of life  again there are others who pretend to excuse themselves for not applying to the best advice upon the account of saving charges though this consideration can be of no manner of force unless it can be thought an excuse to have the chance of being killed cheap but would those very people who satisfy themselves with the advice of an empirical pretender but use their arithmetic they would soon be convinced they acted as much against their interest as reason for by physicking the symptoms and neglecting the cause of a disease the length of the bill as well as the distemper must be consequently increased it is not the collusive pretense of giving advice without a fee which can or ought to be esteemed an equivalent  there are some again who pretend to excuse themselves by pleading that those to whom they apply are masters of some magnified receipt or pretended infallible remedy for this or that distemper  but the vanity of confiding in such trifles has been sufficiently exposed by the plainest demonstration that the most celebrated preparations even of the philosophers by fire are not capable of curing diseases without a judicious and methodical application i shall therefore only subjoin another consideration which is an unanswerable argument of their insufficiency viz that none of these magnified receipts or infallible nostrums have ever stood the test of an age accordingly our very own experience is so far from confirming that it daily contradicts the pretended virtues which the alchymical writers and the public venders of quack medicines with a peremptory assurance ascribe to them  it is urged again that though it must be confessed that very easily curable diseases are often made fatal by quacks yet it is equally true that several persons recover under their hands to this i answer that they recover it is true when the patients have more of their natural vigor than the others are able to destroy and rather to the strength of nature is the happy event to be ascribed than to the judgment of the medicinal administrator such particular cases being no more arguments of their skill than a blind mans throwing stones and hitting some people in a crowd is an argument of the goodness of his aim  having thus fairly and impartially represented the present state of physic in this kingdom plainly indicated the number of quacks with which it is so unhappy as to abound and fully demonstrated not only the impossibility of their being serviceable but the absolute necessity of their being injurious to it in the exercise of the profession they pretend to i think nothing can be more consequentially evident than the necessity of a regulation in the practice of physic and i am not without hopes that some of the abovementioned reasons viz the good of her majestys subjects in general the honor and advantages of her universities in particular the life and reputation of so useful an art as physic or the particular hardships which the gentlemen of that faculty have the misfortune to labor under i am not without hopes i say that some of these reasons will so far influence our legislators as to prevail with them to take the representation of this case into their immediate consideration it is a case undoubtedly of the greatest moment and importance for as the life and health of every individual subject so consequently all ranks and qualities all parties and distinctions of men are in the highest degree and equally concerned in it and as the great importance of the debate makes it not unworthy the cognizance and enquiry of our legislators so the very nature of it seems more particularly to recommend it self to their consideration for it is certainly a great shame as well as an unhappiness that in a kingdom where so many good laws are in force and in which as much care is taken of the liberties and properties of the subject as in any nation upon earth the people should lie open and unguarded in their dearest and most valuable enjoyments health and life there is nothing therefore which in my opinion seems more plainly to demonstrate a deficiency in our laws than the want of some to regulate the gross miscarriages and enormous abuses in the practice of physic the college of physicians it is true is vested with some measure of authority but as their authority is confined to certain limits so through want of an enlargement of their charter it is not at present of that use as seems correspondent to the design of its royal institution but either by enlarging the charter to the college of physicians or by such ways and means as the wisdom of our legislature shall better approve of there seems nothing more feasible than to make a sufficient provision against these pernicious and destructive practices and whenever it shall seem expedient to those who sit at the helm of our excellent government to undertake so useful and necessary a work i humbly recommend    that the distinct spheres of physicians surgeons and apothecaries be limited and specified the surgeons restrained to their proper business the apothecaries confined to their shops and all illiterate and empirical pretenders in physic suppressed    that a provision be made for the poor to have their share in the best advice and medicines  as the want of such a regulation in physic is one of the greatest flaws in our constitution and highly reflects upon the best of governments so such a regulation would undoubtedly tend as much to the honor of our nation as the preservation of its people and which not only the present but all succeeding generations will have the greatest reason in the world to applaud  finis
