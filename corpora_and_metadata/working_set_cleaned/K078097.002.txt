exterminated race confined sad captives never to revisit more their native isle a silent wharf admits themistocles on shore a void extent where sons of neptune heretofore had swarmed no mooring vessel in the haven rode no footstep marked the ways sole inmates there calamity and horror as enthroned sat on oerwhelming ruins and forbade the hero passage till a seeming track presents half buried in surrounding heaps of desolation what appears a dome raised to some god themistocles observes a shattered porch whose proud supporters lie in fragments save one column which upholds part of a sculptured pediment where black by conflagation an inscription maimed retains these words to eleutherian jove the athenian enters followed by his train in arms complete excluded was the day by ruins pild externally around unless what broken thinlyscatterd rays shot through the encumbered portal soon they stand amidst obscuring dusk in silence all all motionless in wonder while a voice distinct in tone delivers through the void these solemn accents eleutherian god since no redeemer to eretria fallen thy will vouchsafes why longer do thou keep thy aged servant on a stage of woe why not release him why not close his eyes so vainly melting over his country lost ten years are fled the morning i have hailed in sighs alone have laid my head on thorns of anguish nightly visited in dreams by images of horror which employ each waking moment to have seen destroyed from their foundations my paternal streets the holy structures burn a people forced in climates new and barbarous to dwell was

vents his tortured thoughts tisander can thy prayers repel grim famine rushing on the blast of barren winter three disastrous days will lay the combatants for greece in dust behind them leaving nothing but a name for salamis to publish lo they come a dying people suppliant to repose within thy fane their fleshdivested bones yet such a tomb their fainting voices cry may those eretrians envy who are doomed to lodge their captive limbs in asias mold he ends in sighs behold a ghastly troop slow through the ruins of their native streets in languid pace advance so gathering shoals of ghosts

their wants discreet sicinus curbs excess the tidings brought of his performance from a short repast dismissed his lord applauding who serene stretched on his naval pillow slept till dawn he rose to him sicinus will my lord permit his servant with an active band of sailors these obstructions to remove or so dispose that feeblest steps may find a passage free to good tisanders fane that through its wonted apertures the round of that huge pile where jupiter should dwell now dark as plutos palace may admit the light of heaven yet further we must search for coverts dry if such the greedy flames have left among these ruins to secure the various stores which cleon may transport to him his lord go monitor expert accomplish what thou counselst toward the fane himself not slow proceeds before the front on scattered fragments of their ancient homes the eretrians pale with longcontinud want are seated thick as winterfamishd birds perch on the boughs which icicles encrust yet chirp and flutter in the attempring sun these at the heros presence wave their hands unite their efforts in acclaim not loud but cordial rather in a general sigh of gratitude the charitable care of his best warriors some of noblest birth impart their help like parents to a race of tender infants onc f might approved in battle hardiest of the naval breed the eretrians worn by hunger scarce retain the slender powers of childhood one by one themistocles consoles them and devotes in condescension sedulous the day to kindness not impolitic in these his piercing genius fit materials saw to build another structure of renown ere he retires tisander thus he greets will thou o father on my board bestow an evening hour my moments all belong to this yet helpless people said the priest such pious care through me shall heaven reward exclaims the chief as round him he remarks the toiling sailors soon thou guardian good of wretched men committed to thy charge soon shall thy temple reassume its state prepare an altar hecatombs again shall smoke ere long eretria cast aside her widowed garb and lift her festive palms to eleutherian jove this uttered swift he seeks his vessel while the sun descends calm as in summer through an either clear aurora leads the day a cheerful sound of oxen lowing from the hollow dales which toward carystus wind of bleeting sheep yet nearer driven across the eretrian plain awake themistocles his couch he leaves revisiting the temple there enjoys the general transport plenty on the wing is nigh the comforts of her fruitful horn to pour on desolation cleon comes accosting thus themistocles my task is well accomplished through the liberal zeal of hyacinthus near a youth unlike his sire nicomachus that subtle chief of our carystian neighbors is behind escorting laden carriages of grain thy purchase naught his sordid hand bestows he curious more than friendly in our need or of thy name respectful to explore not help or pity hither bends his course conduct the father to my ship replied themistocles sure yonder is the son thou have described ingenuous are his looks like him whose name he bears his beauteous form might charm the beaming god once more to court a mortals friendship but dejection pale oercasts his hue strange melancholy dims his youthful eye too modest or unmannd by languor child of grief he stops and bows in distant seeming awe which wounds my soul i must salute him noble youth receive my hand themistocles of greece expects no such obeisance from a fellow greek the majesty of athens might exact that conquered tyrants in my presence brought low as the dust should crouch beneath her chief a start of anguish hyacinthus gave at these last words then silent bowed again his decent brow not awe but latent ills seemed to control his tongue the observant chief defers enquiry to its season due to cleons charge consigns him and retires to his own galley waiting for the sire he meditates a moment on the son i see advantage in this youths distress  my plan is formed he hastens to unbar his copious treasure thence in dazzling show he spreads four silver talents on his board over them a mantle throws and brief again thus ruminates now plutus who can sap the strongbasd tower and soften rigid hearts smile on this juncture aristides scorns thy deity themistocles invokes thy precious succor from profoundest woe disconsolate eretria thou have raised now by a sordid instrument give life to dull carystus sudden in his view by cleon brought who instantly withdraws nicomachus appears and thus begins the salaminian victor i salute charged by carystus happy is my lot to venerate the chief and touch the hand which humbled asia does euboea see thee visitant illustrious to rebuild eretria then instruct her to confine that power and pride her neighbors felt of old the athenian here euboea sees me come both to upraise carystian and depress but to exalt thy state my friend i wish wish thy possessions equal to thy worth behold uplifting to the greedy eye of avarice the mantle he pursues behold four silver talents them accept which in this casket to thy trusted slaves i will deliver now i only ask of thy deepfounded influence to warm supine carystus for thyself and greece unite with mine thy standard further note if at my summons thou produce in arms thy citizens auxiliar from this hand expect four added talents but the hopes of no unpracticed leader who perceives his enterprise assured dare promise more a share nicomachus of spoil in war to pass thy own belief by present gain by more in promise not by glory fired nicomachus rejoins a thousand spears shall wait thy earliest notice while he spoke he snatched the casket shut the treasure close then rushed to seek his confidential slave who takes the precious charge with placid looks the cool the politic athenian sat like some experienced pilot who serene in skilful guidance of the steady helm enjoys the favor smooth of gale and tide combined to waft over oceans fickle breast his gliding keel and lodge her costly freight secure at length in harbor now he spoke to his reentring guest carystian friend thou have a son welldisciplind to war brave liberal wise i doubt not will thou trust to my society a while his youth he is the object of my vows to heaven nicomachus exclaims in passion feigned my souls delight the rapture of my eye if he were absent every hour my age would feel a growing burden come rejoins the athenian him i only would detain my messenger of order to thy walls on him another talent would bestow the gymnic school and letters cries the sire he follows heeds not treasure by his hand send me the talent never let him know the charge he bears this said he loudly calls to hyacinthus who had gained the deck him entering thus addresses son the chief of athens great themistocles demands thee for companion as a casual gleam breaks through the unravlling texture of black clouds which long on winters sullen face have hung so darts a ray of gladness through the gloom of hyacinthus by the attic chief not unobserved intent on swift return the exulting father bids to both farewell remaining day themistocles employs among his sailors in the eretrian streets inspects the necessary toil pursued with unremitted vigor then retires to due refection cleon is a guest with hyacinthus still by grief devoured which all his efforts strive in vain to hide her heavy wing no sooner night outspreads than to sicinus they are given in charge while to his couch themistocles repairs end of the eleventh book the athenaid book the twelfth now in the zodiac had the sun oerpassd the tenth fair sign the new succeeding month though not by flora nor vertumnus decked nor green in hue though first of winters train often with unsullied skies irradiate cheers the prone creation and delights mankind the birds yet warble on the leafless sprays the placid surface glazed by clearest light in crystal rivers and transparent lakes or oceans smooth cerulean bosom shows the finny tribes in play the active son of neocles uprises and descries a dawn which promised purity of air of light and calmness tempting sloth herself to action thus he roused his native fire of this kind season not a moment lose themistocles sicinus ever nigh he called provide two receptacles sure each to contain twelve talents bring my arms produce a second suit resembling mine send hyacinthus let my chosen band of attic friends and spartas fifty youths my followers be ready for a march soon hyacinthus enters still he shows the perturbation of a mind oppressed by some concealed misfortune while beneath the shade of sorrow on his front appeared excelling graces him the chief bespake gay in his look and sprightly in his tone her eastern hill behold the morning mounts in radiance scattered from the liquid gems on her loose mantle but the heart of youth in every season should rejoice in clouds not less than sunshine whether natures voice be hoarse in storms or tune to whispering gales her vernal music sharp some inward grief when youth is sad yet fortune often deceives the inexperiencd by imagined ills or light which counsel of the more mature can lightly heal unlock thy liberal mind to me a guardian pregnant of relief beyond thy father countrymen or friends impart thy cares the sighing guest replied to thy control my service i devote o scourge of tyrants but retain my grief which thou o first of mortals or the king of high olympus never can redress sicinus interrupts his lords commands are all accomplished now carystian friend resembling me in stature size and limbs the son of neocles proceeds accept that suit of armor i have tried it well receive a shield familiar to my arm he next instructs sicinus thou receive twelve talents hasten to the neighboring walls of stately chalcis populous and rich queen of euboean cities in whose port the twenty ships of athens yet remain which chalcis borrowed and equipped for war of her bold race four thousand we beheld distinguished late in artemisiums fight at salamis yet later first approach the newmade archon in a revrent style timoxenus most potent in that state a dubious timid magistrate unlike nearchus cordial salutation bear to him my brave associate do not turn thy back on chalcis till thy prudence brings intelligence of weight the athenian keels with grain abundant and materials lade that friendly roofs the eretrians may obtain before grim winter harrow up these streights unnavigable soon this said he arms begirt by warriors to the temple speeds and greets the priest in gladsome thought i see the goddess health whitehanded crimsoncheekd as from a silver car in roseate uds look on thy people dropping on their lips restoring dew she bids them taste and live the convalescent piously employ in labors where my naval band shall join to free the encumbered temple to repair to cover dwellings lest the winter bring new hardships martial exercise i leave to cleons care while ten revolving suns of absence i must count now father take this hand a hand which fortune and thy god have ever favored which shall soon convert the annual day of mourning in thy fane to festival solemnity of joy blessed by tisander rapid he departs young hyacinthus follows who in arms once by his patron worn to every eye presents a new themistocles but such as when the allurement of his early bloom he not unconscious of the charm displayed to attic damsels cloudless on their march apollo shoots a clear and tepid ray a scattered village in carystian bounds to rural hospitality admits the wearied warriors hyacinthus guides his great protector to a sheltering fane of juno styled connubial stately round old beech extend a venerable shade through ages time had witnessed to their growth whose ruddy texture disarrayd of green glows in the purple of declining day they pass the marble threshold when the youth with visage pale in accents broken spoke unequalled man behold the only place for thy reception fit for mine he paused a gushing torrent of impetuous grief overwhelmed his cheeks now starting on he rushed before the sacred image wrung his hands then sinking down along the pavement rolled his body in distraction would have dashed his forehead there themistocles prevents uplifts and binds him in a strong embrace when thus in eager agony the youth is not thy purpose godlike man to crush the tyrant demonax in torture cut the murderer short that he may feel the pangs of death unnatural young man replies the athenian grave to know my hidden thoughts do thou aspire retaining still thy own still in my presence thy distemper drinks the cup of misery concealed and seems rejecting friendships salutary hand to court the draught which poisons can thou hope mysterious youth my confidence yet none wilt in themistocles repose his look his tone in feigned austerity he wrapped so aesculapius bitter juice applied from helpful plants his wisdom had explored the vehicles of health in humble tears which melted more than flowed the mourner thus forgive me too regardless of thy grace of all forgetful save itself my grief deserves thy frown yet less than giddy joy which grown familiar wantons in the smile of condescension ah that grief will change reproof to more than pity will excite a thirst for vengeance when thy justice hears a tale  unfold it interposed the chief to one who knows the various ways of men has studied long their passions and their woes nor less the medicines for a wounded mind then hyacinthus mighty chief recall thy first successes when euboeas maids saw from her shores barbarian pendants lowrd to thine and grateful plucked the flowers of may to dress in chaplets thy victorious deck then at thy generous instigation fired the men of oreus from their walls expelled cursed demonax their tyrant on a day ah source of short delight of lasting pain i from the labor of a tedious chase oerspent by thirst and heat a forest gained a rill meandring to a green recess i trackd my wonder saw a damsel there in sumptuous vesture couched on fragrant tufts of camomile amid surrounding flowers reposing tall erect a figure stern was nigh all sable on his head and brow above his lip and shadowing his cheeks the hair was brisled fierce but frank his eye a grim fidelity revealed his belt sustained a sabre from a quiver full on sight of me an arrow keen he drew a wellstrung bow presented my approach forbidding loudly she upstarting waked my aspect surely gentle when i first beheld cleora more of hope than fear inspired she craved protection  what ye fates was my protection  o superior man can thy sublimity of soul endure my tedious anguish interposing mild the athenian here take time give sorrow vent my hyacinthus i forbid not tears he now pursues her suppliant hands she raised to me astonished hearing from her lips that demonax was author of her days amid the tumult his expulsion caused she from a rural palace where he stored well known to her a treasure with a slave in faith approved with gold and gems of price escaped all night on fleetest steeds they rode nor knew what hospitable roof to seek my fathers sister glauce close behind this fane of juno dwelt her priestess pure my kindest parent to her roof i brought  o glauce what  o dearest most revered to thee i brougnt cleora horror pale now blanched his visage shook his loosning joints congealed his tongue and raised his rigid hair the athenian calm and silent waits to hear the reassumed narration o ye flowers how were ye fragrant forth in transport wild bursts hyacinthus o embowring woods how soft your shades refreshment founts and rills how sweet your cadence while i won the hand of my cleora to the nuptial tie by spotless vows before thy image bound o goddess hymeneal o what hours of happiness untainted dear espoused did we possess kind glauce smiled on both the earliest birds of morning to her voice of benediction sung the gracious found our evening heard content our pillow smoothed even oxus so cleoras slave was named of sacian birth with grim delight and zeal anticipates our will my nuptials known brings down my father whose resentment warm the affinity with demonax reproves a helpless vagabond a hopeless wretch for now thy sword at salamis prevailed this storm cleora calmed the generous fair before my father laid her dazzling gems she gave he took them all returned content left us too happy in exhaustless stores of love for envious fate to leave unspoild meantime no rumor pierced our tranquil bower that demonax in oreus was replacd that he two golden talents to the hand which should restore cleora had proclaimed to me was all unknown two moons complete have spent their periods since one evening late nicomachus my presence swift required a dying mother to embrace by morn i gained carystus by the close of day a tender parent on my breast expired an agitation unexpected shook my fathers bosom as i took farewell on my return  i can no more  yes yes dwell on each hideous circumstance my tongue with horror tear my heartstrings till they burst poor hyacinthus has no cure but death the sun was broad at noon my recent loss lamenting yet asswaging by the joy to see cleora soon never left before a tedious interval to me i reached my home the abode of glauce closed the door forbids my passage to repeated calls no voice replies two villagers pass by who at my clamours help to force my way i pass one chamber strangled on the floor two damselministers of juno lie i hurry on a second where my wife was in my absence to partake the couch of glauce shows that righteous woman dead the dear impression where cleoras limbs sleep had embraced i saw the only trace of her the last these eyes shall ever behold her name my accents strong in frenzy sound cleora makes no answer next i fly from place to place on sacian oxus call he is not there a lethargy benumbs my languid members in a neighboring hut lodged by the careful peasants i awake insensible to knowledge of my state the direful tidings from carystus rouse my friends nicanor to my fathers home transports me lingering torpid i consumed sevn moons successive when too vigorous youth recalled my strength and memory to curse health sense and thought my rashness would have sought cleora even in oreus there have faced the homicide her sire forbid withheld nicanor i deputed when i marched to bid thee welcome on the way i met that friend returned  persist my faltring tongue rehearse his tidings pitying heaven may close thy narrative in death  the sacian slave produced cleora to her savage sire so fame reports all oreus so believes but this is trivial to the tragic scene which all beheld her hand the tyrant doomed to mindarus a persian lord the chief of his auxiliar guard but she refused and owned our union which her pregnant fruit of love too well confirmed the monster blind with madning fury instantly decreed that deadliest poison through those beauteous lips should choke the springs of life my weeping friend saw her pale relics on the funeral pyre i am not mad  even that relief the gods deny me all my story i have told been accurate on horror to provoke the stroke of death yet live thou must exclaims the chief humanely artful thou must live without thy help i never can avenge on demonax thy wrongs ha cries the youth art thou resolved to lift thy potent arm against the murderer yes the athenian said i will do more thy virtue will uphold whose perseverance through such floods of woe could wade to bid me welcome generous youth trust to the man whom myriads never withstood who towns from ruin can to greatness raise can humble fortune force her fickle hand to render up the victim she has marked for shame and sorrow force her to entwine with her own finger a triumphant wreath to deck his brow themistocles who drives despair and desolation from the streets of fallen eretria and from eastern bonds afflicted greece at salamis preserved he will thy genius to his native powers restore will make thee master of revenge for thy own wrongs to glorious action guide thy manly steps redressing as they tread the wrongs of others not the gracious voice of juno speaking comfort from her shrine not from his tripod joves prophetic seed imparting counsel through his pythian maid not jove himself from dodonaean groves by oracles of promise could have soothed this young but most distinguished of mankind among the wretched as the wellwrought strain of thy heartsearching policy expert themistocles like some wellpractisd son of learned machaon over a patients wound compassionate but cool who never permits his own sensation to control his art but said the athenian soldiers must refresh as well as fast nor keep incessant watch they quit the temple in the dwelling nigh deepmusing hyacinthus lightly tastes the light repast on matted tufts they stretch their wearied limbs themistocles had armed with elevated thoughts his pupils mind which foils at intervals despair his eyes the transient palm of sleep would often seal but often in dreams his dear espoused he sees a livid spectre an empoisond cup she holds and weeps  then vanishes revenge in bloody sandals and a dusky pall succeeds her stature growing as he gazed reveals a glory beaming round her head a sword she brandishes the awful sword which nemesis unsheathes on crimes he sees connubial junos image from the base descend and pointing with its marble hand before him glide a sudden shout of war the yell of death carystian banners waved an apparition of himself in arms stir every sense the dreadful tumult ends the headless trunk of demonax in gore he views in transport instantly his couch shoots forth in laurels vaulting over his head the walls are hung with trophies juno comes no longer marble but the queen of heaven clad in resplendency divine she leads cleora now to perfect bloom restored who beckning opens to the enraptured eye of hyacinthus doting on the charm her breast of snow whence pure ambrosial milk allures an infant from an amber cloud who stoops and round her neck maternal clings he to embrace them striving waked and lost the endearing picture of illusive air but waked composed his mantle he assumed to junos statue trod and thus unlocked his pious breast o goddess though thy smile which i acknowledge for the hours of bliss i once possessed a brief exhausted term could not protect me from malignant fate lo prostrate fallen before thee i complain no more my soul shall struggle with despair nor shall the furies drag me to the grave thou punishment do threaten to the crime which has defaced my happiness on earth themistocles my patron is thy boon who will fulfill thy menace i believe there is a place hereafter to admit such purity as hers whose blissful hand thou did bestow  i lost  i know my days with all their evils of duration short i am not conscious of a black misdeed which should exclude me from the seat of rest and therefore wait in pious hope that soon shall hyacinthus find his wife and child with them to dwell forever he concludes regains the chamber and aurora shines end of the twelfth book the athenaid book the thirteenth when hyacinthus first his couch forsook themistocles in care had followed close but secretly had noted well the prayer to juno sent and part approving part condemning heard accoutrd now in mail the young carystian to his listening friend relates the wonders of his recent dream the athenian while most cordial in the care of hyacinthus whom his woes endeared still weighed his use this answer he devised to ease the grief he pitied and preserve the worth essential to his own designs what thou have told carystian fires my breast it was a signal by saturnia held to animate thy rage and prompt thy arm to action she requires not goddess wise humiliation scorns the sluggish mind whose thoughts are creeping to elysian rest they hush no throbs of anguish while it rends the mangled heartstrings no not more than staunch a bleeding wound or quench a fevers flame we earn elysium and our evils here surmount alike

confidence who feels circaean magic from his patrons eye his tongue and gesture he quicksighted turns to swift advantage his delusion thus come let me try thy vigor i am bound to neighboring styra fly before thy friend among that generous people who their all two galleys sent to salamis proclaim themistocles approaches like a dart lancd from the sinews of a parthians arm without reply the inspired

troubled waves nor jove the raging thunderbolt compose more than divine themistocles had tamed oppression terror anguish and despair this had geraestus in her evil day the panicawd carystians this had proved not less than sad eretria her he finds rejoicing like some widow late forlorn who in the house of mourning with a train of pining orphans titute had  but by a hand beneficent upraisd ungirds the humble sackcloth from her loins nor longer sprinkles ashes on her head amid reviving plenty such the change among the eretrians through the copious aid sicinus lent within chalcidic walls still sedulous abiding every face the gladdning touch of rosytincturd health illumines now from ruins cleared the streets by stable feet of passengers are trod the impending seasons turbulence to foil works under cleons and tisanders eye begun the vigorous populace inspired by their protectors presence now pursue with industry to match the beaver breed laborious and sagacious who construct by native art their mansions to repel congealing air and hoary drifts of snow in winters harsh domains from day to day the toil continued early on a morn a stranger came in body all deformed in look oblique but keen an eastern garb enwrappd his limbs distorted from his tongue fell barbarous accents he addressed the chief in grecian phrase which falterd on his tongue i am a tyrian trafficker in slaves returning home from libya have been forced by dangerous winds to this euboean coast for shelter watching for a friendly gale i learned from fame that warrior thou do wield a sword which prospers and its captives dooms to servitude themistocles commands the sevn geraestian tyrants from his ship where at the bottom they had gnashd their teeth in chains unslackend to the merchant then without a price these miscreants from our climes remove the farthest hence will best repay the obligation for a master choose the most ferocious savage on the wilds of horrid scythia or the caspian bound secure conductors he appoints a band to chain them fast aboard each irksome step they count in curses over euboea lost not as their native region but the seat of power and crimes triumphantly enjoyed they weep still criminal in tears but soon when from the harbor distance had obscured the wellrowd bark the fetters from their limbs the merchant orders who another tone another mien assuming thus began geraestian lords redemption you derive from demonax of oreus me the first among his council lamachus by name he sent to practice on the wily chief of athens wiles which undermine his own they land at dium thence to oreus march where demonax admits them as he sat in secret council your disasters known obtaind our instant succor what intends themistocles this answer is returned not less great prince themistocles intends than thy destruction of eretrian blood all who survive geraestus styra join against thy throne carystus from her walls will pour battalions by eudora fired the amarynthian priestess has declared war in dianas name the laboring hind will quit the furrow shepherds from their flocks youths from their sport the keeper from his herd will run to arms at her commanding voice so prevalent the sound the tyrant turns to mindarus the persian let us march swift to destroy the serpent in his egg to him the persian demonax forgets that winters rigor chills the soldiers blood do thou not hear the tempest while it howls around us even mardonius active bold now rests in covert of thessalian roofs nor fights with nature shall my general hear that i conduct the race of hottest climes in freezing rain and whirlwinds to assail a strongwalld town protected by a chief for valor skill and stratagem renowned with all the unsparing elements his guard again the tyrant mindarus confine thy asiatics till the roses bud while i in howling storms in damps or frost will head my own euboeans heaven forbid the wary lamachus subjoins my lord repose no trust without thy foreign bands in these new subjects gods the alluring guile of that athenian would dissolve thy ranks to his own hostile banner would seduce half thy battalions demonax again then policy with policy shall war among the eretrians publish from their hands this virulent athenian i require bound and delivered to my will their wives their children else late captives of my sword shall from their state of servitude be dragged to bleed the immediate victims of my wrath then mindarus should great mardonius hear that i such inhumanity permit he would exert his full monarchal power my guilty limbs condemning to a cross in fury foaming demonax exclaims i am betrayed thee mindarus the son of that stern prince who laid eretria waste thee xerxes future sovereign of the world appointed my supporter in this isle that i a branch from his imperial root might grow a splendid vassal of his throne my cause his service now thy heart disowns perverse thy sword abandons of my friends thou best requited most ingrate preferred once to have been my son of treasures vast the destined heir my successor in sway do thou desert me and protect my foes but to mardonius to the mighty king i will accuse thee by the infernal powers themistocles has gained thee or thou fear to face that captain on the field of war his breast the persian striking thus in tears do thou recall thy parricide to wound my inmost bosom though another held my dear cleora by the holiest ties i would have struggled with despairing love but sink overwhelmed by horror of that deed which blasting such perfection calls on heaven for punishment unbounded if thou fallst it is the hand of horomazes weighs to earth a body overcharged with guilt do thou upbraid me undeserving man forgetting recent service who restored thy scepter lost what captain has reduced orobia dium half euboeas towns but mindarus he these achievements past regrets but while appointed by his prince will urge his duty to accomplish new then come the season for a warriors toil themistocles shall see my banner guide twelve thousand spears shall see my early sword to general battle or to single fight defy the experience of his powerful arm he said and left the council all withdrew but lamachus the tiger when escaped or fell hyaena from an eager chase of dogs and hunters feels not more dismay mixed with a thirst insatiate of revenge than shook the monster demonax who thus to lamachus insulted and controlled by an audacious stranger do i rule in oreus longer by a poisoned draught or midnight poniard mindarus shall die ariobarzanes second in command will serve me best the counselor subjoins if secret poison or a midnight blow would remedy the grievance i would try their instant operation but reflect twelve thousand warriors masters of thy fate who love their general living on his death might prove too harsh inquisitors at least his courage use once more on open foes a valiant leader makes the soldier brave so have we found in mindarus reserve assassination for a greater mark themistocles the tyrant quick proclaim five golden talents on his head the price discreet though wicked lamachus again would thou incense all greece whose navy rules the main however triumphant in the field no timely help mardonius could extend the genius of themistocles the nymph of salamis indignant by his side would range from state to state their loud alarm would send the whole confederated fleet before the earliest breezes of the spring to pour vindictive myriads on our coast then what our doom no demonax my lord these sevn geraestians while thy recent grace transports their minds and blows the embers hot of rage at recent insult let us league against this formidable man by oaths before the furies in their neighboring cave thyself be present yes the monster said i will be present though cleoras ghost be there and that vile produce which disgraced her virgin zone remembrance of his guilt he roused to strengthen fury and revenge there was a cavern in the bowels deep of naked rock by oreus where the stern eumenides possessed a dusky shrine and frowned in direful idols from the time that titans offspring over euboea reigned the enemies of jove around it slept a stagnant water overarchd by yews growth immemorial which forbade the winds ever to disturb the melancholy pool to this the fabled residence abhorred of hellsprung beings demonax himself predominating demon of the place conducts the sevn assassins there no priest officiates single there as charon grim a boatman wafts them to the caverns mouth they enter fenced in armor down the black descent over moist and lubricated stone they tread unstable nights impurest birds with noisome wings each loathing visage beat of each the shuddring flesh through plated steel by slimy efts and clinging snakes is chilled cold creeping toads beset the infected way now at the caves extremity obscene they reach the sisters three tremendous forms of huge misshapen size alecto there tisiphone megaera on their fronts display their scorpion curls within their grasp their serpents writhed before them sulfurous fires in vases broad antiquitys rude toil to render horror visible diffused such light as hell affords beside a chasm whose bottom blind credulity confined by tartarus alone with trembling feet stood lamachus the wicked and deformed an ewe in dye like ebony he gored the dark abyss received a purple stream next to the dire conspirators he held a vessel over the brim their naked arms they stretched he pierced the veins the envenomed blood a fit libation mixed for hell he poured down the deep cleft then faltring half dismayed at his own rites began ye injured men of wealth and honors violently spoiled implacably condemned to bonds and rods by insolent themistocles before these dreadful goddesses you swear his death you vow by every means revenge can prompt in secret ambush or in open fight by day by night with poison sword or fire else on your heads you imprecate the wrath of these inexorable powers they swore meantime the object of their impious oaths whatever his future destiny enjoyed the comforts which eretria now partook through him so justly her preserver styled while thus reflection whispered to his heart this aristides would delight to see for this commend his rival though my soul knows that in quest of glory for this port i spread the adventurous sail yet sweeter far she feels that glory since a gallant race snatched from the gripe of misery and death by her exalted faculties become her means of power and greatness i confess an act like this my rival would achieve nor other motive seek than acting well perhaps with more attention to myself more sudden more complete is my success lo in his view sicinus just arrived from chalcis him his joyful lord thus hailed we have been long asunder welcome thrice thou long expected on thy brow i see intelligence to whom the faithful man one moon i spent in chalcis i addressed nearchus first of chares slain in fight at artemisium successor approved to lead his countrys banners he rejoiced in thy arrival not so frank in joy timoxenus the archon on the day of my return that hesitating chief

embellished truth beyond her native guise in various lengthened texture of discourse a web of pleasing wonders to ensnare the hearers heart till midnight he pursues a strain like magic to the listening fair nor yet his thread to salamis had reached extended fine for many sweet repasts to her inflamed desire of hearing more timoxenus at length to due repose imparts the signal they disperse her guest delights acanthes pillow but her sire in care lies anxious lest the season rude detain that guest and fatal umbrage give to demonax terrific morn and eve return acanthe drinks the pleasing stream of eloquence exhaustless in its flow whose draughts repeated but augment her thirst now in descriptions animating gloss the various scenes at salamis exalt the fair ones mind the attic wives and maids she emulates in wish and sees in thought their beauteous ranks inspiring youth and age to battle now the tumult rude of mars the crashing oars the bloodystreaming decks chill her soft bosom now that snowy seat of generous pity heaves her azure eyes melt over sandauce in her years of bloom disconsolately widowed and transpiercd by deathlike horror at her children doomed to savage bacchus here the artful man dwells on his own humanity but hides the stratagem which policy not dimmed by his compassion on compassion built when to her freedom he restored the fair who blameless helped his artifice to drive from greece her royal brother to the worth of artamanes tribute just he pays his own reception by the spartan state he colors high the public chariot given the purple mantle and the coursers proud derived from those who won the olympian wreath for demaratus but omits to speak how while seducing vanity misled his steps so far from athens she conferred the naval guidance on xanthippus brave and rule supreme on aristides just the ensnaring story to this period drawn while sevn nocturnal rounds the planets ran possesses all acanthe but disturbs her timid father trembling at the power of demonax yet fondness often would smile on her delight the evening which succeeds themistocles in fiction mixed with truth not to acanthe but his host began accompanied from sparta by the flower of her illustrious citizens i gained her borders there indignant was apprisd that demonax whom heretofore i chased from oreus now by persian arms restored was trampling on euboea vengeance fired my spirit fifty of the spartan troop at once became associates of my zeal with fifty nobles more of attic blood my full stored vessels at eretrias port from suniums cape arrived he now unfolds the wondrous series of his recent deeds what diverse passions sweet acanthe rise in thy attentive generous mind what sighs do hyacinthus and cleora wake what horror black nicomachus what joy revived eretria and geraestus freed what admiration great eudoras state what reverence good tisanders sacred locks what detestation demonax accursed behold me here themistocles concludes who lift in athens and laconias name a guardian shield over chalcis but thy sword offensive drawn shall utterly confound the homicide thy neighbor ah replies timoxenus alarmed thou little know the might of oreus demonax can range twelve thousand warriors culled from asias host of trained euboean youth and lightarmed slaves a multitude innumrous on the plain his own exactions and the persians boons oerload his treasure when the annual sun in his new course three monthly terms has filled expect mardonius from thessalias bounds on greece to pour invasion ah what help should we exchange tranquillity for war from her own wants could attica supply what lacedaemon  cool the athenian here weigh well the grace your polyphemus died in carnage grants reserving for his last most precious morsel your chalcidian wealth shall this rich mansion casket to a gem which none can value earnest here he caught acanthes earnest look shall this abode feel pillage insult which my shuddring mind scarce dares to think from that despoilers hand who scourging half euboea in this hour dreads thee great archon murderer who cut his own cleoras thread in early bloom he trembles now timoxenus at thee o blessed of parents blessing such a child as thy acanthe he thy vengeance dreads o paragon of fathers dreads thy sword unsheathed with mine presumption i disclaim or want of defrence to the wise like thee accept this roll contemplate there the force of amarynthus of carystus large geraestus and eretria add the spears of delphian timon of that hero famed oilean medon who my signal watch from atalantes isle remote the time for action then deliberate i wait without impatience thy resolves mature retired acanthe whose enlightened mind was blessed with native talents as her form with beauty strives a while in reasons scale to weigh the importance of this high attempt proposed when something whispers can thou doubt themistocles a moment can his sword do less than conquer where the powerful arm the valor where the policy to vie with him whose faculties no man can reach no god raise higher these conceptions prove a guide to fancy half the sleepless night through all the enchanting scenery of thought which recollection of his brilliant deeds his courage might humanity and grace his gentle manners and majestic frame exhibits lovely dazzling and sublime to melt her softness and her wisdom blind envelopd now by slumber in a dream which overleaps all measured time and space she sees the laurelld hero as returned from subjugated oreus on his spear the gory head of demonax he bears her yet untainted purity of heart which in sincerity of grief had mourned cleoras fate applauds the just award by nemesis and themis on the guilt of parricide her nobleness of soul enjoys the blessings which euboea reaps from such a conquest but no vision kind would interpose a warning to allay excess of transport at the conqurors sight from fair acanthes own retreat at night a wellembellishd gallerys long range bounds on the splendid chamber which admits themistocles to rest acanthe here when magisterial duties from his home her father called had entertained the guest by morn and feasted all and every morn on rich profusion of his attic words the sun was risen and summoned from her couch to this accustomed interview the fair not meeting straight the object of her search as each preceding morn she feels a pain that he is absent with a voice though low his chamber sounds to listen she disdains back to her own by delicacy led in cautious tones sicinus with his lord was thus discoursing in my wonted walk to watch events since thy arrival here i met nearchus haste he said apprise themistocles that long ere opening day his potent friends timoxenus convened heads of his faction they refuse to arm some i suspect are tainted by the gold of demonax the major part in all obey the timid archon i have strength which when themistocles commands shall try to force compliance from the cowards breast but would acanthe noble dame espouse the glorious cause her prevalence could guide his doting fondness and control his fears enough replies themistocles again the learned tutor fervent and sincere if thy persuasive eloquence could win her noble spirit to direct her sire it would be well but o resistless man let thy persuasion moderate its charm let not a generous ladys peace of mind become the victim of her winning guest the laws of hospitality revere remember too the hymeneal vow remember thy timothea fair and kind who bore those children pupils of my care she now in athens at thy absence pines misjudging friend timothea never pines when i am urging my career of fame returns the chief euboeans must be freed she shall know all and knowing will commend go charge nearchus to suppress all thought of violence his valor shall have scope died in barbarian not in civil blood thus he wellcautiond that in chalcis power aristocratic both in wealth and strength outweighd the people then a splendid gem of all his spoils the richest he selects and from his chamber over the sounding plank which floors the echoing gallery proceeds behold acanthe not the orient sky forth from its amber gates in summers prime the goddesswidow of tithonus sends more fragrant nor in blushes more to charm a new emotion heaves her gentle breast of swelling snow the athenian distant mute remains to speak her hesitating lips a while though prompted by her heart delay when shaped by chance this elegant request flows from her unpremeditated thoughts so much obliged already courteous guest by thy narration i have cause to blush while i solicit a recital new of one exploit distinguished from the rest when ariabignes fell before thy sword in sight of greece themistocles required no repetition of the flattering suit but in transcendent energy of style impressed the bright achievement on her mind more deep than even by novelty before thus he concluded doubly now i bless the auspicious hour when my successful hand despoiled the bravest chief in asias host of this my humble offering to adorn the fairest head in greece he said the gem presenting graceful which she turned aside rejecting not the giver but the gift and answered thus to heaps of richest gems to all the tribute poured at persias throne thy words alone thy converse i prefer her look perusing earnest he proceeds do thou refuse a token of regard from one thy hospitable hand has blessed beyond the expression of his grateful tongue when at this hour departing he again perhaps may never behold thee  ah depart she in unguarded consternation sighs the athenian here in seeming sadness thus alas thy father i too surely know will never join my arms can i remain till this fair city populous and rich this mansion thy inestimable worth become the prey of demonax  this heaven will never permit she eagerly replies thou will protect me  guardian to distress thou will not hurry to desert a friend whose hospitable kindness thou have praised fill fill with powerful argument the mouth of me thy suppliant for another week my words timoxenus regards the chief by interruption sooths her troubled mind i came to save thee if another week thou will employ i will i will she said do thou but stay my father i will bind to thee whom victory can never forsake they part his chamber he regains not long he meditates acanthe grants her aid spontaneous now to elevate her soul by dignity of thought and generous hope of glory purchased by a noble deed he thus contrives on tablets fair and large for her deportment toward a doting sire his ready style instruction copious draws closed in these words among the guardians heaven to greece has destined an exalted mind enrolls acanthe let her constant feet pursue her leading genius grateful flowers before her steps shall freed euboea strew the brightest laurels shall minerva choose among the groves of athens to entwine the first of women with immortal wreaths the muses all shall triumph in their sex a double rapture aeschylus shall feel who famed in martial action as in song shall celebrate acanthe to her hand this by discreet sicinus is conveyed day after day the fairone as inspired now forcibly persuasive now in tears of importuning tenderness assails a parent fond she penetrates his heart his resolution melts at length his fears to her superior guidance yield the rein meantime instructed by their chief the train of spartans and athenians all dispersed around the hospitable town proclaim to listening ears the welladvisd design against the tyrant demonax not long acanthes purpose is unknown divulged by vigilant sicinus while each mind among the applauding populace is warmed who venerate her name among the chiefs the archons weighty approbation known has banished doubt in council they decide to march with great themistocles light fame mounts on her wings and through euboea sounds the preparations ardent shields and spears swords corselets helms new furbishd banners old produced which gallant ancestry had waved youth now commences ripened age renews the exercise of arms nearchus loud extols themistocles like glorious mars from his first trophies on phlegraean fields among encircling brethren of the sky who from his sword perpetual conquest hoped the salaminian victor is revered in chalcis daily hourly he surveys the martial toil acanthes presence aids his prudence leads her through these active scenes he talks on military themes alone and pictures freedom trampling on the necks of tyrants and barbarians this at length might have abated in a virtuous breast the flame his guilty policy had raised but fate and black conspiracy forbid end of the fifteenth book the athenaid book the sixteenth that month severe unfolding to the sun a frosty portal whence his steeds renew their yearly round was closed overcome at night by toil uncommon lay the athenian chief in early sleep profound which early freed his eyes again in suffocating fumes he wakes upstarting round his limbs he wraps the external garment and sicinus calls who slept not distant he unbars a door which shows the gallery in flames down sinks the crackling floor a main sustaining beam from end to end transverse another stands yet unconsumd lo trembling in his view acanthe inextinguishable flames between them rage a moment he devotes to eye the gulf which menaces with death him and his hopes in him the grecian weal would aristides hesitate thus long to save the meanest i before me see on lifes last verge a creature half divine urged by that thought along the burning beam he rushes swift he catches in his arms the looserobd fairone clinging round his neck returning not like orpheus who regained eurydice and lost with matchless strength he holds his prize above the pointed spires of fiery volumes which on either side assail his passing steps the son of jove not more undaunted through the livid blaze of plutos mansion bore the victim pure of conjugal affection back to life alcestis lo sicinus stops his feet in their mid course thy chamber flames he cries speed over this traverse beam yon open door leads to a passage yet unscorchd he guides the hero follows danger here augments as through a swelling tide he wades through fire which scathd his brows his blazing beard and hair nor spared the garments of his precious charge yet her unhurt through that befriending door his unrelaxd rapidity conveys of pain regardless to the public street he thence descends no populace is here that front vulcanian fury had not reached the other draws the throng confusion there prevails uproar and terror on he speeds through frozen air and falling flakes of snow unwearied still his lovely burden holds acanthe fainting her uncovered breast unless that ringlets of her locks unbound let fall at times their loose and silky threads against his cheek with marble coldness pressed at last the dwelling of nearchus nigh affords a refuge on a friendly bed but not of rest themistocles in pain extends his limbs acanthe female slaves receive and cherish absent is their lord who at the head of military files in haste collected early but in vain had issued forth the palace is consumed timoxenus to shelter he conducts the archon trembling for his daughters fate beholds her safe and feels no other loss now all salute themistocles but first sicinus spoke infernal arts have laid thy palace waste timoxenus i saw sulphurous glutinous materials blaze close to the chamber of my lords repose from lips nigh parched by torture of his pains themistocles began my earthly term if heaven required me now to close enough i have achieved to fill the trump of fame to have preserved thy daughter generous host would crown my glory medon is not far well would that chief my vacant post supply were i removed but friends my hurts are light which common succor of machaons art will soon repair yet publish you my state as dangerous words and looks observe keen spies to oreus send thus cautioned each retired except sicinus who addressed his lord will thou trust rumor in her flight at large to sound thy state as dangerous shall a tale to cozen foes and try thy new allies pass unrefuted to cecropian shores rive thy timotheas bosom grieve thy friends dismay all athens and suspend that aid which she might lend thee in some adverse hour the hero then o monitor expert thou have forestalled me instant will i spare thee to prevent such fears thou can not stem the vexed euripus from geraestus sail to my timothea fly thy looks enquire how to relate my story tell her all i have been faithful to my nuptial vow yet have succeeded let the athenians know my force and destined enterprise forbear of them to crave assistance let them act as humor sways cleander should thou meet in kindest greetings tell him i should prize troezenian succor  to its healing folds i am solicited by sleep  farewell not so acanthes troubles are composed when lenient balm of morpheus steeped the cares of other bosoms in the midnight damps she quits a thorny pillow half arrayed with naked feet she roams a spacious floor whence she contemplates that retreat of rest enclosing all her wishes hapless fair without one hope there stifling sighs she melts in silent tears the sullen groan of winds which shake the roof the beating rain she hears unmoved nor heeds stern winter who benumbs her tender beauties in his harsh embrace o love to vernal sweets to summers air to bowers which temper sultry suns at noon art thou confined to rills in lulling flow to flowers which scent thy arbours of recess to birds who sing of youth and soft desire all is thy empire every season thine thou universal origin of things sole ruler often a tyrant stealing steps full frequent draw acanthe to the door of her preserver while he sleeps and pain excites no groan to wound her listening ear anxiety abates but passion grows then recollecting his intrepid strides through fiery surge devouring as he passed his hair majesty wreathing round his limbs in torment which none else to save her life would face or could endure unguarded thought in murmuring transport issues from her lips to boundless obligation can i show less than unbounded gratitude  base tongue dare thou the name of gratitude profane which is a virtue  oh thou impious flame within my breast not gratitude has blown thee from a spark to so intense a heat depraved acanthe vagabond impure of night from honor and its laws estranged a robbers criminal desire of spoil thou feelst a rage of sacrilege to force the sanctuary of hymen and that fire which law religion men and gods protect quench on his altar by the hand of vice she could no more a parting cloud revealed the moon before the silver light she dropped on her bare knee enfeebled by the cold there fixed and freezing from that awful power of chastity she seemed invoking help when newlywakend by her piercing moan with smarting limbs themistocles had left his pillow keener his internal pang to see an image of despair the work of his fallacious art on his approach at once the worn remains of spirit fled from her cold bosom heaving now no more the twilight glimmers on the rear of night his painful arms uplift her from the floor and to her couch with decency of care commit her lifeless charms to sense restored just as the morns exploring eye unclosd acanthe faint and speechless by a sign forbids his presence cautious he retires now she indulged her agonies of shame and selfreproach with horrid visions teemed her agitated brain blackrobd despair stalked round her curtains in his double grasp a bloody poniard and empoisond bowl to her sad choice upholding but ere long that thirsty parching malady which boils the putrid blood and ravages like fire invades her frame whole days whole nights she saw a tender sire beside her pillow mourn her beauties wasting hourly in his view to gentler forms delirium then would change the moon so lately to her aid invoked she saw descending from her lucid sphere assume her shape of goddess who inspired a soothing thought to seek for health and peace at her propitious oracle not rob so kind a father of his only joy meantime the tidings vague of chalcis burned and great themistocles destroyed had fame proclaimed aloud through each euboean town save where sicinus passing to his port of embarkation spreads a milder tale alarming still eretria scarce confines tisanders faltring age but cleon thence from styra lampon hastes geraestus sends eudemus hyacinthus feels no more his own distress and rapid as the bird of jupiter through heavens aerial way flies to his guardian friend eudora skilled in healing juices condescends to mount herself the sacred axle and her state displays in chalcis worshipping her wheels the archon waits respectful on her steps when she salutes the athenian still recluse from public view though nigh restored he bends the knee before her him with stately grace she raises then addresses glad i see thy convalescence to impart my help became a duty so diana willed by me consulted in her solemn grove mysterious where an impulse warned my soul that none but thou can set euboea free protect the temples and her tyrant quell he kissed her sacred vestment and replied i now perceive how powerful are thy prayers to them so favored by the gods i owe my preservation which o learned and wise forestalls thy skill ah since thy face has deigned to cheer this city by a long abode complete the blessing as to ancient troy was that palladian image sent from heaven be thou to chalcis at thy presence known pale demonax will shrink but first apply thy lenient succor to my friends distress whose daughter pines in sickness and deserves thy full regard most holy and benign to sad acanthes couch the archon leads eudora soon from oreus tidings stern awake the native terrors in his heart in haste he greets themistocles o guest fierce demonax assembles all his force but first will try an embassy expect within three days the tyrants fell demands which not accepted bring the avenging waste of his redoubled fury on our heads is he so poor in counselors began the athenian calm amid disabling storms in this rough season will the insensate brute drag to the field his asiatic host he thinks me dead remember thou my friend themistocles is living nor conceive the rash disturbed and selftormenting breast of such a tyrant whom the furies haunt has fortitude and conduct to withstand themistocles in arms not halfrevivd subjoins the archon thou alas may want the brave auxiliars promised to thy arms to thee alike unfriendly are the storms which lock our harbors not a bark can sail illustrious medon dares not plough the surge from atalante nor on attic shores of our distress can aristides hear true answers firm themistocles though stung nor shall we want him is not cleon here nearchus lampon sharers of success in my preceding conflicts of no price is staid eudemus hyacinthus brave is not eudora present sacred dame who will her face majestical unveil among confederated ranks to bless the eleutherian banner and inspire your populace with all religions flame yon despicable embassy prepare to answer nobly or let me be heard now to this chamber summon all my friends timoxenus convened them swift the chief dispatched them ardent to their native states thence their collected citizens in arms the guardians of chalcidic walls to lead three days elapsed the embassy arrived amid the senate on his chair of state the archon sat the athenians sure support behind is planted fierce in tone and look the orean herald represents his lord ye men of chalcis demonax requires that you acknowledge xerxes that your gates a persian garrison admit be wise refusal draws perdition on your heads timoxenus turns pale his faltring lips make no reply the indignant senate mourn their state dishonored by a timid chief when timely steps themistocles in sight whose name is murmured through the applauding court as at the aspect of a single cloud known by the trembling seaman to contain destructive blasts the sail he swiftly furls with anxious wish for shelter in the lee of some still shore the herald thus relaxed his altered features arrogance abashed foreboded ruin from that mighty arm in vigor braced by unexpected health in act to speak the hero stretched his hand to fear and impotent distress he seemed extending refuge like a poplar tall whose grateful branches cool the green descent to some pellucid fountain where his course the oerwearyd passenger suspends to slake his eager thirst beneath such friendly shade bent to provoke the tyrant and mislead his rashness thus themistocles  his look transpiercd the humbled herald while he spoke begone base greek from chalcis in her name defiance bear to demonax whose head shall on the gate of oreus be affixed thine to some trafficker in slaves be sold to oreus back the astonished herald flies on whose report his impious lord incensed blasphemes the gods the furies he invokes to them a human sacrifice devotes his first chalcidian captives from his host two chosen myriads on the plain he pours brave mindarus by duty to his king compelled to service which his sword abhors ariobarzanes second in command barbarian homicide whose joy is blood the sevn geraestians sworn to deeds of hell with lamachus of foul misshapen frame attend the tyrant spreading to rude storms his banner fell so satan from the north of heaven his region once with moloc grim beelzebub and nisroc led the host of impious angels all the destined prey of tartarus meanwhile the athenian sat serene in chalcis his auxiliar bands successively arrived eretria sent twelve hundred spears carystus doubled those beneath her standard amarynthus ranged eudoras vassals styra cased in steel five hundred warriors tried seven hundred more geraestus chalcis from her loins supplied four thousand youths nearchus was their chief the athenians care had traced the region round a level champaign toward septentrion skies extends its western border is the frith whose shore is bold and pressed by waters deep a line of anchored vessels which oerlook the land the chief disposes here whose crews were menials trained to missile weapons light full opposite and cross the plain he marked a quarry parent of the domes and towers exalting chalcis over euboean towns the subterranean passages by all inscrutable but laboring hinds who cleave earths marble womb he garrisons with bands from that rough breed supported by a force of heavymaild chalcideans left in charge to bold nearchus so the watchful bees within their hive lie dangerous on guard against invasion of their precious stores their industry and state by morn the care of active scouts proclaims the adverse host not far though yet unseen the trumpet sounds to fight eudora mounts her car and wields the arms of dian through the spacious streets where under ensigns of their several states the warriors blaze in steel from band to band she by her prompter wellinstructed towers like newborn pallas from the head of jove her voice exhorts her sentiments inspire her majesty commands them all are fired all but timoxenus with armed files in safe reserve though destined to remain behind the walls he dreads the important day his generous daughter whose distempered mind eudoras converse had begun to calm not so debased her thoughts her countrys cause she felt heroic talents she admired him who possessed them all her heart recalled though with abated passion all his tale of salamis the stratagem derived from conjugal affection from the sight of forms beloved to animate the brave recurrd she summoned to her languid bed the most distinguished matrons them besought to mount the walls and overlook the fight in all its terrors imitate she said the attic dames that chalcis may partake of attic glory they approving went o mortals born to err when most you smart with selfreproach on guilty passions wound attempt one act of virtue then your breasts will like acanthes now enjoy a calm in supplication thus her wonder breaks ye lights who shining on my darkness deign to lift the veil of error from my eyes protecting powers accept acanthes prayer for this her native city for a sire too kind for great themistocles who draws the sword of justice  now with purer lips i sound his name  and o illustrious dame of all athenian excellence the flower blessed in a heros love the precious gift of hymeneal juno could thou know what i have suffered by an envious flame what still i suffer while remorse awakes a thought of thee thy generous soul would melt in pity even forgiveness when i vow to every chaste divinity invoked that i will see themistocles no more this victory accomplished renders back her virtue late a captive which recalls affections pure and sanctity of mind still thoughts and hope restorative of peace but on a different victory intent themistocles within chalcidic walls contains his ready host nor means to throw the portals open nor display the face of battle till the enemies in sight yield full advantage in his choice of time so in his deep concealment of green reeds on ganges margin or the flaggy strand of nigers flood from aethiopia rolled the alligator vigilant maintains his fraudful ambush that unwary steps may bring the prey to his voracious jaws end of the sixteenth book the athenaid book the seventeenth sicinus long by unpropitious winds locked in geraestus to their fickle breath halfadverse still impatient spread the sail six revolutions of the sun he spent to gain phaleron to his lords abode he swiftly passed when chance his wondering eyes on aristides fixed an open space revealed the hero issuing sage commands the omnipotent artificer of worlds from chaos seemed with delegated power to have entrusted that selected man from ashes lo a city new ascends one winters indefatigable toil of citizens whose spirit unsubdud subdues calamity each visage wears a cheerful hue yet solemn through the streets successive numbers from adjacent fields drive odorifrous loads of plants and flowers which please the manes amaranth and rose fresh parsley myrtle and whatever the sun now not remote from aries in his course called from the quick and vegetating womb of nature green or florid from their seats of growth are borne for pious hands to weave in funeral chaplets from the grecian states to honor athens their deputed chiefs cleander foremost throng the public place whence aristides with advancing speed salutes sicinus welcome is thy face good man thou know from athens long estranged now doubly welcome in thy looks i read important news retiring from the crowd swift in discourse but full sicinus ran through all the feries of his lords exploits which drew this question has thy patron ought to ask of aristides silent bowed sicinus smiling then the chief pursued do thou attend the ceremonial pomp of obsequies to morrow when the slain at salamis receive their just reward from us survivors by their glorious fall i have detained thee from timothea long the first entitled to thy grateful news now to that matron whom beyond himself he prized sicinus hastens at her loom he finds her placid over a web whose glow of colors rivalld iris where intent she wove the achievements of her lord her skill had just portrayd sandauce in the arms of artamanes when her childrens doom congealed her breast themistocles in look expresses all that subtlety humane which cozened superstition of her prey his godlike figure dignifies the work two boys two lovely little maids surround the illustrious artist while their eyes pursue their mothers flying fingers in delight attentive but their tutor once in view from absence long regretted light with joy to him they bound sicinus melts in tears of soft affection they around him lift their gratulating voices on his neck cling and contend for kisses from those lips approved in kindness as a fluttering brood with chirping fondness natures sweetest note enclose their feathered parent who attunes her tender pipe and spreads endearing plumes sicinus cries timothea thou do bring auspicious tidings from my hero i expect no less unaided by the state a private man like hercules he went in his own powers confiding and secure sit down thou witness of my husbands worth thyself a proof of his discerning choice in thee good man by me and mine revered discreet and faithful no sicinus spoke thou art that proof most faithful most discreet most excellent of women come she said suppress my praises let me hear of none but his and copious let thy story flow glad through his whole heroic theme the sage by time to attic eloquence inured expatiates large where loftiness of plan sustained by counsel with exhaustless art pursued now brought to valors final proof must end in sure success his lords commands observing strict acanthes precious worth in talents form and manners he describes how she the aid of chalcis had procured her favor how themistocles had won if he pursue to victory his plan timothea said and borrow from her hand the means of glory and the general good tell him that i can imitate with joy andromache who fostered on her breast her hectors offspring by a stolen embrace not such thy lot sole mistress of a form matched by perfection of the mind alone sicinus cheerful answered i attest to this my firm belief the allruling sire let horomazes be his name or jove thou givst me transport  thou have leave to smile my good sicinus she replies  but heaven i too attest that transport i conceive less for my own than fair acanthes sake so amiably endowed so clear in fame her purity resigning she alas had proved the only suffrer woman fallen the more illustrious once the more disgraced never can resume her luster laurels hide a heros wanton lapse the greeks would bless the guile which serves them but to endless shame the generous authress of that service doom thou said my husband from cleanders sword solicits help cleander is my guest with ariphilia ready in this port his squadron lies he ploughd the seas in quest of earliest action for the common cause come they are waiting for the nights repast she rose sicinus followed and renewed in ariphilias and cleanders ear the wondrous narrative but cautious veils acanthes love timotheas looks approved he then concluded thus to battle roused the force of half euboea cased in steel against the tyrant demonax i left but in the chase of that devouring wolf on thee relies themistocles for help undaunted chief of troezen he replies should i withhold it by the immortal gods the titles both of soldier and of friend were mine no longer ariphilia then sweet as a vernal flower in early prime a grace in manner hebe in her form say gentle sage of delphis reverend priest of haliartus and oileus son kind guests of mine no

to brave athenians slain an hour serene to cross the strait euripus i embraced for chalcis there thy consort fresh i found in gathered palms from demonax overthrown that day in battle hear the glorious tale which from themistocles himself i learned he wellinformd the chiefs in either host distinctly told their history their names their birth and deeds on hyacinthus most as most esteemed enlarged that hapless youth was husband to cleora daughter she of demonax was poisoned by her sire survey this tablet which before my sight thy hero took with readiness of skill delineating the fight

irregular and wild beyond its bounds tumultuous thus the foes at first appeared expecting to surprise themselves surprised at unexpected bands through opened portals issuing to the plain are forced disheartened by a toilsome march to range their numbers for immediate fight the wary son of neocles suspends the attack till bursting drifts of southern clouds beat on the faces of his harrassd foes a storm of blinding sleet then rushes down in three deep columns of the orean line the right which mindarus conducting wheels along the seas flat margin sore is galled by unremitted showers from bows and slings on wellrangd vessels lamachus commands the left nearchus from the quarry pours an ambushd force and breaks the hostile flank compact of vetrans culled from every state that wedge of war whose bristly front displayed athenian spears and spartan mingling beams themistocles the leader slow but sure bears down the center at a second breach the line gives way to cleon at a third to swift carystians not a life is spared by wronged incensed eretrians not a life by hyacinthus boiling with revenge for his cleora while her cruel sire exerts a desperate valor to revive hope in an army spiritless by toil by sudden onset broken at the name and sight of thy themistocles abashed the rout is general in the bloody chase five thousand slain the conquerors despoil thy husband prudent in success preserves two thousand heads all persian to redeem eretrian captives from the tyrants bonds he thus defeated not subdued retired to oreus powerful remnants of his host he draws within her

worth shall meliorate her husband i obey content on this wide universe to see myself the second aristides first for still he towers above me did thou say cleander medon were already come that aeschylus was coming all their force i want sicinus listen to my tale last night an ancient personage unknown in length of beard most awful not unlike tisander asked an audience and obtained my private ear themistocles he said if i deliver tidings which import thy present safety and thy future weal i shall exact thy promise in the name of all the gods and goddesses to wave enquiry whence i come or who i am first know that mindarus the persian chief in oreus newly for thessalias coast embarked whose neighboring pagasaean cape looks on euboea he this day returned and reinforcement from mardonius brought ten thousand spears thessalia has supplied three thousand more an army huge defends the orean circuit further be informed that sevn geraestian homicides are sworn to thy destruction by their secret wiles the house of rich timoxenus was fired them in the field hereafter all combined against thy head their sable arms will show the hideous impress on their shields is death farewell thou hero if my parting step thou trace farewell for ever else be sure again to see me in thy greatest need in mystery sicinus not of heaven but human art immersed is some event which mocks my utmost fathom but my course is plain in fruitless search i waste no thought who as my servant smiling fortune use nor yet am hers sicinus when she frowns now mark one passage winds among the hills encircling oreus when the vanquished foe her bulwarks sought for shelter i detached eretrian cleon hyacinthus brave and with carystian bands nicanor staid who unopposd the strong defile secured there shall my banner strengthened by the youth of aegae soon be planted there shall wait till each auxiliar thou have named arrive then pour on demonax the storm of war let troezens squadron and the athenian ride before his port cleander have the charge speed back to chalcis publish these resolves they part not long themistocles delayed to gain the mountains nor three days were passed when brave nearchus haliartus bold the illustrious brothers of oilean race great aeschylus and timon with their bands arrived and joined him at the strong defile which now contained his whole collected force thence he descended on a morning fair first of that month which frequent sees the sun through vernal showers distilled from tepid clouds diffuse prolific beams over moistened earth to dress her lap exuberant and fresh with flowers and verdure terrible the bands succeeding bands expatiate over the fields so when an earthquake rives a mountains side where stagnant water gathered and confined within a deep vacuity of rock for centuries has slept released the floods in roaring cataracts impetuous fall they roll before them shepherds and their flocks herds and their keepers cottage fold and stall promiscuous ruins floating on the stream are borne to plains remote now oreus lifts her stately towers in sight three myriads armed before the walls has demonax arrangd in proud defiance so at first overthrown antaeus huge uprising in his might fresh and redoubled by his parent earth returned to combat with alcmenas seed wide stretched the orean van the wary son of neocles to equal that extent spread his inferior number by a front not depth of line the tyrant he deceived but of athenian veterans he formed a square battalion which the martial bard ranged on the seabeat verge the other wing is medons charge where thirty shields in file compose the locrian column ere the word is given for onset thus his wonted guard themistocles addresses if a troop in sable cuirass and with shields impressed by deaths grim figure at my head should aim let them assail me be it then your care postponing other duty to surround to seize and bear them captives from the fight he marched himself the central phalanx led the floating crimson of his plumage known minervas bird his crest whose terrors shook the bloody field of chalcis soon proclaim themistocles now targets clash with shields barbarian sabres with cecropian swords euboean spears with spears in sudden shock bellona mingles medon first oerthrew thessalias line his temperate mind was stung by indignation timon bathed his lance in their perfidious blood leonteus gored their dissipated ranks a chosen troop to their assistance lamachus advanced him haliartus met his sinewy arm which could have quelled lycaon first of wolves the erymanthian or aetolian boar smote to the ground the miscreants bulk deformed whose band recoiling leave the victor space to drag him captive rout and carnage sweep that shattered wing before the oilean swords not with less vigor aeschylus oerturnd the other mindarus in vain opposed undaunted efforts pallas seemed to fire her own athenians neptune in the shape of aeschylus seemed landed from his conch to war as once on troys sigaean strand or to have armed the warriorpoets grasp with that strong weapon which can rock the earth not in the center suddenly prevailed themistocles the sevn geraestians leagued by hell combining their assassin points against the hero for a while delayed his progress firmly their united blows his shield received so hercules endured the sevnfold stroke of hydra but the zeal of iolaus to assist that god in his tremendous labor was surpassed by each athenian each laconian guard who never left themistocles they watched the favoring moment with a hundred spears they hedged the traitors round forbade escape clasped and conveyed them living from the field still demonax resists while near him towers ariobarzanes moving rock of war in weight and stature of euboeans forced by savage power to battle numbers lower surrendring banners some to cleon some to humble styras wellconducted sword and thine sad youth a while by glory taught to strive with anguish and suspend despair cleoras husband mindarus appears who warns the tyrant timely to retreat ere quite envelopd by the wheeling files of aeschylus and medon lo in front more dangerous still amid selected ranks themistocles the monster gnashd his teeth his impious voice with execrations hoarse assailed the heavenly thrones his buckler firm he grasped receding to the orean wall where under vaulted sheets of missive arms whirled on his fierce pursuers through the gates he rushed to shelter thus a mighty boar of calydonian strength long held at bay the hunters point evading and the fangs of staunchest hounds with undiminishd ire red in his eyes and foaming from his jaws impetuous plunges in accustomed woods the athenian chief who sees the incessant storms of darts and arrows from the ramparts height retreats but swift his numbers now enlarged by yielding thousands of euboean race distributes round the invested town to guard each avenue and station from the sea cleander threatens in his evening tent the general views the captives frowns condemn the sevn geraestians to their former chains the hero smiles on lamachus the prize of haliartus and familiar thus again my tyrian trafficker in slaves i greet thee son of lygdamis what praise to thy distinguished efforts is not due this precious head to my disposal yield he then proceeds to lamachus apart now take thy freedom villain to my use see thou employ it else expect to die your land remember and your sea are mine soon on the head of demonax this arm shall dash yon bulwarks what i speak is fate thou have thy option go sicinus hear this man is free conduct him through the camp now from his friends sequestered on a couch which never care disturbs he slept till dawn when roused by heralds from the town again the leaders he convened before them came arbactus fierce barbarian who began themistocles of athens in the name of mindarus the persian i defy thy arm to combat in the listed field the same defiance to thy boldest chiefs ariobarzanes sends if you prevail the royal host shall quit euboeas isle which shall submit to xerxes if you fall up hyacinthus haliartus start indignant first the young carystian spoke are they so gross in ignorance to hope themistocles will stoop to single fight with twiceoerthrown barbarians who unsafe behind a rampart tremble at his power but if the persian mindarus would try a grecians single valor o permit themistocles thy soldier to assert the grecian fame the friend of medon next the same permission i implore o chief invincible thyself that all this host may witness my fidelity to greece themistocles subjoins barbarian go provide thy champions ours thou see prepared for honor not decision of the doom reserved for demonax whose final lot lies in my breast alone the herald back to oreus speeds the prudent chief pursues my hyacinthus all thy wrongs i feel but if resentment can afford the grace i ask thee lend to policy thy arm take mindarus thy captive from thy proofs of might and firmness haliartus brave my wish is lifted high in hope to see ariobarzanes gasping at thy feet he rises straight embattled on the plain his army shows a formidable gleam to demonax still numerous for defense barbarian warriors and thessalian throng the battlements of oreus through the gates in solemn pace and slow a herald train precede their champions heralds from the camp produce the illustrious haliartus clad in richest arms the gift of carias queen a twig of flendrest laurel twisted round a shepherds crook in portraiture adorned his modest buckler grim his foe advanced in mail bloodcolourd with a targe of gold ariobarzanes hyacinthus next appears in tried habiliments of war which on his dearest patron mars had seen in marathonian fields a plumage black denoting grief he carries on his shield a female image and the form of death who blasts her graces mindarus approached in armor studded bright with orient gems his buckler too a shape of beauty pale stretched on a funeral pyre exhibits sad of pearl her limbs of rubies were the flames ere they engage the persian warrior thus since my encounter whether through disdain or policy i know not is refused by your commander not through fear i know do thou in courtesy disclose thy name thy rank in grecian armies may thou prove in luster such as mindarus would choose to be the opponent of a satraps arm then tremble satrap at my name the name of hyacinthus fierce the youth returns cleoras husband whom thy barbarous love has wronged whom hellborn demonax has damned to everduring torment shakes this lance by vengeance pointed and invetrate hate young man rejoins the persian on thy grief i drop a pitying tear while thou do wrong me clear of wrong to thee no barbarous love was mine unconscious of your nuptial tie till she confessed it to her savage sire my flame was holy not a thought impure to violate a right could taint my breast but that i loved her hyacinthus sure he who her dear perfections knew so well must wave his wonder that her fate oerwhelms my spirit never to revive i feel that my disastrous passion caused her doom blame both our fortunes not my guiltless heart if yet thy anguish can a moment look compassionate on me  but i forgive unjust reproaches from a grief like thine which should which must exceed my own my own exceeding after thine all other woe now hyacinthus melted but observed that during this sad interview the spear of haliartus at his feet had laid ariobarzanes dead heartstung by shame at his inaction with so many chiefs with such an army and the godlike son of neocles spectators he begins the fight but recollects that friends request the persian more effeminate desponds at past defeats and present grief renewed whose weight though lighter he less firmly bore than did the hardy greek his heavier share of woe yet fearless he maintains the strife with native force devoid of gymnic skill in which confiding hyacinthus often inverts his spear and levels bloodless strokes still vigilant to ward the hostile point often over his buckler glancing though impelled by active strength at last a ponderous blow full on the persians front descends a groan is heard throughout the rampart as he falls the groan redoubles as the victor bears that leader captive to the investing camp to his own tent themistocles admits the persians battered but unwounded limbs he praises hyacinthus he consoles the noble foe commends to healing rest and at returning morn salutes him thus if thee unransomd mindarus i send to oreus can thou pity her estate cursed in a monster can thou feel the wound of thy own glory longer to support the worst of men excluded by his crimes from heavens protection and the laws of faith will thou to spare whole rivulets of blood greek and barbarian render to my arms the town and thus procure thyself a name to live for ever by a righteous act delighting gods and mortals thee my ships shall land in safety on thy native shore the king will praise thee for his army saved which shall partake my clemency reject all hope good persian to withstand my arm i am themistocles the satrap starts from languor thus athenian i confess thy greatness thy ascendency have felt but will endure whatever a victors power inflicts on captives rather than pollute my loyal faith to xerxes from my king i took my charge and never will betray the crimes of demonax i know myself have proved their horrors in cleoras fate i loved adored her excellence her thread his impious rage disseverd on her tomb my tears have daily flowed retain me still thy captive never to revisit more her fathers hateful mansion heaven permit by thy vindictive arm but heaven forbid that ever by disloyalty of mine the infernal author of her death may fall the barbarism of loyalty which binds men to a monarch but the monarch leaves free to his lusts his cruelty and rage the enlightened greek despised yet now deplored in one by nature gifted to deserve a better lot from heaven not less aware of democratic jealousy which hurls from fortunes summit heroes to the dust he pressed no further cautious not to wound a gallant mind whose friendship won he meant to use in wants such fortune might create he leaves sicinus near him while his care exhausts the light in traversing the camp to view the works his evening orders hold each band in arms while anxious in his tent he sits deepmusing whether to attempt the town that night by storm or patient wait for some event less bloody casual boon of time and fortune wasteful is delay but precious too his soldiers such brave lives the full completion of his vast design requires thus dubious till the second watch throughout the camp is tolled and clouded heaven drops down her sable veil he sits when lo before him stands his monitor unknown the venerable figure which he saw at aegae staid sicinus is the guide who swift retires but watches faithful nigh themistocles the stranger solemn spoke thee i have trusted thou have trusted me nor either has repented who i am now learn by friendships sacred ties by blood to thy best friend eudora i am bound elephenor am called pontific seer of jupiter in oreus timely warned by her most urgent mandate to repose all confidence in thee and lend my aid nor less admonished by tisander sage i helped thee first with counsel now i bring effectual succor demonax though foiled has still a powerful remnant of his host to man his walls and desperate will defend select two thousand spears avoid delay a secret passage known to holy steps alone over town and tyrant will complete thy bloodless conquest swift the attic chief o father sacred in my ear the sound of good tisanders great eudoras names thy former warnings i have proved sincere to merit gratitude and trust he calls sicinus bids him summon all the chiefs of locris and carystus they appear to hyacinthus and nicanor then themistocles attend with all your bands this reverend guide intelligence transmit as you advance his orders are performed next he exhorts the oilean brethren thus nor passes favored haliartus by you with your locrians follow to support these friends lest ambush and deception lurk beneath a promise of assured success this said himself forth issues to prepare the general host for action even that night if fair occasion summons when he meets troezenes leader is cleander here themistocles began momentous sure the cause which sends thee from thy naval charge to him cleander anchored as i lay a slender skiff when darkness first prevailed approached my galley to an earnest suit for conference i listened and received on board a man of oreus all in limbs deformed in lineaments all rude whose name is lamachus to render up this night a separate fort he proffers which commands the town and harbor if thy faith be pledged him and thessalias garrison to land safe on her neighboring coast thy will to learn i come he waits his proffer i accept rejoins the alert athenian and the doom i had prepared for those degenerate greeks postpone cleander to his station flies serene the athenian in array contains his army cool with expectation mute so in deceitful quiet often the main before the glazing light of dian spreads a mirror smooth the ruler of the winds anon from troubled clouds and oceans god from his tempestuous chariot give the sign for wild commotion then the surging brine assails the loftiest tops of reeling masts foams on the rocks and deluges the beach end of the eighteenth book the athenaid book the nineteenth the morning breaks nicanor sudden greets the general welcome tidings in these words he utters loud the citadel is won the tyrant slaughtered with our sacred guide a rugged winding track in brambles hid half up a crag we climbed there stooping low a narrow cleft we entered mazy still we trod through dusky bowels of a rock while our conductor gathered as he stepped a clue which careful in his hand he coild our spears we traild each soldier held the skirt of his preceding comrade we attained an iron wicket where the ending line was fastened thence a long and steep ascent was hewn in steps suspended on the sides bright rows of tapers cheered our eyes with light we reached the top there lifting over his head a staff against two horizontal valves our leader smote which opened at the sound behind me hyacinthus on the rock sunk sudden down pronouncing in his fall cleora i on hyacinthus called is this cleoras husband cried the priest descend my pamphila my wife descend she came a reverend priestess tender both with me assisting placed my speechless friend within a cleft by me unmarked before which seemed a passage to some devious cell me by the hand elephenor removed precipitate a grating door of brass closed on my parting steps ascend he said make no enquiry but remain assured his absence now is best i mount i rise behind a massy basis which upheld jove grasping thunder and saturnia crowned who at his side outstretchd her sceptered hand the troops succeeding fill the spacious dome last unexpected thence more welcome rose detached from medon with five hundred spears brave haliartus who repaired the want of my disabled colleague now the priest ye chiefs auxiliar to the gods profaned and men oppressed securely you have reached the citadel of oreus the dark hour befriends your high attempt let one possess the only entrance from the town below the other swift the palace must surprise where demonax lies slumbering if his guilt admits of rest and dreams not of your spears with small resistance from a drowsy guard i seized the gate the palace soon was forced by haliartus demonax maintained from door to door fierce combat till he sunk blaspheming every power of heaven and hell on his own couch beneath repeated wounds delvd in his body by the carian sword whose point produced the severed head in view these news sicinus to eudora bear themistocles began before her feet fall grateful kiss for me her hallowed robe my venerable friend tisander hail to her to him this victory we owe salute timoxenus my noble host greet his excelling daughter let them hear of brave nicanor and the carian sword which closing at a blow this dangerous war preserves so many greeks carystian chief accept from me good tidings in return for thine intelligence this hour has brought that vigilant cleander has possessed the naval fort an inlet to the town for this whole army pouring from our ships successive numbers if the persian bands yet meditate resistance not to give their consternation leisure to subside against the walls each standard shall advance he said and gave command the different chiefs head their battalions oreus trembling sees encircling danger heralds in their pomp dread summoners are nigh her foreign guard deprived of wonted leaders at the fall of demonax aghast in thought behold death in the conquered citadel extend his hideous arms to beckon from the fleet cleanders valor and from swarming tents themistocles on his approach the gates are thrown abroad from all the persian bands their javelins shields and banners on the ground pale fear deposits thus the yielding masts of all their canvass mariners divest when aeolus is riding on a storm to overwhelm the vessel which would drive in full apparel to resist his ire the athenian though triumphant in his joy omits no care to aeschylus awhile the charge supreme transferring he ascends the citadel the carian victor there conducts him over the palace shows the corse of demonax his treasury unspoild by chosen locrians guarded pleased the chief embraces haliartus friend he said though late acquired inestimable friend how shall i praise thee but my bosom wrapped in long concealment now to thee alone disclosed shall warrant my professed regard know that whatever thou have heard or seen of my euboean labors are no more than preparation for a wider stage of action gold one necessary means thou have provided but i want a man of hardy limbs and vigorous bold discreet who all the persian quarters would explore on either side thermopylae would trace whatever employs mardonius what the time he takes the field and where his gathered stores of war deposits thessaly provoked long since my just resentment ere the king of asia passed the hellespont i led ten thousand greeks her passes to defend by her deserted and betrayed i marched unprofitably back the carian here had i endowments equal to my will i were that man accept me as i am versed in those borders me whose faithful zeal leonidas experienced and approved so let themistocles my rustic weeds i can resume to range the oetaean crags the fields of locris and thessalias plains thou art that man the athenian quick rejoined then hold thee ready sudden in their birth are my resolves and when mature have wings this said he visits aeschylus below judicious he in stations had disposed the various bands the prisoners were secured throughout the orean streets and dwellings reigned tranquillity and order him the son of neocles bespake tomorrows dawn shall see thee honored as becomes a chief whom aristides named and athens chose to save euboea i defer till night our consultations i not wanted here will reascend the citadel the voice of friendship calls me to a tender care he seeks the fane elephenor he greets applause to him in gratitude unfeigned presenting next his earnest lips enquire of hyacinthus here the reverend man first know his dear cleora is alive i priest of jove and pamphila my wife who to the olympian empress in this seat of blended rites are ministers when told that demonax had doomed his child to death solicited her pardon in the names of both divinities at both he spurned while we contrived this stratagem her nurse by us admonished in due time declared cleora dead the body of a slave a youthful maiden recently expired was for cleora carried to the flames while her we sheltered in a secret cell from human sight from sight of day concealed these powers alike offended at the intent as perpetration of an impious deed have sent thee forth their instrument of wrath divinelyprompted hero will thou shed on hyacinthus and cleoras bliss thy guardian smile this uttered down the steps he guides the athenian to the hidden cell by his cleora hyacinthus sat the youthful husband over the snowy breast which lulled and cherished a reposing babe the blooming father over that precious fruit hung fondly thoughtful ecstasy recalled his dream at junos temple where he saw the visionary bosom of his bride disclose maternal to an infant new that pillow smooth of lillies wan her cheek told her confinement from the cheerful day six moons in deep obscurity she dwelt where as a seanymph underneath a rock or indian genie in the cavernd earth her cell in conchs and coral she had dressed by gracious pamphila supplied to cheat time and despair the loom her patient art had plied her own sad story had begun now to conclude in joy the starting youth beholds his patron rushes on his breast in transport thus redeemer of my peace balm of my grief of happiness my source my health of mind and body is thy gift if in his anguish hyacinthus felt his obligation in the hour of bliss to what excess must gratitude expand his bosom now cleora and my child i owe to thy protection  this is she this is my goddess this my light my joy derived from thy humanity thou god of hyacinthus tutelary god thou from the pit of horror did upraise my limbs for ever to its bottom chained without thy helpful hand without thee death had been my portion never had i lived to see cleora never known this day but will my general overlook my fault thy soldier in his subterranean march toward this retirement threw a casual glance which met cleoras down the shield and spear dropped from my hands disabled life forsook my heart which irrecoverably lost all sense of duty both to thee and greece by me alone deserted bless that chance themistocles replies and leads aside the attentive youth perhaps these gods ordained in compensation of thy long distress in recompense of pure and constant love that to cleora thou unstained with blood blood of her father by another slain should be restored nor taint with horrors new this thy new hymen aeschylus by morn will sit in judgment righteous but severe on each euboean criminal the dead not less than living instantly remove to thy carystian home thy wife and babe whatever can pass in oreus must offend her eye and ear then turning to the fair from warlike toils thy consort i dismiss he who so nobly signalized his sword in single combat and the open field and proved his valor equal to his love all future palms to others may resign whatever comforts time and peace can yield are due to both your sufferings nor an hour shall thou be cloistered in this rueful cell elephenor discreet and reverend man let thy kind clue conduct their secret steps with presents laden tokens of my love cars shall attend them at the caverns mouth thou add thy blessing that their newborn day may never set in sorrow thus the chief relaxed from busy care amid success which not a shade of obstacle oerhangs spoke as he felt remunerating full for all his service hyacinthus brave his knees embracing thus cleora spoke i have not uttrance for my grateful heart if thou dismiss us never more to see thy guardian face our day will set in grief in smiles the athenian dissipates that fear long ere thy husbands magisterial term is finished i have further still to crave from him as archon not as soldier help this to carystus would alone direct my footsteps else amid domestic joys to see thy days illumined precious time themistocles would borrow from his charge thus in the grateful fairone he secured another friend if wanted to support his vast designs which gathering on his mind speed his departure with a kind

reflects on this transcendent fair one who had changed the violence of passion to respect so confidential dressed in sweetest grace so far beyond his merits toward a heart of purest texture late by him misled to error now to purity restored by native honor at the affecting thought he turns those eyes till then of steadfast look on all events and objects turns aside to hide their oozing dews yet soon he spoke none can i name but wise timotheas choice to bear her present haliartus brave who has avowed to aeschylus and me a veneration for thy matchless child but he appointed to a service high like hercules must labor yet to gain the sum of bliss for three successive moons he must continue mine the past events in copious strains the hero now rehearsed concluding thus the army i disband

phoebean branches twisted round their spears behind them lodged on axles rolling slow were vases tripods images and busts spoils of the palace demonax had raised thou see replies timoxenus a form to phoebus dear the venerable form of timon priest and soldier from that car he will descend to kiss thy sacred hand before thy feet a precious tribute lay for thy pure goddess sister of his god but look my sweet acanthe on the man themistocles has chosen to revive my drooping years preceded by a troop of youths whom medon ever kind has culled from all his locrian files to grace his friend preceded by a trophy which displays the silver mail of demonax his shield his helm of gold his variegated arms and spear in length ten cubits which upholds the tyrants head his victor meets our eyes the illustrious son of lygdamis she cast not an impassioned but revering glance on one whose might victorious had dissolved euboean thraldom one of noble frame in feature comely and in look serene whom her sole guide the all controlling son of neocles had destined for her lord her dream recurs the tyrants head she sees the exploit sublime though not by him achievd whom partial fancy on her pillow showed her everwakeful loftiness of mind admires impartial and applauds the hand which dealt the glorious blow her awful brow the priestless softens to a smile and thus is this suitor whom my hero chose for bright acanthe favored by the gods themistocles in every action proves he cannot err acanthe hears and pressed by dutys insurmountable control awed by eudoras majesty austere resolves to meet him with becoming grace but of his virtue make one trial more the delphian priest and haliartus quit their chariots them timoxenus receives to his rich mansion and a sumptuous board eudora there with curious eyes and voice explores and questions often the carian brave his delphian friend observing in these words besought him o distinguished by the gods who have in thee their care of virtue shown since from euboea thou must soon depart lose not the present hour these matchless dames must hear thy wondrous narrative at large for singular thy fortunes with events are interwoven to delight the ear affect the heart and win the applauding tongue that all may honor thy desert supreme like me so much thy debtor straight complies the modest carian listening silence reigns in native windings from his lydian fount as various flowed maeander here along a level champaign daisypainted meads or golden fields of ceres here through woods in green arcades projecting over his banks there shut in rock which irritates the stream here by low hamlets there by stately towns till he attained the rich magnesian seat thence with augmented fame and prouder floods rolled down his plenteous tribute to the main so through the mazes of his fortune winds in artless eloquence the expressive strain of haliartus from his peasant state to scenes heroic humble still in mind compelled to follow truths historic clue he ends in glory which his blushes grace nor less they grace these frank and manly words which to acanthe singly he directs such as i am thou elevated fair who have euboeas liberty restored her grateful offerings to thy feet i bring with them an humble suppliant to thy smile that he may rank thy soldier in thy name his own distinguish and achieving well the task by great themistocles imposed deserve acanthes favor she replies with virtuous art can soldiers never know satiety of fame must her career be still beginning never be complete must every passion yield to thirst of praise should i request thee would thou for my sake thy new attempt relinquish to enjoy thy ample portion of acquired renown in peace at chalcis haliartus then not love of fame which oftner frowns than smiles not victory nor spoil inflate my breast all unaspiring sense of duty pure of obligation which i owe to greece themistocles and medon rules supreme within my soul o first of mortal fair thou of his peace thy servant might deprive but were thou fairer than the paphian queen in each excelling art like pallas skilled her paragon in wisdom thy request should thus be answered from a bleeding heart to my performance of the trust reposed the only bar is fate astonished gazed timoxenus nor knew the timid sire that his acanthes breast then first conceived a spark of passion but a spark divine such as for heroes goddesses have felt as thetis glowed for peleus thus the fair o most deserving of that heros choice to which alone acanthe left her fate weighed in the balance nor deficient found thou more than worthy of a hand like mine go but return triumphantly return lord of acanthe of my truth unchanged accept this pledge she gave he kissed her hand eudoras vestment while the solemn scene her looks approved with fervent lips he touched then clasping glad timoxenus retired to hoist his canvass in the morning gale end of the nineteenth book the athenaid book the twentieth an april zephyr with reviving sweets from gay euboeas myrtleborderd meads perfumes his breath scarce ruffling in his course the pearly robe of morn a ready skiff the carian hero mounts the gale though soft to him is adverse from a rapid keel of oreus lo sicinus lifts a sign of salutation haliartus joins the faithful man and joyfully relates his acquisition of acanthes hand to good sicinus grateful sounds the tale who thus replies to athens i proceed no sooner marched the warriors to their homes than disengaged from public care my lord addressed me thus sicinus spread the sail to athens fly my wife and offspring waft to my embraces that while gentle rest remits the labors of my limbs disarmed i with timothea she with me may share the past success and taste of present joy thee haliartus she esteems thy fame exploits and fortune will augment her bliss but of this friendly gale a moment more i must not lose his vessel sails along the other slowly with laborious strokes of oars contends for passage till broad noon flames on the laurelld poops and colors gay of athens and troezene on whose decks emblazd with spoils and trophies phoebus pours his whole effulgence back to attic strands they steer in view to fifes and trumpets clear from every vessel in a blended sound reply the concave shores now sudden shifts the wind and checks their progress but permits glad haliartus close behind the helm of aeschylus to pass the choral notes of triumph then were hushed the warriorbard who had so well accomplished all his charge like jove in judgment on the plain like mars sat in oblivion of his arms which lay beside him over the heliconian hill in thought he wandered and invoked the muse to sing of civic harmony the muse to aristides and the conquering son of neocles united touched the lyre with melody rejoicing at their names the attic warriors thronged the silent decks the shrouds and yards attention closed their lips their minds were opened musical and learned minervas chosen people had been wont to hear his numbers in the tragic scene sententious weight of poesy combined with musics powerful spell there tamed the rude abashed the vicious and the good refined oh artemisia haliartus sighed while at the strain his progress he delayed how can thou splendid vassalage prefer in barbarous climes the residence of slaves to greece the land of freedom arts and arms the legislators and the heros seat the guardian pure of equity and laws the nurse of orphans helpless and oppressed of all whom phoebus and the muses lift above the rank of mortals greece i owe more than my birth and being to thy love my sentiments i owe adopted child for thee my better parent now i go to hazard all in voluntary zeal even the possession of acanthes charms on atalantes seabeat verge he lands swift he collects his peasant weeds the crook the pipe and scrip thus musing ancient garb thou do remind me of oileus good do summon all my gratitude to prove that he who benefits receives and feels a grateful sense is happy from his side his arm and temples he ungirds the sword the shield releases and unclasps the helm these he commits sophronia to thy care spouse of leonteus mother of the race oilean them in tenderness embraced he leaves with blessings reembarks and prints his bounding feet on locris hermes thus in shepherds weeds his deity concealed by joves appointment on the flowery meads of inachus alighting where he stole on watchful argus and his hundred eyes eluding rescued from her bestial form afflicted io like the mountain roe the son of lygdamis in speed excelled he had he run for atalantas love would have rejected cythereas aid nor of her swiftness to beguile the fair before her steps the golden apples thrown he quits the shore impatient on he flies unquestioned ranked among the locrian hinds all persian subjects now a midnight course to oetas wellknown mountains he prefers through winding valleys sprinkled with his tears in memory of past events he finds the track to mycons hut that goatherd hears the sound of footsteps through the morning dew he sees he flies to meliboeus clings around his neck the seeming shepherd thus kind friend inform me of melissas weal to him the swain in wonder thou will hear that no barbarian dares ascend this hill the attempt with death mardonius would chastise benign masistius who his freedom gained from generous medon to his sister thus the benefit repays he often views thermopylae inspects the obsequious band which guards the cavernd passage to our fane the fane he visits pleased melissa greets the gentle persian who delights to speak of aristides righteous and humane of medons valor on psittalias isle who made masistius captive thus at times the tedious winters melancholy hours she soothed deprived of thee superior swain at times conversed with mycon she has tuned my pipe to music purified my tongue refined its language and my soul enlarged despairing never of the public weal to aristides virtuous guardian power of greece she strikes her celebrating chords so will she mycon to the conquering son of neocles our second guardian power cries haliartus but too long i wait to hail my holy mistress she rejoins the swain has left this mountain forty days since i beheld masistius are elapsed his welcome hand before melissa placed a woman rather deity in form the hoary temple with her beauty seemed illumined regal was her state her spouse the youthful king of macedon was by she in melissas presence cast aside her majesty a suppliant in these words whose strong impression i retain she spoke most gracious learned and prudent of thy rank in greece the highest i in delphi born phoebean timons child a pious suit both in my fathers and apollos name to thee prefer trachiniaes neighboring walls contain the object of my tenderest care sandauce thither from emathian bounds for help conveyed masistius will confirm whatever i utter in sandauces praise her virtues more than equal her estate of princess xerxes sister but her woes almost exceed her virtues nature droops beneath its burden sickness wastes her youth resists all medicine while her feeble frame to dissolution verges o beloved by every muse illumining thy mind with every science holy woman famed among these nations for benignant deeds vouchsafe descending from thy pure abode to grant thy healing aid masistius then this is the princess who her husband saw slain at her feet her infants doomed to death by euphrantides never since that day the wound inflicted on her gentle heart admitted cure the charitable suit prevailed and soon trachiniaes gates received the priestess borne in amaranthas car here haliartus have thou never seen among the persians who frequent this hill a youth in rosy vigor by the name of artamanes known i have returns the goatherd he with amarantha came seemed doubly anxious for melissas help to yon afflicted princess urged the suit in medons name his friend and savior styled who made him captive on psittalias shore but on his cheek the roses thou do paint no longer bloom his visage worn and pale denotes some inward malady or grief now meliboeus to my longing ear thy history unfold we parted last thou may remember on this fatal spot the gentle agis from this point surveyed yon froth of torrents in their stony beds yon shagged rocks and that disastrous pass beneath us whence barbarian numbers huge overwhelmed thermopylae but first accept refreshment under hairy boughs of pines a rustic board he piles with oaten loaves dried fruits and chestnuts bubbling nigh a spring supplies their bevrage here the illustrious son of lygdamis recounts a copious tale to wondering mycon but his birth conceals and consanguinity with carias queen he stops to note the narrow passage thronged with laden mules and camels mycon then these are my constant spectacle his host mardonius now assembles he transports alpenus yonder locrian town receives the gathered produce of thessalias fields nicaeas fort contains an equal store preparatives for war where lies the camp the carian questions on the malian plain which oetas cliffs command the swain replied new tents on clear spercheos daily rise of persians banded from their winter holds thou shall behold them follow both proceed along the green expanse melissa loved where genial spring had formed of tufted shrubs a florid cincture to the lucid pool behind the dome inviolable seat of all the muses thence harmonious nymphs part of melissas ministerial choir left in their function with mellifluent voice to harps in cadence true enchant the soul of haliartus doubly charmed to hear leonidas the theme with numbers sweet his praise inwoven by melissas skill was their diurnal song but sorrow soon invades a breast where gratitude presides the time and place to haliartus rise where he and medon took their last farewell of that devoted hero in a sigh the carian thus o wellrememberd scene once to these eyes delectable thy flowers have lost their odor thy crystalline pool is dull in aspect to my sadning sight you cannot sooth melodious maids the pain of recollection starting at the name your measures sound beneath yon solemn beech regret sits weeping lacedaemons king there of terrestrial music heard the last from aeschylus the last of banquets shared with good oileus daughter mycon here suppress this grief the priestess has forbid all lamentation for that heros fate who died so glorious follow to the cliff they soon attain a high projecting point when haliartus in a second sigh here stood melissa from her sacred lips the queen of caria hence endured reproof hence did the great leonidas explore the advancing persians when his prudent care the trees and marble fragments had amassed which from the mountain overwhelmed below such multitudes of foes but mycon speak what is that cross beside the public way ah meliboeus let thy spirit grieve like mine exclaims in gushing tears the swain lo xerxes coward vengeance thou beholdst leonidas suspended on that cross as often when lightning strikes the human frame the wound though imperceptible destroys each vital power throughout the stiffning limbs which still retain their posture rigid thus is haliartus riveted to earth he seems nor utters sound nor breathes nor moves his ghastly eyeballs now when mycon thrice his name repeated briefly he replies i am benumbed  conduct me to a cell where i may slumber  tend thy herd  expect me at thy home a mossy cave is nigh there mycon leaves him haliartus stays not slumbering but when mycon is remote darts from the shelter traverses a wood descends a crag which bounds the upper straits thence winds his rapid journey to the cross which stands a witness of barbaric rage his ardent zeal to free those honored bones admits no pause the midnight watch is past importunate and hateful birds obscene are gathered round disturbed their grating shrieks they mix and clatter their illomend wings a stationd guard is roused resistless force surrounds the carian seizes leads him bound before the chieftain of a camp advanced he at the sight of haliartus charged with guilt whose punishment is death commands the accusing soldiers to retire and thus alas has sorrow so impaired the hue of artamanes that oblivion masks his face from haliartus thee i know thee meliboeus once benignant swain my comforter in bondage when we ploughd the grecian seas in delphian timons bark was not i present when the genuine seed of lygdamis in thee aronces traced but o illustrious brother of a queen adored in asia what disastrous star thy midnight steps misguided to incur the kings immutable decree of death thy bold attempt was virtuous but his will has made thy virtue criminal thy head at his own peril artamanes still shall guard thy liberty accept myself will be thy guide to safety ah replies the generous son of lygdamis and clasps the meritorious persian i perceive still unimpaird thy virtues but receive thy noble proffer back for my behoof not with its shadow danger shall approach my friend thy prisoner let me rest till morn a liberal garb is all the boon i crave then to mardonius lead me tell my crime no grace solicit who i am conceal in tears replied the satrap then thou die the royal edict cannot be controlled it can returned the carian rest assured my preservation in myself i bear oh that with equal certainty my power might from thy bosom chase that inmate new whatever it be which violates thy peace thy early youth disfigures and consumes its fruit unripe ah tell me is it grief for some dead friend or sickness or the smart of injury or love acanthe waked that tender thought which softened on the tongue of haliartus from the persians breast a sigh deep note of agony which rivd his gentle heart accompanied these words endeared associate in affliction past thou and thou only do unlock the breast of artamanes it is love my friend the object once possessing every charm exterior still each beauty of the soul by malady incurable devoured from day to day is hastening to the tomb oh long deplored sandauce thee my steps shall follow close  my passion is unknown to her peculiar was her state and mine too delicate at first for me to speak for her to hear my hopes malignant time has wasted since my health in her decay but while my heart is bleeding for my love the sluice grows wider and to friendship pours a stream enlarged thy danger  ah permit that i reveal thy origin and rank thy sisters name can shake the kings decree no artamanes by the immortal gods rejoins the carian of my just attempt i if succeeding all the merit knew if taken knew my ransom but the stars half through their circles run suggest repose may griefasswaging heaviness of sleep embalm thy eyelids and like mine thy breast feel no disquiet may thou rise again saluting hope the harbinger of peace stretched on a carpet haliartus slept not so the troubled persian long disused to lenient rest before the dawn he rose among the greek auxiliars he procured apparel fair of greece his carian guest attired he guided over the malian beach to that august pavilion which contained the royal person once mardonius now in all the state of xerxes save the crown thus artamanes see a hapless man who has attempted to remove the corse of spartas king that hapless man must die returns the general xerxes so ordained not i then absent on a charge remote mardonius knew not nor approved when known the indignity that noble corse sustained to him the carian mindarus to death with hecatombs of nobles thou decreest who in euboea will appease my ghost ha who art thou in agitation spoke the satrap guard bid lamachus approach our visitor so recent from that isle he was not far the son of gobryas thus addressed him entering note that stranger well why do thou start themistocles can boast no bolder warrior lamachus exclaimed i was his captive in the orean fight again the carian truth for once he speaks i dragged him bound my captive on that field ariobarzanes felt me further learn by me the savage demonax was slain but to have rescued from inhuman wrong the mortal part of that transcendent man who living shook all asia with dismay had been my proudest boast mardonius then by horomazes i admire and prize thy generous flame brave warrior under charge of artamanes in trachiniaes round awhile remain now lamachus ascend some ready bark revisit yonder isle this greek for mindarus exchange redeem the rest of asias nobles i allot for each a talent in these words salute themistocles to athens i have sent young alexander macedonias prince ambassador of friendship i would call themistocles ally himself may name but persias bounty shall exceed his price this if his attic arrogance rejects tell him mardonius who disdains a war of oars and sails the dubious oceans sport will give him battle on the plains of thebes though artamanes joyfully beholds his friend in safety with a trembling step trachiniaes gates he passes to the roof which holds sandauce entering he perceives melissa she transported at the sight of haliartus thus began o friend dear to my sire to all the oilean house what unexpected ecstacy were mine at thy appearance if  ah persian lord sandauce sweet sandauce yields to fate her dying lips on artamanes call soft gratitude overflows her gentle breast her wish is eager ere she breathe her last to see her friend and guardian ending here she moves before him with unstable feet with other prompters anguish and despair he follows pallid on her mournful couch the princess lies her infants weep around bright amarantha in disordered garb unloosend hair and frantic with distress stands nigh the graces sadden on her front her beauteous eyes a gushing torrent pour like overswelling fountains once serene the lucid mirrors to encircling flowers now troubled by a storm which levels round the growth of shade and scatters on their face uprooted shrubs in bloom her languid lips at length unclosing thus sandauce spoke omniscient god of nature let me lift my voice appealing when before me lay autarctus slaughtered when these babes condemned by cruel rites to sacrifice were led did not the creature of thy tenderest mold feel as a wife a mother and receive a cureless wound thy providence upraisd a kind protector through my lengthened walks of grief till now they terminate in death if to his generous purity of care assiduous kind and pious time has raised within my breast a secret soft return was this an error has my heart abused the sensibility thou gavst alone art thou my judge creator i obey before thy awful presence thou do call sandauces youth unconscious of a crime my debt avowed of gratitude i pay by this confession of my fleeting breath to artamanes o illustrious youth supreme in rank in virtue still more high thy care continue to these orphan babes she ceased and speechless on her pillow sunk the enamored persian instant on the floor dropped like a stony mass which inward throes of earth convulsive from a cliff disjoins dead monument of ruin on the beach immovable it lies melissa calls on haliartus suddenly he bears the hapless youth inanimate and cold to an adjoining chamber there outstretchd restored to sense by kind unwearied zeal in haliartus all the night he roamd through sad deliriums labyrinths till morn when lo melissa comfort thee she said the princess lives the burden from her mind discharged has rendered to the powers of life exertion less confined rekindling hope of restoration so the allruling gods vicissitude to nature have decreed the mind the body languishes today revives to morrow interrupting came mardonius thus what tidings have i heard of artamanes and the princess dead by malady most rare a mutual flame too long concealed but entering i received a milder tale they live thou holy greek employ thy science save a lovely dame though persian born in him preserve my friend mardonius long thy countrys foe to thee will never be hostile to sandauce go say from my lips and artamanes hear the flower of nobles xerxes shall not lose through disappointed passion were my friend less than he is among the satraps least at my enforcement shall the king unite their nuptial hands now rouse thee gallant youth not long thy general from his side can spare thy worth approved
