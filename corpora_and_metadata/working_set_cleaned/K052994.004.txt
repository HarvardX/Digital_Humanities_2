mdcclxiv  the history of religion chap xiii of the state of religion from the revolution      to the death of king george ii    0 william had been invited to england by a coalition of parties united by a common sense of danger but this tie being broken they flew asunder and each resumed its original prejudices their mutual jealousy and rancour revived and was heated by dispute into intemperate zeal and enthusiasm those who at first acted from principles of patriotism were insensibly warmed into partisans and king william soon found himself at the head of a faction as he had been bred a calvinist and always expressed an abhorrence of spiritual persecution the protestant dissenters considered him as their peculiar protector and entered into his interests with the most zealous fervor and assiduity for the same reasons the friends of the church became jealous of his proceedings and employed all their influence first in opposing his elevation to the throne and afterward in thwarting his measures william began his reign with a proclamation for confirming all protestants in the offices which they enjoyed on the first day of december having chose his council they resolved to convert the convention into a parliament that the new settlement might be strengthened by a legal sanction which was now supposed to be wanting as the assembly had not been convoked by the kings writ of summons the experiment of a new election being deemed too hazardous the council determined that the king by virtue of his own authority should change the convention into a parliament by going to the house of peers with the usual state of a sovereign and pronouncing a speech from the throne to both houses which expedient was accordingly practiced  whatever promises william had made and whatever sentiments of respect he entertained for the church of england he seemed now in a great measure alienated from it by the opposition he had met with from its members particularly from those prelates these were william sancroft archbishop of canterbury robert frampton bishop of gloucester francis turner bishop of ely william lloyd bishop of norwich thomas ken bishop of bath and wells thomas white bishop of peterborough john lake bishop of chichester and william thomas bishop of worcester among the temporal peers henry cavedish duke of newcastle henry hyde earl of clarendon edwardhenry lee earl of litchfield john cecil earl of exeter william paston earl of yarmouth with the lords griffin and stawel also refused to swear to william and mary who had by absenting themselves from the parliament and refusing the oaths plainly disowned his title he therefore resolved to mortify the church and gratify his own friends at the same time by removing the obstacles affixed to nonconformity that all protestant dissenters should be rendered capable of enjoying and exercising civil employments he recommended the establishing a new oath in lieu of those of allegiance and supremacy it was proposed to abrogate the old and appoint new oaths by which the sacramental test was declared unnecessary to render any person capable of enjoying any office or employment this was however rejected by a great majority in the house of lords another proposal for the same purpose though in different terms met with the same fate these fruitless efforts in favor of dissenters augmented the prejudice of the churchmen against william who would have willingly compromised the difference by excusing the clergy from the oaths provided the dissenters might be exempted from a sacramental test but this was deemed the chief bulwark of the church and therefore the proposal was rejected the churchparty in the house of lords moved that instead of obliging the clergy to take the oaths the king should be empowered to tender them and in case of their refusal they should incur the penalty because deprivation or the apprehension of it might make them desperate and excite them to form designs against the government after a long and warm debate all the mitigation that could be obtained was a clause to invest the king with a power to indulge any twelve clergymen deprived by virtue of the act with a third part of their benefices during pleasure  the king though baffled in his design against the sacramental test act for toleration resolved to indulge the dissenters with a toleration and a bill for this purpose was after some debate passed into a law under the title of an act for exempting their majestys protestant subjects dissenting from the penalties of certain laws it enacted that none of the penal laws should be construed to extend to those dissenters who should take the oaths to the present government and subscribe the declaration of the thirtieth year in the reign of charles ii provided that they should hold no private assemblies or conventicles with the doors shut and that nothing should be construed to exempt them from the payment of tithes or other parochial duties that in case of being chosen into the offices of constables overseers churchwardens etc and of scrupling to take the oaths annexed to such offices they should be allowed to execute the employment by deputy that the preachers and teachers in congregations of dissenting protestants who shall take the oaths subscribe the declaration together with all the articles of religion except the thirty fourth and the two succeeding articles and part of the twentieth should be exempted from the penalties decreed against nonconformists as well as from serving upon juries or acting in parishoffices yet all justices of the peace were empowered to require such dissenters to subscribe the declarations and take the oaths and in case of refusal to commit them to prison without bail or mainprize the same indulgence was extended to anabaptists and even to quakers on their solemn promise before god to be faithful to the king and queen and the latters assenting by profession and asseveration to those articles which the others ratified upon oath they were likewise required to profess their belief in the trinity and the holy scriptures  a bill of comprehension had been brought into the house of peers by which moderate dissenters might be reconciled to the church and admitted into ecclesiastical benefices this was extremely agreeable to the king who had the scheme of comprehension very much at heart in the progress of the bill several warm debates arose some of which were carried in favor of the dissenters however the bill was rejected by the commons after it had passed the lords with great difficulty all the clamor that was raised against it could not prevent the king from prosecuting the scheme he granted a commission under the great seal to ten bishops and twenty dignitaries of the church authorizing them to meet from time to time in the jerusalemchamber to prepare such alterations of the liturgy and canons and such proposals for the reformation of ecclesiastical courts as might most conduce to the good order edification and uniting of the church and tend to reconcile all religious differences among the protestant subjects of the kingdom however all williams endeavors at this time proved ineffectual  a d      the bishop of elys being accused of having been concerned in a conspiracy with lord preston and others furnished the king with a plausible pretense for filling up the sees vacated by the deprivation of the nonjuring bishops the deprived bishops had been given to understand that an act of parliament might be obtained to excuse them from taking the oaths provided they would perform their episcopal functions but as they declined this expedient the king now resolved to supply their places accordingly he conferred the vacant see of canterbury gloucester ely norwich bath and wells peterborough chichester and worcester on dr john tillotson edward fowler simon patrick john moore richard kidder richard cumberland robert grove and edward stillingfleet several of the inferior clergy had likewise sacrificed their benefices to their scruples of conscience with regard to taking the oaths so contrary to those they had taken to king james and were therefore denominated nonjurors but these were but a small number in proportion to those who complied though they declared that they took the oaths in no other sense than that of a peaceable submission to the powers that were affirming that the legislature had allowed the distinction of a king de facto and a king de jure as they had dropped the word rightful when the form of the oath was under debate  a d      this year died on november    archbishop tillotson greatly regretted by the king and queen and generally lamented by the public as a pattern of elegance ingenuity meekness charity and moderation queen mary did not long survive him she was taken ill of the small pox and died on december    in the thirtythird year of her age and the sixth of her reign she was a zealous protestant scrupulously exact in all the duties of devotion of an even temper and calm mild conversation she was ruffled by no passion and seems to have been a stranger to the emotions of natural affection for she ascended without compunction the throne from which her father had been deposed and treated her sister the princess anne as an alien to her blood  a d school at this period dr thomas bray an active divine formed a plan for propagating the gospel in foreign countries missionaries catechisms liturgies and other books for the instruction of ignorant people were sent to the english colonies in america this laudable design was supported by voluntary contribution and the bill having been brought into the house of commons for the better discovery of estates given to superstitious uses dr bray presented a petition praying that some part of the estates might be set apart for the propagation of the reformed religion in maryland virginia and the leeward islands at this time likewise a society for the reformation of manners was formed under the kings countenance and encouragement considerable collections were made for maintaining clergymen to read prayers at certain hours in places of public worship and administer the sacrament every sunday  a d   00 the parliament having received a petition from the lancashire clergy complaining of the insolence and attempts of popish priests a bill was brought in decreeing a further reward to such persons as should discover and convict popish priests and jesuits and perpetual imprisonment for those convicted on the oath of one or more witnesses it enacted that no person born after the twentyfirst day of march next ensuing being a papist should be capable of inheriting any title of honor or estate within the kingdom of england dominion of wales or town of berwick upon tweed and that no papist should be capable of purchasing any lands tenements or hereditaments either in his own name or in the name of other person in trust for him after some alterations it was sent up to the lords and obtained the royal assent contrary to the expectation of those who prosecuted the measure on the supposition that the king was a favourer of papists however the bill was deficient in necessary clauses to enforce execution so that the law was very little regarded in the sequel  a d   0  a bill was this year brought into the parliament for abjuring the pretended prince of wales the son of james ii who died the sixteenth of september at st germain and swearing to his majesty by the title of rightful and lawful king and his heirs according to the act of settlement warm debates arose upon the question whether the oath should be imposed or voluntary and at length it was carried for imposition by the majority of but one voice  a d   0  king williams health had been for some time very much impaired and a fall from his horse by which his collarbone was fractured probably hastened his end he died on march   in the fiftysecond year of his age after having reigned thirteen years in courage fortitude and equanimity he rivalled the most eminent warriors of antiquity he was religious temperate a stranger to violent passions and might have passed for an excellent prince had he never ascended the throne of great britain after which he was opposed in the most generous attempts for the good of the public and through his whole reign was the sacrifice to the faction and parties amongst the people he had saved from ruin  a d   0  anne princess of denmark daughter of james ii by his first wife ascended the throne upon the decease of william in the thirtyeighth year of her age to the general satisfaction of all parties even the jacobites seemed pleased with her elevation on the supposition that as in all probability she would leave no heirs of her own body the dictates of natural affection would induce her to alter the succession in favor of her own brother she had been taught to cherish warm sentiments of the tories whom she considered as the friends of monarchy her inclination for them plainly appeared in her choice of ministers which were mostly of that party the queen summoned a new parliament which met on october  0 the commons of this parliament had nothing more at heart than a bill against occasional conformity on november   a bill was brought into the house for that purpose in the preamble all persecution for conscience sake was condemned nevertheless it enacted that all those who had taken the sacrament and test for offices of trust or the magistracy of corporations and afterward frequented any meeting of dissenters should be disabled from holding their employments pay a fine of five hundred pounds and five pounds a day for the time in which they continued to act in their employments after having been at any such meeting but after several warm debates the bill miscarried a bill was brought into the lower house granting another years consideration to those who had not taken the oath of abjuration the lords added three clauses importing that those persons who should take the oath within the limited time might return to their benefices and employments unless they should be already legally filled that any person endeavoring to defeat the succession to the crown as now limited by law should be deemed guilty of high treason and that the oath of abjuration should be imposed on the subjects of ireland the commons made some opposition to the first clause but at length the question being put whether they should agree to the amendments it was carried in the affirmative by one voice  the two houses of convocation which were summoned with the parliament bore a strong affinity with that assembly by the different interests which prevailed in the upper and lower the last in imitation of the commons was desirous of branding the preceding reign and it was with great difficulty that they concurred with the prelates in an address of congratulation to her majesty the lower house desired in an application to thomas tenison archbishop of canterbury and his suffragans that the matters in dispute concerning the manner of synodical proceedings and the right of the lower house to hold intermediate assemblies might be taken into consideration and speedily determined the bishops proposed that in the intervals of sessions the lower house might appoint committees to prepare matters and when business should be brought regularly before them that they should have sufficient time to sit and deliberate on the subject this did not satisfy the lower house and the prelates refused to depart from the archbishops right of proroguing the whole convocation with consent of his suffragans the lower house proposed to refer the controversy to the queens decision but the bishops declined this expedient as inconsistent with the episcopal authority and the archbishops presidency the lower house having incurred the imputation of favoring presbytery by this opposition to the bishops entered in their books a declaration acknowledging the order of bishops as superior to presbyters and to be a divine apostolical institution then they desired the bishops in an address to concur in settling the doctrine of the divine apostolical right of episcopacy that it might be a standing rule of the church they likewise presented a petition to the queen complaining that in the convocation called in the year   00 after an interruption of ten years several questions having arisen concerning the rights and liberties of the lower house the bishops had refused a verbal conference and afterward declined a proposal to submit the dispute to her majestys determination they therefore fled to her majesty for protection begging she would call the question into her own royal audience the queen promised to consider the petition and ordered their council to examine the affair how it consisted with law or custom whether their report was unfavourable to the lower house or the queen was willing to encourage the division no other answer was made to their address these contests produced divisions through the whole body of the clergy who ranged themselves in different factions distinguished by the names of high church and low church the first consisted of ecclesiastical tories and the other included those who professed revolutionprinciples and recommended moderation toward the dissenters at present however the tories both in church and state triumphed in the favor of their sovereign  a d   0  the bill against occasional conformity was revived this year in the house of commons in the new draught however the penalties were lowered and the several clauses mitigated after several debates it passed and was sent up to the lords it was opposed by a small majority of the bishops and particularly by burnet bishop of sarum who exclaimed against it as a scheme to set the church and protestants at variance and the question being put for a second reading it was carried in the negative  a d   0  on february   the queen ordered secretary hedges to tell the house of commons first fruits and tenths granted to the poor clergy that she had remitted the arrears of the tenths to the poor clergy that she would grant her whole revenue arising out of the first fruits and tenths as far as it should become free from encumbrance as an augmentation of their maintenance and that the house of commons could find any method by which her intention to the poor clergy might be made more effectual it would be an advantage to the public and acceptable to her majesty the commons immediately brought in a bill enabling her to alienate this branch of the revenue and create a corporation by charter to direct the application of it to the uses proposed they likewise repealed the statute of mortmain so far as to allow all men to bequeathe by will or grant by deed any sum they should think fit to give toward the augmentation of benefices addresses of thanks from all the clergy of england were presented to her majesty for her gracious bounty but very little regard was paid to gilbert burnet bishop of sarum although the queen declared that prelate author of the project dr charles leslie in his last letter to bishop burnet gives the true rise of this project in favor of the poor clergy   a d   0  some debates having passed in the house of lords upon the supposed dangers to which the tories affirmed the church was exposed the question was put whether the church was in danger and carried in the negative by a great majority then the house resolved that the church of england as by law established which was rescued from the extremest danger by king william iii of glorious memory is now by gods blessing under the happy reign of her majesty in a most safe and flourishing condition and that whoever goes about to suggest or insinuate that the church is in danger under her majestys administration is an enemy to the queen church and the kingdom the commons concurred in this determination and joined the lords in an address to the queen communicating this resolution beseeching her to take effectual measures for making it public and also for punishing the authors and spreaders of the seditious and scandalous reports of the churchs being in danger the convocation instead of imitating the union and harmony of the parliament revived the former divisions and the two houses seemed to act with more determined rancour against each other the upper house having drawn up a warm address to the queen for her affectionate care of the church the lower house refused to concur nor would they give any reason for their dissent they prepared another in a different strain which was rejected by the archbishop in consequence of this dissension the address was dropped and a stop put to all further communication of the two houses the dean of peterborough protested against the irregularities of the lower house the queen in a letter to the archbishop signified her resolution to maintain her supremacy and the due subordination of presbyters to bishops she expressed her hope that he and his suffragans should act conformably to her resolution in which case they might be assured of the continuance of her favor and protection she required him to impart this declaration to the bishops and clergy and to prorogue the convocation to such time as should appear most convenient when he communicated this letter to the lower house the members were not a little confounded nevertheless they would not comply with the prorogation but continued to sit in defiance of her majestys pleasure  a d   0  the union between england and scotland which had been so often attempted in vain was this year ratified by the queen and the parliaments of both nations though not without a strong opposition especially on the part of the scotch before the english parliament began to investigate the articles of the union the house of lords at the instance of the archbishop of canterbury brought in a bill for the security of the church of england to be inserted as an essential and fundamental part of that treaty it passed through both houses without opposition and received the royal assent and the union of the two kingdoms commenced on may     0   a d   0  the lower house of convocation still continued to wrangle with their superiors and though they joined the upper house in a congratulatory address to the queen on the success of her arms they resolved to make application to the house of commons against the union the queen being apprised of their design desired the archbishop to prorogue them for three weeks before the expiration whereof the act of union had passed in parliament the lower house delivered a representation to the bishops in which they affirmed no such prorogation had ever been ordered during the sitting of parliament the bishops found in their records several precedents of such prorogations and a great many instances of the convocations having sat sometimes when the parliament was dissolved the queen informed of these proceedings wrote a letter to the archbishop intimating that she looked upon the lower house as guilty of an invasion of her royal supremacy and that if any thing of the same nature should be attempted for the future she would use such means of punishing offenders as the law warranted the prolocutor absenting himself from the convocation the archbishop pronounced sentence of contumacy against him and the lower house in a protestation declared this sentence unlawful and altogether null nevertheless the prolocutor made a full submission with which the archbishop was satisfied and the sentence was repealed three camisars or protestants from the cevennois having made their escape and repaired to london acquired about this time the appellation of french prophets from their enthusiastic gesticulations effusions and convulsions and even formed a sect of their countrymen the french refugees scandalized at their behavior and authorized by henry compton bishop of london as superior of the french congregations resolved to enquire into the commission of these pretended prophets whose names were elias marion john cavallier and durand fage and they were declared impostors and counterfeits notwithstanding this decision which was confirmed by the bishops they continued their assemblies in soho under the countenance of sir richard bulkley and john lacy they reviled the ministers of the established church they denounced judgments against the city of london and the whole british nation and published their predictions composed of unintelligible jargon then they were prosecuted at the expense of the french churches as disturbers of the public peace and false prophets they were sentenced to pay a fine of twenty marks each and stand twice on a scaffold with papers on their breasts denoting their offense a sentence which was executed accordingly at charing cross and the royal exchange   a d   0  on the   th of december mr dolben made a complaint to the house of commons of two sermons preached and published by dr henry sacheverel rector of st saviors in southwark as containing positions contrary to revolutionprinciples to the present government and the protestant succession dolbens complaint was seconded by sir peter king and other members and the sermons being read were voted scandalous and seditious libels sacheverel being brought to the bar of the house owned himself the author of both and the doctor being ordered to withdraw the house resolved he should be impeached of high crimes and misdemeanors and mr dolben was ordered to impeach him at the bar of the house of lords in the name of all the commons of england a committee was appointed to draw up articles and sacheverel was taken into custody being impeached at the bar of the upper house he petitioned that he might be admitted to bail but this indulgence was refused and the commons seemed bent upon prosecuting him with such severity as gave disgust to men of moderate principles mean while the tories were not idle they boldly affirmed that the whigs had formed a design to pull down the church and that this prosecution was intended to try their strength before they would proceed openly to the execution of their project these assertions were supported and even credited by some part of the clergy who did not fail to alarm and inflame their hearers while emissaries were employed to raise a ferment among the populace the articles against sacheveral being exhibited the substance of the articles against the doctor was   that he had suggested and maintained that the necessary means used to bring about the revolution were odious and unjustifiable   that the act of toleration was unreasonable and the allowance of it unwarrantable   that the church of england was in a state of great peril and adversity under her majestys administration   that her majestys administration both in ecclesiastical and civil affairs tended to the destruction of the constitution etc these articles were drawn from a sermon the doctor had preached at the assizes at derby on august    and another he had preached at st pauls before sir samuel garrard lord mayor of london on november   this year  his person was committed to the deputy usher of the black rod and the lords admitted him to bail and appointed february    for his trial in westminster hall  this extraordinary trial engaged the attention of the whole kingdom it lasted three weeks during which all other business was suspended and the queen herself was every day present though in quality of a private spectator a vast number of people attended sacheverel every day to and from westminster hall striving to kiss his hand and praying for his deliverance as if he had been a martyr or confessor the queens sedan was beset by the populace exclaiming god bless your majesty and the church we hope your majesty is for dr sacheverel when the doctors council had finished his defense he himself recited a speech wherein he solemnly justified his intentions toward the queen and her government and spoke in respectful terms of the revolution and the protestant succession he maintained the doctrine of nonresistance in all cases whatsoever as a maxim of the church in which he was educated and by many pathetical expressions endeavored to excite the compassion of the audience he was surrounded by the queens chaplains who encouraged and extolled him as the champion of the church and he was privately favored by the queen herself who could not but relish a doctrine so well calculated for the support of regal authority after obstinate disputes and much virulent altercation sacheverel was found guilty by a majority of seventeen voices but four and thirty peers entered a protest against this decision in the course of the trial thomas earl of wharton observed that if the revolution was not lawful many in the house of peers and many others were guilty of blood murder rapine and injustice and that the queen herself was no lawful sovereign since that the best title she had to the crown was her parliamentary title founded upon the revolution the earl of scarborough said that the revolution was a nice point and above the law and hooper bishop of bath and wells allowed that the revolution was not to be boasted of nor made a precedent and those who examined it too nicely were no friends to it the duke of leeds distinguished between resistance and revolution for had not the last succeeded it would certainly have been rebellion since he knew of no other but hereditary right burnet bishop of sarum who was no friend to sacheverel and remarkable for an accidental absence of mind and unguarded expression affirmed that the doctor in reflecting upon the queens ministers had so well marked a peer there present the earl of s  nd  d by the epithet of volpone in one of his sermons that it was not possible to mistake him some of the young peers could not help laughing at this undesigned sarcasm upon the lord treasurer and exclaimed name him name him but the chancellor interrupted declaring that no peer was obliged to say more than he should think proper  he was prohibited from preaching for the term of three years his two sermons were ordered to be burned by the hands of the common hangman in presence of the lord mayor and the two sheriffs of london and middlesex the lenity of the sentence passed upon sacheverel which was in a great measure owing to the dread of popular resentment his friends considered as a victory obtained over a whig faction and they celebrated their triumph with bonfires and illuminations  the queen now so apparently favored the tories that the whig ministry were entirely removed and their places supplied by the other party there was not one whig left in any office of state except the duke of marlborough and he was greatly on the decline in the queens favor that the triumph of the tories might be more complete her majesty dissolved the whig parliament after such precautions were taken as could not fail to influence the new election in favor of the highchurch party to this end nothing so effectually contributed as did the trial of sacheverel who was used as a tool to wind and turn the passions of the vulgar having been presented to a benefice in north wales he went in procession to that country with all the pomp and magnificence of a sovereign prince he was sumptuously entertained by the university of oxford and diverse noblemen and was received in several towns by the magistrates of the corporation in their formalities and often attended by a body of a thousand horse nothing was heard but the cry of the church and dr sacheverel the clergy were actuated by a spirit of enthusiasm which spread through all ranks and degrees of people and had such an effect upon the elections of the new parliament that few were returned as members but such as had distinguished themselves by their zeal against the whig administration  a d      the house of commons in order to demonstrate their attachment to the church in consequence of an address from the lower house of convocation and a quickening message from the queen passed a bill for building fifty new churches in the suburbs of london and westminster and appropriated for this purpose the duty upon coals which had been granted for the building of st pauls cathedral of the convocation which was assembled with the new parliament the lower house chose dr francis atterbury for their prolocutor he was an enterprising ecclesiastic of extensive learning acute talents violently attached to tory principles and intimately connected with the prime minister robert harley lately created earl of oxford and earl mortimer so that he directed all the proceedings in the lower house of convocation in concert with that minister the queen in a letter to the archbishop signified her hope that the consultations of the clergy might be of use to redress the attempts of loose and profane persons she sent a license under the broad seal empowering them to sit and do business in as ample a manner as ever had been granted since the reformation the bishops were purposely slighted and overlooked because they had lived in harmony with the ministry a committee being appointed to draw up a representation of the present state of the church and religion atterbury undertook the task and composed a remonstrance that contained the most keen and severe strictures upon the administration as it had been exercised since the time of the revolution another was penned by the bishops in more moderate terms and several regulations were made but in none of these did the two houses agree they concurred however in censuring some tenets favoring arianism broached and supported by mr whiston mathematical professor at cambridge he had been expelled the university and wrote a vindication of himself dedicated to the convocation the archbishop doubted whether this assembly could proceed against a man for heresy the judges being consulted the majority of them gave in their opinions that the convocation had a jurisdiction the queen in a letter to the bishops said that as there was no doubt of their jurisdiction she expected they would proceed in the matter before them fresh scruples arising they determined to examine the book without proceeding against the author and this was censured accordingly an extract of the sentence was sent to the queen but she did not signify her pleasure on the subject and the affair remained in suspense whiston published a work in four volumes justifying his doctrine and maintaining that the apostolical constitutions were not only canonical but also preferable in point of authority to the epistles and the gospels the bill against occasional conformity was now revived in parliament by the earl of nottingham in more moderate terms than those that had been formerly rejected and it passed both houses by the connivance of the whigs upon the earls promise that if they would consent to this measure he would bring over many friends to join them in matters of greater importance  a d      in consequence of the treaty of utrecht by which the french king obliged himself to abandon the pretender generally distinguished by the name of the chevalier de st george since   0  and acknowledge the queens title and the protestant succession the chevalier had repaired to lorrain the parliament desired that the queen would press the duke of lorrain and all the princes and states in amity with her to exclude him from their dominions her majesty taking little notice of this address the whigs were alarmed they concluded that the dictates of natural affection had biassed her in favor of the chevalier whatever sentiments of tenderness and compassion she might feel for that unfortunate exile the acknowledged son of her own father it does not appear that she ever thought of altering the succession as by law established the term of sacheverels suspension being now expired extraordinary rejoicings were made upon the occasion he was desired to preach before the house of commons who thanked him for his sermon and the queen promoted him to the rich benefice of st andrews in holborn london  a d      at this period died the princess sophia electress dowager of hanover daughter of frederic king of bohemia and granddaughter of james i of england upon whose heirs the succession to the crown of england by the act of settlement devolved as the nearest branch of the royal family in the protestant line she was in all respects one of the most accomplished princesses of the age in which she lived the court of england went in mourning at her death and the elector of brunswic her son afterward king of england was prayed for by name in the liturgy of the church of england on may    sir william wyndham made a motion for a bill to prevent the growth of schism and for the further security of the church of england as by law established the design of it was to prohibit dissenters from teaching in schools and academies it was accordingly prepared but eagerly opposed in both houses as a species of persecution nevertheless it made its way through both and received the royal assent but the queen dying on the day it was to take place the law was rendered ineffectual  her majestys constitution was now quite broke one fit of sickness succeeded another and what completed the ruin of her health was the anxiety of her mind occasioned by the discontents which had been raised by the enemies of her government and by the dissentions among her ministers at last she was seized with a lethargic disorder and notwithstanding all the medicines which the physicians could prescribe the distemper gained ground so fast that on july  0 they despaired of her life the council immediately assembled and took all the necessary precautions for securing the peace of the kingdom they dispatched a messenger to the elector of brunswic informing him of the measures they had taken and desiring he would with all possible speed repair to holland where he should be attended by a british squadron to convoy him to england in case of her majestys decease the queen continued to dose in a lethargic insensibility with very short intervals till august   in the morning when she expired in the fiftieth year of her age and the thirteenth of her reign the capacity of anne stuart queen of great britain was naturally good but not much cultivated by learning nor did she exhibit any marks of extraordinary genius or personal ambition she was not deficient in that firmness of mind by which a prince ought to preserve his independence and avoid the snares and fetters of sycophants and favorites but whatever might have been her weakness in that particular the virtues of her heart could not be questioned she was a pattern of conjugal fidelity and affection a warm friend an indulgent mistress a munificent patron and a merciful princess during whose reign no subjects blood was shed for treason she was zealously attached to the church of england from conviction rather than from prepossession unaffectedly pious just charitable and compassionate she felt a mothers fondness for her people by whom she was universally beloved with a warmth of affection which even partyprejudice could not abate in fine if she was not the greatest she was certainly one of the best and most unblemished sovereigns that ever sat on the throne of england and well deserved that expressive though simple epithet the good queen anne  a d      king george i ascended the throne of great britain in the fiftyfifth year of his age without the least opposition tumult or sign of popular discontent and many were now convinced that no design had ever been concerted by queen anne and her ministry in favor of the chevalier de st george on september    his majesty arrived in the river and landing at greenwich was received by george fitzroy duke of northumberland captain of the lifeguards soon removed and the lords of the council it was the misfortune of this prince as well as a very great prejudice to the nation that he had imbibed a strong prepossession against the tories who constituted such a considerable part of his subjects they were now excluded from all share of the royal favor which was wholly engrossed by their enemies and these early marks of aversion which he was at no pains to conceal alienated the minds of many from his person and government who would otherwise have served him with fidelity and affection the number of malcontents considerably increased by the kings attachment to the whig faction the clamor of the churchs being in danger was revived jealousies were excited seditious libels dispersed and dangerous tumults raised in different parts of the country birmingham bristol chippenham norwich reading etc were filled with licentious riot the partycry was down with the whigs sacheverel for ever many gentlemen of the whig party were abused magistrates in towns and justices in the country were reviled and insulted by the populace in the execution of their office religion was still mingled in all political disputes the high churchmen complained that impiety and heresy daily gained ground from the connivance or at least the supine negligence of the whig prelates  the lower house of convocation had before the queens death declared that a book published by dr samuel clarke under the title of the scripturedoctrine of the trinity contained assertions contrary to the catholic faith they sent up extracts from this performance to the bishops and the doctor wrote an answer to their objections he was prevailed upon to write an apology which he presented to the upper house but apprehending it might be published separately and misunderstood he afterward delivered an explanation to the bishop of london this was satisfactory to the bishops but the lower house resolved that it was no recantation of his heretical assertions the disputes about the trinity increasing the archbishops and bishops received directions which were published for preserving unity in the church the purity of the christian faith concerning the holy trinity and for maintaining the peace and quiet of the state by these every preacher was restricted from delivering any other doctrine than what is contained in the holy scriptures with respect to the trinity and from intermeddling in any affairs of state or government the like prohibition was extended to those who should write harangue or dispute on the same subjects  a d      the proceedings against the late queens minister and partiality to the whigs increased the spirit of discontent which was so much fomented by the friends of hereditary right both in england and scotland that it broke out into open rebellion the suppression of which proved fatal to some of the first families in both kingdoms  a d      the deliberations of the convocation turned chiefly upon two performances of dr benjamin hoadly bishop of bangor one was entitled a preservative against the principles and practices of the nonjurors the other was a sermon preached before the king at the chapel royal at st jamess on march    under the title of the nature of the kingdom or church of christ an answer to this discourse was published by dr snape master of eaton college and the lower house of convocation took so great offense and were so highly scandalized at some of the doctrines advanced by that prelate in those two pieces that they unanimously appointed a committee of six of their members dr moss dr sherlock dr friend dr sprat dr cannon and dr biss to examine the bishops two performances they drew up a representation in which the preservative and the sermon were censured as tending to subvert all government and discipline in the church of christ to reduce his kingdom to a state of anarchy and confusion to impugn and impeach the royal supremacy in causes ecclesiastical and the authority of the legislature to enforce obedience in matters of religion by civil sanctions this representation was not carried to the upper house for the king or his ministry being informed of the matter took care to prevent the heats and animosities which this dispute if not timely checked might have occasioned and therefore his majesty sent a writ to the archbishop of canterbury to prorogue the convocation as for the consequences it produced afterward among the contending parties who upon a trivial incident in which their own reputations indeed were concerned but the merits of the cause not in the least affected grew so outrageous as by advertisement in the public newspapers signed by their own hands to give one another the lie and thereby not only expose themselves to the derision of the sober part of mankind but even the church of england to the attacks and insults of her enemies i have neither room nor inclination to insert them the bishops chief antagonists were dr snape and dr sherlock whom his majesty removed from the office of his chaplains the convocation has not been permitted to sit and do business ever since that period unless it be to make complimentary addresses to the throne in the beginning of this year the rev mr laurence howel was convicted at the old bailey of writing a pamphlet entitled the state of schism in the church of england truly stated in which he affirmed that the established church was schismatical since the deprivation of the primate and the other bishops at the revolution he received sentence to pay a fine of  00 l to the king to remain in prison for three years to find four sureties of  00l each and to be bound himself in  000l for his good behavior during lise to be twice whipped to be degraded and stripped of his gown by the common executioner   on december    earl stanhope declared in the house of lords the acts to prevent occasional conformity and the growth of schism repealed that in order to unite the hearts of the wellaffected to the present establishment he had a bill to offer under the title of an act for strengthening the protestant interest in these kingdoms it was accordingly read and appeared to be a bill repealing the acts against occasional conformity the growth of schism and some clauses in the corporation and test acts this had been concerted by the ministry in private meetings with the most eminent dissenters the tory lords were astonished at this motion for which they were altogether unprepared nevertheless they strenuously opposed it they alleged that the bill instead of strengthening the church of england would certainly weaken her by plucking off her best feathers investing her enemies with power and sharing with churchmen the civil and military employments of which they were then wholly possessed earl cowper declared himself against that part of the bill by which some clauses of the test acts were repealed because he looked upon those acts as the main bulwark of our excellent constitution in church and state which ought to be inviolably preserved archibald earl of ilay late duke of argyle opposed the bill because in his opinion it infringed the pacta conventa of the treaty of union by which the bounds both of the church of england and that of scotland were fixed and settled and he was apprehensive if the articles of the union were broke with respect to one church it might afterward be a precedent to break them with respect to the other william wake archbishop of canterbury said the acts which were by this bill to be repealed were the main bulwark and supporters of the english church he expressed all imaginable tenderness for wellmeaning conscientious dissenters but he could not forbear observing that some among that sect made a wrong use of the favor and indulgence shown to them at the revolution though they had the least share in that happy event it was therefore thought necessary for the legislature to interpose and put a stop to the scandalous practice of occasional conformity he added that it would be needless to repeal the act against schism since no advantage had been taken of it to the prejudice of dissenters dr hoadly bishop of bangor endeavored to prove that the occasional and schism acts were in effect persecuting laws and that by admitting the principle of self defense and selfpreservation in matters of religion all the persecutions maintained by the heathens against the professors of christianity and even the popish inquisition might be justified with respect to the powers of which many clergymen appeared to be so fond and zealous he owned the desire of power and riches was natural to all men but that he had learned both from reason and from the gospel that this must be kept within due bounds and not entrench upon the rights and liberties of their fellow creatures and countrymen after a long debate the house agreed to leave out some clauses concerning the test and corporation acts then the bill was committed and afterward passed it met with great opposition in the lower house but was carried by the majority  while the bill was depending a clause was proposed whereby all persons who came to qualify themselves for offices were obliged to acknowledge the holy scriptures to be a divine inspiration and their faith in the holy trinity but was rejected as too great a restraint  on november    the rev mr edward bysse rector of portbury and of st george in somersetshire was brought to the court of kings bench westminster to receive the judgment of that court for the several facts of which he had been convicted viz at the assizes at salisbury in wiltshire july    for speaking at abury in that county the following words george has no business here we have had no laws these thirty years never since the time of king james ii nor shall until king james comes he is my master and my rightful king at the assizes at aylesbury in the county of buckingham july    he was convicted for speaking the same words at slough in that county at the assizes at wells in the county of somerset august    he was convicted for speaking the same words in the said city of wells at the same assizes he was convicted for uttering at st georges in the said county these words king george is an usurper king james is my lawful king he was also convicted at the same assizes at wells for preaching in the parish church at portbury in these words however god may in judgment allow usurpation yet god will never prosper or bless the same i need not go to foreign countries for proof of this but confine ourselves to our own island where we have groaned under that plague these thirty years we have had neither king parliament nor laws these thirty years things have never been right these thirty years that is since the misfortune of the father and things will never be right till the restoration of his son my master he was moreover convicted at the same assizes at wells for preaching in the parish church of st george in these words king george is an usurper for the abovementioned preaching at portbury church he was sentenced to stand in the pillory for an hour at charing cross on the first of december with this inscription over his head for seditious and treasonable preaching to be imprisoned four years and to find sureties for his good behavior during life himself in  00 l penalty and two sureties in  00 l each for his beforementioned preaching in st georges church he was adjudged to stand in the pillory at the royal exchange on the second of december for an hour with the same inscription over his head and to pay a fine of  00 l for his four other offenses abovementioned he was fined  00 l each  a d      joseph hall esquire having wrote a blasphemous pamphlet entitled a sober reply to mr higgs merry argument or the tritheistical doctrine of the trinity was tried for the same on march   and being found guilty was on june    sentenced to stand on the pillory at charing cross to pay a fine of  00 l to be imprisoned for three months and to find security for his good behavior for seven years mr hall had   0 l of his fine remitted and his standing in the pillory dispensed with but mr william wilkins who only printed off the said pamphlet was adjudged to pay a fine of  00 l to be imprisoned for three months and to find security for his good behavior for seven years and had no mitigation of his sentence  a d      the quakers presented a petition to the house of commons act in favor of the quakers praying that a bill may be brought in for omitting in their solemn affirmation the words in the presence of almighty god as enjoined in an act passed in the reign of king william for making their solemn affirmation to be equivalent to an oath and made perpetual by a statute in      the house complied with their request but the bill gave rise to a warm debate among the peers dr francis atterbury bishop of rochester said he did not know why such a distinguishing mark of indulgence should be allowed to a set of people who were hardly christians his lordship was seconded by the earl of strafford lord north and gray and the archbishop of york but they were opposed by the earl of sunderland the duke of argyle white kennet bishop of peterborough the earl of ilay and the earl of macclesfield and the question being put for committing the bill it was carried in the affirmative by sixtyfour voices against fourteen on january    their lordships were to go into a grand committee upon the said bill but were prevented by an unexpected petition from some of the london clergy which was presented by sir william dawes archbishop of york and was as follows  to the right honorable the lords spiritual and temporal in parliament assembled  the humble petition of the clergy in and about london with all submission shows  that there is a bill now depending in your lordships house entitled an act for granting the people called quakers such a form of affirmation or declaration as may remove the difficulties which many of them lie under which bill should it pass into a law as it may in its consequences nearly affect the property of the subject in general so it will in a more especial manner endanger the legal maintenance of the clergy by tithes inasmuch as the people called quakers pretend to deny the payment of tithes upon a principle of conscience and therefore as your petitioners apprehend may be under strong inducements to ease their consciences in that respect by violating them in another when their simple affirmation in behalf of friends of the same persuasion shall pass in all courts of judicature for legal evidence  however the injuries that your petitioners in their private affairs may possibly suffer are as they ought to be of small account with them in comparison of the mischiefs which may redound to the society from the indulgence intended as it seems to imply that justice may be duly administered and government supported without the intervention of any solemn appeal to god as a witness of the truth of what is said by all persons in all cases of great importance to the common welfare whereas your petitioners are firmly persuaded that an oath was instituted by god himself as the surest bond of fidelity among men and has been esteemed and found to be so by the wisdom and experience of all ages and all nations  but that which chiefly moves your petitioners to apply to your lordships is their serious concern lest the minds of good men should be grieved and wounded and the enemies of christianity triumph when they shall see such condescensions made by a christian legislature to a set of men who renounce the divine institutions of christ particularly that by which the faithful are initiated into his religion and denominated christians and who cannot on this account according to the uniform judgment and practice of the catholic church be deemed worthy of that sacred name  your petitioners moreover crave leave to represent to your lordships that upon the best information they can get the instances wherein any quaker has refused the solemn affirmation prescribed by an act in the seventh and eighth year of william iii have from the passing that act to this day been exceeding rare so that there might be ground to hope that the continued use of the said solemn affirmation would by degrees have entirely cured that people of all those unreasonable prejudices against an oath which the favor designed them by this bill may tend to strengthen and confirm  and your petitioners humbly leave it to your lordships wise deliberations whether such an extraordinary indulgence granted to a people already as is conceived too numerous may not contribute to multiply their sect and tempt persons to profess themselves quakers in order to be exempted from the obligation of oaths and to stand upon a foot of privilege not allowed to the best christians in the kingdom your petitioners therefore humbly hope that these and other considerations which may offer themselves to your lordships great wisdom may induce your lordships not to give your consent to the passing of this bill into a law the clergymen who signed this petition were robert moss d d preacher at grays inn and dean of ely john harris lecturer of grays inn joseph watson d d rector of st stephen walbrook s gatwick rector of queenhythe hen foster

ever pray etc  the archbishop of york spoke in behalf of this petition and moved that it might be read and he was seconded by several bishops and noblemen however the petition was branded by the ministry as a seditious libel and rejected by the majority on january    the lords went into a committee on the quakers bill and after reading the first clause the archbishop of canterbury moved that the quakers affirmation might not be allowed in courts of judicature but among themselves and the archbishop of york moved for a clause that the quakers affirmation should not go in any suit at law for tithes but after some debate the question being put thereupon was carried in the negative by fifty two voices against twentyone and the question being put in the house whether the bill should pass it was resolved in the affirmative  the next affair that engaged the attention of the public proceedings against dr atterbury bishop of rochester with regard to the established church was the prosecution of dr francis atterbury bishop of rochester this prelate had eminently distinguished himself as an highchurchman and was promoted to his see by queen anne in      after the accession of george i he appeared generally among the protesters against the measures of the administration and drew up the reasons of the protests with his own hand this exposed him to the resentment of the ministers and on august         he was committed to the tower on an accusation of high treason several noblemen and gentlemen being also taken into custody on the same pretense about that time or before the end of the year of those so taken into custody none were prosecuted but christopher layer esquire who was convicted of high treason at the kings bench on nov    and after several respites executed at tyburn on may    following and the rev mr george kelly with mr john plunket who by bills of pains and penalties were subjected to close confinement during his majestys pleasure and if they attempted to escape to pains of death to which their assistants were made liable however mr kelly made his escape in       the confinement of the bishop was considered by the ecclesiastics throughout the whole kingdom as an outrage upon the church of england and the episcopal order and most of the clergy in and about london and westminster offered up public prayers in their several churches and chapels for his health about the end of march this year a bill for inflicting pains and penalties on his lordship was brought into the house of commons when sir william wyndham affirmed that there was no evidence against him but conjectures and hearsays the bishop as a member of the upper house made no defense before the commons but when the bill was carried up to the peers his lordship and counsel were heard and supported by many of the ablest speakers and lawyers in that assembly who pointed out the insufficiency of the evidence however his antagonists not being so solicitous about answering reasons as eager to put the question the bill was carried by a majority of eightythree against fortythree but not without protests and on may    received the royal assent by this act his lordship was deprived of all offices benefices and dignities and rendered incapable of enjoying any for the future he was banished the realm and subjected to the pains of death in case he should return as were all persons who should correspond with him during his exile unless authorized under the privy seal and the royal prerogative so far retrenched that the king could not pardon him without an act of parliament his lordship being put on board the aldborough man of war on june    landed on the   st at calais and died on february         in the  0th year of his age at paris whence his corpse was brought to england and interred in westminster abbey dr henry sacheverel who died on june        and had been assisted by the bishop of rochester at his trial before recited left his lordship a legacy of five hundred pounds   this was the last material transaction relating to the church in the reign of king george i who being suddenly seized with a paralytic disorder on the road to hanover lost the faculty of speech became lethargic and on june         expired at osnaburgh in the   th year of his age and   th of his reign george i was plain and simple in his person and address grave and composed in his deportment though easy familiar and facetious in his hours of relaxation before he ascended the throne of great britain he had the character of a circumspect general a just and merciful prince and a wise politician if afterward he seemed to deviate from these principles we may take it for granted that he was misled by the venal suggestions of a ministry who had engrossed all his favor and whose power and influence were supported by corruption  an attempt of the quakers to get themselves relieved from the payment of tithes churchrates and other ecclesiastical dues an intended general naturalization of foreign protestants a proposed review and alteration of the liturgy adapting the calendar in the book of common prayer to the gregorian or new style the marriageact and the act for naturalizing the jews which however was but of short duration being repealed the next session after it passed were unless the ginact etc be included as affecting the morals of the people the most important transactions relating to the interests and constitution of the church of england during the reign of king george ii who departed this life at st jamess palace on october       0 in the   th year of his reign and the   th of his age  the history of the church of scotland the church government in scotland was episcopal from the time of their conversion to the christian religion which was begun by palladius about the year   0 millers propagation of christianity vol ii p    after the birth of our savior or rather from the first establishment of christian churches in that kingdom in the fifth and sixth centuries and so continued till the reformation took place in the reigns of mary mother of james i and of mary i of england but the presbyterian discipline was not finally established therein until the reign of king william and mary a d      when episcopacy was totally abolished  mr john knox a native of scotland and a bold and courageous divine was the instrument in the hands of providence to bring about the work of reformation in that kingdom for which he was well qualified by his undaunted spirit his learning and his eloquence which were extraordinary for those times he had been a public preacher in king edward vis reign in england was in the next an exile at franckfort and afterward one of the pastors of the english congregation at geneva from thence he came to edinburgh may        being then    years of age he settled at perth but was unwearied in his travels and labors over the whole kingdom neals history of the puritans vol i p      he had the boldness to maintain this position that if kings and princes refused to reform religion inferior magistrates and the people being directed and instructed in the truth by their preachers may lawfully reform within their own bounds themselves and if all or the far greater part be enlightened by the truth they may make a public reformation  upon this principle knox and his brethren petitioned the queen mother who was regent for her daughter queen mary then in france for liberty to assemble publicly or privately for the performance of religious duties and offices in the vulgar tongue and for administering the sacrament of the lords supper in both kinds according to the institution of jesus christ their petition though so reasonable not being admitted an association was formed by a considerable number of the nobility who resolved to risk their lives and fortunes in behalf of the indulgence they had requested they encouraged the curates of the parishes within their respective districts to read the prayers and lessons in english but not to expound the scriptures till liberty was obtained from the queen this being practiced with success at perth and some neighboring places and no disturbance ensuing the association was entered into by greater numbers and even at edinburgh the capital many signed it  having made such a multitude of proselytes they again petitioned the queenregent and represented to her the unreasonableness of the rgour she exercised against the protestants considering their numbers but the regent continued deaf to their remonstrances and rejected every moderate measure to which she was advised  when the parliament met the congregation or chiefs of the association presented a set of articles to the regent relative to liberty of conscience to be laid before the house but she would not admit them to be debated whereupon they drew up the following protestation and desired it might be recorded that since they could not procure a reformation agreeable to the word of god from the government that it might be lawful for them to follow the dictates of their own consciences that none that joined them in the profession of the true faith should be liable to any civil penalties or incur any damages for so doing if any tumults arise on the score of religion they protest the imputation ought not to lie upon them who now humbly entreat for a regular remedy and that in all other things they will be most loyal subjects  the regent having acquainted the court of france with the situation of affairs received orders to suffer no other religion but the roman catholic and a promise to supply her with forces to back her proceedings hereupon she summoned the inhabitants of perth and the reformed ministers to appear before her at stirling and they accordingly attended followed by multitudes of people well armed and determined to defend them if any violence were offered to their persons this sight filled the regent with apprehensions for her safety and she prayed the multitude might retire giving her word that nothing should be decreed against the ministers however as soon as they had yielded to her persuasions and were retired quietly home she condemned them for nonappearance  the falsification of her promise no ooner reached perth than the burghers encouraged by the neighboring nobility and gentry formed an army of  000 men which was put under the command of the earl of glencairn for the defense of their ministers against the regent who marched against them with an army composed of french and scotch in order to drive them out of their country seeing the burghers had made preparations to give her a warm reception she was willing to consent to a treaty by which it was agreed she should be received into the city with all due honor and suffered to reside there some days provided she promised to make no alteration in religion but referred what related thereto to the parliament and the scotch forces on both sides to be dismissed but the wily regent had no sooner entered the city and the reformed had dismissed their troops than she broke the articles set up the mass and left a french garrison in the town with a resolution to make it a place of arms she also declared that promises were not to be kept with heretics whereupon the congregations of fife perth dundee angus merns and montrose raised a body of men and engaged to stand by one another in maintenance of the reformation with their lives and fortunes mr knox inspirited them by his preahing and the common people warm with resentment pulled down altars and images destroyed the popish ornaments in churches and plundered many monasteries the regent marched against them at the head of  000 french and  000 scotch in french pay but not being inclined to hazard a battle she retired to dunbar and the reformers made themselves masters of perth scoon stirling and linlithgow which soon produced a truce and the reformed ministers had liberty to preach in the pulpits at edinburgh for the present but the scene was soon changed and upon receiving the recruits and money from france the regent took possession of leith fortified it and stored it with every thing necessary for its defense the confederates complained of this breach of the truce and besought her to demolish the works but she commanded them not to violate their allegiance and to lay down their arms to enforce her commands she marched suddenly to edinburgh and obliged them to desert that capital and retire to stirling but the french troops following them close at the heels they were dispersed into the mountains the spirit which actuated them was far from being abated in this distress and they even published a proclamation wherein they deprived the regent of her authority and threatened to treat all those as enemies who obeyed her orders these sort of acts though they were tokens of their fortitude yet could not enable them to face the regents forces whereupon they resolved to put themselves under the protection of queen elizabeth that wise princess weighing the nature of the case and perceiving the danger that would arise to her own crown as well as the protestant religion if scotland became entirely attached to popery under the government of a popish queen who was also queen of france and claimed the crown of england entered into an alliance with the confederate reformers to support them in their religious and civil liberties and the treaty was signed at berwick february       0 by this treaty the queen engaged to send forces into scotland to continue there till scotland was restored to its liberties and privileges and the french driven out of the kingdom elizabeth pursuant thereto sent a body of forces consisting of  000 foot and   00 horse which joined an army of the same force raised by the confederates this combined army was sometime afterward reinforced from the northern marches by a large detachment commanded by the duke of norfolk and upon this junction they reduced leith and obliged the regent to shut herself up in the castle of edinburgh where she deceased june  0    0  the french alarmed at this progress would have restored calais provided elizabeth would recall her forces from scotland but this she absolutely refused but the troubles in france laid the french soon after under a necessity of sending for their troops home for which purpose they dispatched plenipotentiaries into scotland to treat with those of elizabeth about the method of withdrawing them and the restoration of the scotch to their parliamentary government  at the beginning of the month of august calderwood says the beginning of july a treaty was concluded by which a general amnesty was granted the english and french troops were to withdraw in two months and a parliament was to be assembled with all convenient speed to settle the affairs of religion and the kingdom though francis and mary refused to ratify this treaty the parliament assembled in august    0 by virtue thereof without any direct authority from the crown for that purpose francis indeed died before they met and left his wife queen mary a young and not very prudent widow being entirely and zealously attached to popery and under the management of her french relations  the barons and gentlemen petitioned the parliament to suppress the doctrines of the church of rome in certain exceptionable points to revive the ancient church discipline and to abolish the popes usurped authority  all this received their approbation and the ministers were desired to draw up a confession of faith this they performed in twentysix articles following therein the sentiments of calvin and the foreign reformers this confession being read was carried in the parliament only three voices dissenting therefrom and the popish prelates offering no arguments in defense of the old religion  by another act they abolished the authority of the pope and reading mass was to be punished for the first offense with loss of goods for the second with banishment and for the third with death this last punishment was certainly not to be defended in these reformers difference of sentiment may arise from want of understanding or from the prejudices of education and no man as a good writer has observed should be destroyed for his sincerity unless his opinions tend to mutiny and treason and sap the foundations of civil society  when the parliament broke up a commission directed to mr knox mr willock mr spotswood and some other divines to draw up a scheme of discipline for the church was executed by them nearly upon the plan of the church at geneva save that they admitted superintendants in the name of bishops and in the ordination of ministers rejected the imposition of hands their reason for the latter omission was that they apprehended miracles formerly accompanied that ceremony which they now imagined had ceased they appointed superintendants to the number of ten or twelve to plant and erect kirks and to appoint ministers where there were none already but say they these men must not live like idle bishops but must preach themselves twice or thrice a week and visit their districts every three or four months to inspect the lives and behavior of the parochial ministers to redress grievances or bring them before an assembly of the kirk these superintendants were to be elected by the ministers and elders of the several provinces and to be deprived by them for misbehaviour the assemblies of the kirk were to be classical provincial and national in which last the supreme kirk jurisdiction was reposed  the reformers warmly expected that when this plan of discipline was laid before the estates it would meet with a parliamentary sanction but instead thereof it was referred to future consideration upon which after the recess of parliament many of the nobles barons and chief men of the nation met together at the instance of mr knox and signed the plan resolving to abide by the new discipline till it should be confirmed or altered by parliament thus in effect without the authority of an act of parliament the hierarchical government was laid aside and the kirk of scotland established though as will be seen it had the sanction of no law till some years after  it may not be improper before we proceed to explain the motives of the first reformers for making so great a difference in the new model of church government from that which had been so long established and to reflect a little upon the proceedings already related  robertsons history of scotland vol i p     knox     as the vices of the clergy had at first excited the indignation of mankind and roused that spirit of enquiry which proved so fatal to the whole popish system as this disgust at the vices of ecclesiastics was soon tranferred to their persons and shifting from them by no violent transition settled at last on the offices they enjoyed the effects of the reformation would naturally have extended not only to the doctrine but to the government of the popish church and the same spirit which abolished the former would have overturned the latter but in germany england and the northern kingdoms its operations were checked by the power and policy of their princes and the ancient episcopal jurisdiction under a few limitations was still continued in those churches the episcopal hierarchy appears to be more conformable to the practice of the church since christianity became the established religion of the roman empire the ecclesiastical government was at that time plainly copied from the civil the first not only borrowed its form but derived its authority from the latter and the dioceses and jurisdiction of patriarchs archbishops and bishops corresponded with the division and constitution of the empire in switzerland and the low countries the nature of the government allowing full scope to the genius of the reformation all preeminence of order in the church was destroyed and an equality established more suitable to the spirit of republican policy the situation of the primitive church suggested the idea and furnished the model of the latter system which has since been called presbyterian the first christians oppressed by continual persecutions and obliged to hold their religious assemblies by stealth and in corners were contented with a form of government extremely simple the influence of religion concurred with the sense of danger in extinguishing among them the spirit of ambition and in preserving a parity of rank the effects of their sufferings and the cause of many of their virtues  calvin see vol ii page         and seq of this work  whose decisions were received among the protestants of that age with incredible submission was the patron and restorer of this scheme of ecclesiastical policy the church of geneva formed under his eye and by his direction was esteemed the most perfect model of this government and knox who during his residence in that city had studied and admired it warmly recommended it to the imitation of his countrymen  among the scotch nobles some hated the persons others coveted the wealth of the dignified clergy and by abolishing that order of men the former indulged their resentment and the latter hoped to gratify their avarice the people inflamed with the most violent aversion to popery and approving every scheme that departed farthest from the practice of the romish church were delighted with a system so admirably suited to their predominant passion while the friends of civil liberty beheld with pleasure the protestant clergy putting downwith their own hands that fabric of ecclesiastical power which their predecessors had reared with so much art and industry and flattered themselves that by lending their aid to strip churchmen of their dignity and wealth they might entirely deliver the nation from their exorbitant and oppressive jurisdiction the new mode of government easily made its way among men thus prepared by their various interests and passions for its reception  but on the first introduction of his system knox did not deem it expedient to depart altogether from the ancient form spotswood      instead of bishops he proposed to establish ten or twelve superintendants in different parts of the kingdom these as the name implies were empowered to inspect the life and doctrine of the other clergy as before observed they presided in the inferior judicatories of the church and performed several other parts of the episcopal functions their jurisdictions however extended to sacred things only they claimed no feat in parliament and pretended no rights to the dignity or revenues of the former bishops  the number of inferior clergy to whom the care of parochial duty could be committed was still extremely small they had embraced the principles of the reformation at different times and from various motives during the public commotions they were scattered merely by chance over the different provinces of the kingdom and in a few places only were formed into regular classes or societies the first general assembly of the church which was held december  0    0 bears all the marks of an infant unformed church or society the members were but few in number and of no considerable rank no uniform or consistent rule seems to have been observed in electing them from a great part of the kingdom no representatives appeared in the name of some counties only one person was present while other single towns deputed several a convention so feeble and irregular could possess no great authority and conscious of their weakness the members put an end to their debates without venturing upon any decision of much importance robertson     keith       knox as already observed with the assistance of his brethren in order to give greater strength and consistency to the presbyterian plan composed the first book of discipline which contains the model or platform of the intended policy they presented it to a convention of the estates in      and whatever regulations were proposed with regard to ecclesiastic discipline and jurisdiction would have easily obtained the sanction of that assembly but a design to recover the patrimony of the church which was therein insinuated met with a very different reception robertson       in vain did the clergy display the advantages which would accrue to the public by a proper application of ecclesiastical revenues in vain did they propose by an impartial distribution of this fund to promote true religion to encourage learning and to support the poor in vain did they even intermingle threatenings of the divine displeasure against the unjust detainers of what was appropriated to a sacred use the nobles treated this as a project altogether visionary and so far attached to their intended reformation they would admit of no pleas to retard it  but to return to the thread of our history mary queen of scots returned to scotland in august      and might have had a safe conduct through england if she had consented to ratify the treaty of aug    0 but rather than comply she chose to rn all risks and to her great mortification found her people in general with very few exceptions converted to protestantism she herself was by the assembly in      confined to have mass only in her private chapel and unaccompanied with that pomp and ostentation which perhaps alone rendered it the favorite service of the votaries of the church of rome the queen bred up in a reverence for that church would certainly have merited a gentler treatment than she received but the reformed did not in her case consider the prejudices of education the general assembly petitioned her to ratify the acts of parliament for abolishing the mass and for obliging all her subjects to frequent the reformed worship she replied that she saw no impiety in the mass and was determined not to quit the religion in which she was bred being satisfied it was founded in the word of god and that her change would also be prejudicial to her temporal interest without any stretch of christian charity these were certainly her sentiments and the return of the general assembly was very coarse and very little to the purpose viz that turcism stood upon as good ground as popery what followed in their replication was more worthy of the venerable assembly when they required her in the name of the eternal god to inform herself better by frequenting sermons and conferring with learned men however the queen was not to be moved and continued with a blind zeal to persist in the errors she had embraced  in      the popes authority in matters ecclesiastical was again abolished in the parliament and assembly at edinburgh and the act of    0 for renouncing the jurisdiction of the court of rome was confirmed and all acts passed in former reigns for the support of popish idolatry were annulled the new confession of faith was ratified and the protestant ministers and those of their communion declared to be the true and only church within the realm the examination and admission of ministers was declared to be only in the power and disposition of the church with a saving clause for lay patrons by another act the future kings at their coronation were to take an oath to maintain the reformed religion as then professed and by a third act none but those who professed the reformed religion as then established were to be capable of being judges or proctors or of practicing in any of the courts of justice excepting the right of offices hereditary or for life  the general assembly declared their approbation of the discipline of the reformed churches of geneva and switzerland and of a parity among ministers in opposition to the superior claim of bishops however as these acts of assembly were not confirmed by parliament episcopal government could not be said to be legally abolished though it was tacitly suspended till the king came of age and all church affairs managed by presbyteries and general assemblies but the general assembly asserted their power of the keys at this period by deposing the bishop of orkney for marrying the queen to the earl of bothwell and by making the countess of argyle do penance for assisting at the marriage  ecclesiastical affairs after this lay dormant for a considerable time while the civil government underwent many extraordinary revolutions though the church was under many uneasy apprehensions from the consequences that might result from them in regard to the peace and happiness of the ecclesiastical body two things chiefly engrossed the attention of the clergy the one was the forming a system of discipline or ecclesiastical polity which with much difficulty was in some measure effected the other was the abolition of the episcopal order this was in the year      and in the year      another general assembly of the presbytery met at glasgow wherein with much warmth the dignities honors emolumnts and the very function of bishops were attacked the nobles viewed their power with jealousy the common people considered their lives as profane and wished their downfall with equal ardour and at length an act was passed declaring the office of bishop as it was then exercised within the realm to have neither foundation nor warrant in the word of god and required under pain of excommunication all who now possessed that office instantly to resign it and to abstain from preaching or administering the sacrament till they should receive permission from the assembly some of the proceedings of the assembly were laid before the court and the decree which followed thereupon but the court did not acquiesce therein and very warm representations ensued both from the episcopalian and presbyterian parties robertson vol ii p      however an attention to civil affairs prevented any thing considerable to be done insomuch that many of the nobles and many others of the people who professed to be actuated by a religious zeal and provoked by the injuries offered to the church determined to protect the protestant religion by force of arms they therefore conjured the king not to disappoint their hopes and wishes nor to refuse the suffering church that aid which she so much needed but so little success attended their measures that the king called a convention of estates on june        who humbled the power of the church and abridged the privileges of the city of edinburgh the city was declared to have forfeited its privileges as a corporation the capital of the kingdom was deprived of magistrates at least not allowed to elect their own magistrates nor their own ministers many new burdens were imposed on them and a great sum of money was exacted by way of peace offering  king james having thus far succeeded in his measures he was now very assiduous in forming and executing other schemes to complete his design and in order if possible to gain the clergy whom he had in vain attempted to subdue popular agents were set to work all over the kingdom promises flattery and threats were employed the usurpations of the brethren near the capital were aggravated the jealousy of their power which was growing in the distant provinces was augmented and two different general assembles were held in both which notwithstanding the zeal and boldness wherewith a few leading clergymen defended the privileges of the church a majority declared in favor of those measures which were agreeable to the king many practices which had continued since the reformation were condemned many points of discipline which had hitherto been reckoned sacred and uncontroverted were given up the license with which ministers discoursed of political things was restrained the freedom with which they inveighed against particular persons censured the convoking a general assembly without the kings permission prohibited and the right of nominating ministers in the principal towns vested in the crown thus the clergy themselves surrendered privileges which it would have been dangerous to invade by force and subjected themselves and successors to an intolerable yoke which lessened the popular topic of the encroachments of the king and turned the general outcry of the people on the corruptions of their own order spotswood     called         robertson page  0   0    the king however found it no easy matter to carry his point though he was so intent upon newmodelling the church as to neglect other objects of government toward the end of the year      a parliament was held in order to confer certain privileges and honors upon the bishops and an act was passed by which those ministers on whom the king should confer the vacant bishoprics should be entitled to vote in parliament and that the clergy might conceive no jealousy of any encroachments on their privileges it was remitted to the general assembly to determine what spiritual jurisdiction or authority in the government of the church these persons should possess but though the clergy perceived it would be an accession of honor to be admitted into the supreme council of the nation their abhorrence of episcopacy was extreme and to this they sacrificed every consideration of interest or ambition all the kings professions of regard for the present constitution of the church did not convince them of his sincerity their own experience had taught them with what insinuating progress the hierarchy advances and though admitted at first with moderate authority and under specious pretenses how rapidly it extends its dominion varnish over this scheme said one of the clergymen with what colors you please deck the intruder with the utmost art under all this disguise i see the horns of his mitre the same sentiments prevailed among many of his brethren and induced them to reject power and honors with as much zeal as ever those of their order courted them many however were allured by hopes of preferment the king himself and his ministers employed the same arts which they had tried so successfully last year and after long debates and much opposition the general assembly declared that it was lawful for ministers to accept of a seat in parliament that it would be highly beneficial to the church to have its representatives in that supreme court and that fiftyone persons a number nearly equal to that of the ecclesiastics who were anciently called to parliament should be chosen from among the clergy for that purpose but the manner of their election together with the power with which they should be invested were left undecided for the present and furnished matter for future deliberation spotswood   0 robertson  0    the questions with regard to the election and power of the representatives of the church were finally determined in the year   00 by the general assembly which met at montrose and it was there agreed that the general assembly should recommend six persons to every vacant benefice which gave a title to a seat in parliament out of whom the king should nominate one that the person so elected should neither propose nor consent to any thing there that may affect the interest of the church without special instructions for that purpose that he shall submit to its censure without appeal that he shall discharge the duty of a pastor in a particular congregation that he shall not usurp any ecclesiastical jurisdiction superior to that of his other brethren that he should annually resign his commission to the general assembly which may be restored to him or not as the assembly with the kings approbation shall judge most expedient for the good of the church spotswood     robertson       in the year      james who ascended the english throne on the twentythird of march   0  and soon after went to reside in england to advance the episcopal cause made a progress into scotland and his chapel at edinburgh was adorned with statues and pictures two acts were passed one relative to the choice of archbishops and bishops and the second for the restitution of chapters and the ministers protesting against them many of them were suspended and some banished  in      in a convention held at perth the court and bishops with some difficulty made a shift to carry five articles importing that the holy sacrament should be received kneeling that ministers should be enabled to administer the sacrament in private houses to the sick that they should baptize children privately at home if requested so to do that they should confirm such children as can say their catechism and repeat the lords prayer creed and ten commandments and that the festivals of christmas easter whitsuntide and ascension of our savior should for the future be commemorated in the kirk of scotland these articles were ordered to be published at the marketcrosses and to be read by the ministers in the pulpits but the greatest number of them refused as there was no penalty incurred by the omission save the kings displeasure notwithstanding the opposition of the ministers the court got these articles ratified by the parliament in      contrary to the sense of the kirk and nation this raised so much ill blood that a new persecution was carried on throughout the kingdom numbers of the presbyterian ministers were fined imprisoned and banished by the high commission and this they suffered though from their interest with the people they could have turned their oppressors out of the kingdom  things remained much in the same state till the reign of king charles the first that unhappy monarch pressed on by laud made a progress into scotland in the year      with a view to advance the episcopacy for notwithstanding bishops had existed in scotland for some years they had little more than the name being subject to an assembly that was purely presbyterian to advance their jurisdiction he had renewed the high commission and forbid all general assemblies of the kirk he was crowned at edinburgh june    and on the  0th the parliament met and very complaisantly gave him a large sum of money but in the matter of the acts concerning his royal prerogative and the apparel of kirkmen and for the ratification of former acts touching religion he behaved to his parliament with such arbitrary overbearing haughtiness and carried them through with such barefaced craft that he disgusted all ranks and orders of people which together with the contempt he poured upon the scots clergy and the high hand with which he attempted to introduce the ceremonies of the church of england alienated the affections of the generality of his scotch subjects nor did lauds behavior there do him the least credit or redound at all to his masters interest the mouths of the scots clergy were opened and they inveighed bitterly against the hierarchy of england to widen the breach in      a book of canons for scotland was drawn up by the new bishops of that kingdom and revised by laud juxon and wren which was confirmed by the king under his great seal may    though subversive of the whole constitution of scotland in kirk and state the scots presbytery declared peremptorily against it  in the year      a new liturgy in substance the same with the english was sent into scotland accompanied with a royal proclamation dated dec         commanding all the kings loving subjects of that kingdom to receive it with reverence as the only form his majesty thinks fit to be used in that kirk without so much as laying it before a synod convocation general assembly or parliament of that nation so precipitant and imprudent was this headstrong illadvised prince in all the measures he pursued relative to that kingdom the genius of whose inhabitants he seemed totally unacquainted with the reading it in the pulpits was opposed by the people in a most violent and tumultuous manner and notwithstanding the representation of the consequences likely to ensue from the lords of the privy council to the court they were peremptorily ordered to go on with their work the opposers published their reasons two petitions were presented against it to the lord chancellor and council one from all the men women children and servants of edinburgh another in the names of the noblemen barons gentry ministers and burgesses which were transmitted to the king who instead of returning a soft answer issued a proclamation against the late tumults forbidding all assemblies or convocations of people to frame or sign petitions upon pain of high treason and ordering the term or session to be moved from linlithgow to stirling twentyfour miles from edinburgh with a strict injunction that no stranger should resort thither without special license upon the publication of this proclamation sundry noblemen ministers and others signed a protest four tables as they were called were erected at edinburgh one of the nobility another of the gentry a third of the buroughs and a fourth of the ministers these prepared matters for the general table formed of commissioners from the other sour where the last and binding resolutions were taken one of the first things transacted by these tables was the renewing their confession of faith and solemn league and covenant which had been subscribed by king james march      0  and by the whole scots nation in the year    0 to this covenant was now added a narrative of sundry acts of parliament by which the religion of the reformed had been ratified since that time with an admonition wherein the late innovations were renounced and a band of defense for adhering to each other in the present cause this solemn league and covenant in support of their religious and civil liberties and in opposition to popery tyranny and oppression was sworn to and subscribed with great seriousness and devotion first at edinburgh in feb       and afterward in all places of the kingdom where it was received by the common people as a sacred oracle and subscribed by all who had any zeal for the protestant religion and their country  hereupon the king sent the marquis of hamilton as his high commissioner into scotland one part of his commission being to induce them to give up the covenant upon which he was to consent to the calling a general assembly or parliament but the covenanters declared they would sooner renounce their baptism than their covenant finding them full of this resolution and nothing to be done but by force of arms he returned to england but was soon sent back again and instructed if necessity required to revoke the liturgy canons the high commission and the five articles of perth he might call a general assembly and parliament within a competent time but was to endeavor to exclude the laity from the assembly  on nov         the marquis published a proclamation for a general assembly to meet at glasgow the covenanters carried their elections every where a silenced minister mr henderson was chosen moderator and though the bishops presented a declinator declaring the assembly to be unlawful etc etc and the marquis finding them not of a proper temper for the court dissolved them after having presided seven days forbidding them to continue their sessions upon pain of high treason the assembly continued sitting and next day published a justification of their proceedings they sat for some weeks till they had passed several acts viz an act for disannulling six late assemblies viz those of   0     0          with the reasons an act for abjuring and abolishing episcopacy an act for condemning the five articles of perth an act for condemning the service book book of canons book of ordination and the high commission an act for condemning archdeacons chapters and preaching deacons an act for restoring presbyteries provincial and national assemblies to their constitution of ministers and elders and to their power and jurisdiction contained in the book of policy with many others of like nature they afterward pronounced sentence of deposition against the bishops eight of whom were excommunicated four excluded from the ministerial function and two only allowed to officiate as pastors or presbyters at the close of the session the assembly drew up a letter to the king complaining of the marquis of hamilton who had proclaimed them traitors and forbid the people to pay any regard to their acts and praying him still to look upon them as good and faithful subjects they published also an address to the good people of england in their own vindication which the king suppressed and issued a proclamation against the covenanters  thus matters between the king and his scottish subjects were brought to such a crisis as could not but end in a war charles fitted out a fleet of sixteen ships and raised an army of   000 horse and foot on the other hand the covenanters secured the castles of edinburgh dumbritton and frith raised an army and sent for their old general lesley from germany who brought with him many experienced officers on the the   th of march      the king marched northwards and was met upon the borders by the scots army but after facing each other for some time the king perceiving his english protestant nobility and soldiers not hearty in the cause came to a pacification with the covenanters june    by which all points of difference were referred to a general assembly to be held at edinburgh august    ensuing and to a parliament which was to meet a fortnight after both armies in the interim were to be disbanded the tables broke up and no meetings held but such as were warranted by act of parliament the king accordingly dismissed his army scarcely affording thanks to them for their affection and loyalty the scots delivered up the kings castles and forts and disbanded their troops but cautiously kept their officers in pay  the general assembly met according to the treaty at edinburgh but being constituted as the last the king having given up the point of the lay elders the bishops who presented another declinator were excused attendance by the king the assembly then without any opposition confirmed the proceedings of that of glasgow appointed the covenant to be taken throughout the kingdom voted away the new servicebook etc etc and nemine contradicente determined that diocesan episcopacy was unlawful and not to be allowed in their kirk  the parliament met aug    and confirmed all the acts of the general assembly but having mentioned episcopacy as unlawful the king forbid the earl of traquair his commissioner to consent to the word lest it should be interpreted absolutely whereupon he first prorogued the parliament for fourteen days and then by the kings express command for nine months without ratifying any of their acts  the pacification between the king and the scots was not of long duration for pushed on by laud and strafford he resolved to humble his northern subjects who had dared to dispute his prerogative the scots dreading the impending storm were many of them for seeking succor from france and accordingly wrote a letter to the king of france which however was not sent the majority of the scots nation cast their eye toward the english parliament which was called together to aid in their destruction and met april       0 and upon application to their friends at london were assured by a letter written by lord saville that the hearts of the people of england were with them that they were convinced the liberties of both nations were at stake and therefore they might depend upon their assistance as soon as a fair opportunity offered upon this assurance the scots resolved to raise another army and to march into england mean time charles not meeting with a behavior he expected dissolved the parliament and to carry on the war against the scots set every engine of arbitrary power at work such as loans benevolences ship money etc etc by which he got an army together composed of papists and pressed men who had no affection for the service however with this army the king met the scots upon the borders but soon found that the english nobility were not for conquering them after a small skirmish the scots army passed the tweed aug    and on the  0th took possession of newcastle whilst the king retreated before them as far as york leaving them masters of northumberland cumberland and durham from which counties they subsisted their army and levied what contributions they pleased when they entered newcastle they sent an express to assure the city of london that they would not interrupt the trade between it and that town but would cultivate all manner of friendship and brotherly correspondence they also dispatched messengers to the king petitioning his majesty to confirm their late acts of parliament restore their ships and merchandise recall his proclamation which styles them rebels and call an english parliament to settle the peace between both kingdoms this petition was backed by others from several of the english nobility and the city of london the king finding he must come to terms appointed commissioners to treat with the scots at rippon who agreed to a cessation of arms for three months from oct    the scots to have   0l per diem for the maintenance of the army and the treaty to be adjourned to london where a free parliament was to be immediately called this famous long parliament was opened nov   in which the late commissioners exhibited articles against archbishop laud and by cooperating with them in their opposition to the kings measures and ministers contributed greatly to their future success against monarchy and episcopacy  in the year      when king charles was greatly distressed by the vigorous proceedings of the parliament of england against the bishops and other grievances knowing they were greatly encouraged therein by their confederacy with the scots whose army in the north was entirely in their interest it was resolved in council if possible to disunite that nation from the parliament and bring them over to the king by granting them all their desires and for that purpose he resolved upon a progress into scotland aug  0 the king set out post and arrived there in three or four days but the english parliament aware of his design appointed one lord and two commoners to follow his majesty in order to keep up a good correspondence with the parliament of that nation aug    he opened the parliament there with a very conciliating speech and agreeable thereto he allowed of their late opposition to the liturgy and their erecting tables he confirmed the acts of the assembly at glasgow he followed their manner of worship conferred titles upon many of their gentry and when he left the kingdom all parties seemed contented but from all accounts the king soon repented of his compliances and as to the scots they still thought themselves obliged to cultivate a good understanding with the english parliament  the scots now easy at home and in full possession of their religious and civil rights yet did not look with indifference upon affairs in england and dreaded the ruin of the english parliament as well through gratitude for the favors they had received from them as for their future safety and therefore the scots commissioners at london offered their mediation between the king and the two houses telling his majesty in their petition that the liberties of england and scotland must stand and fall together and beseeching him to have recourse to the faithful advices of both houses of parliament which will not only quiet the minds of his english subjects but remove the jealousies and fears that may possess the hearts of his subjects in his other kingdoms in their address to the english parliament they acknowledge their obligations to them and beseech the two houses to consider of the fairest and most likely methods to compose the differences in church and state bishop burnet says their design was to get episcopacy brought down and presbytery set up to the first of which most of the members were willing to consent but few were cordial for the latter  the king was much displeased with the scots mediation and commanded them not to transact between him and his parliament without first communicating their propositions to him in private and in scotland he used methods to keep that kingdom neutral on the other hand the parliament threw themselves into the arms of the scots they thanked the commissioners for their kind and seasonable interposing and prayed them to continue their endeavors to remove the present distractions and to preserve the union between the two kingdoms they writ to scotland also to the same purpose in may      they again renewed their offers of a mediation which the king rejected as before but the parliament accepted of it and seemed to come heartily into their scheme of church government so that a perfect union took place between the two kingdoms the king alarmed hereat sent a warm remonstrance to the council of scotland august    wherein he very justly observes that the parliament no more believed the divine institution of presbytery than the others did of diocesan prelacy for though they were content in order to secure the assistance of the scots nation to vote away the hierarchy of archbishops and bishops yet when they had conquered the king and had nothing to fear from their neighbors they could not be prevailed with to establish the scots presbytery without a reserve of the power of the keys to themselves  it is foreign to my purpose to enter too deeply into the civil and military history of this unfortunate reign further than to elucidate the history of the kirk of scotland and therefore i shall next take notice that in the year      the general assembly of scotland agreed to assist the english for the recovery of their civil and religious liberties and appointed delegates to the assembly of divines at westminster on sept    the english house of commons and the assembly of divines to secure the assistance of the scots took the solemn league and covenant after many debates in relation to the renunciation of episcopacy and some other points by subscribing their names thereto the house of commons in one parchmentroll and the assembly in another in st margarets church westminster on the sunday following it was tendered to all persons within the bills of mortality after being read in the several churches october    it was likewise taken by the house of lords in scotland it was enforced all over the kingdom under the severest penalties february      it was ordered to be taken throughout the kingdom of england by all persons above the age of eighteen years an exhortation from the westminster assembly of divines being drawn up and published for that purpose the greatest number were zealous for the covenant on a religious account and others in obedience to the parliament being convinced of the distressed circumstances of their affairs and that the assistance of the scots was to be obtained upon no other terms the imposing it as a test however was far from being justifiable for several evident reasons the king published a declaration against it in england and sent one to the same purpose into scotland which had no other effect than to produce the reasons for their conduct and advice to his majesty to take the covenant himself  january          the scots army entered england under the command of general leven the two houses sent a committee to meet them which being joined by another of that nation was called the committee of both kingdoms and this committee directed the armys motions soon after it was joined by an english army under lord fairfax the earl of manchester and cromwell and the combined ay laid siege to york which brought on the battle of marstonmoor wherein the royal army under prince rupert was defeated with great loss afterward the combined army reduced all the northern garrisons which concluded the war in those parts  the kings affairs becoming desperate on the   th of april      he escaped from oxford and threw himself into the hands of the scots army then lying before newark little or nothing occurred relative to the kirk during the nine months the king continued with the scots but altercations between them and the english parliament and assembly relative to the establishment of presbytery and toleration of separatists in england which the presbyterians now as much inveighed against as ever the papists or church of england had done in queen elizabeths days we are persuaded says the parliament of scotland that the piety and wisdom of the honorable houses will never admit toleration of any sects or schisms contrary to our solemn league and covenant  the king determining not to abolish episcopacy and withstanding the solicitations and prayers of his friends nay even the advice of his queen all attempts at an accommodation with his parliament proved abortive therefore as the clergy of scotland would not suffer him to come into that kingdom unless he took the solemn league and covenant and did all they desired and their parliament resolved the kingdom should be secured without him and that they should leave the king in england to his two houses of parliament upon their agreeing to pay the scots army their arrears and  00000l one moiety thereof on the delivering up the king into the hands of the english parliaments commissioners he was delivered up and conducted to holmby house in northamptonshire  the further transactions of this reign have very little relation to the affairs of the kirk of scotland who were entirely averse to the secret treaty with the king in pursuance of which duke hamilton marched into england with an army and was defeated at preston by cromwell after which he marched triumphantly to edinburgh august         they indeed by their commissioners declared and protested against putting the king to death as absolutely inconsistent with their solemn league and covenant  in june    0 the commonwealth of england having departed from the solemn league and covenant the scots who at the kings death proclaimed the prince of wales entered into a treaty with the exiled king at breda subjecting him thereby to the following very mortifying conditions that all persons excommunicated by the kirk should be forbid the court that the king by his solemn oath and under his hand and seal declare his allowance of the covenant that he confirm those acts of parliament which enjoin the covenant that he establish the presbyterian worship and discipline and swear never to oppose or endeavor to alter them that all civil matters be determined by parliament and all ecclesiastical affairs by the kirk that his majesty ratify all that has been done in the parliament of scotland in some late sessions and sign the covenant upon his arrival in that kingdom if the kirk desired it he arrived june    but was obliged to sign both the covenants before he set his feet on shore the covenanters raised an army of   000 foot and  000 horse for his service whereupon the english parliament sent general cromwell against them who entered scotland at the latter end of july with an army of   000 foot and  000 horse after various marches and countermarches and some altercations between the english assembly and cromwell he was obliged not being able to bring the scots to action to retire to dunbar for want of provisions with a weak and sickly army and an enemy hovering over them   000 strong but however he totally routed this great host in the battle of dunbar fought september    killing  000 in the battle and pursuit and taking  0000 prisoners with great quantities of arms ammunition etc etc and with the loss to the english of scarce  00 men kimbers life of oliver cromwell  th edit p      cromwell immediately after the battle took possession of edinburgh and leith and sent to the ministers who had fled to the castle to resume their functions in the churches but this they refused to do whereupon cromwell appointed english ministers to officiate in their places  the scots committees of the kirk and estates having fled to stirling and being joined by those who had escaped from dunbar endeavored to assemble another body of forces but they were so divided amongst themselves that little was done to the purpose the ruling party was for the king and kirk the resolutioners were so called from their adhering to the resolution of the kirk and states that those who had been too backward ought to be admitted to make profession of their repentance and afterward in the present extremity might be admitted to defend and serve their country the protesters protested against this resolution the remonstrators in the western counties formed an association apart as well against the king and the defection in the kirk party as against the army of sectaries whilst these debated and wrangled cromwell reduced darlington house roslan castle and obtained a victory over the remonstrators at hamilton soon after he reduced the maiden castle of edinburgh  january      0  the covenanters crowned the king at scoone who set up his standard at aberdeen whilst the english reduced hume and tantallon castles the king having got together an army of  0000 men encamped at torwood near stirling and afterward at kelsyth from which situations all cromwells generalship could not draw him to an engagement hereupon he reduced calendar house in sight of their army and afterward a detachment of his army crossing to fife defeated a strong body of scots with great slaughter this overthrow threw the scots army into much consternation which decamped and marched into stirling park whilst detachments from the english army made themselves masters of bruntisland and st johnstown by which it hindered any supply of men and provisions being sent from the highlands to the kings army the king thus distressed a resolution was taken to make an irruption into england and on the last of july      he began his march from stirling for that purpose and on the  th of august entered this kingdom by the way of carlisle which caused great consternation to the powers at westminster the indefatigable cromwell was soon however at his heels and finally defeated him at worcester on september   with the loss of almost all the scots army killed or taken prisoners  major general monk whom cromwell had left to command in scotland soon finished the reduction of that kingdom after which for eight years it enjoyed a state of calm under the usurpation a strong english army was kept there under good pay and good discipline a sort of union of the three kingdoms took place in one parliament to which the scots sent their representatives and those eight years were reckoned a time of peace and prosperity to scotland as bishop burnet observes as to the power of the kirk it was reduced into a narrow compass neals history of the puritans vol iv p     for though they had the liberty to excommunicate offenders or debar them the communion they might not seize their estates or deprive them of their civil rights and privileges no oaths or covenants were to be imposed but by direction from westminster and as all fitting encouragement was to be given to the ministers of the established kirk so others not satisfied with their form of church government had liberty to serve god after their own manner and those who would live peaceably and yield obedience to the commonwealth were protected in their several persuasions this occasioned a great commotion among the clergy who complained of the loss of their covenant and churchdiscipline and exclaimed against the toleration as opening a door to all kinds of error and heresy the parliament of england sending independent commissioners to visit the scots universities and to settle liberty of conscience the assembly at edinburgh published a testimony against the present encroachments of the civil power upon the ecclesiastical jurisdiction when the general assembly met again at edinburgh and were just entering upon business colonel cotterel told them that no ecclesiastical judicatories were to sit there but by authority of the parliament of england and without giving them leave to reply he commanded them to retire conducted them out of the westgate of the city with a troop of horse and a company of foot and having taken away the commissions from the several classes injoined them not to assemble any more above three in a company  in      oliver cromwell protector the kingdom of scotland was by his ordinance incorporated with england into onecommonwealth and provision made that in every parliament thirty members should be called from thence to serve for scotland  upon the restoration of charles ii a parliament being chosen according to the mind of the court all went against the covenanters episcopacy was restored and deacons priests and bishops ordained and consecrated according to the rites of the church of england all this was performed by the sole virtue of the kings prerogative for it was not till the next year that a parliament decided the matter in breach of the solemn league and covenant which he had indeed been forced to take several of the scots ministers preached boldly against these measures for which mr james guthrie minister of stirling was convicted of sedition and treason and executed june         dying with all the holy confidence of a christian and the fortitude of a martyr a young officer who suffered with him in the same cause made use of these expressions i bear witness with my blood to the persecuted government of this church by synods and presbyteries i bear witness to the solemn league and covenant and seal it with my blood i likewise testify against all popery prelacy idolatry superstition and the service book which is no better than a relick of popish idolatry soon afterward the rights of patronages were restored and all the presbyterian ministers silenced though the court had not a supply of men of any sort to fill the vacancies occasioned thereby the silenced clergy had been most exemplary in their lives and conversations constant preachers and expounders indefatigable in the discharge of their functions and almost adored by the people though they kept up a very severe discipline in the church but their successors the bishops and clergy were of a quite different stamp most of them very mean divines vicious in their morals idle and negligent of their cures so that they became obnoxious to the whole nation and could hardly even with the assistance of the civil power support their authority the people generally of the presbyterian persuasion stood firm by one another forsook the churches and many of them were thrown into prison and ill used some were fined and the younger sort whipped about the streets so that great numbers transported themselves to ulster in ireland where they were well received and where their posterity flourish to this day  in      sir james turner being sent into the west to levy fines at discretion the people rose in arms and took him and all his soldiers prisoners but were soon dispersed by the kings forces forty of them killed and   0 taken prisoners many of whom were hanged before their own doors their minister was put to the torture and died with great firmness crying out farewell sun moon and stars farewell kindred and friends world and time and this weak and frail body and welcome eternity welcome angels and saints welcome savior of the world and god the judge of all conventicles abounded in all parts the presbyterian ministers preached in their own houses to the people who stood without doors to hear them and when dispersed by the magistrates they went out into the fields to hear the word carrying arms with them for their defense a severe act was published against house and field conventicles but the people still met together in defiance of the law and many who were called cameronians from cameron their preacher were outlawed and therefore left their habitations and traveled about the country at length collecting themselves into a body they were routed by the duke of monmouth at bothwellbridge  00 of them killed and   00 taken prisoners two of their ministers were hanged and  00 banished to the plantations who were all lost at sea in short a persecution spread through the island during the greatest part of this reign almost as cruelly and oppressively carried on as the romish inquisition  the parliament that met at edinburgh upon the accession of james ii in      very compliantly declared their abhorrence of all principles derogatory of the kings absolute power and offered their lives and fortunes to support it against all opposers they declared it high treason to give or take the national covenant or even to write in defense of it and passed an act whereby it was made death to resort to any field or house conventicles they likewise obliged the subjects of scotland to take an oath when so required to do to maintain the kings absolute power on pain of banishment popery began now to lift up its head in that kingdom and several persons of distinction changed to that religion and accommodated themselves to the times for the sake of private interest the populace on the other hand were very tumultuous they broke into the earl of perths private chapel for mass and defaced and destroyed all they could lay their hands on for which one of them was taken and hanged when the king dispensed with the penal laws and tests the scots parliament agreed to a suspension of them for the kings life but james insisting upon an entire repeal which they had firmness to oppose he dissolved them with tokens of resentment the episcopal clergy who were obsequious slaves to the court were sunk into such miserable sloth and ignorance as to render their hearers particularly the common people quite indifferent to the affairs of religion but the presbyterians on the other hand seemed to have gained new strength from persecution and though by the kings dispensing power freed in      from the severities under which they had for so many years suffered it did not cool their zeal against popery their aversion to that corrupt church was more and more apparent their opposition at length roused the whole nation from the lethargy into which it was apparently sunk their behavior at this critical time when it was natural to suppose after they had fared so ill that they would with joy and without reserve have fallen in with the measures of the king which gave them present relief from their burdens will ever redound to the honor of the church of scotland and evince that the principles of religion firmly fixed and rooted in the heart are essentially different from mere professions which generally change with the times and give no stability or firmness to those who embrace them the scots perceived that the kings view in taking off the penal laws and tests was only to serve the papists and therefore when pressed by him to concur in that measure they very wisely answered in cold and general terms  at length the persecuted the suffering church of scotland was redeemed from its perils by the revolution which had restored liberty and religion in its sister kingdom on the   th of april      a convention like that in england for settling the government was called in scotland which passed judgment of forfeiture on king james and voted king william and queen mary king and queen of scotland one article of the claim of rights they drew up was that the reformation in scotland having been begun by a parity among the clergy prelacy in the church was a great and insupportable grievance to the kingdom as the bishops and episcopalians left the convention because not summoned by the abdicated king and continued to adhere to him the presbyterians carried all before them the malcontents sent for king james to come into scotland and the earl of dundee got together a considerable army of highlanders but was routed by general mackay at killicrankey and the earl himself slain thus with king james episcopacy was banished from scotland and the kirkdiscipline and worship restored without a toleration however to dissenters from that church  by the act of union for uniting the two kingdoms into one anno   0  the filth year of queen anne by the name of great britain it was enacted that the presbyterian church government is to remain established in scotland but by the  0th of anne cap   that it shall be lawful for those of the episcopal communion in scotland to assemble for divine worship to be performed by pastors ordained by protestant bishops without disturbance except in parishchurches such pastors of the episcopal persuasion to exhibit their orders at the quarter sessions of the peace and the same to be registered paying one shilling one hundred pounds penalty to be levied on any disturber of their congregations their pastors to baptize and marry provided the christenings be registered and banns three times published in the episcopal congregation no pain or forfeiture to be incurred by any person on any excommunication by the churchjudicatories in scotland ministers are to pray for the royal family by cap    patrons of churches etc are restored to their right of presentation by act   geo i cap    provision was made for rendering more effectual the laws appointing the oaths for the security of the government to be taken by ministers and preachers in churches and meeting houses in scotland and by act   geo i cap    papists and nonjurors are obliged to register their estates these are the principal provisions made since the union relative to religious affairs in scotland where under the mild and auspicious sway of the illustrious house of hanover the church has long enjoyed that repose it in vain sought and struggled for under many of their predecessors and all persecution for conscience sake is laid aside with religious and civil liberty learning arts and sciences flourish politeness and civility every where reign and her clergy and universities have abounded with elegant and fine writers in every branch of literature who have done credit to humanity and spread the reputation of their country to the remotest parts of the world  it must be observed that some internal differences and divisions have happened in the church of scotland from the established judicatories of which a secession has taken place the history of which and the schisms in that secession i shall now give before i enter upon my account of the doctrine and discipline of that church excellently drawn up by a reverend divine of haddington who has therein preserved a christian temper and a laudable moderation  the secession from the established judicatories of the church of scotland took place in consequence of a continued course of offenses to the strict party therein these like their ancestors zealously adhered to the westminster confession of faith catechism and form of presbyterian church government they maintaining the binding obligation of the scots covenant and of the solemn league and covenant of the three nations they allowed the civil magistrate a sovereignty over all church members in all civil causes but refused that he had any spiritual headship over her doctrine worship discipline or government hence they conceived no small disgust at their clergy for so tamely yielding to the dissolution or prorogation of their general assembly by king william and queen anne they were exceedingly grieved with the scots parliament for consenting that the perpetual establishment of prelacy in england should be an essential condition of the union between the two kingdoms and afterward with the british for restoring the power of patrons in the settlement of ministers the former accounted a most sinful burying of the solemn league whereby the scots not only swore against prelacy themselves but also to endeavor the reformation of england from it the latter they detested as annexing the spiritual privileges of the church to civil rights as if christs kingdom were of this world as tending to place the management of the church in the hands of christs enemies as opening a door for simoniacal pactions between the patron and presentee and for filling the church with an indolent naughty and erroneous ministry but as the presbyterian clergy remonstrated against this procedure of the parliament together with their act for toleration of all sorts of opinions except popery and blasphemy the people could not take offense at them on these accounts it was otherwise in the affair of the act imposing the abjuration oath upon the clergy the strict presbyterians whether ministers or people heartily detested popery and the pretender for its sake but observing that this oath was extended to presbyterian ministers by jacobitish influence that it was originally calculated for the maintenance of the english church as well as state that it referred to two english acts of parliament requiring the sovereign to be of the episcopal communion that it implied an approbation of the union settlement and consequently of the abovementioned sinful term thereof that some of its expressions were ambiguous and hard to be understood that though it was suspected few ministers would have taken it but for fear of the penalty yet they were obliged therein to swear they took it heartily and willingly for these and the like reasons many truly loyal sensible and godly ministers declined taking it and not a few as loyal people declined hearing those who took it especially where they had access to hear such as did not scarce was this woeful reding of the church commenced when mr john simson professor of divinty at glasgow being by mr james webster minister at edinburgh processed for error before the general assembly did in his defense and other papers maintain that heathens have an implicit discovery of redemption through christ that if they or others do with natural seriousness use the means of happiness god has given them they shall certainly obtain saving grace and lasting felicity that all infants are formed as holy and free of sin as adam was and dying in nonage shall probably be saved that no proper covenant of works was made with adam as the representative of his posterity that our own happiness ought to be our chief end and motive in glorifying god that there is no immediate divine precourse with the actions of rational creatures and that there will be no sinning in hell after the last judgment  after tedious altercations at that and some former meetings the assembly of      found these notions no more than opinions not necessary to be taught in divinity opinions not evidently founded upon scripture and some of them tending to attribute too much to natural reason and the power of corrupt nature and prohibited him and all others to use such expressions or teach such positions for the future but the very same day they declared the following position viz it is unsound to teach that we must forsake our sin in order to come to christ and instating us in covenant with god most unsound and detestable and thus indirectly declared that we ought and are able to forsake and save ourselves from the reign and practice of our sin before we come to jesus the alone savior from it to stop the current of this and other legal doctrines a new edition of that truly valuable english book entitled the marrow of modern divinity was published with a recommendatory preface by mr james hog one of the holiest ministers in the kingdom this book after it had passed for about eighty years with considerable reputation and esteem among most of the truly serious persons who read it was attacked with great warmth by the general assembly of    0 and though it is shrewdly suspected the greater part of the members had never perused it an act was made charging all ministers in connection with them to warn their people against reading it  in their attack upon this book the assembly plainly condemned the offering of christ as a savior to sinners as such and the asserting that believers are wholly delivered from the law as a covenant of works they maintained that holiness is a federal or conditional means of obtaining eternal happiness and that slavish fear of endless misery and legal hope of future felicity ought to influence the saints in their study of gospel holiness these almost entirely scriptural expressions that believers are not under the law do not commit sin that the lord can see no sin in them nor be angry with them for sin they declared antinomian paradoxes and condemned the distinguishing between the law as a covenant of works and as a binding rule of obedience in the hand of a mediator in order to explain them mess thomas boston ebenezer and ralph erskines with nine others remonstrated against this conduct these twelve representers had their own share of trouble from the judicatories the commission posed them with twelve questions relative to the affair in dispute in the answers to which they set several gospel truths in a very clear light the assembly of      took the matter into further consideration and made an act explaining and confirming the acts of    0 this the representers protested against as still injurious to the truths of the gospel though it must be owned it was not near so gross as those of the assembly of    0 to avoid even the most distant approaches toward favoring the condemned sentiments or expressions of the marrow many of the scots clergy seemed now to become more legal in their doctrine than ever which tempted multitudes of serious christians to crowd to hear the representers who notwithstanding distinguished holiness in practice and a zealous warmth in recommending it to their hearers were exceedingly reproached as antinomian encouragers of a licentious life  it is probable these twelve ministers harrassment and reproach had been more lasting had not a rumor spread in the end of      that mr john simson abovementioned had not only continued to teach his former errors contrary to the prohibition of the assembly but had taught that jesus christ is not necessarily existent that the persons of the godhead are not the very same in substance that necessary existence supreme deity and being the only true god may be taken for the personal property of the father and so not belonging to the son and holy ghost the teaching of his former errors was fully proved but nothing was done to him upon that account his teaching the above arian tenets was also sufficiently manifested but he giving in declarations of his sentiments on these heads in orthodox language and after much tergiversation professing sorrow for some of the offensive expressions proved against him the assembly of      suspended him from the exercise of all ecclesiastic power and function till another general assembly should think fit to take off this sentence the assembly of      further declared that it was not fit to entrust him any more with training up of young men for the holy ministry multitudes were offended he was so slightly censured during this process pastors began to be violently obtruded upon reclaiming congregations and the assembly of    0 enacted that no protests nor dissents should be recorded in their minutes against which and other corruptions about forty ministers and fourteen hundred elders and private christians gave in a warm remonstrance and craved the assembly would assert the truth in direct opposition to mr simsons errors the assembly of      refused to hear these representations and contrary to instructions from the far greater part of the presbyteries who sent any enacted that protestant heritors whether prelatic jacobites or not and elders should be the only voters in the election of gospel ministers the assembly of      discharged the presbytery of dunfermline under pain of the highest censure to administer sealing ordinances to those whose consciences could not submit to the ministry of pastors violently imposed upon them mean while mr ebenezer erskine abovementioned having in his sermon before the synod at perth october      testified against the act of the last assembly relative to the choice of ministers and having decried patronage and some other prevalent corruptions the synod after three days dispute appointed him to be rebuked at their bar for the matter and manner of his conduct twelve ministers and two elders dissented himself appealed to the assembly in      but received no redress that supreme judicatory ordered him to be rebuked at the bar conceiving that the truths of god he had in his sermon supported were hereby injured he protested that he could not without violating his conscience submit to this sentence mess william wilson alexander moncrief and james fisher for the exoneration of their consciences protested against the prevailing course of defection without allowing these four brethren to attempt a defense of their conduct the assembly appointed their commission to proceed against them by suspension and higher censure if they should not retract their protest and profess their sorrow for taking it when the commission met in august the protesting brethren were hardly allowed to declare their mind and because they continued adhering to their protest they were suspended from the exercise of their ministry the next meeting of the commission in november by their moderators casting vote suspended them also from their ministration in their respective congregations hereupon these brethren declared a secession not from the constitution of the scots church but from the prevailing party in her judicatories and that they might regularly adhere to their principles and afford relief to those people that were oppressed with intrusion of pastors they constituted themselves into an ecclesiastic court which they called the associate presbytery their minutes show that quickly after their erection mess wilson and moncrief drew up a paper entitled a testimony to the doctrine worship discipline and government of the church of scotland this paper was judicially considered and approved in their meetings at colfargy and dunfermline and in it they exhibit their reasons of secession from the prevailing party in the judicatories of the established church viz   that that party were breaking down the presbyterian constitution of churchgovernment by their trampling upon and making decisions quite contrary to the barrier acts and rules which had been enacted by the scots church in her purest times for ascertaining due deliberation in the framing of standing laws and general rules by their exercising a lordly tyranny over mens consciences in impowering heritors and elders to impose upon christians what spiritual guides they pleased by their promoting violent intrusion of ministers as opportunity permitted by their censuring and ejecting ministers from their congregations merely for protesting against a sinful act of assembly by threatening the highest censures to such as should administer baptism or the lords supper to those who could not in conscience submit to the ministry of intruders and allowing the commission to take the presbyterys power in settlement of ministers if these presbyteries refused to promote the violent imposition of ministers upon reclaiming congregations   that they were pursuing such methods as tended to corrupt the doctrine contained in their confession of faith in so easily dismissing professor simsons process and refusing to assert the truth in opposition to his various errors in caressing mr campbell professor of church history at st andrews notwithstanding his ridiculing practical goodness as enthusiasm and his declaring that selflove is the chief motive and standard of all virtuous and religious actions that the being of god and immortality of the soul cannot be known by the mere light of nature and yet the laws of nature are a certain and sufficient rule to direct rational minds to happiness and our observing them the great means of our real and lasting felicity and finally in their permitting or encouraging preachers to entertain their hearers with dry harangues of almost mere heathen morality instead of the gospel of christ   that they were imposing upon ministers as a term of communion the sinful breaking of their ordinationvows by neglecting all proper opposition to the prevailing course of apostasy from the doctrine worship government and discipline of the scots church   that they were continuing obstinate in their evil ways notwithstanding of all ordinary means used to recall them  moreover in this testimony these four brethren declared their adherence to their ordinationvows and to the standards of the mother church and that they intended to hold ecclesiastic communion with all such of her ministers and members as opposed the abovementioned course of backsliding as they should have opportunity  the strict party of the scots church having vigorously exerted themselves in the choice of members the assembly of      was very different from several of the preceding sundry corrupt courses were checked the seceding brethren were appointed to be reponed to their charges but as the act of assembly represented this as done without condemning the act of assembly of      or the conduct of their commission these brethren reckoned the truths that suffered along with them not duly vindicated and therefore declined joining the established judicatories on that footing and published the reasons of their conduct however they waited about two years and a half looking and wishing for an opportunity of returning to the judicatories during which time they kept their meetings of presbytery for almost nothing but prayer and conference at length observing the established judicatories fast returning to or proceeding in their forementioned corruptions intrusions promoted professor campbell dismissed without censure and his error concerning selflove inadvertently approved by the general assembly her own excellent act against violent settlements and another for orthodox preaching generally disregarded they began to preach to those oppressed christians who petitioned for it and appointed mr wilson one of their number to train up students for the holy ministry  mean while in the beginning of      mess ralph erskine and thomas mair joined them declaring that they joined them not as different from but as a part of the church of scotland witnessing against the corruption of the prevailing party in her established judicatories that they intended no withdrawment from such godly ministers as were groaning under and wrestling against the then course of backsliding and that they proposed to return to the established judicatories whenever they should return to their duty  about the same time the associate presbytery published a second testimony calculated not to enumerate the causes of secession but to represent the grounds of the lords anger against the generation to approve former reformations to condemn the steps of defection from it and the most prevalent errors of the times and assert the truth in opposition thereto in this paper they particularly rehearsed and condemned the principal defections of church and state between    0 and      they expressly condemned the errors of mess simson and campbell and showed them to be contrary to the word of god and to the westminster confession of faith and catechisms they solemnly asserted that the old and new testament are not only a sufficient and principal but the only rule to direct us how to glorify and enjoy god that jesus christ is the supreme only true and necessarily existent god of the same substance with his eternal father that god from eternity decreed all things merely according to the counsel of his will and elected his people to everlasting life without any regard to their good works as the motive or condition of his choice that god entered into a covenant of works with adam as the representative of all his natural seed that in consequence of the breach of this covenant all men are conceived and born in sin are by nature children of wrath and can do nothing spiritually good that though there be no necessary connection between natural seriousness and our obtaining of saving grace yet it is the duty of all unregenerate persons seriously to attend gospel ordinances whether public private or secret as the means whereby god conveys his converting influence that the light of nature is not sufficient to guide fallen men to true or lasting happiness that christ assumed our nature is very god and very man in two distinct natures and one person for ever that he as our surety undertook for all the elect and gave to the law and justice of god whatever obedience and satisfaction they could require of us that his righteousness imputed to us is the only foundation of our pardon acceptance with god and title to eternal life and not any thing wrought in or done by us that want of conformity to gods law in heart or life is truly and properly sin that sinning and suffering will be the misery of the damned in hell through eternity that all believers in christ are fully delivered from the moral law as a covenant of works so as to be thereby neither justified nor condemned but are for ever under it as a binding rule of obedience given by jehovah the creator and redeemer of men that god needs nothing from nor can be profited by any creature and therefore rewards their good actions entirely of his own free will and absolutely gracious bounty that not selfinterest or pleasure but the holy law of god is the supreme and only standard of all religious and virtuous actions that not selflove but a view of the glorious excellencies of god as revealed in christ and a regard to his authority is the leading motive of our love and obedience to him that no believer can ever totally fall from a state of grace nor did christs disciples while he lay in the grave look upon him as a downright impostor that christ alone is king and ead of his church to him alone it belongs to give her laws ordinances and officers to him alone her officers are subject in their spiritual administrations that he has warranted them to hold general assemblies and other church judicatories as often as necessary that he has appointed the presbyterian form of government and no other to continue in his church till the end of time that christ having in his word prescribed a government in his church distinct from and not subordinate to the civil magistrate he has entrusted it not to all church members but only to her officebearers whose power is entirely subordinate to the laws declared in his word that these officers ought to be set over congregations by the call and consent of the majority of such therein as are admitted to full communion with the church in all her sealing ordinances no persons vote being preferred upon any secular account along with these assertory declarations of their belief they condemned and professed their detestation of the contrary errors and finally declared their hearty adherence to the westminster confession of faith catechisms directory for worship and form of church government and to the national covenant of scotland as explained to abjure prelacy and the articles of perth and to the solemn league and covenant of the three kingdoms and to all acts of assembly or other testimonies tending to promote or support their ancestors covenanted work of reformation and particularly to their own representations to the commission of the general assembly in      their first testimony and their reasons of not acceding to the judicatories of the established church  though this testimony was not intended for a new standard but as an open appearance in favor of those that had been long acknowledged by the nation yet persons at their accession to or joining with the seceding ministers did commonly profess their approbation of it as far as they understood it but that the presbytery did not tyrannically require such as joined them to believe the certainty of the various narratives of fact contained therein is fully evident mr wilson the principal defender of the seceding cause boldly avers that mr currie his antagonist in charging it with twentyfour mistakes respecting historical facts did not affect its proper substance but merely wrangled about circumstances and that the plain meaning of acceders approving this testimony was their signifying their conjunction with the associate presbytery in the same confession of the truths of god held forth from his word in our received standards of doctrine worship discipline and government  now nothing can be more certain that neither the word of god nor standards of the scots church but acts of parliament acts of assembly and other like fallible vouchers hold forth the historical assertions of that paper  not long had this testimony been published when multitudes of private christians a good number of elders and two more ministers being offended with the growth of apostasy abovementioned and anew grieved with a great part of the established clergy for publicly reaing on the sabbath and thus solemnly acquiescing in an act relative to the murderers of captain porteous in which the parliament claimed a spiritual headship over the church constuting themselves judges of ministers fitness to sit in her courts and threatening ecclesiastic penalties for disobedience to their civil authority did join the associate presbytery upon the footing of it now many from different corners of the land petitioned this presbytery for sermons their requests were deliberately granted the seceding ministers preached and especially held fasts in most corners of the south part of the country  the plainness of this second testimony and the crowding of the common people after the authors of it mightily provoked the managers in the established judicatories the seceding ministers were libelled and cited before the assembly of      when they appeared the assembly declared their willingness to drop the libel overlook every thing foregoing and receive them with open arms into all manner of church fellowship but these associate brethren considering that the assembly consisted chiefly of intruders and others deeply guilty of the growing defection declined her authority as a not rightly constituted court of christ this daring attack added to the former provocation mightily chagrined the managers wherefore the assembly in    0 without pretending to find these ministers guilty of error in doctrine or immorality in practice deposed them from being ministers of the church of scotland this sentence occasioned a mighty run of the common people after the seceding brethren but as their followers increased so did their trials sundry if not most of these ministers had ere now believed that a magistrate has only power to appoint fasts and thanksgivings with the diets and causes thereof in extraordinary cases and where he has not access to consult with a church that he judges rightly constituted but some of their people who had acceded to them now prompted them to determine whether it was lawful for them to observe a fast on the day appointed by the king for that effect in a pro re nata meeting of presbytery designed for other business and while    out of    members were absent this question was irregularly hawled in by mess alexander moncrief thomas nairn and thomas mair and because they judged the established church had practically given up their power of appointing fasts and thanksgivings into the hand of the sovereign they carried it by i think one vote that the seceders observing fasts on these occasions was a sinful connivance at the kings exercising a spiritual headship over the church the deep silence concerning this matter in their after confession of sins prefixed to their covenantbond indeed plainly demonstrates that this decision was never generally approved by the seceding clergy but their people being once many of them tinctured with the above notion they seldom found it for edification to observe fasts or thanksgivings on the days appointed for that end by the civil magistrate nevertheless on these occasions they used to recommend private fasting or to forbear giving offense with public labor so that except a few forward and less judicious persons it may be justly averred that the seceders gave as little open offense to the government on that head as most in the nation who pretended to be zealous observers of the sovereigns fasts  by mr whitfields missives to mr ralph erskine and other like circumstances several of the seceding brethren had conceived a very favorable opinion of him but finding upon converse with him that he decried all particular forms of church government as a mere human device and being exceedingly offended with his printed enthusiastic account of gods dealing with his soul they turned their favor into warm opposition in      and some following years a surprising commotion in the souls and bodies of men while they attended sermon happened at cambuslang near glasgow and other places this mr whitfields admirers extolled as a wonderful work of the spirit of god but the seceders though they could not deny that the lives of many were for the present thereby reformed and that some divine influence might attend the truths there delivered yet because of the bodily convulsions disorderly noise imaginary views of christ aversion at a covenanted work of reformation nauseous boasting and other irregularities attending it they decried it as in a great measure delusive in the warm contention upon so critical a topic no doubt both parties sometimes run into extremes and became stumbling blocks to one another however the return of multitudes of the subjects of the surprising influence to their wonted courses mightily confirmed the seceders in their sentiment  mean while the seceding body had another trial from among themselves it was their earnest desire and prayer to god to make our sovereign king george and every subordinate magistrate zealous friends to a covenanted work of reformation but they were firmly persuaded that difference in religion deprives no civil ruler of his just power and authority they openly testified against mr mmilians party and others that thought otherwise not a few of them bore arms against the pretender not one of them can be charged with appearing on his side their ministers often debarred from the lords table such as denied the lawful authority of our present government in all things civil and they formally excommunicated some few of their followers that presumed to do so  in      mr thomas nairn a person too volatile for a witnessing minister took it into his head to maintain that none but a presbyterian and covenanted person could be rightful sovereign of this realm his associated brethren quickly opposed him with great vigor proceeded to censure him published a judicial declaration wherein they showed from the word of god our standards and covenants that it is the duty of the whole nation to obey the present civil government in all things lawful for conscience sake  after about seven years deliberation the associate presbytery agreed upon the form of a bond of public covenanting with god and in december      themselves began to enter into it next year their act on this head was published together with another vindicating the doctrine of gods free grace from the injury done it by the general assemblies of    0 and      abovementioned the form of the seceders covenant had been short and mostly plain had it not reduplicated upon a long confession of sins that it is to be feared few of their people could fully know the import and certainty of not a few therefore condemned the presbyterys act declaring that the swearing of this bond should be the term of ministerial and christian communion with them it was thought very unreasonable that a person of an eminently holy life and zealously attached to all the truths of god to the scots standards and covenants should be excluded from the seals of gods covenant merely because he could not understand the meaning or certainty of some things in this bond and the acknowledgment of sins prefixed to it or would not swear to what he understood not many of the seceding clergy were afterward sensible that this act was sinful nor do i know that ever the most zealous acted up to the tenor of it with respect to their people  about the beginning of the year      the associate presbytery was so far increased that they divided themselves into three presbyteries under one synod soon after which the lord to punish their management of his cause gave them up to angry contentions and an unprecedented breach though in many of their public papers they had solemnly declared their adherence to the ordinationvows used and consequently to the religion professed in the established church though in their principles concerning magistracy published in the year      p  0 they had judicially declared their thankfulness to god that their own religion had such security by the present civil government as no nation on earth enjoyed the like yet at the very first meeting of their associate synod they began warmly to debate whether it was lawful for seceders to swear that clause in some scots burgessoaths viz i profess and allow with my heart the true religion presently professed within this realm and authorized by the laws thereof i shall abide at and defend the same to my lifes end renouncing the roman religion called papistry mess ebenezer and ralph erskines james fisher and others maintained that since it was the true the divine religion itself professed and settled in scotland and not the human and faulty manner of professing or settling it that was sworn to in these oaths that since in their secession they had never pretended to set up a new religion but to cleave more closely to that whereinto they had been baptized that since in their testimonies they had espoused the very same standards with the established church had frequently and solemnly declared their adherence to the ordinationvows sundry of them had taken therein and whereby they were engaged to the religion doctrine worship discipline and government professed and settled in the land that since though in their public papers they had quarrelled with the manner in which the true religion is presently professed and settled in the realm and testified against the various corruptions of church and state yet they had been so far from quarrelling with the true religion professed and settled that no more than two years before they had judicially declared the religion secured by the present civil government to be their own and therefore could not without the most glaring self contradiction prohibit the swearing of the above clause as in itself sinful for those of their way mess alexander mncrief thomas mair adam gib and others commended that seceders swearing of this clause was exceeding sinful and a giving up the whole of their testimony because said they swearing to the true religion presently professed and authorized in this realm imports a swearing to it as presently professed and settled and so an approving by oath of all the corrupt acts of church and state after much hot contention those who defended the burgessoath and who now began to be called burghers offered for the sake of peace to agree to an act forbidding seceders to swear the said clause as inexpedient in the present circumstances this peaceful proposal the antiburghers refused as altogether insufficient and in a pretty thin meeting of syned apr        pushed and carried a vote condemning the present swearing of the above religious clause by seceders as sinful and inconsistent with their testimony and bond for renewing the covenants part of the burgher ministers and elders protested against this sentence but the antiburghers answers to their reasons of protest not being ready as they ought against next meeting of synod and some of the more zealous having in the mean time publicly debarred the defenders of the burgessoath from the lords table a new question was introduced whether the above sentence relative to the religious clause of some burgessoaths should be a term of ministerial and christian communion after much warm altercation at two meetings and a dissent and protestation of the antiburghers against putting this question it was voted and carried that the said sentence should not be a term of ministerial or christian communion at least till the affair should be deliberately considered in presbyteries and sessions their mind obtained and further means used by prayer and conference for seeing eye to eye in the truth no sooner was this sentence carried than mr thomas mair a zealous antiburgher declared and protested that thereby his opposers had forfeited all synodical power and that the lawful authority of the associate synod was devolved upon a constituted meeting of his party and of such as should cleave to them all whom he called to meet next day in mr gibs house for that effect and then with twentytwo others and without either moderator or clerk withdrew from thirtytwo or thirtythree of their brethren constituted in christs name and with their moderator and clerk attending them the day following the burghers assembled and constituted synod in the ordinary place but the antiburghers constituted themselves into another synod in mr gibs house and asserted themselves sole judges of their own answers dissents and protests enacted that the burgher ministers had forfeited all power pertaining to their office and that no seceding presbytery or session not constituted in subordination to their present meeting could be a lawful court of christ this act was the basis of their next meetings of presbytery hence the antiburghers of the presbytery of edinburgh deserted their appointed place of next meeting and took another  those of the presbytery of perth refused their brethren a seat with them and they universally refused to sit in session with those elders that would not submit to their above constitution of synod mournful was the stumbling and alienation of affection that ensued among the people multitudes were perplexed how to side themselves and no doubt many did it entirely by guess to remedy this awful confusion the burgher clergy wrote twice to their brethren that deserted them earnestly begging a meeting for prayer and conference in order to their uniting in the lords cause the antiburghers whether from unwillingness to convince the burghers of the sins they laid to their charge or from consciousness that they had not sufficient arguments for that end or from some different view returned no other answer than that they could not consistently with their testimony comply with any such proposal and that their brethrens only way for peace was to present themselves penitent pannels at their bar the burghers could not in conscience submit to their brethrens constitution of synod none of them therefore appeared at their bar except mr hutton who did it for no other purpose than to read a formidable attack upon the constitution of their court which to this moment has received no proper refutation the burghers continued exercising their ministry and holding their judicatories as formerly they even made an act declaring the antiburgher constitution in mr gibs house void and null eversive of presbytery and contrary to scripture and reason for these and other abovementioned instances of opposition the antiburghers deposed excommunicated and delivered them over to satan these sentences had no effect the mess erskines and other burghers lived as holily preached as edifyingly and died as comfortably as any of their opposers the antiburghers having proceeded two years in thus censuring their brethren were obliged to confess that all along themselves had been lying under scandal with respect to partaking with their brethren in their sin and at a meeting of synod purged one another from it by judicial rebukes and admons ow scandalous persons were fit to censure others or to purge one another was not understood by many however this was scarce well finished when m patrick matthew an antiburgher deserted to the brghers and was censured as they had been  not long after mr thomas mair the founder of the constitution in mr gibs house for maintaining that christ in some sense died for all mankind was prosecuted and censured by his brethren as guilty of arminian error nothing transacted since on either side deserves a place in a general history of religion it remains briefly to represent the present agreement and difference of the two parties since their rupture in      both have retained their respective synod presbyteries and sessions both have supplied the maleontents in their opposers congregations with preaching the congregations belonging to both amount to about  in sundry whereof are some thousand examinable persons but the greater part much below that number which party have the greatest number of followers i know not but the antiburghers having the teacher of philosophy and professor of divinity on their side at the breach then carried off almost all the students and to this day have the greatest number of ministers though even here the burghers seem to gain ground both parties agree in public profession of acherence to the scriptures as the only rule of says and practice and to the confession of faith catechisms form of church government and public covenants of their presbyterian ancestors both i hope preach the gospel of christ in purity and endeavor to commit the ministry to faithful men i heir form of worship is much the same with that of their mother church with both ministers endeavor publicly to catechize and privately to visit their congregations once a year without respect of persons both detest and avoid private bptism both use to administer the lords supper in their congregation once a year and sundry of the burghers do it twice neither party allow themselves to admit to the sacraments any but such as have some visible appearance of saintship gross ignorance of the christian says neglect of the worship of god in secret or in families drunkenness swearing in ordinary conversation even though it be in a passion idleness or unnecessary traveling or laboring on the sabbath playing at cards and dice smuggling of goods lying reviling apparent hatred of others dishonesty obscene language fornication and the like are with both reckoned scandalous and sufficient reason for suspending a person from the sacraments with respect to difference none can be admitted to the sacraments by the antiburghers except he at least indirectly declare his persuasion that it is very sinful for seceders to swear the abovementioned clause of some burgessoaths they contend that the constitution of the scots revolution church is erastian and could never be lawfully joined with they aver that their religion is different from that of the established church but have not hitherto declared what divine truth they hold that is not comprehended in her public standards they seem to equal if not sometimes prefer the second testimony abovementioned to the confession of faith and other standards of their mother church and meanwhile renounce the ordinationvows together with such parts of the first testimony and representations adhered to in it as approve of the religion at present professed in the realm though in their present form of ordinationvows they plainly approve of that declaration of principles concerning the civil magistrate in which it is declared that their own religion has unmatched security by the present civil government yet they separated from their brethren because they would not allow that every one should be excluded from ministerial and christian communion with them who believed it lawful to swear to profess and abide in the religion at present authorized by the civil government they separated without pretending to make any schism and though at the breach no more than about twofifths of the synod they met in a different place and assumed the whole power of it and though confessedly under scandal themselves proceeded as above to censure their brethren who never once acknowledged their authority and frequently they fast and pray that god may bless the censures they have passed upon them they reckon public covenanting a very distinguishing article of their religion and hence push their people into it but it is shrewdly alleged with ut due pains to instruct them in the knowledge of the bond and confession of sins to which they swear or due care to restrain such as do not understand that oath in consequence whereof it is hard to find many whose practice is a whit bettered by their covenanting work  on the other hand the burghers though they generally conceive the religious clause of the burgessoath to be lawful require none either directly or indirectly to be of their mind in that matter with them one that thinks it sinful may be as readily admitted to the sacrament or even to the ministry as if he thought it lawful their maxim being him that is weak in the faith receive ye but not to doubtful disputations they contend that though the glory of the revolutionchurch is indeed inferior to that between      and    0 her constitution is nevertheless scriptural and was lawfully joined with and declare their intention to join with the established judicatories whenever they shall earnestly reform from the various defections introduced since the revolution they maintain that though the human appearances for religion the manner of professing and settling it be different yet the religion of the revolutionchurch is the very same with that professed between      and    0 and generally contend that what themselves profess is the very same religion professed in the established church since their standards of doctrine worship discipline and government are the same though their method of professing and adhering to them be more strict they esteem the second testimony as no standard but as an appearance in favor of their standards they acknowledge that in the historical parts of it there are a few mistakes or illguarded expressions but cleave to the substantial part of it without exception when their brethren separated from them they pursued after peace and union even while it fled from them being the majority at the breach they kept possession of their seat in judicatories though they declared the antiburghers constitution in mr gibs house null and void and maintained their brethrens abovementioned censuring of them and their frequent fasting and prayer for gods ratification thereof an almost unmatched profanation of the name of christ yet they could not see it warrantable from scripture to proceed to censure their brethren while there was no appearance of its tending to the general edification they heartily approve of publicly covenanting when seasonable and done in truth judgment and righteousness they constantly maintain the continued obligation of their ancestors covenants and at ordinations and on other occasions solemnly declare their adherence to them but finding from scripture that public covenanting is not a standing but occasional duty that it neither took place in the reign of david nor solomon those religious kings who together reigned eighty years over israel nor appears to have been ever recommended by the apostles as a present duty for their hearers that it is only to be done with knowledge and understanding and that it is better not to vow than to vow and not pay by a tender and holy practice and fearing that the present broken state of the church when the godly are so divided may not be altogether proper for it finding that besides some inadvertent mistakes the confession of sins published in      and now used by the antiburghers is such as they could not hope to make the twentieth part of their hearers to understand and being determined never to allow persons to swear it ignorantly and finally being exceedingly stumbled at the rash ignorant proud partylike and fruitless covenanting they think they observe among their brethren antiburghers they have never yet proceeded to such work and on that account are represented by the antiburghers as most wicked and wilful apostates from the cause of christ  the government worship and discipline of the church of scotland there are in scotland about  000 parishes each of which is divided in proportion to its extent into particular districts and every district has its own ruling elders and deacons the ruling elders are men of the best quality and interest in their parishes and the deacons are persons of a good character for manners and understanding a consistory of ministers see the westminster form of presbyterial church government  elders see the westminster form of presbyterial church government and deacons see the westminster form of presbyterial church government  is called a kirksession which is the lowest ecclesiastical judicatory and convenes once a week to conduct the affairs of the parish see the westminster form of presbyterial church government  the minister is always moderator but witout a negative appeals lie from thence to their own presbyteries which are the next higher judicatories  scotland is divided into sixtynine presbyteries each consisting of from twelve to twentyfour contiguous parishes the ministers of these parishes with one ruling elder chosen halfyearly at every kirksession compose a presbytery they meet in the principal town from which they are denominated and choose their moderator who must be a minister halfyearly from these presbyteries appeals lie to provincial synods which are composed of several adjacent presbyteries two three four or eight there are fifteen provincial synods in all the members are a minister and a ruling elder out of every parish these synods meet twice a year at the principal town of its bounds they choose a moderator who is their prolocutor the acts of the synods are subject to the review of the general assembly which is the last resort of the kirk of scotland  the general assembly consists of commissioners from presbyteries royal burghs and universiies a presbytery of twelve ministers sends two ministers and one ruling elder a presbytery of between twelve and eighteen send three ministers and one ruling elder of between eighteen and twentyfour four ministers and two ruling elders a presbytery of twentyfour sends five ministers and two ruling elders every royal burgh sends one elder and edinburgh two every university sends one commissioner who is generally a minister  the general assembly meets once a year in the month of may and is opened and adjourned by the kings royal commissioner appointed for that purpose but agreeable to their old maxims the general assembly own no spiritual headship in the civil power and in      they met before the high commissioners commission came down and directly proceeded to business after choosing a moderator  who however has no vote  upon the day appointed for the meeting of the general assembly the preceding moderator makes a sermon before the kings commissioner and the members after sermon they go to the assembly house where the commissioner being upon the throne they proceed to choose a moderator the election is thus managed the last moderator nominates two or three ministers to whom the assembly adds whom they see fit the nominees are said to be upon the list every man upon the list gives his vote and withdraws then the assembly votes and he that has the majority is chosen and takes the chair at the fot of the throne  the moderator being chosen the high commissioner produces his commission impowering him to sit there with his majestys letter to the assembly both which are read by the clerk all the members standing the commissioner then makes a speech which is answered by the moderator and then committees are appointed next day is set apart for prayers the commissioner certainly attending the moderator nominates eight or nine to pray successively after which the assembly adjourns  next day they fall to business the moderator has no negative he only sums up the debates and puts the question the first business is always to answer the kings letter which is done by a committee whose draught is read and examined and altered if need be and then finally approved by the house then the moderator signs it in their presence and delivers it to the commissioner who dispatches it to the king though the business is usually transacted by committees yet any member may propose what he pleases in the assembly when a motion is made or any business is brought in by a committee the moderator names two or three of the most eminent members to speak to it after whom any member may speak that is so inclined when the debate is over it is put to the vote and carried agreed or disagreed by the majority  matters of great weight that bind the whole church are first brought in by way of overtures and then debated in the house after which if approved they are transmitted to every presbytery in scotland who return their answers by their commissioners to the next assembly who according as they find them approved by the presbyteries pass them into acts of assembly or reject them  during every assembly a diet is appointed to inspect the acts of the provincial synods as they had before inspected the proceedings of the presbyteries before they rise they nominate a standing commission of ministers and ruling elders chosen out of every synod to attend the affairs of the church till the next assembly meets of these twentyone is a quorum of whom fifteen must be ministers the moderator of the assembly moderates in the commission if present they were obliged to sit the first week in every quarter all parliamenttime before the union and as often else as they thought fit they have the power of the assembly in all matters referred to them from it regularly they can act in nothing but what is recommended from the assembly but then that recommendation often includes a general clause impowering them to act in every thing that may be for the good of the church they are accountable to the next general assembly and therefore keep a register of their proceedings  when the assembly are to rise the moderator tells them that it is time to dissolve themselves and appoint another assembly in the name of their master the lord jesus christ then he speaks to the commissioner in the name of the assembly who returns an answer and then dissolves them in the kings name and fixes the time and place for the new assembly which is always to be within a year and a day after the dissolution of the old one the moderator then prays and the assembly sing a psalm after which the moderator blesses them and they separate  the deacon whose office is for life is chosen by the kirksession in every parish approved by the congregation and solemnly set apart by the minister after a sermon and prayer for the occasion he collects the offerings for the poor inquires into their necessities and distributes to them as the kirksession appoints he assists at the communion and attends the ministers and elders in their visitations and examinations he has no vote in the kirksessions but may give his opinion if asked nor has he any stipend from the parish  the ruling elders are chosen out of the parish by the kirksession and ordained before the congregation after sermon and prayer their office is also for life in case of no misdemeanor they assist the ministers in overseeing and correcting the manners of the people attend them in visiting and catechizing their districts in the parishes in praying with the sick in private admonitions and at the communion table in all matters of government and discipline they have an equal vote with the ministers  ministers or preaching presbyters only can preach and administer the sacraments catechize pronounce church censures ordain deacons and ruling elders assist at the imposition of hands upon other ministers and moderate or preside in all ecclesiastical judicatories severe scrutinies are made into their qualifications respecting life and manners they must be competently skilled in the scriptures the learned languages and all sorts of divinity they are always tried by the presbytery before they are licensed to preach in order to have calls to be ministers of any parish indeed in scotland all their ministers have an universityeducation and at least have commenced master of arts they are not ordained till they have obtained a call to a particular flock and when that is obtained they cannot desert it without the authority of a presbytery or some superior judicatory to be guilty of nonresidence merits deprivation if the call is agreed to by the congregation the minister present attests it by his subscription in their presence and then reports it to the presbytery who acquaint the person concerned as soon as possible if on trial he satisfies the presbytery they then issue out an edict that all who can object any thing against this nominee should appear before the presbytery there to make good their allegations if the objections are of weight or even doubtful the ordination is suspended till a more perfect trial otherwise they proceed to ordination on the ordinationday a fast is strictly kept to implore gods blessing upon the work they are about the moderator preaches upon the nature and dignity of the ministerial office the person to be ordained is examined of his faith and assent to the doctrine and discipline of the kirk the motive of his coming into the ministry and whether by any indirect means he has obtained his presentation or call of his resolution to do his duty faithfully etc etc etc if he answers to the moderators satisfaction the parishioners ratify their choice by lifting up their hands the moderator and ministers present then lay their hands upon his head and so ordain him minister of the gospel and pastor of that congregation the ordination being over the elders heritors and chief parishioners take their minister by the hand if the nominee had been ordained before he is only recommended to the people with a suitable sermon and prayers by the moderator and the people take him by the hand the patron for at present every parish has a patron is bound to nominate or present in six months after a vacancy otherwise the presbytery fills the place jure devoluto but that privilege does not hold in royal burghs patronages were restored by  0 anne  the stipends of ministers should at the very lowest be  0 l sterling per annum some are   0l per ann out of which they pay a proportionable tax for the support of the widows and orphans of ministers  such as are found guilty of assaulting the lives of ministers or robbing their houses or actually attempting the same shall be punished by death and escheat of movables five hundred merks is allowed to the discoverer and three hundred merks to the apprehender of the criminals to be paid out of the kings treasury for their better accommodation they are provided with convenient parsonage houses manses and where they are not fitting the heritors of the parish shall build complete ones for them not exceeding  000 l nor under  00 merks value  the kirksession can judge in matters of lesser scandal they can suspend from the lords supper for a time their consent in the call of a minister and precentor parishclerk is necessary they provide all necessaries for the communion regulate all particulars relative to public worship and give notice of all catechisings and parochial visitations they have a treasurer who is chosen out of the deacons to keep and distribute the poors money they keep two registers one of births and marriages the other of their own proceedings which they must lay before the presbytery appeals lie from them in all cases to their own presbytery whom they must not contradict  presbyteries have no jurisdiction beyond their own bounds they determine all appeals from kirksessions but can try nothing at the first instance which is cognizable before a kirksession they compose all differences between ministers and people for which they hold presbyterial visitations in every parish where they examine the registers of kirksessions and censure or commend as they find cause they inquire into repairs of churches and see that glebes and manses suffer no dilapidation they appoint schools and see that the funds settled by act of parliament for that purpose be not misemployed and the schoolmasters are subject to their censure and examination they only can inflict the greater excommunication i e absolute prohibition of the communion they license probationers interpose in all calls and ordinations of ministers suspend and depose them and in fine determine ecclesiastical matters of all kinds within their bounds but so as not to contradict any act of parliament there lies an appeal in all cases from the presbyteries to the provincial synods before they inflict private censures they observe a fast in these private censures every minister withdraws by turns and the moderator inquires of the rest concerning his conduct and according to the report they are called in and commended or censured all ecclesiastical judicatories it may be here observed begin adjourn and dissolve themselves by prayer  presbyteries are subject to the privy censures of the synods as ministers are to those of the presbyteries at every ordinary session of the provincial synods a diet is appointed i e one certain time in which these privy censures are performed  before every communion the minister visits and examines every family in his parish once at least of which visits notice is given the preceding lords day that every district may know when he intends to visit them to live six weeks in a parish makes a man a parishioner after which if he leaves it he must get a certificate of his good behavior signed by the minister or kirksession clerk in the name and with consent of the kirksession if the new comer only removes from another family in the parish his name is transferred in the register or examinationbook to its proper place the minister on his visit marks and enters the children in his examinationbook if they are of a fit age he then exhorts every one to a strict observance of their respective duties and particularly to family prayer reading the scriptures and singing of psalms to omit family prayer is esteemed very scandalous and the omission is often punished by excommunication at parting the minister usually prays with every family visitation being over the minister gives notice when he will examine the persons marked in his book every district comes to church by themselves at the time appointed and the minister accompanied by the elder and deacon of that district examines them in order as they stand in the examinationbook he examines them out of the shorter catechism and if the person answers he catechises upon those questions and instructs them in what is difficult he marks at every ones name how they answer grown persons who have been often examined are not catechized when they are found to be sufficiently knowing this exercise being chiefly intended for children and ignorant persons  every lords day there is public worship twice in every parish church in scotland vide the westminster directory to the public worship of god  first a psalm is sung which is read and then tuned by the minister or parishclerk after which the minister prays and then reads a chapter or two out of the bible which he expounds for about half an hour this they call lecturing then another psalm is sung then another prayer offered up after which sermon begins and that ended there is another prayer and another psalm and then all is concluded with the ministers blessing in the afternoon there is no lecturing  baptism in the church of scotland is administered by none but the minister who does it by sprinkling and whether it is performed at church or at home there is always a sermon before it the father or in his absence some reputable neighbor presents the infant to the minister who asks the parent if he desires the child shall be received into the visible church and receive the signs and seals of the covenant of grace by baptism upon his answering yea the minister discourses on the nature of baptism etc etc and then sprinkles a little water in the childs face in the name of the father the son and of the holy ghost  some time before the lords supper is administered the congregation is to have notice thereof from the pulpit the week before the kirksession meets and draws up a list of all the communicants in the parish according to the ministers examinationbook and the restimony of the elders and deacons according to this list tickets are delivered to each communicant if desired and the ministers and elders also give tickets to strangers who bring sufficient testimonials none are allowed to communicate without such tickets which are produced at the table those who never received are instructed by the minister severally and by themselves in the nature of the sacraments and taught what is the proper preparation thereunto the communion is always celebrated upon the lords day the wednesday or thursday before there is a solemn fast and on the saturday there are two preparatory sermons on sunday morning after singing and prayer as usual the minister of the parish preaches a suitable sermon and when the ordinary worship is ended he in the name of jesus christ forbids the unworthy to approach and invites the penitent to come and receive the sacrament then he goes into the body of the church where one or two tables according to its width are placed reaching from one end to the other covered with a white linen cloth and seats on both sides for the communicants the minister places himself at the end or middle of the table on which the elements are placed after a short discourse he reads the institution and blesses the elements then he breaks the bread and distributes it and the wine to those that are next him who transmit them to their neighbors the elders and deacons attending to serve and to see that the whole is performed with decency and order whilst these communicate the minister discourses concerning the nature of the sacrament when the first company has received they withdraw and others take their places and whilst this is performing a psalm is sung and so they continue till all have communicated the minister then returns to the pulpit and discourses concerning the particular cases of communicants and with thanksgiving and singing of psalms the morning service is concluded then the congregation is dismissed for an hour and so meet again when they have the usual afternoon worship and on monday about nine oclock in the morning there is public worship and two sermons which close the whole  on these occasions the parishminister is assisted by two or three of his neighbors and seldom preaches oftener than the morning of the sacramentday no private communions are allowed in scotland  no holy days are observed in scotland besides the lords day which is observed with great exactness they likewise observe fasts and thanksgivings in appointing which though they attribute a power to the church yet they have the sanction of the privy council as thereby they may be more strictly kept  marriage is solemnized by the minister and none can marry that are nearer than cousin germans prohibited degrees in blood hold also in affinity banns are asked on three several lords days in churches where both parties live before marriage can be contracted the minister first prays then discourses upon the institution rise and ends of matrimony and the duties the parties owe to each other the rest of the ceremony save the use of the ring as well as the form of words used are nearly the same as those in the church of england the whole is concluded with a prayer  the discipline of the church of scotland is regulated by two acts of assembly one dated april     0  the other april         which declare that nothing shall be accounted scandalous but what is accounted so by the word of god or by some act or universal custom of the church of scotland agreeable thereto if a scandal be not notified in five years it shall not be revived so as to form a process thereanent unless it becomes again flagrant but in such cases the consciences of the offenders ought to be dealt with in private to bring them to a sense of their sin and duty all churchjudicatories have power to convene examine and censure every person within their own bounds in all ecclesiastical causes cognizable before every such judicatory persons living without the bounds of any judicatory shall not for order sake be cited by them but they shall desire the judicatory under whom such persons live to cause him to appear before the judicatory before whom the cause is to be examined ministers are not subject to their own kirksessions but to the superior judicatories of the church in scandals private admonition is to be first used where persons or parties are concerned the court must give them first a legal and timely citation setting forth the causes thereof if the person resides in the parish fortyeight hours notice is sufficient and the officer must certify his having properly executed the summons by calling the party at his door no man is to be declared contumacious till he has been three times cited either personally or at his dwelling house if the cause be tried at the first instance but if it be in the case of a reference or appeal where the person had actually appeared already before an inferior court a citation apud acta to appear before his superior is sufficient if it be minuted and if instructed infers contumacy if not obeyed though in these cases a man may be pronounced forthwith contumacious upon his nonappearances and not producing any relevant sufficient excuse yet the court is advised to examine and try the cause either by witnesses upon oath or otherwise before they pronounce the person cited contumacious if the party appears the moderator is to acquaint him with the cause and to give him if desired a note of the cause and the witnesses that are to be made use of where there is no formal complaint there is no need of accusers or informers but the party cited is peremptorily to answer the questions put to him by the court but then if he be acquitted the court whether he requires it or not should censure the informers for calumny or impudence the defender should have a list of the names of the witnesses some time before or at his appearance these ought also to have timely notice that they may appear and give their evidence if they do not appear after the third summons they may be proceeded against as contumacious and application may be made to the civil magistrate to oblige them to appear what the party can object in his own vindication is to be discussed before the witnesses can be judicially examined if the court thinks his objections just the witnesses are to be cast an informer may be a witness where he does not formally complain for his own interest or where there are no presumptions of malice in the accusation witnesses even where there is no relevant objection must purge themselves of malice bribes good deed done or to be done and partial counsel witnesses are to be sworn and examined before the moderator and the person accused and if he appears the accused may desire to have the witnesses crossexamined when they have given in all their evidence before the proof is made the accused may offer grounds of exculpation i e bring witnesses to prove his innocence which if he insists upon it must be allowed if the exculpation be fully proved e g if he can prove an alibi he must be acquitted but there is no room for exculpation after depositions are once taken witnesses must subscribe all their depositions if they can write or if they cannot the moderator must subscribe it for them depositions being taken the parties withdraw and the matter is calmly debated by the presbytery fugitives whilst process is depending must first be cited to appear from the pulpits of their respective parishes then from the pulpit of every parish in the presbytery if they do not at last appear they are to be declared fugitives from church discipline and that declaration must be intimated in all the bounds of the presbytery and process is to be stopped till notice can begot of those persons in case of drunkenness disobedience to parents sabbathbreaking swearing cursing scolding fighting lying cheating or stealing the persons guilty are ordinarily admonished in private only for the first offense for the second offense rebuked by the session and on promise of amendment there they are to stop if no amendment follows the kirksession should proceed to the sentence of lesser excommunication under which the person is to lie till amendment appears if the guilty person neglects to take the sentence off and relapses into the vices for which he is censured it may be construed into such a degree of contumacy as may merit the greater excommunication which may be inflicted or not as shall be judged convenient other crimes that come before the ecclesiastical judicatories are cases of uncleanness where there is no child  of a married womans being with child whose husband has been absent longer than the usual time of her going with child  of an unmarried woman being with child who should be pronounced contumacious if she will not discover the father  of the delated father of the child  of incest  adultery  relapse in fornication  murder  atheism  idolatry  witchcraft  maiming  heresy  error publicly vented  schism etc etc these acts abovementioned settle the manner of appeal to the presbytery etc the manner of treating complaints against ministers etc etc which some of my readers would think tedious and for which the more curious had better consult the acts themselves or vide collections and observations methodized concerning the worship discipline and government of the church of scotland by walter stuart  to edinburgh   0    in ordinary cases the lesser excommunication only is inslicted which is done after much deliberation and tenderness to the criminal and with great solemnity the people are exhorted not to hold unnecessarycommunion with him the greater excommunication the church only inflicts upon the most obstinate offenders it is the expulsion of the offender from the communion of the faithful a debarring him from all the privileges of church membership and in the words of the apostle a delivery of him over to satan however excommunication dissolves no civil or natural rights nor does it exempt from the duties belonging to them  if when all this is done it be found ineffectual for the purposes intended the civil magistrate should be desired to use his coercive power to suppress all such offenses and to vindicate the discipline of the church from contempt  the end of churchcensure being the repentance of the sinner if he shows real signs of godly sorrow and if upon application to the presbytery first made they give a warrant for his absolution he is to be brought before the congregation and there confess his sin and express his sorrow for it this is to be repeated as often as the presbytery and kirksession shall judge convenient when the congregation is thus satisfied of his repentance the minister is in a prayer with the congregation to desire our lord jesus christ who has instituted the ordinance of excommunication i e of binding and loosing the sins of men upon earth with a promise of ratifying above the rightful sentence that shall be passed here below to accept of this mans repentance to forgive his former disobedience and to assist him with his spirit that he may never again relapse into the like offenses and then prayer being ended he pronounces the sentence of absolution by which he wholly takes off the former sentence and receives him into the communion of the church and the free use of all the ordinances of christ sentence being passed the minister exhorts him as a brother to perseverance in his godly resolution the elders embrace him and the congregation thence forward communicate with him as a member of their own body and wherever the sentence of excommunication has been published the sentence of absolution is also expressly intimated  in all matters of church discipline there never is one penny of fee or reward required or taken chamberlaynes present state edit          citations examinations censures and absolutions are never expensive in the least to the delinquent nor have any members of any ecclesiastical judicatory in scotland any gain thereby nor is there any civil penalty incurred by being censured by the church all the severe laws against excommunicated persons formerly in force having been repealed since the happy revolution  at burials of the dead the church of scotland uses neither funeral sermons or any public prayers they are performed without any ceremony of words only the bodies are decently attended to the graves by all that please to go of which they have notice at edinbugh particularly by ringing of a handbell through the street by the crier who says all brethren and sisters i let you to wot that there is a brother  or sister  departed at the pleasure of almighty god etc and then gives notice when he or she is to be interred when the corpse is silently laid in the grave the funeral rites are ended and every one retires to their several habitations  for the advancement of religion in scotland the society for propagating christian knowledge was erected by letterspatent from queen anne granting them full power to receive subscriptions mortifications donations legacies sums of money lands goods and gear and therewith to erect and maintain schools to teach to read especially the holy scriptures and other good and pious books and also to teach writing and arithmetic and such like degrees of knowledge in the highlands islands and remote corners of scotland appointing their meetings etc etc these letterspatent bear date may      0  which year the general assembly passed an act to encourage the design of erecting charityschools both these institutions have met with deserved success in every parish there is a charityschool whose master has a salary from the public and the scholars allow them some small matter quarterly in countryschools they teach writing arithmetic and reading english and in some latin in the royal burghs they teach latin and greek and have tolerable salaries besides that each scholar gives   s or   s   d a quarter and in these schools they teach nothing else having english and writing schools besides in all places where they have grammar schools in countryparishes the schoolmaster is usually precentor and kirksession clerk which brings him in some advantage for he receives   s and sometimes   s and   d for asking banns of marriage   d for registering a child that is christened and  d for a certificate for any person that removes out of the parish the schoolmasters are obliged to take the oath of allegiance to subscribe the confession of faith and must submit to a trial from the presbytery of the bounds  for a continual supply of ministers in the church of scotland it was ordained by the general assembly in      that a number of pious youths of good expectations and approved ability should be chosen and sent bursars or exhibitioners to the universities by the several presbyteries of scotland these bursars are to be allowed for their maintenance  00 l scots per annum at least to be taken out of the kirkpenalties and to be collected by the moderator of each presbytery by equal divided portions the one half to be brought in at the wintersynod and given to the bursars and the other half at the summersynod to be sent to them the bursar not to continue at the university above four years and when any are removed by death or called to a particular charge others are to succeed in their room all bursars of theology are obliged to bring sufficient testimonies from the universities where they are bred of their proficiency and good behavior and be also ready to give proof of their labors at the several synods if it shall be required and if they are found deficient their exhibitions are taken away and given to others  besides bursars from the presbyteries there are others maintained by noblemen and gentlemen ministers and others who have left great sums of money for that end the interest whereof is applied to maintain poor students and by a gift of king william iii diverse students have considerable allowances to study beyond seas which gift is charged upon the revenues of the late bishops  in the year      the city of edinburgh founded their high school by warrant and encouragement from king james vi whence it took the name of the kings school it has a master four ushers a writing master and a janitor all which have fixed competent salaries except the writing master whose benefit is casual it has a public library erected by the towncouncil in      principally consisting of the latin and greek classics  the universities of scotland are four st andrews glasgow aberdeen and edinburgh besides the marischal college at aberdeen  faith and doctrines of the church of scotland as i have already said so much of calvin and his principles of religion see vol ii p              of this work  and so many particulars of the faith and doctrines of the church of scotland have occurred in the foregoing pages it will be sufficient to give a summary of the doctrines of that church in as few words as possibly can be employed to that purpose  they believe that the old and new testament is the only rule of faith and practice  that the father son and holy ghost three persons are one god the same in substance equal in power and glory  that god has foreordained all that shall come to pass  the doctrine of original sin or that all mankind by the fall of their first parents lost communion with god are under his wrath and curse and so made liable to all the miseries in this life to death itself and to the pains of hell for ever assemblys catechism   the doctrine of election that god out of his mere good pleasure from all eternity elected some to everlasting life did enter into a covenant of grace to deliver them out of sin and misery and to bring them into an estate of salvation by a redeemer  that the only redeemer of gods elect is jesus christ who being the eternal son of god became man and so was and continues to be god and man in two distinct natures and one person  that effectual calling is the work of gods spirit  that we are justified by gods free grace only for the righteousness of christ imputed to us and received by faith alone  that the souls of believers are at their death made perfect in holiness and do immediately pass into glory and their bodies still being united to christ do rest in their graves till the resurrection  that every sin deserves gods wrath and curse both in this life and that which is to come to escape which wrath and curse due to us for sin god requires of us faith in jesus christ which faith is a saving grace whereby we receive and rest upon him alone for salvation as he is offered to us in the gospel  that repentance is a saving grace whereby a sinner out of a true sense of his sin and apprehension of the mercy of god in christ does with grief and hatred of his sin turn from it unto god with full purpose of and endeavor after a new obedience  that the outward and ordinary means whereby christ communicates to us the benefits of redemption are his ordinances especially the word sacraments and prayer all which are made effectual to the elect for salvation  that the spirit of god makes the reading but especially the preaching of the word an effectual means of convincing and converting sinners and of building them up in holiness and comfort through faith unto salvation  that the word must be attended unto with diligence preparation and prayer received with faith and love laid up in our hearts and practiced in our lives to make it effectual to salvation  that the sacraments become effectual means of salvation not from any virtue in them or in him that does administer them but only by the blessing of christ and the working of the spirit in them that by faith receive them  that the sacrament is an holy ordinance instituted by christ wherein by sensible signs christ and the benefits of the new covenant are represented sealed and applied to believers  that the sacraments of the new testament are baptism and the lords supper  that baptism is a sacrament wherein the washing with water in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost does signify and seal our ingrafting into christ and partaking of the benefits of the covenant of grace and our engagement to be the lords  that baptism is to be administered to such only as profess their faith in christ and obedience to him but the infants of such as are members of the visible church are to be baptized  that the lords supper is a sacrament wherein by giving and receiving bread and wine according to christs appointment his death is showed forth and the worthy receivers are not after a corporal and carnal manner but by faith made partakers of his body and blood with all his benefits to their spiritual nourishment and growth in grace  that it is required of them that would worthily partake of the lords supper that they examine themselves of their knowledge to discern the lords body of their faith to feed upon him of their repentance love and new obedience lest coming unworthily they eat and drink judgment to themselves that prayer is an offering up of our desires to god for things agreeable to his will in the name of christ with confession of our sins and thankful acknowledgment of his mercy  that the special rule of direction for prayer is the lords prayer  i have purposely gathered these heads of belief and doctrine from the assemblys shorter catechism as since revised by a minister of the gospel knowing it to be most agreeable to the sentiments of the moderate members of the church of scotland two catechisms were formed out of the westminster confession of faith one larger for the service of a public exposition in the pulpit according to the custom of foreign churches the other smaller in both which the articles relating to church discipline are omitted the smaller is a very accurate summary of the confession of faith which contains the established doctrine of the kirk  to those who would see the sentiments of the more rigid kirkmen if the foregoing histories are not sufficient i would recommend a perusal of the confession of    0 or the abovementioned confession with the national covenant of      the solemn league and covenant and the solemn acknowledgment of public sins and breaches of the covenant the republication of which would not be consistent with the necessary brevity of my design  the history of the presbyterians this denomination of protestant dissenters have been called by different names at different periods of time in their first attempts for a further reformation of the church they were by way of reproach termed puritans a name derived from the cathari or puritani of the third century after christ the ungenerous and cruel persecutions they suffered for conscience sake in the reigns of elizabeth james i and charles i will ever reflect disgrace upon the memory of those princes  i might say that wickliffe the first english reformer maintained many of those points by which the puritans were afterward distinguished or trace them from the reign of edward vi when many excellent divines were endeavoring a further reformation from the ceremonies and fopperies of the church of rome particularly with regard to the popish vestments but i shall observe that the reformed exiles who were driven to franckfort to avoid the cruelties of mary i and who being outed from thence by those reformers who stickled for king edwards liturgy in      which the others scrupled the use of and who afterward set up congregations at basil and geneva and there followed the geneva discipline were first called puritans as their opponents obtained the name of conformists the history of the church of england foregoing has particularly recited their various sufferings for their opposition to the habits see vol iii of this work p     and seq  and their scruples in regard to the act of uniformity with their separation from the church thereon but they had other objections against the hierarchy besides those for which they were deprived which they labored incessantly throughout the reign of elizabeth to remove neals history of the puritans vol i p     they complained of the bishops affecting to be thought a superior order to presbyters and claiming the sole right of ordination and the use of the keys they disliked the temporal dignities and lordships annexed to their offices and their engaging in secular employments and trusts etc as tending to exalt them too much above their brethren and not so agreeable to their characters as ministers of christ nor consistent with the due discharge of their spiritual function  they excepted to the titles and offices of archdeacons deans chapters and other officials belonging to cathedrals as having no foundation in scripture or primitive antiquity but intrenching upon the privileges of the presbyters of the several dioceses they complained of the exorbitant power and jurisdiction of the bishops and their chancellors in their spiritual courts as derived from the canon law of the pope and not from the word of god or the statute law of the land of their fining imprisoning depriving and putting men to excessive charges for small offenses and that the highest censures such as excommunication and absolution were in the hands of laymen and not in the spiritual officers of the church  they lamented the want of a godly discipline and were uneasy at the promiscuous and general access of all persons to the lords table the church being described in her articles as a congregation of faithful persons they thought it necessary that a power should be lodged somewhere to inquire into the qualifications of such as desired to be of her communion  though they did not dispute the lawfulness of set forms of prayer provided a due liberty was allowed for prayers of their own composure before and after sermon yet they disliked some things in the public liturgy established by law as the frequent repetition of the lords prayer the responses some passages in the offices of marriage burial etc such as with my body i thee worship i sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life to be pronounced over the worst of men if not excommunicated etc  they disliked the reading of the apocryphal books in the churches whilst some parts of the canonical books were omitted dumb ministers pluralists and nonresidents and that presentations to benefices were in the hands of the queen bishops or some lay patron which ought to arise from the election of the people  they disapproved of the approbation of sundry of the church festivals or holidays as having no foundation in scripture or primitive antiquity such as saints days fasting on friday etc in lent etc  they disallowed of the cathedral mode of worship of singing their prayers and of the antiphone o chanting of the psalms by turns trumpets organs etc which were not in use in the church for above   00 years after christ  they scrupled conformity to certain rites and ceremonies which were injoined by the rubric or the queens injunctions viz to the sign of the cross in baptism baptism by midwives the manner of churching women the use of godfathers and godmothers to the exclusion of the parents from being sureties for the education of their own children etc etc the custom of confirming children as soon as they could repeat the lords prayer and catechism by which they had a right to come to the sacrament without any other qualification this might be done by children of five or six years old kneeling at the sacrament of the lords supper bowing to the name of jesus the ring in marriage to the wearing of the surplice and other vestments to be used in divine service there was no difference in points of doctrine so that one article more and my readers have the chief heads of controversy between the church of england and the protestant dissenters at this time viz the natural right that every man has to judge for himself and make profession of that religion he apprehends most agreeable to truth as far as it does not affect the peace and safety of the government he lives under without being determined by the prejudices of education the laws of the civil magistrate or the decrees of councils churches or synods  in the maintenance of their conscientious separation they seemed inspired with all the courage and fortitude of the primitive confessors and martyrs in point of argument they had much the better of their adversaries but had no protection against the pains penalties imprisonments and fines imposed by the governing powers under which however they in general behaved with christian meekness and unexampled patience  the first presbyterian church in england was erected at wandsworth a village near london and on the  0th of november      eleven elders were chosen and their offices described in a register entitled the order of wandsworth other churches notwithstanding proclamations for uniformity etc were soon erected in other counties though with the utmost privacy and secresy under james the firsts persecution numbers of puritan ministers and others left the kingdom and retired to amsterdam rotterdam the hague leyden utrecht etc etc and erected churches in those places after the presbyterian model those churches were maintained by the states according to treaty with queen elizabeth as the french and dutch churches were in england  the puritans were far from finding any relaxation of the severities exercised against them in the reign of the unfortunate charles i who following the violent advice of archbishop laud reduced them to the necessity of quitting the kingdom in still greater numbers by his espousing arminianism and opposing the old calvinistical doctrines arminianism and popery may be said to have been prevalent in his court but were warmly opposed by the calvinists laud introduced popish ornaments into the churches turned the communiontables into altars punishing those that opposed him with the utmost severity and with a total disregard to the laws of the land the opposers to these and other innovations were styled doctrinal puritans and the patronisers doctrinal papists indeed it seemed to be lauds favorite scheme to bring about a union of the churches of england and rome to which he sacrificed the interests of the kingdom of his master and finally his own life by his own arbitrary will he made many alterations in the book of common prayer by which he rendered it still more exceptionable to the puritans numbers of worthy clergymen were deprived and suffered the utmost rigours for not reading and enforcing the declaration for the allowance of revels maygames etc etc on the sabbath day and in short the puritan divines and others on these accounts underwent as cruel a persecution as could be carried on by an inquisition if some of these conscientious people were too strict and precise in their opposition they could not be much blamed as there seemed such a visible design to defeat the blessed effects of the reformation by countenancing and adopting all the ceremonies and fopperies of the romish church these persecutions occasioned the settlement of the colonies of new england where many learned and pious ministers eminent merchants and some thousands of families transported themselves to avoid the rage of their enemies heylin observes the severe pressing of the ceremonies made the people in many trading towns tremble at a visitation but when they found their striving in vain and that they had lost the comfort of their lecturers these lecturers were chiefly puritans who not being satisfied with a full conformity so as to take upon them a cure of souls only preached in the afternoon being chosen and maintained by the people they were strict calvinists warm and affectionate preachers and distinguished themselves by a religious observation of the lords day by a bold opposition to popery and the new ceremonies and by an uncommon severity of life the king by lauds procurement laid them under such difficulties that they were soon silenced such as that the afternoonservice be turned into catechizing that every lecturer read divine service before lecture in his surplice and hood that they preach in gowns and not in cloaks that no lecturer be admitted that is not ready and willing to take upon him a living with a cure of souls etc etc etc and such as preached against arminianism or the ceremonies were suspended  who were turned out for not reading the second service at the communion table in their hoods and surplices and for using other prayers besides that of the fiftyfifth canon it was no hard matter for those ministers to persuade them to transport themselves into foreign parts the sun said they shines as comfortably in other places and the sun of righteousness much brighter it is better to go and dwell in goshen find it where we can than tarry in the midst of such egyptian bondage as is among us the sinful corruptions of the church are now grown so general that there is no place free from the contagion therefore go out of her my people and be not partaker of her sins  the body of the puritans were however not now presbyterians in the reigns of elizabeth and james i they were for the most part of that opinion though even then there were many episcopalians among them but from the time that arminianism prevailed in the church and the whole body of calvinists were to be distinguished by the name of doctrinal puritans both parties seemed to unite in a moderate episcopacy for there was little or no mention of the old book of discipline for twenty years before the beginning of the civil war all the controversy being upon points of calvinism upon a reduction of the exorbitant power of the bishops and upon innovations as they were called and ceremonies there were few either among the clergy or laity that had a zeal for presbytery or desired any more than to be rid of their oppressions  many of the ceremonies and innovations complained of by the puritans were removed by the long parliament in      and lectures again established they voted away the hierarchy of the church of england but still at the beginning of the civil war no other discipline was erected in its room nor as mr neale observes was the name style and dignity of archbishops and bishops taken away by ordinance of parliament till september        i e till the war was over and the king their prisoner in this interval there was properly no established form of church government the clergy being permitted to read more or less of the liturgy as they pleased and to govern their parishes according to their discretion the vestments were left indifferent some wearing them and others in imitation of the foreign protestants making use of a cloak in the place of that profaneness and contempt of religion visible before the civil war all orders of men in the city army and country became devout and pious the generality of those people baxters life p       etc  throughout out england who went by the name of puritans precisians presbyterians who followed sermons prayed in their families read books of devotion and were strict observers of the sabbath being avowed enemies to swearing drunkenness and all kinds of profaneness adhered to the parliament  of the clergy those who were of the sentiments of calvin who were constant preachers of the word of god themselves and encouragers of it in others who were zealous against popery and wished for a reformation of the discipline of the church were on the parliaments side among those were some of the elder clergy who were preferred before the rise of archbishop laud all the deprived and silenced ministers with the whole body of lecturers and warm popular preachers both in town and country these drew after them great numbers of the more serious and devout people who were not capable of judging between the king and parliament but followed their spiritual guides from a veneration they had for their integrity and piety no wonder with such instruments the parliament did such great things for even the sober men who were against the parliament used to say the king had the better cause but the parliament had the better men  on june         both houses of parliament jointly published an ordinance for the calling an assembly of divines for settling the government and liturgy of the church of england to meet july   in henry viis chapel in westminster abbey hence called the westminster assembly this famous assembly drew up the well known confession of faith a larger and shorter catechism and a form of church government after the presbyterian mode being principally urged thereto by the low state of the parliament and the indispensible necessity there was for the assistance of the scots whose commissioners were sent to join with them as observed p  0 before going they admitted of the solemn league and covenant our commissioners as burnet observes pressed for a civil league but the scots would have a religious one to which the english were obliged to yield but took care at the same time to leave a door open for the latitude of interpretation the english in foreign parts were not exempted from this test december  0      it was ordered by the lords and commons that no person should be capable of being elected a common councilman of the city of london or so much as have a voice in such elections who has not taken the covenant january         it was ordered by the commons that the solemn league and covenant be upon every day of fasting and public humiliation publicly read in every church and congregation within the kingdom and every congregation is obliged to have one fairly printed in a large letter in a table fitted to be hung up in a public place of the church or congregation to be read by the people all young ministers were required to take the covenant at their ordination none of the laity were continued in any office of trust civil or military who refused it thus the very persons who had opposed tests and subscriptions under episcopacy now were forward to impose them in the severest manner upon their fellow subjects and fellow christians indeed the assembly though composed in general of men of learning and excellent divines yet had a persecuting zeal and hurt themselves by running into heats upon the divine right of presbyterian government which lost them together with their enmity to toleration the hearts and support of the parliament and their best friends the episcopal party had no concern in the government of the church from the time of the taking the covenant to the restoration though the hierarchy was not yet set aside by an ordinance of parliament there were no more ecclesiastical courts no wearing the habits no regard paid to the canons or ceremonies nor even to the common prayer itself whilst the assembly of divines sat all churchbusiness went through their hands the parishes chose their ministers the assembly examined and approved and the parliament confirmed them in their benefices without any regard to the archbishop or his vicar in the distant counties the ministers were put in by the parliament generals as appears by an ordinance of february         giving authority to lord fairfax to supply the churches in the north the preamble to which recites that the houses being credibly informed that many ministers in the county of york were not only of a scandalous life but having left their churches and cures had withdrawn themselves wilfully from the same and joined such forces as had been raised against the parliament and assisted them with men money horses and arms therefore it is ordained that lord fairfax be authorized to fill up their places with such learned and godly divines as he shall think fit with advice of the assembly in      the universities were purged and many of the officers deprived with above  00 graduates and scholars whose places were supplied by the assembly of divines principally with calvinist ministers etc etc and the livings from which the hierarchical clergy were ejected were also supplied by presbyterian divines so that presbytery was now the reigning religion and it must be confessed the presbyterians were as determined against toleration as ever the church of england had lately been but it must be said they brought religion to be the reigning fashion the lords day was strictly observed all profaneness and immorality were discouraged and the care and pains of the new governors of the church was abundantly visible in the lives and behavior of all ranks of people throughout the kingdom  after many and long debates in the westminster assembly and the parliament on the divine right of presbytery the power of the keys etc the presbyterian form of church government became the national establishment in      by way of probation as far as an ordinance of parliament could make it for the preamble sets forth that if upon trial it was not found acceptable it should be reversed or amended that the two houses found it very difficult to make the new settlement agree with the laws and government of the kingdom that therefore it could not be expected that a present rule in every particular should be settled at once but that there will be need of supplements and additions and perhaps alterations as experience shall bring to light the necessity thereof  the parliament apprehended neales puritans vol iii p     they had now established the fundamentals of the presbyterian discipline though it proved not to the satisfaction of any one party of christians so hard it is to make a good settlement when men dig up old foundations all at once the presbyterian government was as narrow as the prelatical and as it did not allow a liberty of conscience but claimed a civil as well as ecclesiastical authority over mens persons and properties was equally if not more insufferable  the settling presbytery bishop kennet was supported by the fear and love of the scots army and when these were gone home it was better managed by the english army who were for independency and a better principle of toleration but as things stood nobody was pleased the episcopalians and independants were excluded and because the parliament would not give the several presbyteries an absolute power over their communicants but reserved the last appeal to themselves neither the scots nor english presbyterians would accept of the ordinance  the assembly petitioned the houses of parliament asserting the divine right of the presbyterian government and complaining of a clause in the late ordinance which established an appeal from the censures of the church to a committee of parliament hereupon they voted the assembly guilty of a praemunire and whereas they insisted so peremptorily on the jus divinum of the presbyterian government the committee of parliament drew up certain queries which they sent to the assembly by three of their members and desired they would resolve to their satisfaction the three members also set before them their rash and imprudent conduct and showed wherein they had exceeded their province which was to advise the houses in such points as they should lay before them but not to dictate to those to whom they owed their being an assembly the assembly terrified at what they heard appointed a solemn fast and the next year      the independants having left them and the erastians dividing them in the committee appointed to consider the questions and entering their dissent when the answer was laid before them it was not called the answer of the committee but of some brethren of the committee and when the question was put the erastians withdrew from the assembly and left the high presbyterians to themselves who agreed with but one dissenting voice that jesus christ as king of the church has himself appointed a church government distinct from the civil magistrate after more squabblings with the parliament the presbyterian ministers complied to put the presbyterial government in practice according to the present establishment with a reserve of certain considerations and cautions which they drew up  hereupon the kingdom instead of so many dioceses was divided into a certain number of provinces made up of representatives from the several classes within their boundaries every parish had a congregational or parochial presbytery for the affairs of the parish the parochial presbyteries were combined into classes these chose representatives for the provincial assemblies as the provincial did for the national thus the presbyterian church government began to rise and appear in its proper form but new obstructions being raised by the ministers to the choice of representatives the provincial assembly of london did not meet till the year      nor did it ever obtain but in london and lancashire the parliament never came heartily into it however the presbyterian ministers had their voluntary associations for church affairs in most counties though without any authoritative jurisdiction  it should have been observed that the presbyterians had refused to come to a toleration of their brethren the independants in      after much altercation and many papers had passed relative thereto in a committee of accommodation as it was styled consisting of a committee of lords and commons appointed to treat with the scots commissioners and the committee of divines to endeavor a union if possible or to find out how far tender consciences who cannot in all things submit to the same rule may be borne with according to the word of god and consistent with the public peace little did the presbyterian divines think says neale that in less than twenty years all their artillery would be turned against themselves that they should be excluded the establishment by an act of prelatical uniformity that they should be reduced to the necessity of pleading for that indulgence which they now denied their brethren and think it their duty to gather churches for separate worship out of others which they allowed to be true ones if the leading presbyterians in the assembly and city had come to a temper with the independants on the foot of a limited toleration they had in all likelihood prevented the disputes between the army and parliament which were the ruin of both they might then have saved the constitution and made their own terms with the king who was now their prisoner but they were enchanted with the beauties of covenant uniformity and the divine right of their presbytery which after all the parliament would not admit in its full extent  from the year      to the death of charles i matters with regard to the presbyterians continued much upon the same footing yet though they filled most of the livings and had the city and great part of the parliament at their devotion they met with many mortifications from the independants and army who were mostly of that sect but principally for their rigid and intolerant spirit which disgusted all the other sects they had done all they could while the army was marched against the scots in      to bring about a peace with the king but the unhappy prince obstinately refused to comply with their terms nor would the presbyterians relax in them so that the army had an opportunity given them to break all their measures  it is my opinion after carefully consulting every account pro and con that the presbyterians are cleared from any share in the guilt of putting the king to death nay the london ministers published a serious and faithful representation against doing any violence to the person of the king addressed to the general and his council of officers jan         to wipe away the calumnies thrown out against them on that account they published a paper also entitled a vindication of the london ministers from the unjust aspersions cast upon their former actings for the parliament as if they had promoted the bringing the king to capital punishment in this vindication after declaring over again their dislike of the proceedings against the king they conclude in words to this effect therefore according to our covenant we do in the name of the great god warn and exhort all that belong to our respective charges or to whom we have administered the said covenant to abide by their vow and not to suffer themselves to be persuaded to subscribe the the design of this paper was to change the government into a kind of a commonwealth without a king and house of lords it was tendered to the nation by the officers of the army it provided amongst other matters for a toleration agreement of the people which is subversive of the present constitution and makes way for the toleration of all heresies and blasphemies and will effectually divide the two kingdoms of england and scotland we earnestly beseech them to mourn for the sins of the parliament and city and for the miscarriages of the king himself in his government which have cast him down from his excellency into an horrid pit of misery almost beyond example and to pray that god would give him effectual repentance and to sanctify the bitter cup of divine displeasure which divine providence has put into his hands and that god would restrain the violence of men that they may not dare to draw upon themselves and the kingdom the blood of their sovereign in short they showed themselves in the second civil war almost unanimous for accommodating matters with the king but as before observed the stiffness of both parties rendered their designs abortive and brought on a catastrophe to which they were utterly averse and used every means in their power to prevent  that the reader may see the principles of the presbyterians of those days i shall first make an extract from a testimony of the truth of jesus christ and to our solemn league and covenant as also against the errors heresies and blasphemies of these times and the toleration of them to which is added a catalogue of the said errors etc published by the london clergy and dated from sion college dec         it was subscribed by    of the most eminent pastors in london    of whom were of the assembly of divines to which    of the ministers of gloucestershire    of lancashire    of devonshire and    of somersetshire subscribed their concurrence touching errors and heresies they declare their detestation and abhorrence of the following inter alia   that the holy scriptures are not of divine authority and the only rule of faith   that god has a bodily shape that god is the name of a person and that god is the author of sin having a greater hand in it than men themselves   that there is not a trinity of persons in the godhead that the son is not coequal with the father and that the holy ghost is only a ministering spirit   that god has not elected some to salvation from eternity and rejected or reprobated others and that no man shall perish in hell for adams sin   that christ died for the sins of all mankind that the benefits of his death were intended for all and that natural men may do such things as whereunto god has by way of promise annexed grace and acceptance   that man has a free will and power in himself to repent to believe to obey the gospel and to do every thing that god requires to salvation   that faith is not a supernatural grace and that faithful actions are the only things by which a man is justified   that the moral law is not the rule of life that believers are as clean from sin as christ himself that such have no occasion to pray for pardon for sin that god sees no sin in his people nor does he ever chastise them for it   that there is no church nor sacraments nor sabbath the opinion of the seekers now called quakers  0 that the children of believers ought not to be baptized nor baptism continued amongst christians that the meaning of the third commandment is thou shall not forswear thyself    that persons of the next kindred may marry and that indisposition unfitness or contrariety of mind arising from natural causes are a just reason of divorce    that the soul of man is mortal that it sleeps with the body and that there is neither heaven or hell till the day of judgment they also witnessed against the error of toleration patronizing and promoting all other errors heresies and blasphemies whatsoever under the grossly abused notion of liberty of conscience herein they complain as a very great grievance that men should not have liberty to worship god in the way and manner as shall appear to them most agreeable to the word of god and no man be punished or discountenanced by authority for the same and that an enforced uniformity of religion throughout a nation or state confounds the civil and religious and denies the very principles of christianity and civility they then bear their testimony to the covenant and to the divine right of presbytery they lament the imperfect settlement of their discipline by the parliament and lay the foundation of all their calamities in the countenancing a public and general toleration and conclude upon all these considerations we the ministers of jesus christ do hereby testify to our flocks to all the kingdom and to the reformed world our great dislike of prelacy erastianism brownism and independency and our utter abhorrence of antiscripturism popery ariamsm socinianism arminianism antinomianism anabaptism libertinism and familism and that we detest the forementioned toleration so much pursued and endeavored in this kingdom accounting it unlawful and pernicious  secondly an extract from the ordinance against blasphemy and heresy by the parliament to which when the army marched from london toward scotland the deprived presbyterian members had returned and having the superiority took occasion to discover their principles and spirit it will hardly be credited that persons who had themselves experienced all the horrors of persecution and penal statutes should display so persecuting so unchristian a disposition the ordinance was dated may        and ordains that all persons who shall willingly maintain publish or defend by preaching or writing the following heresies with obstinacy shall upon complaint or proof by the oaths of two witnesses before two justices of the peace or confession of the party be committed to prison without bail or mainprize till the next jaildelivery and in case the indictment shall then be found and the party upon his trial shall not abjure the said error and his defense and maintenance of the same he shall suffer the pains of death as in case of felony without benefit of clergy and if he recant or abjure he shall remain in prison till he find sureties that he will not maintain the said heresies or errors any more but if he relapse and is convicted a second time he shall suffer death as before the heresies are as follow   that there is no god   that god is not omnipresent omniscient almighty eternal and perfectly holy   that the father is not god that the son is not god that the holy ghost is not god or that these three are not one eternal god or that christ is not god equal with the father   the denial of the manhood of christ or that the godhead or manhood are distinct natures or that the humanity of christ is pure and unspotted of all sin   the maintaining that christ did not die nor rise again nor ascend into heaven bodily   the denying that the death of christ is meritorious on the behalf of believers or that jesus christ is the son of god   the denying that the holy scriptures of the old and new testament are the word of god   the denying of the resurrection of the dead and a future judgment some other errors of less demerit are then mentioned as   that all men shall be saved   that man by nature has free will to turn to god   that god may be worshipped in or by pictures or images   that the soul dies with the body or after death goes neither to heaven or hell but to purgatory   that the soul of man sleeps when the body is dead   that the revelations or workings of the spirit are a rule of faith and christian life though diverse from or contrary to the written word of god   that man is bound to believe no more than by his reason he can comprehend   that the moral law contained in the ten commandments is no rule of christian life   that a believer need not repent or pray for pardon of sin  0 that the two sacraments of baptism and the lords supper are not ordinances commanded by the word of god    that the baptism of infants is unlawful and void and that such persons ought to be baptized again    that the observation of the lords day as injoined by the ordinances and laws of the realm is not according or is contrary to the word of god    that it is not lawful to join in public or family prayer or to teach children to pray    that the churches presbyterian of england are no true churches nor their ministers and ordinances true ministers and ordinances or that the church government by presbyters is antichristian or unlawful    that magistracy or the power of the civil magistrate by law established in england is unlawful    that all use of arms though for the public defense and be the cause never so just is unlawful these heresies and errors were taken from the speeches and writings of the papists arminians antinomians arians papists quakers etc of those times whosoever shall maintain or defend these last errors shall upon application etc and conviction by the oath of two witnesses or by his own confession etc be ordered to renounce his said error or errors in the public congregation of the parish from whence the complaint comes or where the offense was committed and in case of refusal he shall be committed to prison till he find sureties that he shall not publish or maintain the said errors any more  how different the principles of the presbyterians of the present times the reader will presently see the presbyterians under the various usurpations till the restoration of charles ii acted in concert with the scots for restoring the king upon the foot of the covenant several of their ministers carried on a correspondence privately with the chiefs of that nation and instead of taking the engagement to the present powers called them usurpers and declined praying for them in their churches they also declared against a general toleration which the army and parliament contended for and to widen the breach the latter took away all the penal statutes for religion sept  0    0 by an ordinance  while the scots were raising forces for the kings service a private correspondence was carried on between the presbyterians in england and the scots large sums of money were collected privately to forward an expedition into england but the commonwealth soon defeated their designs several ministers and others were taken into custody and mr love one of them and mr gibbons were tried and executed  under oliver cromwells usurpation though their discipline was disarmed of its coercive power he still left them all that was sufficient for religious purposes they had their monthly or quarterly classical presbyteries in every county for the ordination of ministers by imposition of hands according to the directory in the distant counties they entered into friendly associations for brotherly counsel and advice and were still retained in the public ministry but as the protector was for the liberty of conscience their church censures were now of no force and the churches were indiscriminately bestowed on ministers of the independants and other persuasions  upon richard cromwells resigning the protectorate the presbyterians seeing no probability of restoring the covenant or coming into power by the rump parliament which was principally made up of enthusiasts and declared enemies to monarchy they entered into a sort of confederacy with the royalists to restore the king and the old constitution and several of their ministers appeared in the insurrection of sir george booth a presbyterian in cheshire whose party however was defeated by general lambert  general monk having restored the secluded members of      to their seats in the house who were of the presbyterian party they then carried all before them and the cityministers petitioned the parliament to take a more effectual course against papists to prohibit the quakers opening their shops on the sabbath day and that the public ministers may not be disturbed in their public services they also besought them to establish the assemblys confession directory and catechisms etc etc all or most of these things the house complied with and they ordered the solemn league and covevant to be reprinted and set up in every church in england and read publicly by the minister once every year the presbytery was restored to all its powers and the ministers of that persuasion were put in full possession of all the livings in england by their credulity and the artifices of general monk they were made to believe that presbytery was to be the established government of the church of england also under king charles ii in whose restoration they heartily concurred and in fact brought it about which they were capable of doing as they were at that time in possession of the whole power of england the council of state the chief officers of the army and navy and the governors of the chief forts and garrisons were theirs and their clergy were in possession not only of the livings but of both universities in short they brought in the king without any stipulation or concession on his part strange infatuation which they soon after had reason to repent for they might be sure that the old constitution must return with the king that diocesan episcopacy was the only legal establishment and that all that had been done in favor of presbytery not having had the royal assent was void in law therefore they and their friends who had not episcopal ordination and induction into their livings must be looked upon as intruders and not legal ministers of the church of england the king to carry on the farce as it was really on his side when the ministers waited upon him in holland gave them such encouraging promises as raised in some of them high expectations when he came to whitehall he made ten of them his chaplains these were doctors reynolds spurstow wallis manton bates and mess calamy ash case baxter and woodbridge  at the instance of the earl of manchester but before the expiration of the year    0 many of the parochial clergy were prosecuted for not using the book of common prayer the justices and others insisting that the laws returned with the king and that they ought not to be dispensed with in the neglect of them the sequestered clergy came out of their hiding places and took possession of their former livings by which some hundreds of the presbyterian clergy were at once dispossessed the two universities were restored to their old discipline and government and the heads of colleges etc etc ejected in      were put in again new creations were made in both universities in favor of any almost who would declare their aversion to presbytery and hearty affection of episcopal government deans and chapters were also again restored and bishops were promoted to the vacant sees and thus the church of england was restored to its former power except only the peerage of the bishops no period of time since the reformation had more of the spirit and appearance of religion nor less open profaneness and impiety than under the late governments perhaps there was a little too much rigor and preciseness in indifferent matters which might be thought running into a contrary extreme but the lusts of men were laid under a very great restraint better laws were never made against vice and never better put in execution the dress the language and conversation of people was sober and virtuous and their manner of housekeeping remarkably frugal there was hardly a single bankruptcy to be heard of in a year the vices of drunkenness fornication profane swearing and every kind of debauchery were banished and out of fashion the clergy were laborious to excess in preaching and praying in catechizing youth and visiting their parishes the magistrates did their duty in suppressing all kinds of games stage plays and abuses in public houses there was not a play acted in england for almost twenty years the lords day was observed with unusual strictness and there were a set of as learned and pious youths in the university as had been known so that if such a reformation of manners had obtained under a legal administration they would have deserved the character of the best of times  but when the legal constitution was restored there came in with it a torrent of all kinds of debauchery and wickedness men set no bounds to their vicious appetites two play houses were erected womenactresses introduced upon the english stage the most lewd and obscene plays were acted nothing was to be seen at court but feasting hard drinking revelling and amorous intrigues which produced the most enormous vices the common people threw off the very profession of virtue and piety the appearance of religion in any one furnished matter of ridicule to the profane mockers of real piety to appear serious to make a conscience of ones words and actions was the way to be avoided as a schismatic a sanatic or a sectarian they who did not applaud the revived ceremonies were marked out for presbyterians and every presbyterian was a rebel the restored persons were notoriously vicious and scandalous such was the general dissoluteness of manners which attended the tide of joy that overflowed the nation upon his majestys restoration neale and to the same effect all other historians   the king and the duke of york were for a general toleration in order to include the papists and the bishops and lord clarendon at their head were against any comprehension for or concessions to the presbyterians the reasons of the bishops angry behavior were their high notions of the episcopal form of government as essentially necessary to the very essence of a christian church the resentments that remained in their breasts against all who had engaged with the long parliament and had been the cause of their sufferings the presbyterians being legally possessed of most of the benefices in church and state it was thought necessary to dispossess them and if there must be a schism rather to have it out of the church than within it for it had been observed that the halfconformity of the puritans before the war had in most cities and corporations occasioned a faction between the main body and the lecturers which latter had endeavored to make themselves popular at the expense of the hierarchy of the church besides the presbyterians had too much credit in the elections of parliament men therefore they resolved says burnet to seek the most effectual means to cast them out of the church  the well meaning presbyterians were therefore striving against the stream and making interest with a set of men who were now laughing in their sleeves at the abject condition to which the folly of their adversaries had reduced them they offered archbishop ushers model of primitive episcopacy as a plan of accommodation that the surplice the cross in baptism and kneeling at the communion should be left indifferent they were content to set aside the assemblys confession and let the articles of the church of england take place with some amendments his majesty desired a number of their ministers who were introduced to him by the earl of manchester to crave his interposition for reconciling the differences of the church to draw up such proposals as they thought meet for an agreement about church government and to set down the most they could yield accordingly the cityministers with some of their country brethren met at sion college and after two or three weeks deliberation agreed upon a paper which together with archbishop ushers reduction of episcopacy they offered to the king with a proper address to this paper the bishops published a reply upon which the presbyterians sent a warm remonstrance to the bishops and a defense of their proposals which concludes thus we perceive your counsels against peace are not likely to be frustrated your desires concerning us are likely to be accomplished you are like to be gratified with our silence and ejection and yet we will believe that blessed are the peacemakers and though we are prevented by you in our pursuits of peace and are never like thus publicly to seek it more yet are we resolved as much as possible to live peaceably with all men  their eyes now began to open and they perceived with regret their credulity in expecting an agreement with the bishops who appeared to be exasperated and determined to bind them over to the old establishment the former severities were already revived and the laws to be put in execution against such as did not make use of the old liturgy many were suspended and turned out of their livings on this account upon application for redress to the king he told them he would put what he thought fit to grant them into the form of a declaration which they should peruse before it was made public a copy was accordingly delivered to them with liberty to make exceptions they petitioned for some further amendments and alterations upon which the king appointed a day to hear what could be said on both sides and came to chancellor hydes house october       0 attended by the dukes of albemarle and ormond the earls of manchester and anglesea and lord hollis for that purpose on the part of the bishops were dr sheldon bishop of london morley of worcester henchman of salisbury cosins of durham gauden of exeter hacket of litchfield and coventry dr barwick dean of st pauls and dr gunning etc on the side of the presbyterians dr reynolds mr calamy dr spurstow mr ash dr manton mr baxter and dr wallis  as the chancellor read over the declaration each party were to make their exceptions and the king to determine the chief debates were on the high powers of the bishops and the necessity of reordination upon hearing the whole the king told them what he thought proper should stand in the declaration and appointed bishops morley and henchman dr reynolds and mr calamy to determine upon proper words and if they disagreed the earl of anglesea and lord hollis were to decide if this declaration did not please all the ministers the greatest number in london and the country were content but as it went upon the plan of diocesan episcopacy which they had covenanted against others were not satisfied some of them ventured upon a second address to the king renewing their requests for archbishop ushers plan etc however the presbyterians about london were so much pleased that they drew up a warm address of thanks to the king which was presented november    upon the terms of this declaration says neale dr reynolds accepted the bishopric of norwich mr baxter was offered the bishopric of hereford but refused it upon other reasons and mr calamy declined that of litchfield and coventry till the declaration passed into a law dr manton having been presented to the living of covent garden by the earl of bedford accepted it upon the declaration and received episcopal institution from the hands of sheldon bishop of london january  0    0  subscriptis prius articulis fidei ecclesiae anglicanae tantum and praestito juramento de allegiant and supremitate and canonica obedientia in omnibus licitis and honestis the doctor was also content that the common prayer book should be read in his church dr bates was offered the deanery of coventry and litchfield dr manton the deanery of rochester and mr bowls that of york but finding how things were going at court after some time they refused   when the parliament read the kings declaration they agreed to wait upon him in a body and return him thanks notwithstanding which the bill to pass into a law was rejected by the house of commons after the first reading this blunted all the expectations of the presbyterian clergy at once for it was now apparent that the court did not design the declaration should be continued but only serve as a temporary expedient to keep them in quiet until the church should be in circumstances to bid them defiance neale   the doctrines of passive obedience and nonresistance were now revived men obnoxious and inveterate to the presbyterians were preferred to bishoprics and were compensated for their late sufferings by the large sums they raised by renewing leases which were almost all expired what the bishops did with their great fines was a pattern to all the lower dignitaries who generally took more care of themselves than of the church the men of service were loaded with many livings and many dignities with this accession of wealth there broke in upon the church a great deal of luxury and high living on pretense of hospitality and with this overset of wealth and pomp that came upon men in the decline of their age they who were now growing into old age became lazy and negligent in all the true concerns of the church burnet   from this time persecution against the presbyterians commenced one mr zach crofton was imprisoned and turned out of his living for writing in favor of the covenant though he had a wife and seven children and had been remarkably zealous for the restoration another mr parsons rector of wem in shropshire was taken from his wife by soldiers for seditious preaching and nonconformity to the ceremonies and fined two hundred pounds with imprisonment till paid spies says mr neale were sent into all the congregations of presbyterians throughout england to observe and report their behavior to the bishops and if a minister lamented the degeneracy of the times or expressed his concern for the ark of god if he preached against perfidiousness or glanced at the vices of the court he was marked for an enemy of the king and government many eminent and loyal presbyterians were sent to prison upon such informations and when they came to their trials the court was guarded with soldiers and their friends not suffered to attend them many were sequestered from their livings and cited into the ecclesiastical courts for not using the surplice and other ceremonies whilst the discipline of the church was under a kind of suspension so eager were the spiritual courts to revive the exercise of their power and so strongly did the tide run against the unhappy presbyterians by the act for restoring the old sequestered clergy some hundreds of the nonconformist ministers were dispossesed of their livings before the act of uniformity was formed here was no distinction between good and bad but if the person had been episcopally ordained and in possession he must be restored though he had been ejected upon the strongest evidence of immorality or scandal the ministry soon after did every thing in their power to throw the odium of plots and conspiracies upon the presbyterians for which many were taken into custody but released afterward without prosecution by these devices they facilitated the passing the penal statutes that were coming upon the carpet they could not consistent with the declaration from breda or with decency attack the presbyterians purely upon account of their religion they were therefore to be accused right or wrong of raising disturbances in the state by the act for the wellgoverning and regulating corporations all nonconformists were turned out of every branch of magistracy at once and could not serve their country even in the meanest offices of a commoncouncil man or a burgess or bailiff of a corporation commissioners appointed hereupon were sent to visit the several corporations who executed their commission so rigorously that every member of them was turned out who was not entirely devoted to the king and church  the savoy conference ended without any good effect and the act of uniformity received the royal assent may         by which the terms of conformity were higher than before the civil wars and the common prayer book rendered more exceptionable by enforcing this act see vol iii of this work p           the calamities of the ejected ministers were very terrible many hundreds of them says baxter with their wives and children had neither house nor bread the people thus left were not able to relieve them nor durst they if they had been able because it would have been called maintenance of schism and faction many of the ministers being afraid to lay down their ministry after they had been ordained to it preached to such as would hear them in fields and private houses till they were apprehended and cast into gaols where many of them perished  the people were no less divided some conformed and others were driven to a greater distance from the church and resolved to abide by their faithful pastors at all events they murmured at the government and called the bishops and conforming clergy cruel persecutors for which and frequenting of the private assemblies of their ministers they were fined and imprisoned till many families left their native country and settled in the plantations  the presbyterian ministers though men of gravity says neale and far advanced in years were rallied in the pulpits under the opprobrious names of schismatics and fanatics they were exposed in the playhouse and insulted by the mob insomuch that they were obliged to lay aside their habits and walk in disguise it is impossible to relate the number of the sufferings both of ministers and people the great trials with hardships upon their persons estates and families by uncomfortable separations dispersions nonsettlements and removes disgraces reproaches imprisonments chargeable journeys expenses in law tedious sicknesses and incurable diseases ending in death great disquietments and frights to the wives and families and their doleful effects upon them  their congregations had enough to do besides a small maintenance to keep them out of prisons or maintain them there though they were as frugal as possible they could hardly live some lived on little more than brown bread and water many had but eight or ten pounds a year to maintain a family so that a piece of flesh has not come to one of their tables in six weeks time their allowance could scarcely allow them bread and cheese one went to plow six days and preached on the lords day another was forced to cut tobacco for a livelihood the zealous justices of peace knew the calamities of the ministers when they issued out warrants upon some of the hearers because of the poverty of the preachers conformist plea against the nonconformist   various were the hardships and persecutions of the presbyterians before the fire of london the parliament and ministry discovering on every occasion an unrelenting animosity to them and if the king showed any compassion it was purely owing to his desire of easing the papists from their difficulties by a general toleration even that awful visitation the great plague gave them no respite but regardless of the displeasure of heaven the ministry and bishops pursued them with the more malignant barbarity after the fire of london they were somewhat connived at they built wooden tabernacles to preach in and their places of worship were crowded with penitent and devout auditors the disgrace of their bitter enemy the earl of clarendon was likewise favorable to them but after a short respite and several attempts for a toleration and comprehension had failed the persecution was revived in the year      and their private meetings were broken up again mr baxter and other learned and pious preachers imprisoned and they were abused in many hot writings particularly by dr patrick and dr parker afterward bishops but the latter was wittily and farcastically answered by the famous andrew marvel in    0 the conventicleact was revived which the court forwarded with a view of reducing the presbyterians to the necessity of petitioning for a general toleration by which a door would be opened for the introduction of popery the wit of man could hardly invent any thing short of capital punishment more cruel and inhuman than this act by which means houses were to be plundered their persons imprisoned their goods and chattles carried away and sold to those that would bid for them and encouragement given to a vile set of informers to live upon the labor and industry of their conscientious neighbors neale  the act was so severely executed that there was soon not a conventicle to be heard of all over england great numbers were prosecuted on it and many industrious families reduced to poverty many ministers were confined in goals and close prisons and warrants were issued out against them and their hearers and distraints made to the amount of a great sum of money informers were every where at work and having crept into religious assemblies in disguise levied great sums upon ministers and people soldiers broke into the houses of honest farmers under pretense of searching for conventicles and where ready money was wanting they plundered their goods drove away their cattle and sold them for half price even the sick had their beds taken from under them and themselves laid upon the floor during the time that charless declaration of indulgence see vol iii of this work p     continued in force the presbyterians and independants set up the merchants lecture at pinners hall to show their agreement among themselves as well as to support the doctrines of the reformation against the prevailing errors of popery etc supported by the contributions of the principal merchants and tradesmen of their persuasions in the city they continued united till      when the presbyterians removed to salters hall and the independants continued their lecture at pinners hall both which have continued ever since the testact of      was the last penal statute against the nonconformists in this reign see ibid p      and as the dissenters in general had with great generosity supported that measure against the court through their dread of the increase of popery the court next year let loose again all their engines of cruelty upon them and the fines imprisonments and other severities exercised were excessive thence to the year      various attempts were made by the successive parliaments for a toleration of dissenters and putting the laws in execution against popish recusants and many books and pamphlets were published in their defense which unanswerably vindicated their principles but in that year and to the end of this reign sham plots were contrived to render them odious and set on by the court and the papists they felt all the rage of the high churchparty who displayed their hatred by encouraging infamous informers and inflicting exorbitant fines and cruel imprisonments under which many pious and learned divines found a refuge in death from all their troubles  i have now gone as comprehensively as i could through this gloomy reign in which so many thousands of pious and good persons were ruined for conscience sake but it must be remembered that the public liberty was ruined with them and that the whole constitution at the time of charless death was in a manner brought to its dissolution yet when the nation was groaning under every oppression when every vice stalked abroad in open day light and corruption of manners and prostitution of heart and tongue were even fashionable remember readers and blush for your country there were wretches abandoned enough to address this voluptuous monarch in strains that were impious and could with propriety be only ascribed to god himself  james ii at the beginning of his short reign revived the persecution against the protestant dissenters the majority of whom were presbyterians which was carried on with the most barbarous rigor and even exceeded those in his brothers reign but the favorite scheme which had proved abortive under that prince was sedulously pursued by james of making the presbyterians and other dissenters tools to obtain a general toleration by which the papists were to be relieved from the penal laws and tests as he imagined it impracticable to obtain his desire legally he determined to attempt it by his dispensing power and began to caress the nonconformists and to show them great favor their ministers were encouraged to set up their conventicles which had been discontinued or held very secretly for some years and the king had it intimated timated every where that he would not have their meetings disturbed but the dissenters seeing the kings drift now joined with their persecutors of the church of england generously giving up their private resentments however just to their fears of popery and slavery which were making large strides toward the destruction of religious and civil liberty of which the dispensing power and the declaration for liberty of conscience were to be the principal engines see vol iii of this work p     and seq  this wise conduct of the dissenters certainly saved the church and state  thus however an end was put to the prosecution of the protestant dissenters by the penal laws though the laws themselves were not legally repealed or suspended till after the revolution upwards of sixty thousand persons suffered upon a religious account between the restoration and the abdication of king james five thousand of whom died in prison great numbers retired to the plantations and many transported themselves and their effects into holland and filled the english churches in the cities of the states neale says if we admit the dissenting families of the several denominations in england to be no more than   0000 and that each family suffered no more than the loss of three or four pounds per ann from the act of uniformity the whole will amount to    or   000000 a prodigious sum for those times but these are only conjectures the damage to the trade and property of the nation was undoubtedly immense and the wounds that were made in the estates of private families were deep and large many of whom to my certain knowledge wear the scars of them to this day   though in pursuance of the declarations for liberty of conscience etc the dissenters were not only at their liberty to worship in their several ways and were admitted to serve in all offices of profit and trust they could not be brought to acknowledge dispensing power though many to them addressed the king with thanks for the freedom they now enjoyed from persecution a measure however that was not approved by their elders and more cautious ministers in short they were now courted both by king and church by the latter of which they were promised in case they now stood firm to the common interest they would in better time come into a comprehension of such as could be brought into a conjunction with the church and to a toleration of the rest  the presbyterians concurred heartily in the revolution and when the prince of orange came to st jamess december         several of their ministers attended him with the bishop of london and many of the clergy to congratulate him upon his success january   about ninety of the nonconformist ministers waited upon the prince with a separate address to which they received a most cordial answer when king william and queen mary were settled on the throne the dissenting ministers waited on their majestys with addresses of congratulation which were delivered by dr bates and though many generous attempts made by the king for a comprehension were rendered abortive by the opposition of the jacobites and tories yet the memorable bill for toleration of protestant dissenters which is the basis of their present liberty was passed in their favor see p   of this volume  every body remembers the gratitude of their new friends in the reign of queen anne see ibid p   and seq   little else has occurred since that happy era of the revolution but fruitless attempts for a repeal of the corporation and test acts which have been constantly opposed by the church of england but it is to be hoped some future time will restore the dissenters to that entire liberty which is the birthright of every englishman and that they may have the privilege of serving their country indiscriminately with their fellowsubjects of the established church which they can never upon their present principles wish overturned though they may desire that the stumbling blocks to their union therewith were removed  i now come to give some account of the religious principles of the presbyterians who continue to be the most numerous sect of protestant dissenters in england and have almost entirely forsaken the rigid and severe maxims of their forefathers  presbyterians are so called from their assertion that the government of the church as appointed in the new testament is by presbyters i e ministers and ruling elders associated for government and discipline they maintain that there is no order in the church superior to that of presbyter that all ministers being ambassadors of christ are equal by commission and that elder presbyter and bishop though different in name are the same in office  the presbyterians acknowledge jesus christ alone supreme head in his church and that in matters purely spiritual they are under no human authority and jurisdiction see the dissenting gentlemans answer to mr john whites three letters   mo edit from p    to     for this reason they dissent from the  0th article viz that the church has power to decree rites and ceremonies and authority in matters of faith ibid  and for the same reason in subscribing to articles which are appointed or required of them to qualify them for the ministry this among others is left out and with respect to the  th article the authority of the three creeds one of those to which a

inclinations with all actual transgressions which proceed from it  ques what is the misery of that state  ans mankind lost communion with god are under his wrath liable to the miseries of this life death itself and all the pains of hell for ever assemblys catechism with notes by dr watts  but more moderate persons among the presbyterians entertain different notions e g  all corruption and depravity is contracted or natural contracted corruption is the result of repeated actions and consequently a person is no otherwise the author of this corruption than as he is the author of the actions from which it flows but he is not the immediate author according to the doctrine of original sin which fin is considered as predetermined  now supposing the action of eating the forbidden fruit to have been as much the action of any other individual as it was adams it will not therefore follow that it was his because rightly considered it will appear not to have been adams  adam on that scheme could not act without being predetermined any more than his posterity their will at least to that which is bad must have as much power as his and why was adam predetermined no recourse can be had here to an antecedent corruption adam therefore was not guilty of the first sin and if adam was not much less are we and not being guilty of the first sin we are not accountable for the corruption which is brought into human nature nor the cause of gods predetermining us to actions on account of this corruption the issue this drives us upon is that god is the only cause of all disconformity between human actions and his own law the law is from god as its author so likewise is the action and both the terms proceeding from him the contrariety between them must be his too

doctrine of the atonement of christ for sin seems to me to be an essential part of christianity because so many of the peculiar privileges and chief duties of it are so deeply interested therein and

benefits which god is graciously pleased to bestow upon us and of our acceptance of them and the promise whereby we oblige ourselves to him and that therefore no other sign hereof should be used the rev mr pierces vindication vol iii chap   p       baptism dr watts says is an ordinance which initiates us into christianity dr wattss works vol iii p   0 ibid p       it is a sacrament wherein the washing with water in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost does signify and seal our ingrafting into christ our partaking of the benefits of the covenant of grace and our engagements to be the lords i e entirely given up to the service of christ  and page     he defines baptism to be a washing with water in token of regeneration and remission of sins  the sacrament of baptism is that wherein by being washed with water in the name of the father son and holy spirit the baptized person solemnly gives up himself to god through his son to be governed by the gospel he taught in expectation of the aids of that spirit whose miraculous gifts proved the truth of the gospel and whereby he obliges himself to forsake all his former impurities which he thus acknowledges while at the same time by this rite he is encouraged to hope for gods pardoning mercy through christ and the cleansing influences of the spirit it is certainly a suitable and reasonable institution  the baptizing the children of christian parents in their infancy is an action in itself reasonable and it is fit that parents should dedicate their children to god the former of their bodies and the father of their spirits in acknowledgement they have received them from him and solemnly oblige themselves to endeavor the training them up in a religious and virtuous life and it is a great encouragement to them that god will accept the dedication and by the influences of his spirit bless and succeed their endeavors all which is justly expressed by this external rite mr amory on christ the light of the world system p       of the lords supper dr watts tells us plainly it is eating bread and drinking wine in the church in remembrance of the death of christ dr wattss scripture catechism   of church discipline and government church authority etc it is not only the right but the indispensible duty of christians to separate from the fellowship of those who are called brethren and walk disorderly that is as the apostle describes them fornicators idolators drunkards extortioners etc or who in any other like instances notoriously transgress the plain and essential precepts of the gospel and the apostle exhorts the corinthians to put away the incestuous person from among them and asserts their right which is so far the right of all christian churches viz to judge them that are within abernethy on religious obedience founded on persuasion p       touching ecclesiastical authority this can by no means bind the conscience for in all such cases the only foundation upon which a man can act conscientiously is his private persuasion it limits and circumscribes the extent of human authority and is not limited and circumscribed by it if a decision of men binds any person it is in matters wherein he thinks they have power when they carry their pretensions farther and determine things wherein his judgment does not allow their authority their decrees must be regarded by him as void and consequently if any ones conscience dissallows human authority in the lowest instances wherein it is exercised its acts can produce no obligation upon him else the rights of private judgment might be invaded in all cases and conscience given up to the will of men for it is as really injured if a man be forced to act against its light in a circumstance or matter of ceremony as an article of faith for whatsoever is not of faith is sin from whence it is plain that ecclesiastical authority has no power over conscience indeed none at all but what conscience gives it and therefore must yield to its superior where their voices differ  the direction given to the corinthians let all things be done decently and in order is alleged by many to be a sufficient foundation for the churches power in points of external order but what those points are even protestants are not agreed some extend them to ceremonies and modes of worship which are neither expressly commanded nor forbidden by the word of god others limit them to the natural circumstances of actions upon their different opinions different schemes of ecclesiastical constitutions are erected but it will appear that no proper authority can be binding without the authority of conscience since the magistrate is not capable of knowing how the subjects conscience is grieved by such impositions when the plea of conscience is real or only pretended and whether if it be an error how it was led into it and whether its errors be culpable he must run the hazard of punishing the innocent which ought never to be done when it can be avoided without danger to the state see this more largely illustrated by the preceding author from p     to p      grove  of the doctrine of predestination   physical predetermination says mr grove does not consist with the nature of man as a rational agent    is needless contrary to what is affirmed of its being absolutely necessary to action    will not consist with human liberty    it makes god the author of sin for taking away human freedom a man ceases to be accountable for any thing he does and his actions ought not to be imputed to him but to the being that lays him under a necessity so to act an inspired writer has told us that god is not tempted with evil neither tempts he any man but if this hypothesis was true he would more than tempt men he would compel them groves system vol i p       of the civil magistrate with respect to the authority of the magistrate in matters of mere conscience and religion to make our worship and obedience acceptable to god it must proceed from an inward conviction that it is agreeable to his will and to practice any thing as religion out of obedience to human authority is a regarding men more than god consequently no magistrate can have a right to compel persons to profess or practice that which he does not inwardly approve  absolute toleration therefore and a general liberty of conscience where persons violate not the rights of others and propagate no doctrines destructive of society are the unalienable right of all  and perhaps such a power may with reason be granted when no more than a just proportion of the public revenue is taken and when this is applied not to the spreading doctrines and practices of a doubtful nature and of no immediate good influence on the virtue and happiness of a nation but to recommend the great and plain principles and rules of natural and revealed religion groves system of moral philosophy vol ii p      and as christianity is the only scheme of religion which contains a pure complete and wellconnected system of those principles and duties a government upon the sole principle of public utility may be justified in establishing it  an abstract of a profession of faith made at a public ordination at the old jewry in    0 which is agreeable to many others i have procured  art i the first and great article of my belief from natural and revealed religion is the existence of one god whose power is uncontrollable whose knowledge is infinite whose presence is immensity whose being is eternity whose beneficence is boundless mercy whose name is love a spirit immutable in his nature and unchangeable in all his perfections the creator of all worlds and of all beings that exist  i believe that his providence is universal and that his supreme government is over all his works exercised with the most persect wisdom and invariable goodness most conducive to his own glory and the happiness of his creatures  i believe that this allwife and good god ought to be worshipped in spirit and truth free from corrupt affections and with the most pious and devout dispositions  art ii i believe that god the parent of all nature directed by the essential beneficence of his own perfect mind formed man for the purposes of wisdom virtue and happiness and furnished him with all abilities suitable to answer these important ends but that our first parent by violating the express law of his maker fell from his innocence his dignity and happiness and when sin entered into the world death entered by sin  i believe that in pity to the unhappy state of mankind and in condescension to the weakness and imbecility of human nature god at sundry times and in diverse manners afforded such revelation of himself as was most agreeable to the state and circumstances of his creatures that as reasonable beings capable of a law they had life and death set before them had liberty of choice consequently and were accountable to god for their conduct  art iii i believe also that in the most suitable and fitting time god sent his only son into the world that the world through him might be saved  that the gospel of jesus christ reveals the most noble sentiments of the deity and of that duty we owe to him  that it contains the most sublime precepts of morality with all the evidences of reason and all the dignity of divine authority  from hence i am led to believe what is therein farther taught the forgiveness of sins and everlasting life on the conditions of our repentance faith in jesus christ as the one mediator and obedience to his gospel these doctrines of the gospel i believe to be the wisest and best system of religion and this method of salvation most consistent with the perfections of god with the state and circumstances of mankind and most conducive to their highest perfection and happiness  art iv i believe that jesus christ instituted two positive ordinances baptism and the lords supper by the first of these we are initiated into the christian religion and by the latter we are to commemorate our lords death till he come  art v i believe that jesus christ by his holy and unblameable life has left us a perfect example that by his death he perfected his obedience and made a proper oblation to god for us that he arose again from the dead to procure and ascertain our resurrection to immortality that he ascended to his god and our god and ever lives as our advocate with the father and that through him our sincere though imperfect obedience will be accepted  art vi i believe that god has promised the direction and assistance of his spirit to all those who sincerely and humbly implore it and that the aid of the divine spirit in conjunction with our own endeavors is sufficient to the duty required of us that the holy spirit was given to the apostles of our lord in an extraordinary manner for the propagation and confirmation of the gospel and is still continued and employed in a general way to promote the happiness and salvation of mankind  finally i believe that whatsoever circumstances may confound the distinctions betwixt men in this world there will be a future state a state of impartial and righteous retribution when every one will receive according to his deeds done in the body whether they were good or whether they were evil  these are the articles of my belief all that i esteem essential to a christian and whatever controversies may have arisen in matters of less consequence as they are not clearly revealed cannot be necessary to salvation and therefore suspend my conclusions concerning them till that decisive day when all difficulties shall be removed and the secrets of all hearts will be manifest  after this general confession of faith the following questions were proposed to the minister by the senior of officiating presbyter question i as the work in which you are now engaging is certainly very important and difficult and the credit and promotion of religion much depends on the due discharge of it please to let us know what are the governing motives to your undertaking therein  answer whatever reflections christian ministers have been exposed to i shall always disclaim being influenced by any other than the noblest motives the glory of god the happiness of my own soul and that of others i profess myself devoted to no master but christ and i embrace this profession with no other views than of preaching the important truths and doctrines of the gospel in their genuine nature inculcating the precepts and duties of the christian religion and enforcing them by rational and gospel motives  ques ii as we have been long employed in this important work and find the necessity of frequent application to the means of improvement will you diligently attend to reading meditation and prayer for these ends  ans conscious of my own weakness and insufficiency i shall frequently and seriously apply myself to study and all those exercises which may enable me more honorably and more successfully to discharge that office in which i have engaged in obedience to the command of my great master and in duty to that society over which i am placed  ques iii will you endeavor to adorn the doctrine of god our savior by a holy and upright conversation  ans as i profess to make the promotion of religion the invariable purport of my actions i shall esteem a good example the noblest proof i can give of my sincerity as a christian minister and the most promising means of its success  ques iv ministers are set for the defense of the gospel will you endeavor to maintain the truths of the gospel pure and unmixed free from all popish corruption and human tradition and inventions and allow to others the same right of judging for themselves which you claim  ans popery i look upon as a gross corruption of the sacred scriptures as the most palpable insult upon the common understanding of mankind an invasion of the natural rights and privileges of conscience and even of civil liberty i believe that the ignorance superstition and cruelty of the church of rome are evident marks of her apostasy i esteem the reformation as a singular instance of the providence of god from the greatness of the advantages attending it and i shall always think it my duty as a faithful minister to maintain and defend that liberty which as a man i esteem sacred and to support and vindicate the genuine principles of christianity and of protestantism what may befall me in my life i cannot tell but it is my present resolution never to abandon this worthy cause but with invariable sincerity and diligence to persevere therein unto my lifes end in the remembrance of gods omniscience and in hopes of obtaining his favor which i shall always esteem the completion of my everlasting happiness  ques v sometimes omitted viz for what reasons do you profess yourself a protestant dissenter and desire to have your ordination by presbyters  ans when i declare myself a protestant dissenter i can sincerely say i am not led to it by any prejudices of education by any fondness of singularity or by any views of worldly advantages but from a regard to the rights of conscience the purity of the christian doctrines and the simplicity of their worship govment etc  ordination in this manner i esteem valid and of primitive apostolic authority  that several passages in scripture speak of elders or presbyters and bishops as the same and that the bishops duty extended no farther than that christian church by whose suffragan he was appointed but though i prefer presbytery to episcopacy etc i profess my esteem of every faithful minister of every denomination and it shall be always my endeavor to cultivate that friendship that ought to subsist betwixt the ministers of the gospel of the grace of god  then the minister standing or kneeling the presbytery present lay each of them a hand on his head and the eldest presbyter or other minister appointed to officiate prays  questions proposed to the rev mr thomas wright at his ordination may         with the answers returned  ques i we your brethren in christ are at your request here assembled in the presence of god and of this congregation to acknowledge receive and approve you in the full exercise of that christian ministry for which you have been prepared by a regular and learned education and we do it with the greater pleasure as during several years you have given satisfactory proof of your abilities and qualifications for it as an assistant minister in this church  we pretend to no dominion over your faith or authority to invest you with any new powers or rights by the imposition of our hands which we retain only as an ancient rite or ceremony whereby we bear our public and solemn testimony that we esteem you worthy of that sacred ministry which you have chosen to devote yourself to and of discharging all the pastoral duties without exception which christ has appointed to be performed in his church recommending you to god by prayer and to the church of christ by our unanimous suffrages  we presume not to offer to you any articles of faith or religion in the words of men or canons of human contrivance for your assent and subscription but as there is a propriety in the thing itself and as it is the religion of christ only in its native and uncorrupted simplicity of which we would be understood to approve and declare you a minister will you give us on this occasion your own ideas of the general plan of that excellent and divine religion of jesus christ which has been and is from henceforth by this solemn dedication of yourself to it to be the chief and important subject of the labors of your life  ans in the view sir that you are pleased to represent it i readily consent to lay before you and this assembly a general account of the religious principles which i profess and apprehend i have drawn from the pure fountains of religious knowledge  by the exercise of my rational powers upon myself and other objects i am led into the firm belief of the existence of an eternal independent immense being which we call god possessed of infinite power wisdom and goodness with all conceivable all possible perfection of nature character and state the original cause of all other beings the source of all the excellence perfection and happiness that obtain in the universe the preserver of the whole world the righteous governor and judge of moral agents amongst whom is the race of mankind  but the character and moral government of this glorious being especially his dispensations toward the human race with their duty are more particularly and clearly represented in the scriptures which are of divine original and contain a just account of all necessary truth relating to religion  from them i learn that the supreme governor of the world to show his displeasure against sin banished our first parents from paradise in which he had placed them for disobedience to a positive prohibition and inflicted upon them the penalty threatened to their transgression though not without giving them the promise of a deliverer from the evils to which they had subjected themselves and their posterity  in the succeeding ages of the world this promise was repeated for the encouragement of welldisposed persons and various means were made use of by the wise and and merciful god to preserve or restore true religion amongst men particularly it was renewed to abraham one branch of whose family he chose and distinguished from the rest of the world by peculiar laws and rites of worship to convey to posterity the knowledge of this promise with several important doctrines and duties of religion  at the time appointed by infinite wisdom as most proper for it he sent the longexpected person into the world to save men from perdition and bring them to everlasting life  the wellbeloved son of god in obedience to his father and from compassion to mankind took flesh and was born of a virgin lived in a mean condition conversed familiarly with men taught the great doctrines and duties of true religion then very much unknown and neglected corrupted by traditions and human inventions illustrated by his own temper and conduct the pure doctrines and rules of duty which he taught setting an example of strict purity of warm benevolence of sublime piety of universal holiness and proved also his divine commission and character as the messiah by miraculous works  thus did this divine teacher proceed for a considerable time gloriously displaying the excellency of the divine perfections and government and his own good will to mankind till he was seized by wicked men who unjustly condemned and crucified him but the violent opposition which they made to his cause and the evils they inflicted on his person were so far from frustrating the great design on which he came into the world from putting a stop to the exercise of his piety to god and his beneficence to men that they afforded him an opportunity of promoting it in the most effectual manner for as by these last sufferings he set us an example of a steady adherence to the cause of righteousness under the greatest natural and temporal evils that can befall us so in death he gave himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to god of a sweet smelling savor  nor did he long remain under the dominion of death for on the third day he was raised again by the mighty power of god appeared to and conversed with many of his disciples especially the apostles who were particularly appointed to be witnesses of this great event by which he was declared in the most convincing manner to be the son of god and savior of the world and after conversing with them several times for the space of forty days and instructing them in the things relating to the kingdom of god commanding them to proselyte all nations baptising them into the name of the father of the son and of the holy ghost teaching them to observe whatever he had commanded them he was taken up into heaven from among them and seated at the right hand of the majesty on high as a prince and a savior to give repentance and remission of sins unto all people  vested with all power both in heaven and earth soon after his ascension he conferred the gifts of the holy ghost upon them which qualified them in the best manner for propagating his religion in the world  this religion as published by christ and his apostles and contained in the scriptures is a most excellent and perfect institution admirably adapted to the state and circumstances of mankind it contains the laws of nature with various additional directions assistances promises and motives suited to our unhappy circumstances of ignorance weakness and guilt and directly tending to promote our purity comfort and eternal felicity for as it has provided a remedy for the ears and sorrows of humble persons sensible of their guilt and infirmities by offring a free pardon to them who believe and repent effectual assistance to all who are desirous of holiness and exert themselves in the way appointed for obtaining it and eternal life to them who persevere in well doing so on the other hand it has taken away all ground of hope from impenitent and careless men by assuring them that without holiness none shall ever see the lord but that all who obey not the gospel shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the lord and the glory of his power  for preserving the knowledge of this excellent religion and accomplishing its ends in the world it is agreeable to the will of christ that societies be formed in which the doctrines and duties of his gospel are taught and inculcated and the father worshipped through him the only mediator between god and men and he appointed two peculiar services of religion viz baptism and the lords supper the former to be observed only once as a token of admission into his church and of a right to the blessings of his kingdom the latter to be celebrated often in commemoration of his dying for us and as an acknowledgment of our christian obligations  though the apostolic office ceased with the lives of those who were first ordained to it by christ himself yet it is suitable to his directions that pastors and teachers be continued throughout all ages for preaching his religion offering up prayers and administering his ordinances  and notwithstanding the gifts which were conferred on the first ministers of the gospel are not continued i apprehend that faithful diligent men who give themselves to reading meditation and prayer that they may understand the will of god enter into the true spirit of the gospel and qualify themselves for discharging the duties of the christian ministry have encouragement to hope for a blessing on their studies and labors from the head of the church for excellently as this kingdom is constituted and well as it is furnished with means for its preservation and prosperity it is not left to the mere natural operation of those means but our lord constantly presides in it directing its affairs and by his influence promoting the improvement and happiness of his disciples  thus does our lord exercise his power and grace toward mankind at present but they will be more sensibly and gloriously displayed hereafter when descending from heaven in his own and his fathers glory he shall raise the dead convene all men before his tribunal with unerring judgment separate the good from the bad and assigning the wicked to misery proportioned to their guilt shall reward the righteous with everlasting life and happiness rising according to the perfection of their obedience and holiness though infinitely above their deserts then comes the end when he shall deliver up the kingdom unto the father that god may be all in all  this i sincerely deliver as a general idea of that religion which i firmly believe and according to which i hope by divine assistance to form both my public and private conduct that i may save myself and others  ques ii as we have in common with all the reformed churches both at home and abroad renounced the authority of the church of rome notwithstanding her arrogant pretensions to be the only true catholic church and her anathemas denounced against all that have departed from her communion as heretics and schismatics divided from the body of christ give us leave to ask you what are your sentiments concerning the reformation and the reason and foundation of the protestant profession  ans the church of rome appears to me to be different not only in her ceremonies and many of her doctrines but in her very spirit and constitution from the church of christ particularly as she claims dominion over the faith and religious practice of men and inforceth her injunctions by the terrors of this world without which her anathemas are objects of contempt and i avow it as a fundamental principle of christianity that every man has a right and is required by christ to judge for himself in matters of religion and to act agreeably to his own judgment formed by the holy scriptures which is the only rule of faith and practice to christians  i cannot therefore but look upon the reformation as a necessary and as far as it has proceeded an excellent work and heartily pray that all who have rejected the authority of the church of rome may renounce her imposing spirit with all her corruptions of the christian religion  ques iii as there remain some differences still in the constitution and worship of the protestant churches themselves though professedly agreed in one common fundamental principle of the sufficiency and authority of the sacred scriptures alone as the rule and standard of christian faith worship and practice will you please to let us hear why you think it more eligible to exercise your christian ministry among the protestant dissenters under the toleration than in the church established by law  ans the great principle of true religion that it is the right and duty of every one to search the scriptures and act agreeably to his own judgment in religious matters obliges me to dissent from the church established by law since she assumes power to decree rites and ceremonies and authority in controversies of faith the acknowledging this authority would be in an high degree improper as i do not find that christ has delegated such power to any man or body of men on earth and seems to me to be directly inconsistent with allegiance to him who is the sole head and lawgiver of the christian church matthew xxiii      0 xvii   john xiv         in her service also there are some things that appear to me inconsistent with the simplicity and purity of the gospel which requires us to worship the father in the name of christ john xiv       xv    xvi          ephesians iii      for these and such like reasons which are not founded upon scruples relating to ceremonies considered in themselves but upon a regard to what i apprehend the important principles of truth and christian liberty i think it my duty considered either as a minister or a private christian to dissent from the church established by law matthew x       etc mark viii    luke ix    xii       by exercising my ministry among the protestant dissenters which i desire to do peaceably and in brotherly love to those of the establishment and all other denominations i appear publicly in behalf of the natural rights of men and christians keep my mind more open to conviction from reason and the word of god endeavor to promote the pure worship of the gospel and can better use those means which i judge conducive to the great ends of religion  ques iv as an higher object of inquiry still and as i doubt not but you can assign the most laudable motives and ends will you acquaint us with those that have the principal influence upon your mind in inclining you to engage and proceed in the christian ministry rather than in any of the most necessary lawful and profitable secular employments for which your abilities might equally qualify you  ans though i judge many other employments lawful and honorable yet the sacred ministry appears to me above all to afford advantages for promoting the scheme of gods righteous and beneficent government and answereng most completely the principal ends for which we are all sent into the world viz to improve our own natures in holiness and assist others in improving theirs the consideration of which i trust has had the principal influence in determining me to engage and cheerfully to proceed in the work of the christian ministry rather than the most profitable secular employment in which i might perhaps with equal application have succeeded  ques v will you consider yourself in what you are doing as coming under a solemn obligation of attending with a conscientious diligence and sincerity to all the great duties and purposes of the christian ministry in the various occasions and circumstances wherein divine providence may direct you of preserving an exemplary behavior in your life of living in harmony with your brethren as far as in you lies in inoffensiveness and peace with your fellow christians of other denominations and in christian charity and benevolence toward all men utterly disclaiming all persecuting principles and practices in every degree and kind and as difficulties and discouragements may arise some of which may be foreseen and others not may we not hope that you have considered this and that you stand prepared and determined in your own mind in humble dependence upon the divine assistance to acquit yourself with integrity in the service of your and our great lord and judge that you may be approved by him at his appearing and as a good and faithful servant enter into your masters joy  ans i consider myself as a disciple and minister of jesus christ and would be looked upon as publicly acknowledging myself under the most sacred obligations to obey his laws to profess his religion and to the utmost of my ability promote the interest of his kingdom which is a kingdom of purity peace and love to the end of my life  though gratitude obliges me to acknowledge that through my situation in this society and the countenance and friendship of those with whom i have been and am principally connected i have experienced few difficulties and may hope for further peace and comfort from the same means yet i am not insensible that difficulties generally attend a faithful discharge of the ministerial office and that various discouragements may arise in the course of providence but i trust that by attending with prudence to the duties of my station and paying a due regard to the advice of my worthy brethren in the ministry and other christian friends especially by humbly imploring the assistance of god i shall be furnished with wisdom and fortitude sufficient for every exigency enabled to maintain my fidelity discharge my duty with diligence and success and finish my course with the joyful expectation of a crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge will give unto all his faithful servants at the great day of retribution  with a view to which important ends i desire the further prayers and instructions of you my fathers in the ministry  the history of the independants the original of the independants may be deduced from a set of religious and conscientious people called brownists so styled from mr robert brown a puritan preacher in the diocese of norwich brown was a descendant of an ancient and honorable family in rutlandshire and mearly related to the lord treasurer cecil he was educated in corpus christi college cambridge he went about the country inveighing against the discipline and ceremonies of the church and was imprisoned but upon acknowledgment of his offense released by the bishop of norwich in    0 in      he wrote the life and manners of a true christian to which was prefixed a treatise of reformation without tarrying for any etc etc for which he was brought into question but after some time released and lived four years at home with his father he then associated himself with richard harrison and preached every where against bishops ceremonies etc etc for which he was committed thirtytwo times to prison and at length was forced to leave the kingdom upon which he retired to middleburgh in zealand with several of his followers where he formed a church upon his own model but this church soon crumbled into parties and brown in      having left them and renounced his principles of separation became rector of achurch in northamptonshire where he lived an idle and dissolute life and for an assault being committed to northampton gaol died therein in    0 in the   st year of his age  whose followers were so prejudiced by the severities exercised upon the puritans that about the year    0 they totally separated from the church of england and would not allow her to be a true church nor her ministers true ministers renouncing all communion with her not only in ceremonies but in hearing the word and in the sacraments see vol   of this work p         where a trivial mistake or two is made   the brownists held the same articles of faith with the church of england but were very rigid in matters of discipline and maintained that of the church of england to be popish and antichristian they apprehended every church ought to be confined within the limits of a single congregation and that the government should be democratical some of their reasons for separating from the church were that the laws and the queens injunctions had made many unwarrantable additions to the institutions of christ that there were several gross errors in the church service which were made necessary for communion and imposed accordingly that if persecution for conscience sake was the mark of a false church the church of england could not be a true one that the constitution of the hierarchy was too bad to be mended that the very pillars of it were rotten and that the structure should be begun anew therefore they resolved to lay a new foundation as near as possible to the primitive pattern though with the hazard of all that was dear to them in the world   these people suffered much with the rest of the puritans during the reign of queen elizabeth and many of them died with remarkable constancy for the principles they professed and in      they were become so numerous that sir walter raleigh declared in the parliament house that they were not less than  0000 divided into several congregations in norfolk essex and the parts about london many learned men were then at their head as mess smith jacob the learned mr ainsworth etc etc those about london being numerous formed themselves into a church chose a pastor teacher deacons and elders all in one day and seven persons were baptized at the same time without godfathers or godmothers and the lords supper administered thus five white loaves being set upon the table the pastor blessed them by prayer after which having broke the bread he delivered it to some and the deacons to the rest some standing and others sitting about the table using the words of the apostle   cor xi    take eat this is the body of the lord jesus which was broken for you this do in remembrance of him in like manner he gave the cup using the like words of the apostle this cup is the new testament in his blood this do ye as often as ye drink it in remembrance of him in the close they sung a hymn and made a collection for the poor when any person came first into the church he made this protestation or promise i will walk with you so long as you walk in the way of the lord and as far as may be warranted by the word of god this congregation was soon dispersed and fiftysix of them sent by two and two to the gaols about london neale in that year they laid their case before the lords of the council wherein they set forth their very grievous sufferings but the council did not choose to moven the affair as it lay before the high commission hereupon they petitioned the lord treasurer setting forth their hardships which petition was signed by fiftynine of them then prisoners in the gatehouse fleet newgate bridewell clink white lion and the compters but this and other of their petitions were rejected and thus as mr neale observes these pious and conscientious persons after a long and illegal imprisonment were abandoned to the severity of an unrighteous law the statute against recusants some of them being publicly executed as felons and others proscribed and sent into banishment these persecutions obliged many of them to fly into holland see vol ii of this work p      where their chiefs mess johnson smith ainsworth robinson jacob etc were before gone and were setting up churches at amsterdam arnheim middleburgh leyden etc etc that at amsterdam flourished for more than one hundred years in the reign of james i still greater numbers were compelled to leave their native country and though there happened many differences and schisms in their churches in holland they continued to increase every year by the accession of more of their persecuted brethren mr henry jacob he was born in kent and educated in st mary hall was precentor of christs church college oxon and afterward was rector of cheriton in kent  one of the former exiles having conferred with mr robinson he was a norfolk divine and had enjoyed a living near yarmouth he set out upon the most rigid principles but by the conversation of other learned men he became more moderate and did not deny those reformed churches from which he differed to be true churches though he maintained it to be lawful and necessary to separate from them he admitted their members to occasional communion and his own church to join with the dutch churches in prayer and hearing the word but not in the sacraments and discipline he was the father of the independants  pastor of the church at leyden embraced his sentiments of church discipline now known by the name of independancy about the year    0 he returned to his native country and having called several of his friends together and obtained their consent to unite in church fellowship for the enjoying the ordinances of christ in the purest manner he laid the foundation of the first independent or congregational church in england this was the manner thereof having appointed a day of solemn fasting and prayer for a blessing upon their undertaking toward the close of the solemnity each of them made open confession of their faith in our lord jesus christ and then standing together they joined hands and solemnly covenanted with each other in the presence of almighty god to walk together in all gods ways and ordinances according as he had already revealed or should further make them known to them mr jacob was then chosen their pastor by the suffrage of the brotherhood and others were appointed to the office of deacons with fasting and prayer and imposition of hands mr jacob soon after published a protestation or confession in the name of certain christians showing how far they agreed with the church of england and wherein they differed with the reasons of their dissent drawn from scripture to which he added a petition to the king for the toleration of such christians in the year      to enlarge his usefulness he went by the consent of his flock to virginia where he died neale  in the year      mr jacob was succeeded in his pastoral charge by mr lathorp but the little society being discovered by the bishops pursuivant april         at a house in blackfriars fortytwo of them were apprehended only eighteen escaping some of those that were made prisoners were confined in the clink others in new prison and the gatehouse and continued there two years or more and were then suffered to be bailed out but no favor could be obtained for their pastor upon which he petitioned the king for liberty to depart the kingdom which was granted and in      he with about thirty of his followers went and settled in new england mr can author of the marginal references in the bible  who was chosen in his room for a year or two preached to them in private houses and then was driven by the rage of persecution into holland where he became pastor of the brownist congregation at amsterdam mr samuel how was their next pastor who was thrown into prison where he died mr stephen more a layman succeeded him and now    0   the times being more favorable after shifting about from place to place for so many years they ventured to meet in public in deadmans place southwark on the   th of january they were soon however on a lords day surprised by the marshal of the kings bech and committed to prison next day they were carried before the house of lords and accused of denying the kings supremacy in ecclesiastical matters and with preaching contrary to the statute of eliz    the latter charge they consessed and declared as to the former that they could acknowledge no other head of the church but christ that they apprehended no prince on earth had power to make laws to bind the conscience and that such laws as were contrary to the laws of god ought not to be obeyed but that they disowned all foreign power and jurisdiction the house however so much the times were changed instead of referring them to the ecclesiastical courts dismissed them with a gentle reprimand and the next lords day some of the members came out of curiosity to their assembly to hear their preaching and to see their administration of the sacrament and were so much pleased as to contribute to their collection for the poor  many of their ministers now returned from exile sat in the famous westminster assembly of divines and made a bold stand against the proceedings of the high presbyterians they had increased prodigiously by this time and presented an apologetical narration to the house of commons to remove all the censures and illnatured suggestions against them after expressing great charity for other churches they say the scheme they embraced was a middle way between brownism and presbyterianism viz that every congregation of christians has an entire complete power of jurisdiction over its members to be exercised by the elders thereof within itself this they are sure must have been the form of government in the primitive church not that they claim an entire independency with regard to other churches for they agree that in all occasions of offenses the offending church is to submit to an open examination by other neighboring churches and on their persisting in their error or miscarriage they then are to renounce all christian communion with them until they repent which is all the authority or ecclesiastical power that one church may exercise over another unless they call in the civil magistrate for which they find no authority in scripture they then give the method of their public worship profess their agreement in doctrine with the articles of the church of england etc etc etc it was signed by thomas goodwin sydrach sympson philip nigh jer buroughs and william narus this apology was attacked in swarms of pamphlets by the presbyterians as tending to break the uniformity of the church under pretense of liberty of conscience and on other accounts  of the committee to bring about a comprehension of the independants within the establishment of presbytery the reader has seen the issue see p     of this volume  but it should be remarked that as the presbyterial form of church government was established the independants mildly moved only for an indulgence or toleration which was refused them they seemed in fact not only concerned for themselves but for tender consciences of all persuasions at this time the independants were courted by the king but though they were enemies to the presbyterian discipline they dared not trust a monarch whose professions seemed directed by nothing but his own interest  when the presbyterians in      petitioned the house against the toleration of sectaries which was seconded by the scots the independants procured a counter petition from the city with a great number of hands applauding the labors and successes of the parliament in the cause of liberty and praying them to go on with managing the affairs of the kingdom according to their wisdoms and not suffer the freeborn people of england to be inslaved on any pretense whatsoever nor to suffer any set of people to prescribe to them in matters of government or conscience and the petitioners will stand by them with their lives and fortunes the presbyterians were hereupon pressed by the wise parliament who only wanted to gain time to answer in the assembly their questions relating to the jus divinum of presbytery accordingly the assembly went to work for that purpose but the independants took the opportunity to leave them refusing absolutely to be concerned in the affair the king who was in the scots army when the treaty with the parliament was broken off attempted to bring the scots nation over to his interest by playing the independants against them but to little purpose though he told them the best way to destroy the sectarians was to join with the episcopalians and admit of the establishment of both religions that they could not imagine there was any hopes of silencing the independent party which undoubtedly will get a toleration in religion from the parliament of england unless you join with me in that way that i have proposed for the establishing of my crown  the army at this time was composed of independants with a mixture of anabaptists and other sectaries who when they found the presbyterians even in their treaty with the king of      insisting upon presbyterian uniformity without making the least provision for that liberty of conscience they had been contending for grew outrageous and at length buried king parliament and presbytery in the ruins of the constitution see p     of this volume  however they are not so chargeable with the death of charles i as their adversaries generally imagine for though it was not possible for the few independent ministers in london to join the presbyterians in their addresses against that measure see ibid p      because they were not possessed of parochial livings nor members of the provinicial assembly of london nor admitted to their weekly consultations at sion college but were a sort of dissenters from the public establishment and for other reasons as conclusive yet none of their ministers but hugh peters and john goodwin declared their approbation of the proceedings of the council of officers in the trial of the king nay some of the independent ministers in the country joined the presbyterians in protesting against it there were no doubt among them as well as amongst other parties men of republican principles who had a large share in the guilt of the fatal day that for so many years deprived the nation of monarchy  as oliver cromwell was averse to church power and a friend to universal toleration they were one of his chief supports during his protectorship they petitioned him for liberty to hold a synod in order to publish to the world a uniform confession of their faith for they were become a considerable body their churches were increased both in city and country and many rich and substantial persons had joined them but they were not agreed upon any standard of faith or discipline though their brethren in new england had done it ten years before as this history is confined to the english independants and notice has before been taken of the settlement of the churches in new england p     of this volume it is only necessary to refer the reader to neales history of new england for what concerns the independants there where they are the established church and have existed so long to their own honor and the benefit of their mother country and inspired with the bravery of their ancestors have performed such eminent services in the two last wars particularly  the protector yielded to their importunity but did not live to see the fruits of it it met at the savoy oct         and consisted of ministers and messengers from above  00 congregational churches of which the majority were laymen the rest pastors of churches they opened their synod with a day of fasting and prayer and appointed a committee the committee were dr t goodwin dr owen mr philip nigh mr wm bridge mr jos caryl and mr wm greenhill to draw up a new confession which was soon after published in quarto under the title of a declaration of the faith and order owned and practiced in the congregational churches in england agreed upon and consented unto by their elders and messengers in their meeting at the savoy oct         it consists of thirtythree chapters in which are almost two hundred distinct articles of faith and discipline though the whole time of the synods sessions was not above eleven or twelve days in most places this confession runs in the very words of the assemblys confession and the difference says neale between the two confessions in points of doctrine are so very small that the modern independants have in a manner laid aside the use of it in their families and agreed with the presbyterians in the use of the assemblys catechism at the end of the confession there is a chapter of discipline in which they assert that every particular society of visible professors agreeing to walk together in the says and order of the gospel is a complete church and has full power within itself to elect and ordain all church officers to exclude all offenders and to do all other acts relating to the edification and wellbeing of the church that the way of ordaining officers that is pastors teachers or elders is after their election by the suffrage of the church to set them apart with fasting and prayer and imposition of the hands of the eldership of the church though if there be no imposition of hands they are nevertheless rightly constituted ministers of christ but they do not allow that ordination to the work of the ministry though it be by persons rightly ordained does convey any officepower without a previous election of the church that no persons may administer the sacrament but such as are ordained and appointed thereunto nor are the pastors of one church obliged to administer the sacraments to any other than to the members of that church to whom they stand related in that capacity nor may any person be added to the church as a private member but by the consent of the church after a confession of his faith declared by himself or otherwise manifested they disallow the power of all stated synods presbyteries convocations and assemblies of divines over particular churches but admit that in cases of difficulty or difference relating to doctrine or order churches may meet together by their messengers in synods or councils to consider and give advice but without exercising any jurisdiction lastly they agree that churches consisting of persons sound in the faith and of good conversation ought not to refuse communion with each other though they walk not in all things according to the same rule of church order and if they judge other churches to be true churches though less pure they may receive to occasional communion such members of those churches as are credibly testified to be godly and to live without offense these opinions they add may appear new to a great many people because they have not been openly and publicly professed in the english nation but we are able to trace the footsteps of an independent congregational way in the ancientest practice of the church and in the writings of the soundest protestant divines that their principles do not in the least interfere with the authority of the civil magistrate nor do they concern themselves upon any occasions with him any further than to implore his protection for the preservation of the peace and liberty of their churches they glory in this that ever since they appeared in the world they have distinguished themselves in the cause of christian liberty we have always maintained say they this principle that among all christian states and churches there ought to be a forbearance and mutual indulgence to christians of all persuasions that keep to and hold fast the necessary foundations of faith this principle we have maintained for the sake of others when we ourselves had no need of it they conclude with thankfulness to their present governors for permitting those who could not comply with the presbyterian establishment to enjoy the liberty of their consciences and equal encouragement and protection with others and that this liberty is established by a law as long as they disturb not the public peace this should engage us they conclude to promote the honor and prosperity of such a government to be peaceably disposed one toward another and to love as brethren forasmuch as the differences between presbyterians and independants are differences between fellow servants and that neither of them have authority from god or man to impose their opinions upon one another the reader will join with me in thinking this a most rational and christian conclusion and that it does great credit to the synod  when general monk closed with the presbyterians though before he had inclined to the independants and kept an independent chaplain about him when every thing went in their way and the parliament lay at their mercy the independants offered to stand by their friends in the house to raise four new regiments from among themselves to force monk back into scotland and to raise  00000l for the use of the army provided they would protect them in their religious liberties which they apprehended monk and the presbyterians designed to subvert but it was too late for such proposals to be accepted the old regiments were dislodged and monk in possession of the city and thus ended the power of the army and the independants  when the king and the hierarchy were restored the independants and anabaptists petitioned for a toleration but during the whole reign of charles ii they were subject to the same persecutions and severities with the rest of the dissenters and suffered very severely on many occasions upon the mad attempt of venner and his followers in    0 see vol iii of this work p      which gave the court a handle to renew their severities against the dissenters the independants thought fit publicly to disown and renounce that insurrection they in their declaration disowned the principles of a fifth monarchy or the personal reign of king jesus on earth as dishonorable to him and prejudicial to his church and abhor the propagating this or any other opinion by force or blood etc etc etc this declaration was signed by mess caryl griffiths kenrick brag venning oxenbridge nigh row weld slater cockayne goodwin brooks helm hodges bachiler wood greenhill barker mallory loder yates owen mather and stoughton   when james the second published his declaration for liberty of conscience the independants at least some of them addressed the king for the indulgence therein shown them though they were far from approving the dispensing power which produced it with the other denominations of dissenters for from this time the history of one includes all they sincerely joined in the revolution with great zeal and were finally blessed with peace and rest from all their sufferings by the equitable and wise act of toleration  the independants though characterised and distinguished by the forementioned constitution of their churches are in these days like some other denominations of christians greatly divided in their sentiments the far greatest part of them are what is called orthodox with respect to the equality of the three persons in the trinity and of strict calvinistical principles in the points of predestination final perseverance justification by faith etc and are extremely solicitious to preserve and propagate these sentiments as though they were fundamental and essential to salvation nay the greatest part of them will not scruple to assert it of which many of their writings are my vouchers see the rev mr tho bradburys etc etc   the independants of this denomination have a fund for the support of an academy for the training up and educating persons for the ministry though they do not assert such an education is essentially necessary for that office yet they deem it a proper expedient the students admitted are first taught the rudiments of grammar latin and greek and are then initiated by the more immediate instruction of the master or principal tutor of the academy who must be approved of by the committee of the said fund for that purpose the pupils are not only recommended but carefully examined upon their admission touching their firm belief and resolution to be steadfast in maintaining what they call the orthodox says and at frequent opportunities their sentiments are scrutinized and especially upon any suspicion of their deviating from it toward the expiration of the time of their continuance of the more common preparatory exercises and when any are deemed properly qualified to give public specimens or their abilities for the ministry a subject is pitched upon by the master or principal tutor on which they are publicly to exhibit an oration sometimes before some persons selected by the committee and if from the ambiguity of their expressions or any particular explanation of texts of scripture they are suspected of entertaining any heterodox opinions it is usual for a person appointed to lay before them a set of articles a creed or summary of the christian faith concerning which they are interrogated touching their belief to which if they answer in the affirmative and satisfactorily they are permitted to continue in the academy and receive the consequent benefits of it as long as may be thought necessary but if it so happens as is sometimes the case that from their impartial inquiry they indulge a more free way of thinking and will not cannot bona fide declare their belief of those articles and are found privately to call them in question let their mental qualifications and their moral characters be ever so valuable and recommendatory to esteem they are discarded the academy deprived of any farther benefit from the fund lest not only unprovided for and treated as aliens from the faith but scarcely with christian charity this was the case of some not long ago who are now ministers in other societies of christians whose distinguishing abilities and amiable lives are an honor to their character and office  but there are other independent societies who disclaim any pretensions to dictate to their ministers or to impose on them particular creeds and articles of faith or making such the boundaries of communion they have not learned to place religion in unintelligible mysteries nor in the calvinistical tenets of predestination justification by faith effectual calling final perseverance etc they admit and encourage a much greater latitude of thinking and seem to center christianity in this grand article of the christian religion that jesus christ is the son of god and that moral virtue is the great cement of christian societies  one of the ministers of a respectable body of this denomination at pinners hall was some years ago the rev dr james foster who though a general baptist embraced and defended catholic communion and likewise accepted at the same time an invitation to preach an eveninglecture at the old jewry where his ministerial capacity was so much discovered and evidenced by the universal applause of the vast numbers who attended his lectures  nor can i forget a laudable example in another minister of that society who succeeded dr foster i mean the rev mr caleb fleming when he was called to accept the pastoral care of this congregation at the time of his ordination in opposition to orthodox creeds of mere human invention taking the greek testament in his hand he said this i believe to be the word of god the rule of faith and practice to christians as such i shall endeavor to understand the true sense of it to inculcate the genuine truths and duties of it and to live according to it this declaration as to the substance of it has been the only profession of faith made also by some of the presbyterian and general baptist ministers since at the time of their ordination however i have thought proper to give the substance of a confession of faith at the public ordination of mr thomas bradbury london july  0   0  which perhaps is most agreeable to the principles of the majority of the independants  forasmuch as upon these occasions many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed amongst us i desire to make the same good profession before many witnesses and according to my measure of the gift of christ give a reason of the hope that is in me with meekness and fear and especially at this time when by fasting and prayer and laying on of hands i am to be separated for the work whereunto the lord has called me though i be less than the least of all saints and not worthy of this grace to preach the unsearchable riches of christ  article i i therefore declare my belief that the books of the old and new testament which are commonly received amongst us came not by the will of man but the holy men of god spoke as they were moved by the holy ghost and are profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction and instruction in righteousness  art ii this through grace i will always adhere to as the great rule of my faith and ministry  to this law and testimony i profess to bring every opinion  this i promise in a dependence upon him who has the residue of the spirit  i apply to these scriptures as the best discovery god has made of himself in this life  i here learn what god is and what he does this includes both his nature and glorious perfections it includes both his eternal unity and a trinity of persons  art iii i believe that the lord our god is one lord there is none besides him  art iv i believe there are three that bear record in heaven the father the word and the holy ghost and that these three are one this i would avow as a truth and humbly adore as a mystery  art v i believe that this one god father son and holy ghost is a spirit the king eternal immortal invisible from everlasting to everlasting  merciful and gracious long suffering and abundant in goodness and truth but who will take vengeance on his adversaries and not at all acqit the wicked  art vi i believe that he created all thins and for his pleasure they are and were created  that his government reaches over the whole creation that his providence extends to all creatures and their actions and that the foreknowledge of god over rules the corruptions of men  art vii i believe that god made a covenant with our first parents as the common root of all their posterity and gave them a righteous law with this establishment that he that does these things shall live by them but in the day that he offended he should surely die  art viii i believe that by one mans disobedience our natures are not only guilty but impure and that we lie dead in trespasses and sins  art ix i believe that god resolved to glorify himself by redeeming some of the lost race  that he did from all eternity predestinate some to the adoption of children whose names are written in heaven  that this election was free and it will have a certain issue  that the remnant are saved according to the election of grace not for the works which they should afterward do but according to his own purpose and grace before the world began  art x i believe that this design will be effectual to the happiness of all those  art xi i believe that the only method of obtaining this happiness was by appointing one mediator between god and man the man christ jesus giving a certain number to him and setting him forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood for the remission of sins that god might be just and yet the elect be saved  art xii i believe the divinity of our great lord redeemer that he is over all god blessed for evermore that he thought it no robbery to be equal with god but receives a divine homage  i believe this word was made flesh and dwelt among us  this is the mystery of godliness great without controversy that god was manifest in the flesh  i believe him to be a teacher come from god  that he was made a priest for ever  that he is the king of saints of whose kingdom there shall be no end  in all these capacities he is head of the church and the savior of the body  appointed to be the heir of all things but more especially lord over them who are given to him  art xiii i believe he went about doing good delighting to do the will of him that sent him by the which will we are sanctified  that he was made a curse for us suffering in both the parts of his human nature that he was the messiah who should be cut off to finish transgression and make an end of sin that there is no other name given under heaven whereby men can be saved  art xiv i believe when he had by himself purged our sins he was buried and lay part of three days and three nights in the belly of the earth  art xv i believe that god raised him to heaven loosed the pains of death because it was not possible he should be holden of it i believe he ascended up on high is seated on the right hand of god as the advocate of his people and the judge of the world  art xvi i believe that whom he predestined them the also called and whom he has called them he also justifies freely by his grace the blessedness of this consists in gods imputing righteousness without works  i believe that we lay hold on this mercy by faith and that not of ourselves but of the gift of god  that the people of god receive the adoption of sons and there is a change in the disposition of those who are heirs of the grace of life owing to free love and to almighty power  i believe that the ransomed of the lord grow in grace and that he who has begun a good work in them will perform it unto the day of jesus christ no man shall be able to pluck them out of his hands  art xvii i believe he is to be worshipped with reverence and godly fear  i believe that we are to own this lord in societies and that there is a communion with all that in every place call upon the name of the lord jesus christ both theirs and ours and that jesus christ will be with them to the end of the world  art xviii i believe he has given us several commands and institutions which we as christians are obliged to perform one of which is baptism in water in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost  taught us all things whatsoever he has commanded  admonishing one another in psalms hymns and spiritual songs  and by eating bread and drinking wine in remembrance of him we are to continue steadfast in doctrine and fellowship and in breaking of bread and in prayer  art xix i believe that in all these parts of worship one is our master even christ no man having dominion over our faith and liberty  art xx i believe that the christian at his death enters upon two blessings a complete purity and satisfying enjoyment that the spirits of just men are made perfect  see christ and know him as themselves are known that more perfect felicity which will follow the resurrection and universal judgment for  art xxi i believe there shall be a resurrection of the dead both of the just and unjust  that christ has authority to execute judgment because he is the son of man that the angels who sinned are delivered into chains of darkness both they and the wicked who know not god nor obey the gospel of his dear son shall go into everlasting punishment but the righteous into life eternal  the history of the baptists commonly called anabaptists the baptists or anabaptists were so styled from their practice of baptising believers thinking them the only proper subjects of that institution and that the mode of baptism should be performed by immersion the method made use of by the primitive christians for the three first centuries after the promulgation of the gospel gales answer to wall  thus they claim an immediate descent from the apostles and assert that the constituion of their churches is from the authority of jesus christ himself and his immediate successors  some historians indeed deduce their origin as a sect from much later times and affirm they first sprang up in germany and separated themselves from the lutherans because the doctrine of these reformers was imperfect or not brought to the primitive standard as the proper mode and subject of baptism was not allowed by them to be necessary in the performance of the rite dupin cent xvi  therefore they rebaptised their followers condemning infant baptism as unscriptural and of no effect whence they acquired the reproachful name anabaptists they insisted on strict morality mortification fasting and simplicity of dress they not only exclaimed against the authority and tyranny of the church of rome but against every authority that opposed the rights of conscience  the antiquity of baptism by immersion is fixed however upon too firm a basis to be removed as may be shown from the consent and testimony of the most approved ancient tertullian who flourished anno dom  00 is the first christian writer who expressly mentions such a practice as baptising of infants and condemns it as an unwarrantable and irrational practice and modern writers and even some of their greatest opposers acknowledge the rise of the baptists as a sect to be at least five hundred years as wall bishop tailor baxter etc etc etc before the confusions at munster in germany italy switzerland france etc their opinions had multitudes of abettors numbers of whom were martyred for their adherence thereto in the the   th and   th centuries by those who had the civil and religious government in their hands the martyrology crsbys history of the baptists vol i p   of the foreign anabaptists is a large book in folio and the account it gives of the number of their martyrs and confessors as well as of the cruelties that were used toward them very much exceeds any thing that has been done in england however according to their number in this land and the degree to which persecution has at any time arisen they have always had their full share of it  it is pretty clear from the consent of many learned authors that wickliffe the first english reformer denied infant baptism to be lawful for one of his tenets was that those are fools and presumptuous which affirm such infants not to be saved which die without baptism and he denied that all sins are abolished in baptism fuller p      as it was the opinion that baptism washed away original sin and by a secret virtue regenerated the person and that the infant dying without it was in danger of damnation that opinion began and established the practice of infant baptism therefore this foundation being removed that practice falls of course see killingworths letter to whiston      p    some of his followers maintained that the children of believers are not to be sacramentally baptized and that it was unprofitable to give children ecclesiastical baptism saying they were sufficiently clean and holy because they were born of holy and christian parents marshals defense of infant baptism p     but to commence my history  though several anabaptists were put to death and banished for their opinions in the reign of henry viii yet i shall begin their history with the words of bishop burnet history of the reformation part ii p   0 and seq  and which i look upon to be proper for my purpose at this time      there were many anabaptists in several parts of england they were generally germans whom the revolutions there had forced to change their seats upon luthers first preaching in germany there arose many who building on some of his principles carried things much further than he did the chief foundation he laid down was that the scripture was to be the only rule of christians upon this many argued that the mysteries of the trinity and christs incarnation and sufferrings of the fall of man and the aids of grace were indeed philosophical subtilities and only pretended to be deduced from scripture as almost all opinions of religion were and therefore they rejected them amongst these the baptism of infants was one they held that to be no baptism and so were rebaptised but from this which was most taken notice of as being a visible thing they carried all the general name of anabaptists on the   th of april there was a complaint brought to the council that with the strangers that were come into england some of that persuasion had come over and were disseminating their errors and making proselytes so a commission was ordered for the archbishop of canterbury the bishops of ely worcester westminster chichester lincoln and rochester sir william petre sir thomas smith dr cox dr may and some others three of them being a quorum to examine and search after all anabaptists heretics or contemners of the common prayer they were to endeavor to reclaim them to enjoin them penance and give them absolution or if they were obstinate to excommunicate and imprison them and to deliver them over to the secular power to be further proceeded against some tradesmen in london were brought before these commissioners in may and were persuaded to abjure their former opinions one of which was that the baptism of infants was not profitable one of those who thus abjured was commanded to carry a faggot next sunday at st pauls where there should be a sermon setting forth his heresy but there was another of these extreme obstinate joan bocher commonly called joan of kent she denied that christ was truly incarnate of the virgin whose flesh being sinful he could take none of it but the word by the consent of the inward man in the virgin took flesh of her these were her words they took much pains about her and had many conferences with her but she was so extravagantly conceited of her own notions that she rejected all they said with scorn whereupon she was adjudged an obstinate heretic and so left to the secular power see vol iii of this work p  00  in    0 the anabaptists were excepted out of a general pardon these anabaptists were certainly of an untractable and obstinate temper but says burnet for the other sort of the anabaptists who only denied infant baptism see ibid p      i find no severities used to them but several books were written against them to which they wrote some answers in the reign of queen elizabeth the baptists greatly increased and were subjected to imprisonment and banishment see vol ii of this work p      some few indeed recanted their errors as fuller observes but two were burnt in smithfield in the reign of james i among the persecuted exiles that fled to holland were several anabaptists who set up a church under the pastorship of mr john smith who had been a minister of the established church but they were violently opposed by the other puritan exiles from whom they received much abuse in books written against their opinions in this reign edward wightman a baptist of burton upon trent was burnt at litchfield he was the last martyr that suffered by this cruel kind of death in england and it may be remarked that william sawtre the first that suffered in that manner for his religious opinions was supposed to have denied infant baptism so that this sect crosby ut supra p  0  had the honor both of leading the way and bringing up the rear of all the martyrs who were burnt alive in england as well as that a great number of those who suffered this death for their religion in the  00 years between were of this denomination in    0 several anabaptists transported themselves into new england where for a time they met with but hard measure from their congregational brethren who though they had fled from persecution themselves yet could give no great latitude to the tender consciences of the baptists and quakers dr mather in his ecclesiastical history has indeed acknowledged many of the baptists to be worthy and honest men and that mr williams one of their preachers being banished from salem settled at a place called providence where he gathered a church together and was very instrumental in obtaining a charter for the government of rhode island of which he was sometimes chosen governor and that he did all in his power to convert the indians in his neighborhood of the manners language and tempers of whom he published a relation when they were restored to a peaceable state the baptists spread greatly in the colonies of new england increased much in pensilvania where they had in      nine churches and there are now baptist churches in many other colonies in the british america but to return home  in      the more moderate baptists published a small treatise wherein they endeavored to justify their separation from the church of england and to prove that every man has a right to judge for himself in matters of religion and that to persecute any on that account is illegal and antichristian contrary to the laws of god as well as to several declarations of the kings majesty they also assert their opinion concerning baptism and show the invalidity of the baptism which was administered either in the established church or among the other dissenters and clear themselves of several errors unjustly cast upon them it appears to be written or approved of by the whole body of baptists who then remained in england they subscribe themselves christs unworthy ministers and his majestys faithful subjects commonly called anabaptists  i shall from this treatise inform my readers what were in general the opinions of this denomination at this period they acknowledge magistracy to be gods ordinance and that kings and such as are in authority ought to be obeyed in all civil matters not only for fear but also for conscience sake they allow the taking of an oath to be lawful and declare that all their profession were willing in faithfulness and truth to subscribe the oath of allegiance they protest against the doctrine of the papists that princes excommunicated by the pope may be deposed or murdered by their subjects calling it a damnable and accursed doctrine which their souls abhor and also against the errors of the familists who to avoid persecution can comply with any external form of religion they confess that christ took his flesh of the virgin mary and for their orthodoxy in these and other points refer the reader to their confession of faith published in      they acknowledged that many called anabaptists held several strange opinions contrary to them but lament it and clear themselves from deserving any censure upon that account by showing that it was so in the primitive church and yet christ did not condemn all for the errors of some but that which they chiefly inveigh against is the pride luxury and oppression of the lords bishops or pretended spiritual power whereby they were exposed to great hardships and cruel persecutions having in their preface mentioned that text the kings of the earth shall give their power unto the beast if it be granted say they that the kings of this nation formerly have given their power to the romish beast it shall evidently appear that our lord the king and all magistrates under him do give their power unto the same beast though the beast be in another shape  our most humble desire of our lord the king is that he would not give his power to force his faithfulsubjects to dissemble to believe as he believes in the least measure of persecution though it is no small persecution to lie many years in filthy prisons in hunger cold idleness divided from wise family calling left in continual miseries and temptations so as death would be to many less persecution again showing how near the prelatical power and usurpation came to the bloody spiritual power of the roman catholics they say how many only for seeking reformation have been put to death by your power in the days of queen elizabeth and how many both then and since have been consumed to death in prisons yea since that spiritual power has been set up has not hanging burning exile imprisonments and all manner of contempts been used and all for religion although some for grievous errors and yet you see not this to be a bloody rellgion  let they say in another place mr fox or any others who have described the spiritual power of rome let but their description thereof be compared with the spiritual power in all their laws courts titles pomp pride and cruelty and you shall see them very little differ except in their cruelties which glory be to god the kings majesty who thirsts not after blood has somewhat restrained although it is most grievous cruelty to lie diverse years in most noisome and filthy prisons and continual temptations of want their estates overthrown and never coming out many of them till death let it be well weighed and it is little inferior to the cruel sudden death in times of the romish power in this nation after all they conclude with an hearty prayer for their enemies that the lord would give them repentance that their sins may not be laid to their charge even for christs sake  notwithstanding this declaration their sufferings were rather increased than lessened they were not only harrassed in the spiritual courts but the temporal sword was used against them their goods seized their persons confined for many years in stinking goals where they were deprived of their wives children and friends till god was pleased to release numbers of them by death  many other attempts they made in the reign of james to obtain a toleration but without effect yet they daily gained ground in that of charles the first they suffered with the rest of the puritans still greater persecutions and in the year      the baptists began to separate themselves from the puritans and to form societies distinct and apart of those of their own persuasion in      was a dispute between the famous dr featley and four anabaptists in southwark an account of which the doctor published though a very doubtful and partial one in the dedication to which he says that he could hardly dip his pen in any thing but gall a sure proof of his unrighteous spirit it was published with the following title the dippers dipped or the anabaptists dipped and plunged over head and ears in a disputation lately held in southwark etc etc  what greatly contributed to the increase of antipoedobaptism in these times was that some of the greatest writers for reformation spoke favorably of that opinion and the reasonableness of granting liberty to those who held it such were robert lord brook mr daniel rogers bishop tailor and dr hammond in  0   the baptists published their confession of faith of which several editions were printed in      and      one of which was licensed by authority and dedicated to the parliament their very adversaries were obliged to own this confession was in general orthodox and could object very little against it except the denial of infant baptism and making immersion necessary to the right administration of that ordinance however they were now persecuted by the intolerant presbyterians as they had before been by the rigid episcopalians but in march      a declaration of the lords and commons was published in their favor induced thereto by the great numbers of them then in the army and in most corporations of england it had the following words  the name of anabaptism has indeed contracted much odium by reason of the extravagant principles and practices of some of that name in germany tending to the disturbance of the government and peace of all states which opinions and practices we abhor and detest but for their opinion against the baptism of infants it is only a difference about a circumstance of time in the administration of an ordinance wherein in former ages as well as this learned men have differed both in opinion and practice and though we could wish that all men would satisfy themselves and join with us in our judgment and practice in this point yet herein we hold it fit that men should be convinced by the word of god with great gentleness and reason and not beaten out of it with force and violence etc it should seem however this christian temper in the parliament was but of short duration for in      they published a cruel ordinance for the punishing of blasphemies and heresies by which every sect but the rigid presbyterians were condemned and upon this ordinance several baptists were prosecuted for denying the validity of infant baptism  the short rest they enjoyed toward the close of the usurped government had a period by the restoration of king charles ii in which they concurred with sincerity from whom or rather his ministers and clergy they soon experienced equal hardships with other dissenters and were persecuted in all parts of the kingdom with imprisonment loss of goods etc etc upon venners insurrection they published two apologies wherein they protested against the principles and practices of him and his adherents and it is certain there were no baptists amongst them nevertheless the persecution of them was not ceased and if possible they still met with harder measure than besore so that in about eighteen weeks only many upon account of that insurrection were kept close prisoners above four hundred were crowded into newgate besides what were in other prisons but at the coronation an act of indemnity being granted to all offenders save murderers they were all set at liberty yet in vain were all their petitions and remonstrances in vain the many sensible vindications they published of their principles and practices they were every where in this reign loaded with fines hardships reproach and abuse about the year      the baptists had several disputes with the quakers which ended to their advantage in      they published a confession of their faith put forth by the elders and brethren of many congregations of christians baptized upon profession of their faith in london and the country  to survey the sufferings of the pious and worthy persons who encountered all perils for the sake of a good conscience amongst the baptists though it would draw tears from the sympathetic eye yet must at the same time inspire the reader with the same holy confidence and resolution they in general exerted under their persecutions and bonds and i must think their fortitude proceeded from the secret influence of a superior and unseen power which strengthened them in the day of trial  the baptists suffered severely in the reign of james ii till his declaration for liberty of conscience relieved them and their persecuted brethren of the other denominations of dissenters at length the glorious revolution and the consequent toleration of protestant dissenters restored them to the public profession of their principles the face of things being thus changed it presently appeared how ineffectual those cruel and barbarous methods fines imprisonments etc were to stop the growth and increase of the english baptists for soon after it appeared by the narrative of the proceedings of a general assembly there were more than one hundred congregations of them assembled together to consult of proper ways and means to advance the glory of god and the well being of their churches a general fast was ordered by this assembly to be kept by all the congregations and the causes and reasons thereof sent to all the churches at this general assembly which was every day opened and concluded with solemn prayer were present upwards of one hundred and fifty persons and so united were their hearts in the spirit of love and sweet concord that in their debates consultations and resolves they say scarcely one brother dissented from the assembly in the sentiments of his mind in any one thing proposed to their serious consideration this general assembly sept   considered and concluded that a public fund or stock was necessary toward maintaining and supporting a regular ministry and came to a resolution how to raise it and unanimously concluded that it should be raised by a free will offering that every person should communicate according to his ability and as the lord shall make him willing and enlarge his heart and that the churches severally among themselves do order the collection of it with all convenient speed that the ends proposed may be put into present practice  the uses to which this fund was to be applied were   to communicate thereof to those churches that are not able to maintain their own ministry and that their ministers may be encouraged wholly to devote themselves to the great work of preaching the gospel   to send ministers that are ordained or at least solemnly called to preach both in city and country where the gospel has or has not been preached and to visit the churches and these to be chosen out of the churches in london or the country which ministers are to be approved of and sent forth by two churches at the least but more if it may be   to assist those members that shall be found in any of the aforesaid churches that are disposed for study have an inviting gift and are sound in fundamentals in attaining to the knowledge and understanding of the languages latin greek and hebrew  the baptists history from this happy era of the act of toleration is not such as to come within the compass of my proposed plan i have brought them to the safe enjoyment of their religious liberties since that was afforded to them by the wisdom of the legislature their history to the present day can consist of little but acts of internal discipline the meetings and acts of their assemblies and a few controversies which have agitated them relating to the doctrine of the trinity psalmsinging etc etc they have dutifully with the other denominations addressed the throne upon all interesting public occasions and have been concerned with them in the several applications for the repeal of the corporation and test acts  as the baptists are divided into two bodies called general and particular before i lay before my readers their sentiments in point of doctrine i shall give an account of their method of performing the rite of baptism in which they are all agreed with very little variation particularly as it is that peculiar practice by which they are distinguished  it will be proper to premise that the person to be baptized is previously instructed in the principles of the christian religion of the nature of baptism the design prerequisite qualifications the manner in which it ought to be administered and the advantages resulting from it that from a persuasion of its being then his duty he may voluntarily offer and desire to be baptized the minister then with some of that society converse with him or her after which at the time and place appointed which is usually the next sabbath day sometimes after the morningservice at other times after the afternoonservice and at other times on some other day of the week the rite is performed when there is usually a sermon suitable to that occasion and the minister uses a short address to the person to be baptized to the following purpose  in presenting yourself before god and these witnesses and members of his church to be baptized in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit and into the profession of the christian religion we presume in charity and have good reason to believe you are determined by the clear and strong sense of your duty and with such dispositions as your own conscience approves such as are acceptable to god and through his blessing upon your faithful endeavors will terminate in the improvement and happiness of your soul etc then the minister enlarges on the grounds and authority of christs instituting the ordinance of baptism unless a sermon is preached on the subject  the minister proceeds to explain what is properly to be understood by being baptized into the name of the father son and holy ghost  he likewise enlarges on the moral use and influence of baptism  on the qualifications demanded in scripture of all persons to whom christian baptism is to be administered as that which can justify a minister therein and in vindication of this mode of baptism  then the minister addressing himself to the person asks him these questions  minister will you declare in the church and presence of god who cannot be deceived and will not be mocked that you believe that jesus christ is the son of god  answer i believe that jesus christ is the son of god  minis is it your affectionate reverence for the authority and institution of jesus christ that induces you at this time to offer yourself to be baptized into the profession of his holy name and religion  ans yes  minis are you resolved to renounce every known and presumptuous sin to obey the precepts and follow the example of your lord and savior jesus christ and in an humble dependence upon god to adorn the profession of christianity you this day put on by maintaining to the end of your life a conversation becoming the gospel  ans yes  then in some congregations they sing a psalm or hymn adapted to the occasion and then pray at others they proceed to prayer without singing the matter and form of which as recommended in harrisons office of baptism printed in      and given as a specimen appears to be well adapted but i must refer the curious to the book itself  the minister then withdraws to dress himself for the administration as do the persons to be baptized for they have proper dresses for men and women and different apartments with proper attendants on each in the time of intermission another minister or deacon generally reads ps xxvi cxviii   peter iii acts viii romans vi or some other parts of scripture  upon the ministers etc return to the baptistry which at barbican near adlersage street is admirably commodious the minister addressing himself to the person to be baptized says in consequence of your voluntary public and solemn profession of your christian faith penitence and holy resolutions it becomes my duty to baptize you then taking the person by the hand they go down together into the water using these or such like phrases they went down into the water philip with the eunuch and he baptized him  who shall forbid water that these should not be baptized who have made a good profession before many witnesses  sometimes where the former address to the person has been omitted the minister says immediately before the baptism as thou have professed thy faith in jesus christ and desire to be baptized i baptize thee in his name at other times only the scripture form is used i baptize thee in the name of the father of the son and of the holy ghost at coming up out of the water some significant phrase is usually made use of as  we are buried with him by baptism  thus it becomes us to fulfill all righteousness etc  then the minister and the baptized retire and some other minister generally concludes with singing a psalm or hymn and then prayer the person thus baptized is deemed a member of the society and consequently has a right to partake of the lords supper in that church or any other of the same denomination  but here in many congregations it must be acknowledged they practice laying on of hands of the minister on the party baptized with prayer before their admission to communion this is sometimes considered as a primitive practice which was always at least generally performed soon after baptism and mentioned heb vi etc  others assert that the imposition of hands by the apostles and first ministers of the christian church was generally attended with extraordinary effects as evidences of their mission but as no mention is made of this in the history of our saviors life and these effects ceased with the apostles it is thought by many who submit to baptism of no standing obligation in the christian church and is consequently dispensed with by ministers of several congregations where there is not a persuasion of its lawfulness and expedience  the two parties of baptists in england which have subsisted ever since their first appearance as a sect are the particular baptists viz those that have followed the doctrines of calvin and from the principal point thereof personal election are so called see vol ii of this work p      the general baptists who profess the arminian or remonstrant tenets and have from the chief of those doctrines universal redemption see id p      been so denominated these last have also their general assembly annually held at london in the whitsunweek  the chief heads of belief and doctrine of the particular baptists i must draw from the various confessions of their faith which have appeared in the world from time to time which vary little from each other noting afterward in what some of the present particular baptists differ this i shall be obliged to do as briefly as possible  they believe in one god whose subsistence is in himself whose essence cannot be comprehended by any but himself who only has immortality dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto who is in himself most holy every way infinite in greatness power wisdom love merciful and gracious longsuffering and abundant in goodness and truth who gives being moving and preservation to all creatures that in god there is the father the word and the holy spirit yet one god that god has decreed concerning all things before the world was created whether necessary accidental or voluntary yet without being the author of sin that he has preordained some men to eternal life through jesus christ to the praise and glory of his grace leaving the rest in their sin to their just condemnation to the praise of his justice that god made all things good but by adams transgression death came upon all his posterity who now are conceived in sin and by nature the children of wrath the subject of death and every misery in this world and for ever unless christ set them free that neither good or evil befall any by chance or without gods providence and that whatsoever befalls the elect is by his appointment for his glory and their good that all the elect are redeemed not by themselves nor their own works but only by the free grace and mercy of god through jesus christ that the scriptures are the only rule for holiness and obedience that jesus christ is the son of god by whom he made and upholdeth the world that he was begat by the holy ghost born of the virgin mary was tempted as we are yet without sin that jesus christ is the mediator and prophet priest and king of the church of god for ever that he was appointed by god unto this office from everlasting and in respect of his manhood from the womb called separated and anointed most fully and abundantly with all gifts necessary god having without measure poured out his spirit upon him that he is by the special promise of god ordained to the office of mediator which promise is that christ should be made a sacrifice for sin etc all of mere free and absolute grace toward gods elect and without any condition foreseen in them to procure it that the office of mediator that is to be prophet priest and king of the church of god cannot be transferred from christ to any other that he might be a prophet every way complete it was necessary he should be god and also that he should be man for unless he had been god he never could perfectly have understood the will of god and unless he had been man he could not suitably have unfolded it in his own person to men that by the sacrifice of christ for sin he has finally finished and suffered all things required for the salvation of gods elect etc that jesus christ by his death did purchase salvation to the elect that god gave unto him that these only have interest in him and fellowship with him for whom he makes intercession with his father in their behalf and to them alone does god by his spirit apply this redemption as also the free gift of eternal life is given to them and none else that faith is the gift of god wrought in the hearts of the elect by the spirit of god that all those who have that precious faith wrought in them by the spirit can never finally nor totally fall away seeing the gifts of god are without repentance and the names of the elect have been written in the book of life from all eternity that faith is ordinarily begotten by the preaching of the gospel or word of christ without any power or agency in the creature but it being wholly passive and dead in trespasses and sins does believe and is converted by no less power than that which raised christ from the dead that all believers are by christ united to god that they are the sons of god and joint heirs with christ to whom belong all the promises of this life and that which is to come that they are justified from all their sins by the blood of christ that sanctification is a spiritual grace that all believers in the time of this life are in a continual warfare and combat against sin self the world and the devil being predestined and appointed thereunto and whatsoever the saints enjoy or possess of god spiritually is by faith and outward and temporal things are lawfully enjoyed by a civil right by them who have no faith that jesus christ has here on earth a spiritual kingdom which is his church whom he has purchased and redeemed to himself as a peculiar inheritance which church is a company of visible saints called and separated from the world by the word and spirit of god to the visible profession of the faith of the gospel being baptized into that faith and joined to the lord and each to other by mutual agreement in the practical enjoyment of the ordinances commanded by christ their head and king that to this church he has made his promises and gives the signs of his covenant presence acceptance love blessing and protection that being thus joined every church has power given them from christ for their wellbeing to choose among themselves meet persons for elders and deacons that the ministers lawfully called as aforesaid ought carefully to feed the flock of christ committed to them not for filthy lucre but of a ready mind that the ministers of christ ought to have whatsoever they shall need supplied freely by the church that according to christs ordinance they that preach the gospel should live of the gospel by the law of christ that baptism is an ordinance of the new testament given by christ to be dispensed upon persons professing faith or that are made disciples who upon profession of faith ought to be baptized and after to partake of the lords supper that the way and manner of dispensing this ordinance is dipping or plunging the body under water that it being a sign must answer the things signified which is that interest the saints have in the death burial and resurrection of christ and that as certainly as the body is buried under water and risen again so certainly shall the bodies of the faints be raised by the power of christ in the day of the resurection to reign with him that the person designed by christ to dispense baptism the scripture declares should be a disciple it being no where tied to a particular church officer or person extraordinarily sent the commission enjoining the administration being given to them as considered disciples being men able to preach the gospel that christ has given power to his church to receive in and cast out any member that deserves it and this power is given to every congregation and not to one particular person either member or officer but in relation to the whole body in reference to their faith and fellowship that every member of each church is subject to this censure and judgment and that the church ought not without great care and tenderness and due advice but by the rule of faith to proceed against her members that for the keeping of this church in holy and orderly communion he places some special men over the church who by their office are to govern oversee visit watch so likewise for the better keeping thereof in all places by the members he has given authority and laid duty upon all to watch over one another that such to whom god has given gifts in the church may and ought to prophesy according to the proportion of faith and so to teach publicly the word of god for the edification exhortation and comfort of the church that this being rightly gathered and continuing in obedience to the gospel of christ none are to separate faults and corruptions for as long as the church consists of men subject to failings there will be no difference in the true constituted church until they have in due order and tenderness sought redress thereof that although the particular congregations be distinct and several bodies yet are they all to walk by one rule of truth are to have the counsel and help one another if necessity require it as members of one body in the common faith under christ their head that all due subjection be yielded to the civil magistrate and supplication and prayers be made for kings and all that are in authority that under them we may live a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty that we are to witness to the truth of the scriptures unto death if required in the midst of all trials and afflictions as his saints of old have done not accounting our goods lands wives children etc etc yea and our own lives dear unto us so we may finish our course with joy remembering always that we ought to obey god rather than men who will when we have finished our course and kept the faith give us a crown of righteousness to whom we must give an account of all our actions and no man being able to discharge us thereof that it is lawful for a christian to be a magistrate or civil officer to take an oath for confirmation of truth that there shall be a resurrection of the dead both of the just and unjust and every one shall give an account of himself to god that every one may receive the things done in his body according to what he has done whether it be good or bad  some of the particular baptists differ from the majority in the following particulars viz   they deny that the second person in god is either begotten or set up applying all those scriptures that speak of christs being brought forth set up etc to the human nature so maintaining a perfect equality among the persons in the godhead johnsons mathematical question p    etc allens chain of truth lately published spiritual magazine vol ii p             they deny an absolute predestination of whatsoever should come to pass believing only that god predestined a certain number of men to the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself in subserviency whereunto all other things in heaven and earth were created   cor iv    and are governed johnsons evangelical truths vindicated introd and chap    of consequence they believe that god could accomplish this without obliging man to be a sinner johnsons evangelical truths vindicated introd and chap    and then naturally   they deny that god is the author of sin as some have asserted dr gills piece on the supralapsarian scheme mr brines motives to love and unity among calvinists etc p     they also differ from the others concerning what faith is and concerning redemption for an account of which see evangelical truths etc chap   and the election of god undisguised p         a brief confession of faith of the general baptists printed first in    0 and afterward

messengers to those ministers whom they particularly desired to act in this affair and gave a general invitation to all the rest to honor them with their presence on this occasion  the assembly being come together at the meetinghouse in barbican on the day appointed mr foxwell went first up into the pulpit and read the third and fourth chapters of the first epistle to timothy after which he prayed for that church for the persons called to offices in it for the presence of god and the assistance of his grace in the duties to be that day performed next mr benj stinton went up and preached a sermon from phil i   from whence according to the province assigned him he endeavored to explain the office and duties both of an elder and deacons then followed mr nathaniel hodges who chose for his text tit i   from whence he took occasion among other things to explain and vindicate the form of ordination after this the ministers and those who were to be ordained being together in the middle of the meeting place where the communiontable used to stand mr stinton according to appointment stood up and said it is desired that all those who are members of the church which usually meets in this place would draw together in the middle of the meeting house and that the rest of the assembly would separate themselves either by going into the galleries or the remote parts of the place then directing his speech particularly to the church he said we have been informed by messengers from you that you have chosen our honored and beloved brother mr joseph buroughs this worthy and pious divine died between two and three years since at his house in st johns square clerkenwell after a long life of usefulness as a minister and of virtue and benevolence as a man  to be your elder or overseer in the lord and have accordingly desired him to take that office upon him it will however be proper that you should now in a more public manner and before this assembly declare and confirm your said choice all you therefore who do approve of and confirm the choice you have made of mr joseph buroughs to be your pastor and desire that he should now be ordained to that office be pleased to signify it by the lifting up of your hands when they had so done the negative was put but no hand lifted up against it then he turned to mr joseph buroughs and said brother joseph buroughs as this church has unanimously chosen and called you to be their pastor and do earnestly desire that you would take upon you that honorable though difficult office so we desire you to signify unto us whether you do accept of their call and are willing for the sake of christ and the good of this community to be put into this office hereupon mr buroughs signified that it had been his desire for many years past to be useful to the souls of men in the work of the ministry and that this continued to be the free choice of his mind in preference to any other employment that in pursuance of this desire he had applied himself to the study of the holy scriptures and to other exercises that might prepare him for public usefulness that he wished he had made better improvement of his time and was deeply sensible of his insufficiency for discharging the work to which he was called suitably to its great importance but was willing to use his best endeavors and placed his hope in the goodness of god who he was assured was able to make him successful that the unanimity which this church had shown in choosing him for their pastor gave him an encouraging prospect of doing good amongst them and therefore he declared that he took the oversight of this flock not by constraint but willingly and should reckon himself obliged by his acceptance of this peoples call to be their pastor and by being solemnly set apart for the office to be their remembrancer in the doctrines and precepts of the christian religion and to watch for their souls as one that must hereafter give an account and that he was determined in every part of his proceeding to make the holy scripture his only rule and standard then after a short prayer suitable to the occasion the ministers present laid their right hands upon his head and mr stinton in the name of the whole pronounced the words of ordination as follows  brother joseph buroughs we do in the name of our lord jesus christ and with the consent of this church ordain thee to be an elder bishop or overseer of this church of jesus christ and their hands continuing on his head mr stinton put up a short prayer to god for him and the congregation it must be observed here that there are some amongst the baptists who object against this form of ordination though usually performed in their churches believing it savours too much of mens asseming too great power to themselves in their setting others apart to the ministry and also believing that the apostles themselves in ordinations used not this form we ordain thee and therefore decline pronouncing any words of ordination and only pray to god for a blessing on the pastor elect laying their hands upon his head which they hold is ordination sufficient and all that they know with certainty respecting the practice of the apostles who laid their hands over the persons whom they set apart and prayed to god in their behalf   after the ordination of mr buroughs they proceeded to the ordination of two deacons which was after this manner mr stinton stood up and said we must now address ourselves again to you the members of the congregation that statedly worship god in this place we were informed by your messengers aforesaid that you have chosen two persons from amongst yourselves unto the office of deacons in this church of christ viz brother matthew shelswell and brother george reynolds it will therefore be necessary that you should in this as you have in the other case declare and confirm your election all you therefore that do approve and confirm your former choice of brother matthew shelswell to be a deacon in this church and desire that he may now be ordained to that service be pleased to signify it by the lifting up of your hands and then the negative was put after this the same question was put both in the affirmative and negative with respect unto the other and it appeared they were both unanimously chosen and upon being asked whether they accepted the churchs call to this work and were willing to take this office upon them they answered they were then the deacons elect kneeled down and the ministers laying their right hands upon their heads ordained them mr mulliner putting up a prayer to god suitable to this part of the solemnity and then he went up into the pulpit and preached from   thessalonians v       in which according to the province assigned him he treated of the duties of the members of a christian church to their officers both elders and deacons after which he prayed then a psalm of thanksgiving was sung at the conclusion of which the assembly was dismissed with one of the apostolical benedictions  the history of the quakers the history of this sect or brotherhood should be drawn with a very impartial pen they have from their differing not only in the fundamentals but in dress and form of speech from other christians if i may be permitted to call them so been subject to the most low and illiberal abuse the writers of other sentiments have stored up so many calumnies and falsehoods when they have had occasion to mention them that it is a difficult task to separate fiction from fact therefore as my intent is to afford impartial justice to my subject i think i cannot better do so than by recurring to their own writers not only for their history but for an account of their doctrine and discipline  the appellative quakers was bestowed upon them as a name of reproach and contempt taken from the strugglings and agitations visible in their speakers or preachers when under those influences they esteemed divine they modestly acquiesce in making use of this term when they address the throne and in their common transactions with the world but the name they use amongst themselves is that of friends sewells history folio p   and      which they borrow from primitive example viz the friends salute thee  greet the friends etc etc john iii ephesians xiv acts xxvii   etc  however agreeable to the gospel the sentiments of these people may be found for from different senses and interpretations of scripture most of the sects amongst us derive themselves it is certain the first leader of this sect as a separate body was george fox born in leicestershire about the year      not at drayton in lancashire as neale says  he was descended of honest and sufficient parents who brought him up in the national religion penns account of the rise and progress of the quakers edit   p     but from a child he appeared religious still solid and observing beyond his years and uncommonly knowing in divine things he was brought up to husbandry and other countrybusiness and was particularly inclined to the solitary occupation of a shepherd an employment says my author that very well suited his mind in several respects both for its innocence and solitude and was a just emblem of his after ministry and service in the year      he entirely forsook the national church in whose tenets he had been brought up as before observed and in      he traveled into derbyshire and nottinghamshire without any set purpose of visiting particular places but in a solitary manner he walked through several towns and villages which way soever his mind turned he fasted much says sewell and walked often in retired places with no other companion but his bible he visited the most retired and religious people in those parts says penn and some there were short of few if any in this nation who waited for the consolation of israel night and day as zacharias anna and simeon did of old time to these he was sent and these he sought out in the neighboring counties and among them he sojourned till his more ample ministry came upon him at this time he taught and was an example of silence endeavoring to bring them from selfperformances testifying of and turning them to the light of christ within them and encouraging them to wait in patience and to feel the power of it to stir in their hearts that their knowledge and worship of god might stand in the power of an endless life which was to be found in the light as it was obeyed in the manifestation of it in man for in the word was life and that life is the light of men life in the word light in men and life in men too as the light is obeyed the children of the light living by the life of the word by which the word begets them again to god which is the regeneration and new birth without which there is no coming into the kingdom of god and to which whoever comes is greater than john that is than johns dispensation which was not that of the kingdom but the consummation of the legal and fore running of the gospel times the time of the kingdom accordingly several meetings were gathered in those parts and thus his time was employed for some years  in the year      he had a visitation of the great work of god in the earth and of the way that he was to go forth in a public ministry to begin it he directed his course northward and in every place where he came if not before he came to it he had his particular exercise and service shown to him so that the lord was his leader indeed he made great numbers of converts to his opinions and many pious and good men joined him in his ministry some of the most eminent were richard farnsworth james naylor william dewsberry thomas aldam francis howgil edward buroughs john camm john audland richard hubberthorne etc etc who were the first preachers amongst the quakers  these were drawn forth especially to visit the public assemblies to reprove reform and exhort them sometimes in markets fairs streets and by the highwayside calling people to repentance and to return to the lord with their hearts as well as their mouths directing them to the light of christ within them to see examine and consider their ways by and to eschew the evil and do the good and acceptable will of god  they were not without opposition in the work they imagined themselves called to being often set in the stocks stoned beaten whipped and imprisoned though as my author observes honest men of good report that had left wives children houses and lands to visit them with a living call to repentance but these coercive methods rather forwarded than abated their zeal and in those parts they brought over many proselytes and amongst them several magistrates and others of the better sort they apprehended the lord had forbid them to pull off their hats to any one high or low and required them to speak to the people without distinction in the language of thou and thee they scrupled bidding people good morrow or goodnight nor might they bend the knee to any one even in supreme authority both men and women went in a plain and simple dress different from the fashion of the times they neither gave nor accepted any titles of respect or honor nor would they call any man master on earth several texts of scripture they quoted in defense of these singularities such as swear not at all  how can ye believe who receive honor one of another and seek not the honor which comes from god only etc etc they placed the basis of religion in an inward light and an extraordinary impulse of the holy spirit  in      their first separate meeting in london was held in the house of robert dring in watling street for by that time they had spread themselves into all parts of the kingdom and had in many places set up meetings or assemblies particularly in lancashire and the adjacent parts but they were still exposed to great persecutions and trials of every kind one of them in a letter to the protector oliver cromwell represents that though there are no penal laws in force obliging men to comply with the established religion yet the quakers are exposed upon other accounts they are fined and imprisoned for refusing to take an oath for not paying their tithes for disturbing the public assemblies and meeting in the streets and places of public resort some of them have been whipped for vagabonds and for their plain speeches to the magistrate  under favor of the then toleration they opened their meeting at the bull and mouth inn in aldersgate street where women as well as men were moved to speak their zeal transported them to some extravagances which laid them still more open to the lash of their enemies who exercised various severities upon them throughout the next reign upon the suppression of venners mad insurrection see vol iii of this work p      the government having published a proclamation forbidding the anabaptists quakers and fifthmonarchy men to assemble or meet together under pretense of worshipping god except it be in some parochial church chapel or in private houses by the persons there inhabiting all meetings in other places being declared to be unlawful and riotous etc etc etc the quakers thought it expedient to address the king thereon which they did in the following words  oh king charles  our desire is that thou may live for ever in the fear of god and thy council we beseech thee and thy council to read these following lines in tender bowels and compassion for our souls and for your good  and this consider we are about four hundred imprisoned in and about this city of men and women from their families besides in the county goals about ten hundred we desire that our meetings may not be broken up but that all may come to a fair trial that our innocence may be cleared up   london   th day eleventh month    0  on the   th of the same month they published the declaration referred to in their address entitled a declaration from the harmless and innocent people of god called quakers against all sedition plotters and fighters in the world for removing the ground of jealousy and suspicion from both magistrates and people in the kingdom concerning wars and fightings it was presented to the king the   st day of the eleventh month    0 and he promised them upon his royal word that they should not suffer for their opinions as long as they lived peaceably but his promises were very little regarded afterward  in      they assumed courage to petition the house of lords for a toleration of their religion and for a dispensation from taking the oaths which they held unlawful not from any disaffection to the government or a belief that they were less obliged by an affirmation but from a persuasion that all oaths were unlawful and that swearing upon the most solemn occasions was forbidden in the new testament their petition was rejected and instead of granting them relief an act was passed against them the preamble to which set forth that whereas several persons have taken up an opinion that an oath even before a magistrate is unlawful and contrary to the word of god and whereas under pretense of religious worship the said persons do assemble in great numbers in several parts of the kingdom separating themselves from the rest of his majestys subjects and the public congregations and usual places of divine worship be it therefore enacted that if any such persons after the   th of march       shall refuse to take an oath when lawfully tendered or persuade others to do it or maintain in writing or otherwise the unlawfulness of taking an oath or if they shall assemble for religious worship to the number of five or more of the age of fifteen they shall for the first offense forfeit five pounds for the second ten pounds and for the third shall abjure the realm or be transported to the plantations and the justices of peace at their open sessions may hear and finally determine in the affair  this act had a most dreadful effect upon the quakers though it was well known and notorious these conscientious persons were far from sedition or disaffection to the government george fox in his address to the king acquaints him that three thousand and sixtyeight of their friends had been imprisoned since his majestys restoration that their meetings were daily broken up by men with clubs and arms and their friends thrown into the water and trampled under foot till the blood gushed out which gave rise to their meeting in the open streets a relation was printed signed by twelve witnesses which says that more than four thousand two hundred quakers were imprisoned and of them five hundred were in and about london and the suburbs several of whom were dead in the goals  however they even gloried in their sufferings which increased every day so that in      and the intermediate years they were harrassed without example as they persisted resolutely to assemble openly at the bull and mouth beforementioned the soldiers and other officers dragged them from thence to prison till newgate was filled with them and multitudes died of close confinement in that and other goals  six hundred of them says an account published at this time were in prison merely for religionsake of whom several were banished to the plantations in short says mr neale the quakers gave such full employment to the informers that they had less leisure to attend the meetings of other dissenters  yet under all these calamities they behaved with patience and modesty toward the government and upon occasion of the ryehouse plot see vol iii of this work p     in      thought proper to declare their innocence of that sham plot in an address to the king wherein appealing to the searcher of all hearts they say  sewells history p     their principles do not allow them to take up defensive arms much less to avenge themselves for the injuries they receive from others that they continually pray for the kings safety and preservation and therefore take this occasion humbly to beseech his majesty to compassionate their suffering friends with whom the goals are so filled that they want air to the apparent hazard of their lives and to the endangering an infection in diverse places besides many houses shops barns and fields are ransacked and the goods corn and cattle swept away to the discouraging of trade and husbandry and impoverishing great numbers of quiet and industrious people and this for no other cause but for the exercise of a tender conscience in the worship of almighty god who is sovereign lord and king in mens consciences   on the accession of james ii they addressed that monarch honestly and plainly telling him  ibid p     we are come to testify our sorrow for the death of our good there was some reason for this epither they knew he would have gladly tolerated them if it had been in his power at the same time to tolerate the romancatholics friend charles and our joy for thy being made our governor we are told thou art not of the persuasion of the church of england no more than we therefore we hope thou will grant us the same liberty which thou allowest thyself which doing we wish thee all manner of happiness  when james by his dispensing power granted liberty to the dissenters they began to enjoy some rest from their troubles and indeed it was high time for they were swelled to an enormous amount they the year before this to them glad release in a petition to james for a cessation of their sufferings set forth  sewell p         that of late above one thousand five hundred of their friends both men and women were in prison and that now there remain one thousand three hundred and eightythree of which two hundred are women many under sentence of praemunire and more than three hundred near it for refusing the oath of allegiance because they could not swear three hundred and fifty have died in prison since the year    0 in london the goal of newgate has been crowded within this two years sometimes with near twenty in a room whereby several have been suffocated and others who have been taken out sick have died of malignant fevers within a few days great violences outrageous distresses and woeful havoc and spoil have been made upon peoples goods and estates by a company of idle extravagant and merciless informers by persecutions on the conventicleact and others the acts or penal statutes on which they suffered were these some few on stat    hen viii cap  0 others on   eliz cap   for one shilling a sunday    eliz cap    de excom capiendo     eliz cap   for twenty pounds amonth     eliz cap   for continuation     eliz cap   for abjuring the realm on pain of death    jac i cap   for praemunire imprisonment during life and estates confiscated    th and   th of king charles ii against quakers etc transportation     charles ii cap   against nonconformists     car   cap   against seditious conventicles  n b the quakers were not much affected with the corporation and test acts because they would not take an oath nor with the oxford fivemile act which had so baneful an effect upon other dissenters    also on qui tam writs and on other processes for twenty pounds amonth and two thirds of their estates seized for the king some had not a bed left to rest on others had no cattle to till the ground nor corn for seed or bread nor tools to work with the said informers and bailiffs in some places breaking into houses and making great waste and spoil under pretense of serving the king and the church our religious assemblies have been charged at common law with being riotous routs and disturbances of the peace whereby great numbers have been confined in prisons without regard to age or sex and many in holes and dungeons the seizures for twenty pounds amonth have amounted to several thousand pounds sometimes they have seized for eleven months at once and made sale of all goods and chattles both within doors and without for payment several who have employed some hundreds of poor families in manufacture are by those writs and seizures disabled as well as by long imprisonment one in particular who employed two hundred people in the woollen manufacture many informers especially imprudent women whose husbands are in prison swear for their share of the profits of the seizures the fines upon one justices warrant have amounted to many hundred pounds frequently ten pounds a warrant and five warrants together for fifty pounds to one man and for nonpayment all his goods carried away by cartloads they spare neither widow nor fatherless nor poor families nor leave them so much as a bed to lie upon thus the informers are both witnesses and parties to the ruin of great numbers of sober families and justices of peace have been threatened with the forfeiture of one hundred pounds if they do not issue out warrants upon their informations with this petition they presented a list of their friends in prison in the several counties amounting to    0  upon the declaration of king james for liberty of conscience and as before the king had sent an order to the lord mayor of london to dispense with the quakers not swearing or at least not to fine them if they refused to serve they addressed the king thus may it please the king  though we are not the first in this of addressing way yet we are not the least sensible of the great favors we are come to present the king our humble open and hearty thanks for we rejoice to see the day that a king of england should from his royal seat so universally assert this royal principle that conscience ought not to be restrained nor people forced for matters of religion etc etc     they partook with the other dissenters from the legal establishment of religion of that invaluable blessing liberty of conscience at the revolution and the reader is already acquainted with the fate of their petition to have these words in the presence of almighty god omitted in their solemn affirmation see vol iii p     and since that they have made an attempt to get themselves eased of the burden of tithes which they could not conscientiously pay and for refusal of which they have so greatly suffered but it did not succeed  the settlement of pensilvania where the quakers the first settlers are the majority of the inhabitants and the history of that colony the most flourishing of north america do not come within the compass of my plan and as to the affairs of their several assemblies since the revolution what is necessary to mention thereof will properly occur under the head of their discipline etc etc  they are in the present days a very praiseworthy and inoffensive set of people and by their wise regulations do honor to themselves and are of infinite service in the community  of the religious principles of the quakers their principal distinguishing tenet is the doctrine of an inward light wherewith christ enlighteneth every man and to which they profess to take heed but i shall for the information of my readers be more particular in pointing out what may be called the articles of their faith and this i shall do by an impartial abstract of their belief published in      and signed by the principal persons of that denomination  articles of belief in god jesus christ and the holy spirit we sincerely profess faith in god by his only begotten son jesus christ as being our light and life and our only way to the father and also our only mediator and advocate with the father  we believe that god created all things he made the world by his son jesus christ and that the father the word and the holy spirit are one in divine being inseparable one true living and eternal god blessed for ever  yet that this word or son of god in the fullness of time took flesh became perfect man according to the flesh was miraculously conceived by the holy ghost and born of the virgin mary and also farther declared to be the son of god according to the spirit of sanctification by the resurrection from the dead that in this word was life and the same life was the light of men the life and light within us and that men are to believe in this light christ jesus that as man he died for our sins rose again and was received up into glory he having by that one great universal offering became a sacrifice for peace atonement and reconciliation between god and man  that jesus christ who sits on the right hand of the throne of the majesty in the heavens is our king high priest and prophet in his church and by his spirit also makes intercession in our hearts  that the gospel of the grace of god should be preached in the name of the father son and holy ghost being one in power wisdom and goodness and indivisible in the great work of mans salvation and that divine worship is to be paid to the son from his union or oneness of the father and son and that our prayers are accepted through him  that christs body that was crucified was not the godhead yet by the power of god was raised from the dead changed into a more glorious condition and ascended into heaven and glory true and living faith in christ jesus the son of the living god respects his being and fullness and also his making himself known in the soul in every degree of his light life spirit grace and truth the immediate cause author object and strength of our living faith etc which light and life of the son of god within truly obeyed and followed will bring us to the adoption of sons it is true we are not to undervalue the holy scriptures nor slight the preaching of the word as being outward helps and instruments in the hand of god for the conversion of sinners nor do we set them in opposition to the light or spirit of god or christ within for his faithful messengers are ministers thereof to turn people to the same light and spirit in them  it is certain that great is the mystery of godliness in itself that god should be manifested in the flesh etc  and it is a great and precious mystery of godliness and christianity that christ should be spiritually and effectually manifested in mens hearts  christ is revealed in every true believer freeing them from the bondage of sin as their wisdom righteousness sanctification and redemption this mystery of godliness in its own being and glory in many hid and in some revealed has been and must be testified preached and believed where god is pleased to give commission and prepare peoples hearts for the same  as touching the resurrection of the dead we believe as the scripture testifies that if in this life only we have hope in christ we are of all men most miserable that the soul or spirit of every man and woman shall be reserved in its own distinct and proper being so as there shall be as many souls in the world to come as in this and every seed yea every soul shall have its proper body as god is pleased to give it a natural body is sown a spiritual body is raised and though this corruptible shall put on incorruption and this mortal shall put on immortality the change shall be such as flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of god so we expect our spiritual bodies in the resurrection shall far excel what our bodies now are but how the dead are raised or with what body they come we submit to the wisdom and pleasure of almighty god for we cannot presume to determine  as to the doctrine of the eternal judgment we belive that god has committed all judgment unto the son jesus christ and he is both judge of quick and dead and of the states and ends of all mankind that this son of man who has so deeply suffered and endured so great indignities shall in the last and great day manifestly appear in glory attended with all his glorious heavenly host and retinue to the terror and amazement of those who have denied him but to the glory and triumph of the righteous the faithful followers and friends of christ it is a righteous thing with god that they who suffer with him should appear with him in glory and dignity when he shall appear at last judge of the world and prince thereof  whilst those who now evade and reject the inward convictions and judgment of the light and shut up the records or books thereof in their own conscience they shall be at last opened and every one judged of these things recorded therein according to their works  signed in behalf of our christian profession and people george whitehead ambrose rigg william fallowfield james park charles marshall john bowater john vaughton william bingley   besides these several articles which were in general received and approved there were four articles drawn up and presented to parliament by george whitehead occasioned by a charge of socinianism at that time which are as follow be it known to all that we sincerely believe and profess  i that jesus of nazareth who was born of the virgin mary is the true messiah the christ the son of god to whom all the prophets gave witness and that we do highly value his death sufferings works offices and merits for the redemption of mankind together with his laws doctrine and ministry  ii that this very christ of god who is the lamb of god that takes away the sins of the world was slain was dead and is alive for ever in his divine eternal glory dominion and power with the father  iii that the holy scriptures are of divine authority as being given by inspiration of god  iv and that magistracy or civil government is gods ordinance the good ends thereof being for the punishment of evil doers and the praise of them that do well  some other points of faith or opinion or wherein they are distinguished from the established church and other denominations of christians viz  of the sacraments  of the lords supper they say as for the word sacrament we do not read of it in the scripture but as for the body and blood of christ i own and that there is no remission without blood we do believe according as it is written that christ at his last supper took bread and brake it and gave it to his disciples and also took the cup and blessed it and said unto them and as often as ye do this you show forth the lords death till he come and this we believe they did and did eat their bread in singleness of heart but when christ came again to them according to his promise they said we being many are one bread for we are all partakers of this one bread for there is a difference between that bread which he brake at his last supper wherein they were to show forth his death as in a sign and this whereof they spoke they being many are one bread for herein they were come more into the substance and to speak more mystically as they knew it in the spirit r hubberthorn  baptism any more than the lords supper is not practiced by this people as to the former they say it is not outward washing with water that makes the heart clean by which men are fitted for heaven mr barclay see his masterly and shrewd apology endeavors to prove this proposition viz as there is one lord and one faith so there is one baptism which is not the putting away the filth of the flesh but the answer of a good conscience before god by the resurrection of jesus christ and this baptism is a pure and spiritual thing to wit the baptism of the spirit and fire by which we are buried with him that being washed and purged from our sins we may walk in newness of life of which the baptism of john was a figure which was commanded for a time and not to continue for ever as to the baptism of infants it is a mere human tradition for which neither precept nor practice is to be found in all the scripture concerning the lords supper he advances in his   th proposition that the communion of the body and blood of christ is inward and spiritual which is the participation of his flesh and blood by which the infant man is daily nourished in the hearts of those in whom christ dwells of which things the breaking of bread by christ with his disciples was a figure which they even used in the church for a time who had received the substance for the cause of the weak even as abstaining from things strangled and from blood the washing one anothers feet and the anointing of the sick with oil all which are commanded with no less authority and solemnity than the former yet seeing they are but the shadows of better things they cease in such as have obtained the substance it is not within my province to declare my sentiments of the success with which this famous apologist has endeavored to demonstrate these propositions but i can declare with truth that many pieces in answer thereto which i have read do little honor to the cause they espouse and betray a very rigid and persecuting spirit  the church discipline and government of the people called quakers in the year      i was moved says george fox see his journal  to recommend the setting up of monthly meetings throughout the nation friends hitherto having only had their general quarterly meetings in the beginning says dr rutty the business now properly belonging to the monthly meetings was transacted at the quarterly meetings where a larger body of friends being assembled was more necessary for mutual help and advice especially in those times of suffering and weakness  and the lord opened unto me and let me see what i must do and how mens and womens monthly and quarterly meetings should be ordered and established in england and other nations and that i should write to them where i came not to do the same accordingly having recommended the setting up of five monthly meetings in the city of london to take care of gods glory and to admonish and exhort such as walked disorderly and not according to truth then i passed forth into the counties again and advised that monthly meetings should be settled there also for the same purposes which was done according to the gospelorder in and by the power of god the authority of our meetings being the power of god and in the year      i writ to ireland and to scotland holland barbados and other parts of america advising friends to settle their monthly meetings in those countries also which was accordingly done he afterward visited those countries in person and assisted them in the establishing of those meetings  and indeed the good effects of the settlement of those meetings soon appeared  they did make a great reformation amongst people insomuch that the very justices took notice of the usefulness and service thereof and several who had run out were brought to condemn what they had done amiss and through repentance came in again and many have blessed the lord god that ever he did send me forth in this service now all coming to have a concern and care for gods honor and glory that his name be not blasphemed which they do profess and to see that all who profess the truth do walk in the truth and in righteousness and holiness  thus were monthly meetings for men and women formed for their authority in the latter case see exodus xxxv       romans xvi       phil iv   titus ii         cor xi george fox has thus given us the use of them that the faithful women who were called to the belief of the truth being made partakers of the same precious faith and heirs of the same everlasting gospel of life and salvation might in like manner come into the possession and practice of the gospel order and be therein meethelps to the men in the restoration in the service of the truth in the affairs of the church as they are outwardly in civil or temporal things that so the family of god women as well as men might know possess perform and discharge their offices and services in the house of god whereby the poor might be the better taken care of the younger sort instructed and informed in the way of god the loose and disorderly reproved and admonished in the fear of the lord the clearness of persons propounding marriage more closely and strictly enquired into in the wisdom of god and all the members of the spiritual body the church might watch over and be helpful to one another in love   penns account of the rise and progress of the quakers the monthly meetings so set up were more or fewer as the case required in every respective county four or six meetings of worship usually making one meeting of business and these monthly meetings in each county made up one quarterly meeting where the most zealous and eminent friends of the county assembled to communicate advise and help one another especially when any business seemed difficult or a monthly meeting was tender of determining a matter and these several quarterly meetings digested the reports of their monthly meetings and prepared one for each respective county against the yearly meeting in which all quarterly meetings resolve which is held in london where the churches in this nation and other nations and provinces meet by chosen members of their respective counties both mutually to communicate their church affairs and to advise and be advised in any depending case to edification the minutes of the yearly meeting upon the several matters that have been under consideration therein are drawn up to the end that the respective quarterly and monthly meetings may be informed of all proceedings together with a general exhortation to holiness purity and charity these meetings are opened and usually concluded in their solemn waiting upon god and it is further to be noted in these solemn assemblies for the churchs service there is no one presides among them after the manner of the assemblies of other people christ only being their president as he is pleased to appear in life and wisdom in any one or more of them to whom whatever be their capacity and degree the rest adhere with a firm unity not of authority but conviction which is the divine authority and way of christs power and spirit in his people making good his blessed promise that he would be in the midst of his where and whenever they were met together in his name even to the end of the world  such says dr rutty was the constitution of the several meetings for discipline and the orderly subordination of monthly to quarterly and of these to the yearly meeting this last being the representative of the whole body of the people thus if any brother apprehend himself injured by the determination of a monthly meeting he has liberty of appeal from thence to the quarterly and from this last if ned be to the yearly or national meeting and monthly meetings are so far subordinate to the quarterly that at the yearly meeting      it was agreed that no monthly meeting shall divide itself into two separate monthly meetings either by reason of the decrease of love or any other difference among them in that meeting nor without the consent or concurrence of the quarterly meeting before i close my account of the meetings for discipline it is necessary to observe that there is also another meeting which convenes for the benefit of the whole body in the intervals of the yearly meeting being a deputation or committee of the yearly meeting commonly called the meeting for sufferings which holds correspondence with the several counties and even with other nations in order to solicit for ease from the government in any case of suffering for conscience sake or to be otherwise helpful to any of the inferior meetings on any emergency see dr ruttys treatise of christian discipline   the power and authority exercised by these meetings is such as christ has given penn as before p    to his own people to the end of the world in the persons of his disciples viz to oversee exhort reprove and after long suffering and waiting upon the disobedient and refractory to disown them as any more of their communion or that they will any longer stand charged in the sight and judgment of god or men with their conversation or behavior or any of them until they repent the subjectmatter about which this authority in any of the foregoing branches of it is exercised is first in relation to common and general practice and secondly about those things that more strictly refer to their own character and profession and which distinguish them from all other professors of christianity avoiding two extremes upon which many split viz persecution and libertinism that is a coercive power to whip people into the temple that such as will not conform though against faith and conscience shall be punished in their persons or estates or leaving all loose and at large as to practice and so unaccountable to all but god and the magistrate to which hurtful extreme nothing more has contributed than the abuse of church power by such as suffer their passion and private interests to prevail with them to carry it to outward force and corporal punishment a practice they have been taught to dislike by their extreme sufferings as well as their known principle for an universal liberty of conscience on the other hand they equally dislike an independency in society an unaccountableness in practice and conversation to the rules and terms of their own communion and to those that are the members of it they distinguish between imposing any practice that immediately regards faith or worship which is never to be done or suffered or submitted unto and requiring christian compliance with those methods that only respect churchbusiness in its more civil part and concern and that regard the discreet and orderly maintenance of the character of the society as a sober and religious community in short what is for the promotion of holiness and charity that men may practice what they profess live up to their own principles and not be at liberty to give the lie to their own profession without rebuke is their use and limit of church power they compel none to them but oblige those that are of them to walk suitable or they are denied by them that is all the mark they set upon them and the power they exercise or judge a christian society can exercise upon those that are members of it  the way of their proceeding against such as have lapsed or transgressed is this he is visited by some of them and the matter of fact laid home to him be it any evil practice against known and general virtue or any branch of their particular testimony which he in common professes with them they labor with him in much love and zeal for the good of his soul the honor of god and reputation of their profession to own his fault and condemn it in as ample a manner as the evil or scandal was given by him which for the most part is performed by some written testimony under the parties hand and if it so happen that the party prove refractory and is not willing to clear the truth they profess from the reproach of his or her evil doing or unfaithfulness they after repeated entreaties and due waiting for a token of repentance give forth a paper to disown such a fact and the party offending recording the same as a testimony of their care for the honor of the truth they profess and if he or she shall clear their profession and themselves by sincere acknowledgment of their fault and godly sorrow for so doing they are received and looked upon again as members of their communion for as god so his true people upbraid no man after repentance  as those meetings became established and friends grew in the exercise of christian discipline it was in diverse places judged expedient to choose out of them persons of approved integrity to visit the families of friends whose business in general seems to have been well described in those terms which the nature of the thing rendered familiar among the brethren of watching over one another in love this branch of christian discipline still remains to be exercised in this nation ireland  as well as diverse parts of great britain and america though let drop in some places where it was formerly in practice  these visitors being appointed by the monthly meetings whereof they were members commonly performed their visit to the several families within the limits of their respective meetings once a year or oftener as occasion might require and returned an account of their labors to the meeting which constituted them and when they had performed their visit a new nomination of persons was made for this service the qualifications required in these men are thus described in general terms in the records of the national meeting at the first institution of them viz that they should be just in dealings among men free from worldly encumbrances and all coming up in their places to answer their high and honorable calling according to their capacities and abilities and the general tenor of their commission is thus described that friends might be cautioned against running into any excess or extreme in trading or farming that they might be kept out of airiness in deportment and multiplicity of words in bargaining buying or selling and superfluity in apparel furniture or householdstuff they were not however restricted to these particulars only but in the course of their exercise in this weighty service were led to many other necessary subjects of counsel and admonition and indeed the zeal and vigilance of the brethren in ireland in this branch of discipline was truly memorable of which i think it well worth while to give a short specimen from the writings of an experienced elder joseph pike in an epistle to the national meeting published in dublin a d       and other records viz first of all they that were chosen for visitors met together and after waiting for a time in silence upon the lord any one as he found it upon his mind spoke what appeared to him suitable to the occasion and every one in a tender brotherly manner submitted himself to the examination of his brethren viz how far each one stood clear himself with respect to those things concerning which he was about to advise others such examination being premised they thus proceeded in their visits when they came to a family they sat down with them and first waited a while upon the lord and then as it arose upon the minds of any advice was given them suitable to their respective states and conditions sometimes to all the family together and sometimes to particular persons apart as they saw occasion particularly and principally directing them to the witness of god and gift of his holy spirit in themselves as that by which alone they could grow in truth and witness their hearts cleansed which would work an effectual regulation in their outward demeanor and then they proceeded to the mention of some instances of this as occasion offered and recommended to their observation the particular minutes or advices which had been given forth from meetings but more particularly in these familyvisits friends were exhorted to diligence in the worship of almighty god and a zealous attendance on the meetings appointed for that purpose both on the first days and on other days of the week and not only so but to a fervent exercise of spirit in those meetings and parents masters and mistresses of families were advised to encourage their children and servants in this religious exercise they were also severally advised to answer the high and holy calling of the lord in coming up in their services in the church according to the understanding received and ability of body and substance  next as to trading and dealing  that none might involve themselves in the cares and encumbrances of the world so as to be hindered from serving the lord with that freedom of spirit which becomes a people called by his name also that none professing truth and righteousness might run into debts or contract great trades beyond the bounds of moderation or their capacities to manage  that they should be punctual in keeping their words and promises  that they should be circumspect in their lives and conversations at all times  avoid unnecessary frequenting of alehouses and taverns and fashioning themselves according to the vain unsettled customs of the world whether in apparel or housefurniture lastly the good education of youth was strongly recommended to parents particularly in plainness of habit and speech honest labor and suitable trades and employments and that they should restrain them as much as in their power from all unfit liberties in recreations and those hurtful pleasures that youth is inclined unto  the crimes and irregularities which render the quakers liable either to be admonished or disowned as brethren are a neglect of the meetings appointed for the worship of god injustice and frauds of all kinds defamation breach of the marriagecovenant whoredom drunkenness gaming and swearing but besides the above enumerated evils condemned by them in common with other professors of christianity there were also certain practices which seemed to be either lesser degrees of those evils or to have a tendency to promote them or in the view of this people to be hurtful to the souls of men and their spiritual prosperity and inconsistent with that christian testimony god had called them to bear against the corruptions of the world which became the subjects of the churchs care to preserve her members from e g the unnecessary frequenting of alehouses or taverns drinking of healths superfluities of provisions at marriages or burials the abuse of our precious time in diverse exercises called recreations as cockfighting horseraces and attending play houses and musicmeetings also extravagance and superfluity in habit furniture speech and even in trading and farming all these were and are deemed proper subjects of reproof and admonition there are yet some other instances of unfaithfulness peculiarly cognizable by the church among this people viz   one brother going to law with another   fighting whether private or public   the payment of tithes or churchrates so called by any of this profession was always censured among this people as a deviation from the known sense and judgment of the brethren with regard to the support of a christian ministry and a trampling upon that testimony which they believed god had called them to bear against this antichristian yoke of oppression and was faithfully maintained by diverse of the ancient brethren by suffering imprisonment even unto death upon this account a mean submission to this yoke for fear of suffering was further condemnable because of its tendency to increase the sufferings of the faithful and strengthen the hands of their adversaries this has been always deemed so essential a point that from the first publication of the epistles from the yearly meeting of london to this present time accounts are transmitted from thence of the sufferings of friends in that behalf and not only so but exhortations to faithfulness in this respect are rarely omitted  their method of procedure in regard to disorderly persons has been given above in general terms besides which there are certain particularities of conduct suited to particular cases  their care to supply the necessities of their poor and that their offspring shall be properly educated is a wellknown branch of their discipline a query to this purpose being constantly to be answered from the particular to the general meetings nor is their charity confined to their own poor but extended to all others  their ministers rutty ut supra  although according to the apostles advice   timothy v    they are esteemed worthy of double honor yet do not as among some others exercise a lordship over their brethren nor deem themselves to be of a class or order so far above other men as not to need the assistance of their brethren or to be unaccountable to them for their conduct but do willingly own themselves also to be proper objects of the churchs care and as such responsible to them in the following important particulars whereof an account is required to be returned to the quarterly meetings viz   how are ministering friends in love and unity one with another and with faithful brethren in their own meeting   do none of them travel abroad in the work of the ministry without a certificate from their own monthly meeting   do they give way to each other and to strangers in the exercise of their gifts   do none overcharge themselves with business to the hindrance of their service   are they found in their ministry   do any of them burden their hearers with words without life   do they adorn their doctrine by a suitable conduct and conversation as good examples in all respects their discipline in relation to marriage merits the attention of other professors of christianity rutty the man and woman present themselves to the men and womens monthly meetings for church affairs where they reside and there declare their intentions of taking each other as man and wife if the said meeting have no material objection against it  the principal conditions of their acceptance are these    it is an established rule that no man propose marriage to a woman without the previous consent of his own and her parents or guardians and if the unbridled affections of any should have precipitated him into a breach of this rule he is required pursuant to the advice of the yearly meeting of london   0  to remove the offense and give satisfaction as also the woman if she have encouraged it to such parents and guardians and to the meeting to which they do belong by a due and open acknowledgment of the offense and condemnation of himself for it and to get the consent of such parents or guardians before he shall be permitted to proceed to accomplish his intended marriage    that the parties be of the same faith and judgment in matters of religion and professed members of this society    that none shall marry within such degrees of consanguinity or affinity as are forbidden by the law of god    whereas the admission of any marriage to be celebrated according to the rules of this society is an acknowledgment of the persons thus admitted as brethren and sisters of the community if either of these should formerly have been guilty of any misdemeanour whereby scandal had been brought on the society it has in such case been the constant practice in this nation that upon this solemn occasion such should condemn their fault which for the most part is done in writing  where no obstacles on any of these accounts appear or having appeared are removed the meeting passes the proposals of marriage takes a minute thereof and appoints proper persons to enquire into the clearness of the parties from all others and to hold correspondence with other monthly meetings to the same purpose if the parties have resided in different places it also orders the intentions of marriage to be published at least in two sundry public meetings where the man and woman reside or have resided before the marriage be solemnized in order that convenient time may be allowed for satisfaction concerning their clearness from all scandal precontracts etc  the parties are required to give their attendance a second time at the monthly meeting which is usually the next ensuing or the next after where the persons appointed to make the enquiry above mentioned return an account of the result which if it prove satisfactory to the meeting the parties are at liberty to proceed to the accomplishment of their marriage for which purpose it was the ancient practice to appoint a particular meeting whereat twelve faithful witnesses at least were required to be present but of later years marriages in this nation have been commonly solemnized in the ordinary public meetings for worship which has had this good effect to make public and strongly recommend this decent and comely order to all sober and impartial observers here the man and woman take each other as husband and wife and promise each other with gods assistance to be loving and faithful in that relation till death separate them of all these proceedings a narrative is kept in the way of certificate to which the said parties first set their hands thereby making it their own act and deed and then diverse of the relations spectators and auditors set their names as witnesses of what they have said and signed and this certificate is afterward registered in the record belonging to the meeting where the marriage is solemnized  there is yet another thing that always in this nation becomes the subject of the care of the same monthly meeting viz to appoint two persons as overseers to take care that the marriage be solemnized with modesty and gravity and to discourage superfluities of eating drinking apparel wanton behavior etc upon this occasion  as to second marriages these two things chiefly fall under their care and cognizance    if the man be a widower or the woman a widow and have children by a former wife or husband that provision be previously made for such children where it can conveniently be done    friends should not proceed in second marriages until a year is elapsed from the death of the former wife or husband and the practice accordingly has been such and more early procedure condemned and forbidden as indecent  to their yearly meeting held in london every whitsuntide which sometimes lasts four five or more days are admitted such as are sent from all churches of that society in the world to give an account of the state of their particular churches which from some places is done only by writing and from this meeting is sent a general epistle to all the churches which commonly is printed and sometimes particular epistles are sent to churches respectively by which it is known in what condition their churches are every year and in the said epistle there is always recommended a godly life and conversation and due care about the education of children if it happens that the poor any where are in want then that is supplied by others that have in store or sometimes by an extraordinary collection i have subjoined one of those epistles for my readers satisfaction  an epistle from the annual meeting in london held by adjournment from the  0th day of the fourth month to the   th of the same inclusive      to the quarterly and monthly meeting of friends in great britain and elsewhere  our salutation in the love of christ jesus our blessed lord is freely extended to you whose tender care over and favor to this our annual assembly we do humbly and thankfully acknowledge in the love amity tender condescension and peaceable procedure thereof with regard to the divine power and goodness of the lord our god and the service of his church and people sincerely desiring the prosperity of his whole heritage even in all the churches of christ among us in his dear love unity and peace to his eternal glory and our universal comfort and perpetual joy in the kingdom of the dear son of god  we are truly comforted in that we understand there is such a general concurrence and union among friends which was our former earnest desires and counsel for true and universal love unity peace and good order to be earnestly endeavored and maintained amongst us as a peculiar people chosen of the lord out of this world to bear a faithful testimony to his holy name and truth in all respects and that all that is contrary be watched against and avoided as strife discord contentions and disputes tending to divisions may be utterly suppressed and lad aside as the light and righteous judgment of truth require  oh that all the churches and congregations of the faithful would be excited by the spirit of the dear son of god fervently to pray for the prosperity of his church and people throughout the world that sion may more and more shine in the beauty of holiness to the glory and praise of the king of glory  the friends and brethren come up from the several quarterly meetings in this nation have given a good account to this meeting of truths prosperity and that friends are generally at love and unity with one another and by several epistles from north carolina jersey pensylvania maryland barbados holland scotland ireland and wales which have been read in this meeting as also by verbal accounts given by several friends that have lately traveled in diverse parts of america and elsewhere we have received comfortable a counts of the state of truth and friends in those parts by which we are encouraged to hope truth prevails in many places and a concern grows upon friends for the prosperity thereof and that there is an inclination in people to hear the truth declared  by the accounts brought up this year we find that friends suffering in england and wales amount to    0l chiefly for tithes priests wages and steeplehouse rates and that notwithstanding four friends were discharged last year there yet remain twenty friends prisoners on these accounts  we advise that a tender care remain upon friends in all places to be faithful in keeping up our christian testimony against tithes as being justly persuaded it is that whereunto god has called his people in this our day we seeing by daily experience that such as are not faithful therein do thereby add to the sufferings of other friends and hinder their own growth and prosperity in the most blessed truth  as touching the education of friends children for which this meeting has always a tender concern we think it necessary to recommend to you the necessity there is of a care of preserving of them in a plainness of speech and habit suitable to our holy profession and also that no opportunity be omitted nor any endeavors wanting to instruct them in the principles of truth which we profess that thereby they being sensible of the operation thereof in themselves may find not only their spirits softened and rendered fit to receive the impressions of the divine image but may also from thence find themselves under a necessity to appear clear in the several branches of our christian testimony and as this will be most beneficial to them being the fruits of conviction so it is the most effectual way of propagating the same throughout the churches of christ and there being times and seasons wherein their spirits are more than at others disposed to have these things impressed upon them so we desire that all parents and others concerned in the oversight of youth might wait in the fear of god to know themselves divinely qualified for that service that in his wisdom they may make use of every such opportunity which the lord shall put into their hands and we do hereby warn and advise friends in all places to flee every appearance of evil and to avoid pride and following the vain fashions and customs of this world as recommended in our epistle       and as we always found it our concern to recommend love unity and concord in the churches of christ every where so as a means to effect the same we earnestly desire that friends but more especially such who are concerned in meetings of business do labor to know their own spirits to be subjected by the spirit of truth that thereby being baptized into one body they may be truly one in the foundation of their love and unity and that therein they may all labor to find a nearness to each other in spirit this being the true way to a thorough reconciliation wherever there is or may have been any difference of apprehension thereby friends will be preserved in that sweetness of spirit that is and will be the bond of true peace throughout all the churches of christ  and dear friends the friends of this meeting to whom the inspection of the accounts was referred made report that having perused the same they found the stock nearly expended whereupon this meeting thinks it necessary to recommend unto you that a general and free contribution be made in every county and that what shall be thereupon collected be sent up to the respective correspondents  finally dear friends and brethren be careful to walk unblameable in love and peace among yourselves and toward all men in christian charity and be humbly thankful to the lord our most gracious god for the favor he has given us in the eyes of the king and civil government in the peaceable enjoyment of our religious and christian liberty under them and the god of peace we trust will be with you to the end  the grace of our lord jesus christ be with your spirits  signed in and on the behalf and by the order of their meeting by benj bealing note in      an act was passed that the solemn affirmation of the people called quakers shall be deemed of the same force and validity in law as an oath this act was renewed and confirmed anno   0  and again renewed and made perpetual to extend to scotland and the plantations by act geo i      by act   geo i cap   they were further indulged to have the name of god struck out of their solemn affirmation and declaration  account of the nonjurors the nonjurors differ in little or nothing from the established church of england in their ecclesiastical doctrine or discipline the late dr deacon a nonjuring bishop at manchester established a sect called primitive christians who have a form of worship and discipline peculiar to themselves and hold certain religious tenets which the inquisitive reader may see as published under the doctors own inspection in political principles they agree however with the other nonjurors  their rise and separation from her was at the revolution and they were so denominated on account of their refusing to take the oaths to king william and queen mary as they have refused to do to the succeeding monarchs of this kingdom de facto  they maintain that the doctrines of passive obedience and nonresistance and of the hereditary indefeasible right of some of the more inquisitive and less rigid nonjurors found all their scruples of acknowledging the present government to be lawful only on the doctrine of hereditary right sovereigns were the distinguishing principles of the church of england in her political character and that these doctrines were confirmed by every sanction derived from the laws of god and man by the second canon of the church of england the canon is whosoever shall hereafter affirm that the kings majesty has not the same authority in causes ecclesiastical that the godly kings had amongst the jews and christian emperors of the primitive church or impeach any part of his regal supremacy in the said causes restored to the crown and by the laws of this realm therein established let him be excommunicated ipso facto and not restored but only by the archbishop after his repentance and public revocation of those his wicked errors  they affirm the king therein mentioned is to be understood of that person who is possessed of the throne according to the civil institution of the hereditary english monarchy and that whoever disowns his authority etc incurs the sentence of excommunication ipso facto according to that canon they insist that if king james ii had a right the compliers with the revolution were by this canon excommunicated as in depriving their rightful sovereign they disavowed his authority etc king james had a right they say which he continued to claim till the day of his death and that his son whose right as a son they declare to be as unquestionable as his fathers has always kept up and asserted his claim so much for their political creed  with regard to their ecclesiastical tenets they maintain the necessity of an uninterrupted succession from the apostles of those who administer christs ordinances that the deprivation of bishops by layauthority is invalid of itself and should not be acknowledged that the interposition of laypower has interrupted the succession as to all who submit to or own their interposition that the authority of the church of england and of consequence the church of england itself was resident in the deprived bishops and clergy and remains in the nonjurors their successors who have immutably adhered to her true constitutions and principles and that all who depart from them are at least in a state of schism to support these tenets they advance that the canonical metropolitan archbishop sancroft was not only displaced but dr tillotson a subject presbyter of his placed in his room and when god had removed him another dr tennison was set up in his place as head of the schism that under the bishops who actually did this or those who approve of such doings by joining in communion with them in opposition to the true canonical bishops have all the parochial clergy acted and joined with them against the canonical deprived prelates and their successors and being thus joined with them they become schismatics and that those though canonically ordained and placed over a flock yet by closing with schismatics have forfeited all the privileges of their function and cannot dispense the ordinances of religion with any benefit  the nonjurors of scotland maintain the same principles with those of england they both make use of the book of common prayer in their worship though the scots generally officiate by the communion service in the prayer book composed for their country in the reign of king charles i  dr hicks dr kettlewell the rev mr john lindsay and others their champions have written learned treatises in defense of their principles and the nonjurors aver that the above with dr charles leslie see note p    of this volume  have published more in their behalf than all their adversaries and even the late dr benjamin hoadley see page    of this volume and the bishops performance there mentioned  the learned bishop of winchester have been able to refute  see more to make this history complete pages   and   of this volume and note p     the nonjurors are dwindling away insensibly the zeal which actuated the first adherents to their principles does not seem to operate so forcibly upon their children and descendants and perhaps in half a century there may be none such in being as conscientious persons they certainly merit the indulgence of the government whilst they behave with that respect and inoffensiveness it has a right to expect from them and which are cultivated by the sensible persons of their persuasion  the history of the lutherans so much has been already necessarily said of luther the progress and establishment of his opinions and the doctrines of the lutheran church in vol ii of this work p          and p        0 as to render any thing further on that head superfluous and therefore i content myself with referring my readers to that volume  the history of the methodists contrary to my usual method i think proper to begin with the principles of this popular sect before i give an account of their rise and progress and first i shall lay before my readers the character of a methodist as drawn by the rev mr john wesley who though he may differ in a few points from the rev mr george whitefield the founder of methodism yet speaks in most things the sense of the whole body he introduces it by saying he does now give the clearest account he can in the presence of the lord and judge of heaven and earth of the principles and practices whereby those who are called methodists are distinguished from other men     the distinguishing marks of a methodist are not his opinions of any sort his assenting to this or that scheme of religion his embracing any particular set of notions his espousing the judgment of one man or of another are all quite wide of the point whosoever therefore imagines that a methodist is a man of such or such an opinion is grossly ignorant of the whole affair he mistakes the truth totally we believe indeed that all scripture is given by inspiration of god and herein we are distinguished from jews turks and infidels we believe the written word of god to be the only and sufficient rule both of christian faith and practice and herein we are fundamentally distinguished from those of the romish church we believe christ to be the eternal supreme god and herein are we distinguished from the socinians and arians but as to all opinions which do not strike at the root of christianity we think and let think so that whatsoever they are whether right or wrong they are no distinguishing marks of a methodist    neither are words or phrases of any sort we do not place our religion or any part of it in being attached to any peculiar mode of speaking any quaint or uncommon set of expressions the most obvious easy common words wherein our meaning can be conveyed we prefer before others both on ordinary occasions and when we speak of the things of god we never therefore willingly or designedly deviate from the most usual way of speaking unless when we express scripture truths in scripture words which we presume no christian will condemn neither do we affect to use any particular expressions of scripture more frequently than others unless they are such as are more frequently used by the inspired writers themselves so that it is as gross an error to place the marks of a methodist in his words as in opinions of any sort    nor do we desire to be distinguished by actions customs or usages of an indifferent nature our religion does not lie in doing what god has not enjoined or abstaining from what he has not forbidden it does not lie in the form of our apparel in the posture of our body or the covering of our heads nor yet in abstaining from marriage nor from meats and drinks which are all good if received with thanksgiving therefore neither will any man who knows whereof he affirms fix the mark of a methodist here in any actions or customs purely indifferent undertermined by the word of god    nor lastly is he to be distinguished by laying the whole stress of religion on any single part of it if you say yes he is for he thinks we are saved by faith alone i answer you do not understand the terms by salvation he means holiness of heart and life and this he affirms to spring from true faith alone can even a nominal christian deny it is this placing a part of religion for the whole do we then make void the law through faith god forbid yea we establish the law we do not place the whole of religion as too many do god knows either in doing no harm or in doing good or in using the ordinances of god no nor in all of them together wherein we know by experience a man may labor many years and at the end have no true religion at all no more than he had at the beginning much less in any one of these or it may be in a scrap of one of them like her who fancies herself a virtuous woman only because she is not a prostitute or him who dreams he is an honest man merely because he does not rob or steal may the lord god of my fathers preserve me from such a poor starved religion as this were this the mark of a methodist i would sooner choose to be a sincere jew turk or pagan    what then is the mark who is a methodist according to your own account i answer a methodist is one who has the love of god shed abroad in his heart by the holy ghost given unto him one who loves the lord his god with all his heart and with all his soul and with all his mind and with all his strength god is the joy of his heart and the desire of his soul which is constantly crying out whom have i in heaven but thee and there is none upon earth that i desire beside thee my god and my all thou art the strength of my heart and my portion for ever    he is therefore happy in god yea always happy as having in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life and overflowing his soul with peace and joy perfect love having now cast out fear he rejoices evermore he rejoices in the lord always even in god his savior and in the father through our lord jesus christ by whom he has now received the atonement having found redemption through his blood the forgivenness of his sins he cannot but rejoice whenever he looks back on the horrible pit out of which he is delivered when he sees all his transgressions blotted out as a cloud and his iniquities as a thick cloud he cannot but rejoice whenever he looks on the state wherein he now is being justified freely and having peace with god through our lord jesus christ for he that believes has the witness of this in himself being now the son of god by faith because he is a son god has sent forth the spirit of his son into his heart crying out abba father and the spirit itself bears witness with his spirit that he is a child of god he rejoiceth also whenever he looks forward in hope of the glory that shall be revealed yea this his joy is full and all his bones cry out blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who according to his abundant mercy has begotten me again to a living hope  of an inheritance incorruptible undefiled and that fades not away reserved in heaven for me    and he who has this hope thus full of immortality in every thing gives thanks as knowing that this whatsoever it is is the will of god in christ jesus concerning him from him therefore he cheerfully receives all saying good is the will of the lord and whether the lord gives or takes away equally blessing the name of the lord for he has learned in whatsoever stare he is therewith to be content he knows both how to be abased and how to abound every where and in all things he is instructed both to be full and to be hungry both to abound and to suffer need whether in ease or pain whether in sickness or health whether in life or death he gives thanks from the ground of the heart to him who orders it for good knowing that as every good gift comes from above so none but good can come from the father of light into whose hands he has wholly committed his body and soul as into the hands of a faithful creator he is therefore careful anxiously or uneasily careful for nothing as having cast all his care on him that cares for him and in all things resting on him after making his request known to him with thanksgiving    for indeed he prays without ceasing it is given him always to pray and not to faint not that he is always in the house of prayer though he neglects no opportunity of being there neither is he always on his knees although he often is or on his face before the lord his god nor yet is he always crying aloud to god or calling upon him in words for many times the spirit makes intercession for him with groans that cannot be uttered but at all times the language of his heart is this thou brightness of the eternal glory unto thee is my mouth though without a voice and my silence speaks unto thee and this is true prayer  the lifting up the heart to god this is the essence of prayer and this alone but his heart is ever lifted up to god at all times and in all places in this he is never hindered much less interrupted by any person or thing in retirement or company in leisure business or conversation his heart is ever with the lord whether he lie down or rise up god is in all his thoughts he walks with god continually having the loving eye of his mind still fixed upon him and every where seeing him that is invisible    and while he thus always exercises his love to god by praying without ceasing rejoicing evermore and in every thing giving thanks this commandment is written in his heart that he who loves god loves his brother also and he accordingly loves his neighbor as himself he loves every man as his own soul his heart is full of love to all mankind to every child of the father of the spirits of all flesh that a man is not personally known to him is no bar to his love no nor that he is known to be such as he approves not that he repays hatred for his good will for he loves his enemies yea and the enemies of god the evil and the unthankful and if it be not in his power to do good to them that hate him yet he ceases not to pray for them though they continue to spurn his love and still despitefully use him and persecute him   0 for he is pure in heart the love of god has purified his heart from all revengeful passions from envy malice and wrath from every unkind temper or malign affection it has cleansed him from pride and haughtiness of spirit whereof alone comes contention and he has now put on bowels of mercies kindness humbleness of mind meekness long suffering so that he forbears and forgives if he had a quarrel against any even as god in christ has forgiven him and indeed all possible ground for contention on his part is utterly cut off for none can take from him what he desires seeing he loves not the world nor any of the things of the world being now crucified to the world and the world crucified to him being dead to all that is in the world both to the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye and the pride of life for all his desire is unto god and to the remembrance of his name     agreeable to this his one desire is the one desire of his life namely not to do his own will but the will of him that sent him his one intention at all times and in all things is not to please himself but him whom his soul loves he has a single eye and because his eye is single his whole body is full of light indeed where the loving eye of the soul is continually fixed upon god there can be no darkness at all but the whole is light as when the bright shining of a candle does enlighten the house god then reigns alone all that is in the soul is holiness to the lord there is not a motion in his heart but is according to his will every thought that arises points to him and is in obedience to the law of christ     and the tree is known by its fruits for as he loves god so he keeps his commandments not only some or most of them but all from the least to the greatest he is not content to keep the whole law and offend in one point but has in all points a conscience void of offense toward god and toward man whatever god has forbidden he avoids whatever god has enjoined he does and that whether it be little or great hard or easy joyous or grievous to the flesh he runs the ways of gods commandments now he has set his heart at liberty it is his glory so to do it is his daily crown of rejoicing to do the will of god on earth as it is done in heaven knowing it is the highest privilege of the angels of god of those that excel in strength to fulfill his commandments and hearken to the voice of his word     all the commandments of god he accordingly keeps and that with all his might for his obedience is in proportion to his love the source from whence it flows and therefore loving god with all his heart he serves him with all his strength he continually presents his soul and body a living sacrifice holy acceptable to god entirely and without reserve devoting himself all he has and all he is to his glory all the talents he has received he constantly employs according to his masters will every power and faculty of his soul every member of his body once he yielded them unto sin and the devil as instruments of unrighteousness but now being alive from the dead he yields them all as instruments of righteousness unto god     by consequence whatsoever he does it is all to the glory of god in all his employments of every kind he not only aims at this which is implied in having a single eye but actually attains it his business and refreshments as well as his prayers all serve to this great end whether he sit in his house or walk by the way whether he lie down or rise up he is promoting in all he speaks or does the one business of his life whether he put on his apparel or labor or eat and drink or divert himself from too wasting labor it all tends to advance the glory of god by peace and good will among men his one invariable rule is this whatsoever ye do in word or deed do it all in the name of the lord jesus giving thanks to god and the father by him     nor do the customs of the world at all hinder his running the race that is set before him he knows that vice does not lose its nature though it becomes ever so fashionable and remembers that every man is to give an account of himself to god he cannot therefore even follow a multitude to do evil he cannot fare sumptuously every day or make provision for the flesh to fulfill the lusts thereof he cannot lay up treasures upon earth no more than he can take fire into his bosom he cannot adorn himself on any pretense with gold or costly apparel he cannot join in or countenance any diversion which has the least tendency to vice of any kind he cannot speak evil of his neighbor no more than he can lie either for god or man he cannot utter an unkind word of any one for lovekeeps the door of his lips he cannot speak idle words no corrupt communication ever comes out of his mouth as is all that which is not good to the use of edifying not fit to minister grace to the hearers but whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are justly of good report he thinks and speaks and acts adorning the doctrine of our lord jesus christ in all things     lastly as he has time he does good unto all men unto neighbors and strangers friends and enemies and that in every possible kind not only to their bodies by feeding the hungry clothing the naked visiting those that are sick or in prison but much more does he labor to do good to their souls as of the ability which god gives to awaken those that sleep in death to bring those who are awakened to the atoning blood that being justified by faith they may have peace with god and to provoke those who have peace with god to abound more in love and in good works and he is willing to spend and be spent herein even to be offered up on the sacrifice and service of their faith so they may all come unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ     these are the principles and practices of our sect these are the marks of a true methodist by these alone do those who are in derision so called desire to be distinguished from other men if any man say why these are only the common fundamental principles of christianity thou have said so i mean this is the very truth i know they are no other and i would to god both thou and all men knew that i and all who follow my judgment do vehemently refuse to be distinguished from other men by any but the common principles of christianity the plain old christianity that i teach renouncing and detesting all other mrks of distinction and whosoever is what i preach let him be called what he will for names change not the nature of things he is a christian not in name only but in heart and in life he is inwardly and outwardly conformed to the will of god as revealed in the written word he thinks speaks and lives according to the method laid down in the revelation of jesus christ his soul is renewed after the image of god in righteousness and in all true holiness and having the mind that was in christ he so walks as christ also walked     by these marks by these fruits of a living faith do we labor to distinguish ourselves from the unbelieving world from all those whose minds or lives are not according to the gospel of christ but from real christians of whatsoever denomination they be we earnestly desire not to be distinguished at all not from any who sincerely follow after what they know they have not yet attained no whosoever does the will of my father which is in heaven the same is my brother and sister and mother and i beseech you brethren by the mercies of god that we be in no wise divided among ourselves is thy heart right as my heart is with thine i ask no farther question if it be give me thy hand for opinions or terms let us not destroy the work of god do thou love and serve god it is enough i give thee the right hand of fellowship if there be any consolation in christ if any comfort of love if any fellowship of the spirit if any bowels and mercies let us strive together for the faith of the gospel walking worthy of the vocation wherewith we are called with all lowliness and meekness with longsuffering forbearing one another in love endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace remembering there is one body and one spirit even as we are called with one hope of our calling one lord one faith one baptism one god and father of all who is above all and through all and in you all  the principles of a methodist by the same author of justification by faith i believe justification by faith alone for i am firmly persuaded that every man of the offspring of adam is very far gone from original righteousness and is of his own nature inclined to evil that this corruption of our nature in every person born into the world deserves gods wrath and damnation that therefore if ever we receive the remission of our sins and are accounted righteous before god it must be only for the merits of christ by faith and not for our own works or deservings of any kind nay i am persuaded that all works done before justification have in them the nature of sin and that consequently till he is justified a man has no power to do any work which is pleasing and acceptable to god  i believe three things must go together in our justification upon gods part his great mercy and grace upon christs part the satisfaction of gods justice by the offering his body and shedding his blood and fulfilling the law of god perfectly and upon our part true and living faith in the merits of jesus christ so that in our justification there is not only gods mercy and grace but his justice also and so the grace of god does not shut out the righteousness of god in our justification but only shuts out the righteousness of man that is the righteousness of our works and therefore st paul requires nothing on the part of man but only a true and living faith yet this faith does not shut out repentance hope and love which are joined with faith in every man that is justified but it shuts them out from the office of justifying so that although they are all present together in him that is justified yet they justify not all together neither does faith shut out good works necessarily to be done afterward but we may not do them to this intent to be justified by doing them our justification comes freely of the mere mercy of god for whereas all the world was not able to pay any part toward their ransom it pleased him without any of our deserving to prepare for us christs body and blood whereby our ransom might be paid his law fulfilled and his justice satisfied christ therefore is now the righteousness of all them that truly believe in him he for them paid the ransom by his death he for them fulfilled the law in his life so that now in him and by him every believer may be called a fulfiller of the law  but let it be observed the true sense of those words we are justified by faith in christ only is not that this our own act to believe in christ or this our faith which is within us justifies us for that were to account ourselves to be justified by some act or virtue that is within us but that although we have faith hope and love within us and do never so many good works yet we must renounce the merit of all of faith hope love and all other virtues and good works which we either have done shall do or can do as far too weak to deserve our justification for which therefore we must trust only in gods mercy and the merits of christ for it is he alone that takes away our sins to him alone are we to go for this sorsaking all our virtues good words thoughts and works and putting our trust in christ only in strictness therefore neither our faith nor our works justify us i e deserve the remission of our sins but god himself justifies us of his own mercy through the merits of his son only nevertheless because by faith we embrace the promise of gods mercy and of the remission of our sins therefore the scripture says that faith does justify yea faith without works and as it is all one to say faith without works and faith alone justifies us therefore the ancient fathers from time to time speak thus faith alone justifies us and because we receive faith through the only merits of christ and not through the merit of any virtue we have or work we do therefore in that respect we renounce as it were again faith works and all other virtues for our corruption through original sin is so great that all our faith charity words and works cannot merit or deserve any part of our justification for us and therefore we thus speak humbling ourselves before god and giving christ all the glory of our justification but it should also be observed what that faith is whereby we are justified now that faith which brings not forth good works is not a living faith but a dead and devilish one for even the devils believe that christ was born of a virgin that he wrought all kind of miracles declaring himself to be very god that for our sakes he died and rose again and ascended into heaven and at the end of the world shall come again to judge the quick and the dead this the devils believe and so they believe all that is written in the old and new testament and yet still for all this faith they are but devils they remain still in their damnable estate lacking the true christian faith the true christian faith is not only to believe the holy scriptures and articles of our faith are true but also to have a sure trust and confidence to be saved from everlasting damnation by christ whereof does follow a loving heart to obey his commandments and this faith neither any devil has nor any wicked man no ungodly man has or can have this sure trust and confidence in god that by the merits of christ his sins are forgiven and be reconciled to the favor of god  of christian perfection perhaps the general prejudice against christian perfection may chiefly arise from a misapprehension of the nature of it we willingly allow and continually declare there is no such perfection in this life as implies a dispensation from doing good and attending all the ordinances of god or a freedom from ignorance mistake temptation and a thousand infirmities necessarily connected with flesh and blood first we not only allow but earnestly contend as for the faith once delivered to the saints that there is no such perfection in this life as implies any dispensation from attending all the ordinances of god or from doing good unto all men while we have time though especially unto the household of faith and whosoever they are who have taught otherwise we are convinced are not taught of god we dare not receive them neither bid them god speed lest we be partakers of their evil deeds we believe that not only the babes in christ who have newly found redemption in his blood but those also who are grown up unto perfect men unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ are indispensibly obliged and that they are obliged thereto is their glory and crown of rejoicing as often as they have opportunity to eat bread and drink wine in remembrance of him to search the scriptures by fasting as well as temperance to keep their bodies under and bring them into subjection and above all to pour out their souls in prayer both secretly and in the great congregation we secondly believe and therefore speak and that unto all men and with much assurance that there is no such perfection in this life as implies an entire deliverance either from ignorance or mistake in things not essential to salvation or from manifold temptations or from numberless infirmities wherewith the corruptible body more or less presses down the soul this is the same thing which we have spoken from the beginning if any teach otherwise they are not of us we cannot find any ground in scripture to suppose that any inhabitant of an house of clay is wholly exempt either from bodily infirmities or from ignorance of many things or to imagine any mere man is incapable of mistake or of falling into diverse temptations no the disciple is not above his master nor the servant above his lord it is enough that every one who is perfect shall be as his master but what then it may be asked do you mean by one that is perfect or one that is as his master we mean one in whom is the mind which was in christ and who so walks as he also walked a man that has clean hands and a pure heart or that is cleansed from all filthiness of flesh and spirit one in whom there is no occasion of stumbling and who accordingly does not commit sin to declare this a little more particularly we understand by that scriptural expression a perfect man one in whom god has fulfilled his faithful word from all your filthiness and from all your idols will i cleanse you  i will also save you from all your uncleanness we understand hereby one whom god has sanctified throughout even in body soul and spirit one who walks in the light as he is in the light in whom is no darkness at all the blood of jesus christ his son having cleansed him from all sin this man can now testify to all mankind i am crucified with christ nevertheless i live yet not i but christ lives in me he is holy as god who has called him is holy both in heart and in all manner of conversation he loves the lord his god with all his heart and serves him with all his strength he loves his neighbor every man as himself yea as christ loved us them in particular that despitefully use him and persecute him because they know not the son neither the father indeed his soul is all love filled with bowels of mercies kindness meekness gentleness long suffering and his life agrees thereto full of the work of faith the patience of hope the labor of love and whatsoever he does either in word or deed he does it all in the name in the love and power of the lord jesus in a word he does the will of god on earth as it is done in heaven this it is to be a perfect man to be sanctified throughout created anew in christ jesus even to have a heart so allflaming with the love of god to use archbishop ushers words as continually to offer up every thought word and work as a spiritual sacrifice acceptable unto god through christ in every thought of our hearts in every word of our tongues in every work of our hands to show forth his praise who has called us out of darkness into his mavelous light o that both we and all who seek the lord jesus in sincerity may thus be made perfect in one  if there be anything unscriptural in these words anything wild or extravagant anything contrary to the analogy of faith or the experience of adult christians let them smite me friendly and reprove me let them impart to me of the clearer light god has given them how know thou o man but thou may gain thy brother but he may at length come to the knowledge of the truth and thy labor of love shown forth with meekness of wisdom may not be in vain  of the assurances of justification i believe that conversion meaning thereby justification is an instantaneous work and the moment a man has living faith in christ he is converted or justified which faith e cannot have without knowing that he has it  i believe the moment a man is justified he has peace with god which he cannot have without knowing that he has it  the first sense of forgiveness is often mixed with doubt or fear but the full assurance of faith excludes all doubt and fear as the very term implies  i believe to be justified is the same as to be born of god and he that is born of god sins not which deliverance from sin he cannot have without knowing that he has it  of the conditions of justification i believe every man is penitent before he is justified he repents before he believes the gospel but it is never before and generally long after he is justified that christ is formed in him and that this penitence and contrition is the work of the holy ghost  yet i believe that all this is nothing toward and has no influence on our justification  again i believe that in order to obtain justification i must go strait to christ with all my ungodliness and plead nothing else  yet i believe we should not insist upon anything we do or feel as if it were necessarily previous to justification no not on anything else  of the effects of justification i believe a man may have a strong assurance he is justified and not be able to affirm he is a child of god  a man may be fully assured that his sins are forgiven yet may not be able to tell the day when he received this full assurance because it grew up in him by degrees  a man may have a weak faith at the same time that he has peace with god and no unholy desires  a man may be justified who has not a clean heart neither the indwelling of the spirit  to sum up the whole mr wesley desires not a more consistent account of his principles than the following words  our spiritual state should be considered and distinctly under each of these views    before justification in which state we may be said to be unable to do anything acceptable to god because then we can do nothing but come to christ which ought not to be considered as doing anything but as supplicating or waiting to receive a power of doing for the time to come for the preventing grace of god which is common to all is sufficient to bring us to christ though it is not sufficient to carry us any farther till we are justified    after justification the moment a man comes to christ by faith he is justified and born again that is he is born again in the imperfect sense for there are two if not more degrees of regeneration and he has power over all the stirrings and motions of sin but not a total freedom from them he has christ with him but not christ in him therefore he has not yet in the full and proper sense a new and clean heart or the indwelling of the spirit but being exposed to various temptations he may and will fall again from this condition if he does not attain to a more excellent gift    sanctification the last and highest state of perfection in this life for then are the faithful born again in the full and perfect sense then have they the indwelling of the spirit then is there given unto them a new and clean heart and the struggle between the old and new man is over  mr wesley in an earnest appeal to men of reason and religion thus further expresses himself in regard to the principles of the methodists  although it is with us a very small thing to be judged of you or of mans judgment seeing we know god will make our innocence as clear as the light and our just dealing as the noonday yet are we ready to give any that are willing to hear a plain account both of our principles and actions as having renounced the hidden things of shame and desiring nothing more than by manifestation of the truth to commend ourselves to every mans conscience in the sight of god  we see and who does not the numberless follies and miseries of our fellow creatures we see on every side either men of no religion at all or men of a lifeless formal religion we are grieved at the sight and should greatly rejoice if by any means we might convince some that there is a better religion to be attained a religion worthy of god that gave it and this we conceive to be no other than love the love of god and of all mankind the loving god with all our heart and soul and strength as having first loved us as the fountain of all the good we have received and of all we ever hope to enjoy and the loving every soul which god has made every man on earth as our own soul  this love we believe to be the medicine of life the neverfailing remedy for all the evils of a disordered world for all the miseries and vices of men wherever this is there are virtue and happiness going handinhand there is humbleness of mind gentleness longsuffering the whole image of god and at the same time a peace that passes all understanding and joy unspeakable and full of glory  this religion we long to see established in the world a religion of love and joy and peace having its seat in the heart in the inmost soul but ever showing itself by its fruits continually springing forth not only in all innocence for love works no ill to his neighbor but likewise in every kind of beneficence spreading virtue and happiness all around it  this religion have we been following after for many years as many know if they would testify but all this time seeking wisdom we found it not we were spending our strength in vain and being now under full conviction of this we declare it to all mankind for we desire not that others should wander out of the way as we have done before them but rather that they may profit by our loss that they may go though we did not having then no man to guide us the straight way to the religion of love even by faith  now faith supposing the scripture to be of god is the demonstrative evidence of things unseen the supernatural evidence of things invisible not perceivable by eyes of flesh or by any of our natural senses or faculties faith is that divine evidence whereby the spiritual man discerns god and the things of god it is with regard to the spiritual world what sense is with regard to the natural it is the spiritual sensation of every soul that is born of god  perhaps you have not considered it in this view i will then explain it a little further  faith according to the scriptural account is the eye of the new born soul hereby every true believer in god sees him who is invisible hereby in a more particular manner since life and immortality have been brought to light by the gospel he sees the light of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ and beholds what manner of love it is which the father has bestowed upon us that we who are born of the spirit should be called the sons of god  it is the ear of the soul whereby a sinner hears the voice of the son of god and lives even that voice which alone wakes the dead son thy sins are forgiven thee  it is if i may be allowed the expression the palate of the soul for hereby a believer tastes the good word and the powers of the world to come and hereby he both tastes and sees that god is gracious yea and merciful to him a sinner  it is the feeling of the soul whereby a believer perceives through the power of the highest overshadowing him both the existence and the presence of him in whom he lives moves and has his being and indeed the whole invisible world the entire system of things eternal and hereby in particular he feels the love of god shed abroad in his heart  by this faith we are saved from all uneasiness of mind from the anguish of a wounded spirit from discontent from fear and sorrow of heart and from that inexpressible listlessness and weariness both of the world and of ourselves which we had so helplesly labored under for many years especially when we were out of the hurry of the world and sunk into calm reflection in this we find that love of god and of all mankind which we had elsewhere sought in vain this we know and feel and therefore cannot but declare saves every one that partakes of it both from sin and misery from every unhappy and every unholy temper  if you ask why then have not all men this faith all at least who conceive it to be so happy a thing why do they not believe immediately  we answer on the scripturehypothesis it is the gift of god no man is able to work it in himself it is a work of omnipotence it requires no less power thus to quicken a dead soul than to raise a body that lies in the grave it is a new creation and none can create a soul anew but he who at first created the heavens and the earth  may not your own experience teach you this can you give yourself this faith is it now in your power to see or hear or taste or feel god have you already or can you raise in yourself any perception of god or of an invisible world i suppose you do not deny that there is an invisible world you will not charge it in poor old hesiod to christian prejudice of education when he says in those wellknown words millions of spiritual creatures walk the earth unseen whether we wake or if we sleep now is there any power in your soul whereby you discern either these or him that created them or can all your wisdom and strength open an intercourse between yourself and the world of spirits is it in your power to burst the veil that is on your heart and let in the light of eternity you know it is not you not only do not but cannot by your own strength thus believe the more you labor so to do the more you will be convinced it is the gift of god  it is the free gift of god which he bestows not on those who are worthy of his favor not on such as are previously holy and so fit to be crowned with all the blessings of his goodness but on the ungodly and unholy on those who till that hour were fit only for everlasting destruction those in whom was no good thing and whose only plea was god be merciful to me a sinner no merit no goodness in man precedes the forgiving love of god his pardoning mercy supposes nothing in us but a sense of mere sin and misery and to all who see and feel and own their wants and their utter inability to remove them god freely gives faith for the sake of him in whom he is always well pleased  this is a short rude sketch of the doctrine we teach these are our fundamental principles and we spend our lives in confirming others herein and in a behavior suitable to them  after a great deal of shrewd and pertinent reasoning he goes on to vindicate these doctrines in a manner peculiar to himself  perhaps the first thing that now occurs to your mind relates to the doctrine which we teach you have heard that we say men may live without sin and have you not heard that the scripture says the same we mean without committing sin does not st paul say plainly that those who believe do not continue in  that they cannot live any longer therein romans vi     does not st peter say he that has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin  that he no longer should live  to the desires of men but to the will of god   pet iv     and does not st john say most expressly he that commits sin is of the devil  for this purpose the son of god was manifest that he might destroy the works of the devil whosoever is born of god does not commit sin for his seed remains in him and he cannot commit sin because he is born of god   john iii   etc and again we know that whosoever is born of god sins not chapter v     you see then it is not we that say this but the lord these are not our words but his and who is he that replieth against god who is able to make god a liar surely he will be justified in his saying and cleared when he is judged can you deny it have you not often felt a secret check when you was contradicting this great truth and how often have you wished what you was taught to deny nay can you help wishing for it at this moment do you not now earnestly desire to cease from sin to commit it no more does not your soul pant after this glorious liberty of the sons of god and what strong reason have you to expect it have you not had a foretaste of it already do you not remember the time when god first lifted up the light of his countenance upon you can it ever be forgotten the day when the candle of the lord first shone upon your head you then had power not to commit sin you found the apostles words strictly true he that is begotten of god keeps himself and that wicked one touches him not but those whom you took to be experienced christians telling you this was the only time of your espousals this could not last always you must come down the mount and the like shook your faith you looked at men more than god and so became weak and like another man whereas had you then had any to guide you according to the truth of god had you then heard the doctrine which now you blame you had never fallen from your stedfastness but had found that in this sense also the gifts and calling of god are without repentance  have you not another objection nearly allied to this namely that we preach perfection true but what perfection the term you cannot object to because it is scriptural all the difficulty is to fix the meaning of it according to the word of god and this we have done again and again declaring to all the world that christian perfection does not imply an exemption from ignorance or mistake or infirmities or temptations but that it does imply the being so crucified with christ as to be able to testify i live not but christ lives in me  gal ii    and has purified my heart by faith  acts xv   it does imply the casting down every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of god and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ it does imply the being holy as he that has called us is holy in all manner of conversation   cor x     pet i    and in a word the loving the lord our god with all our heart and serving him with all our strength  now is it possible for any one who believes the scripture to deny one tittle of this you cannot you dare not you would not for the world you know it is the pure word of god and this is the whole of what we preach this is the height and depth of what we with st paul call perfection a state of soul devoutly to be wished by all who have tasted of the love of god o pray for it without ceasing it is the one thing you want come with boldness to the throne of grace and be assured that when you ask this of god you shall have the petition you ask of him we know indeed that to man to the natural man this is impossible but we know also that as no work is impossible with god so all things are possible to him that believes  for we are saved by faith but have you not heard this urged as another objection against us that we preach salvation by faith alone and does not st paul do the same thing by grace says he ye are saved through faith can any words be more express and elsewhere believe in the lord jesus and thou shall be saved acts xvi     what we mean by this if it has not been sufficiently explained already is that we are saved from our sins only by a confidence in the love of god as soon as we behold what manner of love it is which the father has bestowed upon us we love him as the apostle observes because he first loved us and then is that commandment written in our heart that he who loves god love his brother also from which love of god and man meekness humbleness of mind and all holy tempers spring now these are the very essence of salvation of christian salvation salvation from sin and from these outward salvation flows that is holiness of life and conversation well and are not these things so if you know in whom you have believed you need no further witnesses  but perhaps you doubt whether that faith whereby we are thus saved implies such a trust and confidence in god as we describe you cannot think faith implies assurance an assurance of the love of god to our souls of his being now reconciled to us and having forgiven all our sins and this we freely confess that if number of voices is to decide the question we must give it up at once for you have on your side not only some who desire to be christians in deed but all nominal christians in every place and the romish church one and all nay these last are so vehement in your defense that in the famed council of trent they have decreed if any man hold fiduciam trust confidence or assurance of pardon to be essential to faith let him be accursed  thus does that council anathematise the church of england for she is convict hereof by her own confession the very words in the homily on salvation are even the devils believe that christ was born of a virgin that he wrought all kind of miracles declaring himself very god that for our sakes he suffered a most painful death to redeem us from death everlasting these articles of our faith the devils believe and so they believe all that was written in the old and new testament and yet for all this faith they be but devils they remain still in their damnable estate lacking the very true christian faith  the right and true christian faith is not only to believe the holy scriptures and the articles of our faith are true but also to have a sure trust and confidence to be saved from everlasting damnation through christ or as it is expressed a little after a sure trust and confidence which a man has in god that by the merits of christ his sins are forgiven and he reconciled to the favor of god  indeed the bishop of rome says if any man hold this let him be an anathema maranatha but it is to be hoped papal anathemas do not move you you are a member of the church of england are you then the controversy is at an end then hear the church faith is a sure trust which a man has in god that his sins are forgiven or if you are not whether you hear our church or no at least hear the scriptures hear believing job declaring his faith i know that my redeemer lives hear thomas when having seen he believed crying out my lord and my god hear st paul clearly describing the nature of his faith the life i now live i live by faith in the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me hear to mention no more all the believers who were with paul when he wrote to the colossians bearing witness we give thanks unto the father who has delivered us from the power of darkness and has translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sins c i v           but what need have we of distant witnesses you have a witness in your own breast for am i not speaking to one that loves god how came you then to love him at first was it not because you knew that he loved you did you could you love god at all till you tasted and saw that he was gracious that he was merciful to you a sinner what avails then controversy or strife of words out of thy own mouth you own you had no love to god till you was sensible of his love to you and whatever expressions any sinner who loves god uses to denote gods love to him you will always upon examination find that they directly or indirectly imply forgiveness pardoning love is still at the root of all he who was offended is now reconciled the new song which god puts in every mouth is always to that effect o lord i will praise thee though thou wast angry with me thine anger is turned away behold god is my salvation i will trust and not be afraid for the lord jehovah is my strength and my song he is also become my salvation isa xii      a confidence then in a pardoning god is essential to true faith the forgiveness of sins is one of the first of those unseen things whereof faith is the evidence and if you are sensible of this will you quarrel with us concerning an indifferent circumstance of it will you think it an important objection that we assert that this faith is usually given in a moment first let me entreat you to read over that authentic account of gods dealings with men the acts of the apostles in this treatise you will find how he wrought from the beginning on those who received remission of sins by faith and can you find one of these except perhaps st paul who did not receive it in a moment but abundance you find of those who did besides cornelius and the three thousand and to this also agrees the experience of those who now receive the heavenly gift three or four exceptions only have i found in the course of several years perhaps you yourself may be added to that number and one or two more whom you have known but all the rest of those who from time to time among us have believed in the lord jesus were in a moment brought from darkness to light and from the power of satan unto god  and why should it seem a thing incredible to you who have known the power of god unto salvation whether he has wrought this in your soul or no for there are diversities of operations by the same spirit that the dead should hear the voice of the son of god and in that moment live thus he uses to act to show that when he wills to do is present with him let there be light said god and there was light he spoke the word and it was done thus the heavens and the earth were created and all the hosts of them and this manner of acting in the present case highly suits both his power and love there is therefore no hindrance on gods part since as his majesty is so is his mercy and whatever hindrance there is on the part of man when god speaks it is not only ask then o sinner and it shall be given thee even the faith that brings salvation and that without any merit or good work of thine for it is not of works lest any man should boast no it is of grace of grace alone for unto him that works not but believes on him that justifies the ungodly his faith is counted to him for righteousness  but by talking thus you encourage sinners i do encourage them  to repent and do not you do not you know how many heap sin upon sin purely for want of such encouragement because they think they can never be forgiven there is no place for repentance lest does not your heart also bleed for them what would you think too dear to part with what would you not do what would you not suffer to bring one such sinner to repentance could not your love endure all things for them yes  if you believed it would do them good if you had any hope they would ever be better why do you not believe it would do them good why have you not a hope that they will be better plainly because you do not love them enough because you have not that charity which not only endures but at the same time believes and hops all things  you still think we are secretly undermining if not openly destroying the church what do you mean by the church a visible church as our article defines it is a company of faithful or believing people coetus credentium this is the essence of a church and the properties thereof are as they are described in the words that follow that the pure word of god be preached therein and the sacraments duly administered now then according to this authentic account what is the church of england what is it indeed but the faithful people the true believers of england it is true if these are scattered abroad they come under another consideration but when they are visibly joined by assembling together to hear the pure word of god preached and to eat of one bread and drink of one cup they are then properly the visible church of england  it were well if this were a little more considered by those who so vehemently cry out the church the church as those of old the temple of the lord the temple of the lord not knowing what they speak nor whereof they affirm a provincial or national church according to our article is the true believers of that province or nation if these are dispersed up and down they are only a part of the invisible church of christ but if they are visibly joined by assembling together to hear of his word and partake of his supper they are then a visible church such as the church of england france or any other  this being premised i ask how do we undermine or destroy the church the provincial visible church of england the article mentions three things as essential to a visible church  st living faith without which indeed there can be no church at all neither visible nor invisible  dly preaching and consequently hearing the pure word of god else that faith would languish and die and  dly a due administration of the sacraments the ordinary means whereby god increases faith now come close to the question in which of these points do we undermine or destroy the church  do we shut the door of faith do we lessen the number of believing people in england only remember what faith is according to our homilies viz a sure trust and confidence in god that through the merits of christ my sins are forgiven and i reconciled to the favor of god and we appeal to all mankind do we destroy this faith which is the life and soul of the church is there in fact less of this faith in england than there was before we went forth i think this is an assertion which the father of lies himself will scarce dare to utter or maintain  with regard then to this first point it is undeniable we neither undermine nor destroy the church the second thing is the preaching and hearing the pure word of god and do we hinder this do we hinder any minister from preaching the pure word of god if any preach not at all or not the pure word of god is the hindrance in us or in themselves or do we lessen the number of those that hear the pure word of god are then the hearers thereof whether read or preached fewer than they were in times past are the usual places of public worship less frequented by means of our preaching wheresoever our lot has been cast for any time are the churches emptier than they were before surely none that has any regard left either for truth or modesty will say that in this point we are enemies to or destroyers of the church  the third thing requisite if not to the being at least to the wellbeing of a church is the due administration of the sacraments particularly that of the lords supper and are we in this respect underminers or destroyers of the church do we either by our example or advice draw men away from the lords table where we have labored most are there the fewest communicants how does the fact stand in london bristol newcastle o that you would no longer shut your eyes against the broad light which encompasses you on every side  i believe you are sensible by this time not only how weak this objection is but likewise how easy it would be terribly to retort every branch of it upon most of those that make it whether we speak of true living faith of preaching the pure word of god or of the due administration of the sacraments both of baptism and the lords supper but i spare you it suffices that our god knows and will make manifest in that day whether it be by reason of us or you that men abhor the offering of the lord  others object that we do not observe the laws of the church and thereby undermine it what laws the rubrics or canons in every parish where i have been curate yet i have observed the rubrics with a scrupulous exactness not for wrath but for conscience sake and this so far as belongs to an unbeneficed minister or to a private member of the church i do now i will just mention a few of them and leave you to consider which of us has observed or does observe them most    days of fasting or abstinence to be observed the forty days of lent the emberdays at the four seasons the three rogationdays all fridays in the year except christmas day     so many as intend to be partakers of the holy communion shall signify their names to the curate at least some time the day before  and if any of these be an open and notorious evil liver  the curate shall advertise him that in any wise he presume not to come to the lords table until he has openly declared himself to have truly repented    then after the nicene creed the curate shall declare unto the people what holydays or fastingdays are in the week following to be observed    the minister shall first receive the communion in both kinds himself and then proceed to deliver the same to the bishops priests and deacons in like manner if any be present and after that to the people    in cathedral and collegiate churches and colleges where there are many priests and deacons they shall always receive the communion with the priest every sunday at the least    the children to be baptized must be ready at the font immediately after the last lesson    the curates of every parish shall warn the people that without great necessity they procure not their children to be baptized at home is their houses    the curate of every parish shall diligently upon sundays and holydays after the second lesson at evening prayer openly in the church instruct and examine so many children as he shall think convenient in some part of the catechism    whenever the bishop shall give notice for children to be brought unto him for their confirmation the curate of every parish shall either bring or send in writing with his hand subscribed thereunto the names of all such persons within his parish as he shall think fit to be presented to the bishop  now the question is not whether these rubrics ought to be observed you take this for granted in making the objection but whether in fact they have been observed by you or me most many can witness i have observed them punctually yea sometimes at the hazard of my life and as many i fear that you have not observed them at all and that several of them you never pretended to observe and is it you that are accusing me for not observing the rubrics of the church what grimace is this o tell it not in gath publish it not in the streets of askelon  with regard to the canons i would in the first place desire you to consider two or three plain questions   st have you ever read them over   dly how can these be called the canons of the church of england seeing they were never legally established by the church never regularly confirmed in full convocation   dly by what right am i required to observe such canons as were never legally established  and then i will join issue with you in one question more viz whether you or i have observed them most  to instance only a few  can    no person shall be admitted godfather or godmother to any child  before the said person has received the holy communion  can    every parson vicar or curate upon every sunday and holyday before evening prayer shall for half an hour or more examine and instruct the youth and ignorant persons of his parish  can    every parson vicar or curate shall declare to the people every sunday whether there be any holydays or fastingdays the week following  can    no minister shall refuse or delay to christen any child that is brought to the church to him upon sundays or holydays to be christened or to bury any corpse that is brought to the church or churchyard   n b inability to pay fees does not alter the case  can    no ecclesiastical persons shall spend their time idly by day or by night playing at dice cards or tables  now let the clergyman who has observed only these five canons for one year last past and who has read over all the canons in his congregation as the kings ratification straightly enjoins him to do once every year let him i say cast the first stone at us for not observing the canons so called of the church of england  however we cannot be it is said friends to the church because we do not obey the governors of it and submit ourselves as at our ordination we promised to do to all their godly admonitions and injunctions i answer in every individual point of an indifferent nature we do and will by the grace of god obey the governors of the church but the testifying the gospel of the grace of god is not a point of an indifferent nature the ministry which we have received of the lord jesus we are at all hazards to fulfill it is the burden of the lord which is laid upon us here and we are to obey god rather than man nor yet do we in any ways violate the promise which each of us made when it was said unto him take thou authority to preach the word of god in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost we then promised to submit mark the words to the godly admonitions and injunctions of our ordinary but we did not could not promise to obey such injunctions as we know are contrary to the word of god  but why then say some do ye leave the church leave the church what can you mean do we leave so much as the churchwalls your own eyes tell you we do not do we leave the ordinances of the church you daily see and know the contrary do we leave the fundamental doctrine of the church namely salvation by faith it is our constant theme in public in private in writing in conversation do we leave the practice of the church the standard whereof are the ten commandments which are so essentially inwrought in her constitution as little as you may apprehend it that whosoever breaks one of the least of these is no member of the church of england i believe you do not care to put the cause on this issue neither do you mean this by leaving the church in truth i cannot conceive what you mean i doubt you cannot conceive yourself you have retailed a sentence from somebody else which you no more understand than he  mr wesley then takes a retrospective view of the state of religion before the methodist doctrines were preached and the happy change produced thereby in the following words  before i conclude i cannot but entreat you who know god to review the whole matter from the foundation call to mind what the state of religion was in our nation a few years since in whom did you find the holy tempers that were in christ bowels of mercies lowliness meekness gentleness contempt of the world patience temperance longsuffering a burning love to god rejoicing evermore and in every thing giving thanks and a tender love to all mankind covering believing hoping enduring all things perhaps you did not know one such man in the world but how many that had all unholy tempers what vanity and pride what stubbornness and self will what anger fretfulness discontent what suspicion and resentment what inordinate affections what irregular passions what foolish and hurtful desires might you find in those who were called the best of men in those who made the strictest profession of religion and how few did you know who went so far as the profession of religion who had even the form of godliness did you not frequently bewail wherever your lot was cast the general want of even outward religion how few were seen at the public worship of god how much fewer at the lords table and was even this little flock zealous of good works careful as they had time to do good to all men on the other hand did you not with grief observe outward irreligion in every place where could you be for one week without being an eye or an ear witness of cursing swearing or profaneness of sabbathbreaking or drunkenness of quarrelling or brawling of revenge or obscenity were these things done in a corner did not gross iniquity of all kinds overspread our land as a flood yea and daily increase in spite of all the opposition which the children of god did or could make against it  if you had been then told that the jealous god would soon arise and maintain his own cause that he would pour down his spirit from on high and renew the face of the earth that he would shed abroad his love in the hearts of the outcasts of men producing all holy and heavenly tempers expelling anger and pride and evil desire and all unholy and earthly tempers causing outward religion the work of faith the patience of hope the labor of love to flourish and abound and wherever it spread abolishing outward irreligion destroying all the works of the devil if you had been told that this living knowledge of the lord would in a short space overspread our land yea and daily increase in spite of all the opposition which the devil and his children did or could make against it would you not vehemently have desired to see that day that you might bless god and rejoice therein  behold the day of the lord is come he is again visiting and redeeming his people having eyes see ye not having ears do ye not hear neither understand with your hearts at this hour the lord is rolling away our reproach already his standard is set up his spirit is poured forth on the outcasts of men and his love shed abroad in their hearts love of all mankind meekness gentleness humbleness of mind holy and heavenly affections do take place of hate anger pride revenge and vile or vain affections hence wherever the power of the lord spreads springs outward religion in all its forms the houses of god are filled the table of the lord is thronged on every side and those who thus show their love of god show they love their neighbor also by being careful to maintain good works by doing all manner of good as they have time to all men they are likewise careful to abstain from all evil cursing sabbathbreaking drunkenness with all other however fashionable works of the devil are not once named among them all this is plain demonstrable fact for this also is not done in a corner now do you acknowledge the day of your visitation do you bless god and rejoice therein  what hinders is it this that men say all manner of evil of those whom god is pleased to use as instruments in his works o ye fools did ye suppose the devil was dead or that he would not fight for his kingdom and what weapons shall he fight with if not with lies is he not a liar and the father of it suffer ye then thus far let the devil and his children say all manner of evil of us and let them go on deceiving each other and being deceived but ye need not be deceived also or if you are if you will believe all they say be it so that we are weak silly wicked men without sense without learning without even a desire or design of doing good yet i insist upon the fact christ is preached and sinners are converted to god this none but a madman can deny we are ready to prove it by a cloud of witnesses neither therefore can the inference be denied that god is now visiting his people o that all men may know in this their day the things that make for their peace  mr wesley in his farther appeal thus answers the charge of enthusiasm brought against the methodists  i assert that till a man receives the holy ghost he is without god in the world that he cannot know the things of god unless god reveal them unto him by his spirit no nor have even one holy or heavenly temper without the inspiration of the holy one now should one who is conscious to himself that he has experienced none of these things attempt to confute these propositions either from scripture or antiquity it might prove a difficult task what then shall he do why cry out enthusiasm enthusiasm and the work is done  but what does he mean by enthusiasm perhaps nothing at all few have any distinct idea of its meaning perhaps something very bad or something i never experienced and do not understand shall i tell you then what that terrible something is i believe thinking men mean by enthusiasm a sort of religious madness a false imagination of being inspired by god and by an enthusiast one that fancies himself under the influence of the holy ghost when in fact he is not  let him prove me guilty of this who can i will tell you once more the whole of my belief on these heads and if any man will show me by arguments not hard names what is wrong i will thank god and him  every good gift is from god and is given to man by the holy ghost by nature there is in us no good thing and there can be none but so far as it is wrought in us by that good spirit have we any true knowledge of what is good this is not the result of our natural understanding the natural man discerns not the things of the spirit of god so that we never can discern them until god reveals them unto us by his spirit reveals that is unveils uncovers gives us to know what we did not know before have we love it is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost which is given unto us he inspires breathes infuses into our soul what of ourselves we could not have does our spirit rejoice in god our savior it is joy in or by the holy ghost have we true inward peace it is the peace of god wrought in us by the same spirit faith peace joy love are all his fruits and as we are figuratively said to see the light of faith so by a like figure of speech we are said to feel this peace and joy and love that is we have an inward experience of them which we cannot find any fitter word to express  the reasons why in speaking of these things i use those terms  inspiration particularly are   because they are scriptural   because they are used by our church   because i know none better the word influence of the holy ghost which i suppose you use is both a far stronger and a less natural term than inspiration it is far stronger even as far as flowing into the soul is a stronger expression than breathing upon it and less natural as breathing bears a near relation to spirit to which flowing in has only a distant relation  but you thought i had meant immediate inspiration so i do or i mean nothing at all nor indeed such inspiration as is sine mediis but all inspiration though by means is immediate suppose for instance you are employed in private prayer and god pours his love into your heart god then acts immediately on your soul and the love of him which you then experience is as immediately breathed into you by the holy ghost as if you had lived   00 years ago change the term say god then assists you to love him well and is not this immediate assistance say his spirit concurs with yours you gain no ground it is immediate concurrence or none at all god a spirit acts upon your spirit make it out any otherwise if you can  i cannot conceive how that harmless word immediate came to be such a bugbear in the world why i thought you meant such inspiration as the apostles had and such a receiving the holy ghost as that was at the day of pentecost i do in part indeed i do not mean that christians now receive the holy ghost in order to work miracles but they do doubtless now receive yea are filled with the holy ghost in order to be filled with the fruits of that blessed spirit and he inspires into all true believers now a degree of the same peace and joy and love which the apostles felt in themselves on that day when they were first filled with the holy ghost  i have now considered the most material objections i know which have been lately made against the great doctrines i teach i have produced so far as in me lay the strength of those objections and then answered them i hope in the spirit of meekness and now i trust it appears that these doctrines are no other than the doctrines of jesus christ that they are all evidently contained in the word of god by which alone i desire to stand or fall and that they are fundamentally the same with the doctrines of the church of england of which i do and ever did profess myself a member  by these extracts my readers will see the principles of these honest if mistaken people and will come to such conclusion as his reason and understanding will afford him it will not be expected of me to give my opinion it is the business of an historian to relate facts and not to comment upon them particularly in cases where religion is the concern and in which i think every man has a natural right to follow the determinations of his own judgment but before i give a brief history of their rise etc after this recapitulation of their principles and doctrines i shall set before my readers what they say in answer to one or two of the most popular objections or calumnies raised against them the first of which is that they create divisions in private families their able apologist farther appeal p    thus refutes it accidentally we do for instance suppose an entire family to have the form but not the power of godliness or to have neither the form nor the power in either case they may in some sort agree together but suppose when these hear the plain word of god one or two of them are convinced this is the truth and i have been all this time in the broad way that leads to destruction these then will begin to mourn after god while the rest remain as they were will they not therefore of consequence divide and form themselves into separate parties must it not be so in the very nature of things and how exactly does this agree with the words of our lord suppose ye that i came to send peace upon earth i tell you nay but rather division for from henceforth there shall be five divided in one house three against two and two against three the father shall be divided against the son and the son against the father the mother against her daughter and the daughter against the mother the motherinlaw against the daughterinlaw and the daughterinlaw against the motherinlaw luke xii          and the foes of a man shall be they of his own household matt x     thus it was from the very beginning for is it to be supposed that a heathen parent would long endure a christian child or that a heathen husband would agree with a christian wife unless either the believing wife could gain her husband or the unbelieving husband prevailed on the wife to renounce her way of worshipping god at least unless she would obey him in going no more to those societies or conventicles as they termed the christian assemblies  do you think now i have an eye to your case doubtless i have for i do not fight as one that beats the air why have not i a right to hinder my own wife or child from going to a conventicle and is it not the duty of wives to obey their husbands and of children to obey their parents only set the case seventeen hundred years back and your own conscience gives you the answer what would st paul have said to one whose husband forbad her to follow this way any more what direction would our savior have given to him whose father enjoined him not to hear the gospel his words are extant still he that loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me and he that loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me matt x       nay more if any man comes to me and hates not in comparison of me his father and mother and wife and children yea and his own life he cannot be my disciple luke xiv     o but this is not a parallel case for they were heathens but i am a christian a christian are you so do you understand the word do you know what a christian is if you are a christian you have the mind that was in christ and you so walk as he also walked you are holy as he is holy both in heart and in all manner of conversation have you then the mind that was in christ and do you walk as christ walked are you inwardly and outwardly holy i sear not even outwardly no you live in known sin alas how then are you a christian what a railer a christian a common swearer a christian a sabbathbreaker a christian a drunkard or whoremonger a christian thou art a heathen barefaced the wrath of god is on thy head and the curse of god upon thy back thy damnation slumbereth not by reason of such christians it is that the holy name of christ is blasphemed such as thou they are that cause the very savages in the indian woods to cry out christian much drunk christian beat men christian tell lies devilchristian me no christian  it may be observed above that the methodists do not separate from the church nor farther appeal part iii p     dispute about the externals or circumstantials of religion they approve of and adhere to them all that they learned when they were children in their catechism and common prayer book they were born and bred up in the church of england and desire to die therein they always were and now are they say zealous for the church only not with a blind zeal they do not indeed lay the main stress of their religion on any opinions right or wrong neither do they ever begin or willingly join in any dispute concerning them the weight of all religion they apprehend rests on holiness of heart and life and consequently wherever they come they press this with all their might how wide then is their case from that of the protestant dissenters in general they avowedly separated from the church the methodists utterly disavow any such design they severely and almost continually inveighed against the doctrine and discipline of the church they left these approve both the doctrines and discipline of our church and inveigh only against ungodliness and unrighteousness they spent great part of their time and strength in contending about externals and circumstantials the methodists agree with the church of england in both so that having no time to spend in such vain contention they have their desire in spending and being spent in promoting plain practical religion i am sick says mr wesley of opinions i am weary to bear them my soul loathes this frothy food give me solid and substantial religion give me an humble gentle lover of god and man a man full of mercy and good fruits without partiality and without hypocrisy a man laying himself out in the work of faith the patience of hope the labor of love let my soul be with these christians wheresoever they are and whatsoever opinion they are of whosoever thus does the will of my father which is heaven the same is my brother and sister and mother  with regard to the charges of making men idle and thereby beggaring their families and of driving men out of their senses mr wesley thus answers this objection having been continually urged for some years i will trace it from the foundation two or three years after my return from america one captain robert williams of bristol made affidavit before the then mayor of the city that it was a common report in georgia mr wesley took people off from their work and made them idle by preaching so much  the fact stood thus at my first coming to savannah the generality of the people rose at seven or eight in the morning and that part of them who were accustomed to work usually worked till six in the evening a few of them sometimes worked till seven which is the time of sunset there at midsummer  i immediately began reading prayers and expounding the second lesson both in the morning and evening the morning service began at five and ended at or before six the eveningservice began at seven now supposing all the grown persons in the town had been present every morning and evening would this have made them idle would they hereby have had less or considerably more time for working the same rule i follow now both at london bristol and newcastleupontyne concluding the service at every place winter and summer before six in the morning and not ordinarily beginning to preach till near seven in the evening now do you who make this objection work longer throughout the year than from six to six do you desire that the generality of people should or can you count them idle that work so long some few are indeed accustomed to work longer these i advise not to come on weekdays and it is apparent that they take this advice unless on some rare and extraordinary occasion but i hope none of you who turn them out of their employment have the confidence to talk of my making them idle do you as the homely phrase is cry wh  first i admire your cunning but not your modesty so far am i from either causing or encouraging idleness that an idle person known to be such is not suffered to remain in any of our societies we drive him out as we would a thief or a murderer to show all possible diligence as well as frugality is one of our standing rules and one concerning the observance of which we continually make the strictest inquiry  but you drive them out of their senses you make them run mad nay then they are idle with a vengeance this objection therefore being of the utmost importance deserves our deepest consideration  and first i grant it is my earnest desire to drive all the world into what you probably call madness i mean inward religion to make them just as mad as paul was when he was so accounted by festus i grant secondly it is my endeavor to drive all i can into what you may term another species of madness which is usually preparatory to this and which i term repentance or conviction  now what if your wife or daughter or acquaintaince after hearing one of these fieldpreachers should come and tell you that they saw damnation before them and beheld with the eye of their mind the horror of hell what if they should tremble and quake and be so taken up partly with sorrow and heaviness partly with an earnest desire to be delivered from this danger of hell and damnation as to weep to lament to mourn and both with words and behavior to show themselves weary of life would you scruple to say that they were stark mad that these fellows had driven them out of their senses and that whatever writer it was that talked at this rate he was fitter for bedlam than any other place  you have overshot yourself now to some purpose these are the very words of our own church you may read them if you are so inclined in the first part of the homily on fasting and consequently what you have peremptorily determined to be mere lunacy and distraction is that repentance unto life which in the judgment both of the church and of st paul is never to be repented of  i grant thirdly that extraordinary circumstances have attended this conviction in some instances a particular account of these i have frequently given while the word of god was preached some persons have dropped down as dead some have been as it were in strong convulsions some roared aloud though not with an articulate voice and others spoke the anguish of their souls  this i suppose you believe to be perfect madness but it is easily accounted for either on principles of reason or scripture  first on principles of reason for how easy is it to suppose that a strong lively and sudden apprehension of the heinousness of sin the wrath of god and the bitter pains of eternal death should affect the body as well as the soul during the present laws of vital union should interrupt or disturb the ordinary circulations and put nature out of its course yea we may question whether while this union subsists it be possible for the mind to be affected in so violent a degree without some or other of those bodily symptoms following  it is likewise easy to account for these things on principles of scripture for when we take a view of them in this light we are to add to the consideration of natural causes the agency of those spirits who still excel in natural strength and as far as they have leave from god will not fail to torment whom they cannot destroy to tear those that are coming to christ it is also remarkable that there is plain scriptureprecedent of every symptom which has lately appeared so that we cannot allow even the conviction attended with these to be madness without giving up both reason and scripture  i grant fourthly that touches of extravagance bordering on madness may sometimes attend severe conviction and this also is easy to be accounted for by the present laws of the animal economy for we know fear or grief from a temporary cause may occasion a fever and thereby a delirium  it is not strange then that some while under strong impressions of grief or fear from a sense of the wrath of god should for a season forget almost all things else and scarce be able to answer a common question that some should fancy they see the flames of hell or the devil and his angels around them or that others for a space should be afraid like cain whosoever meets me will slay me all these and whatever less common effects may sometimes accompany this conviction are easily known from the natural distemper of madness were it only by this one circumstance that whenever the person convinced tastes the pardoning love of god they all vanish away in a moment  lastly i have seen one instance i pray god i may see no more such of real lasting madness  two or three years since i took one with me to bristol who was under deep convictions but of as sound an understanding in all respects as ever he had been in his life i went a short journey and when i came to bristol again found him really distracted i inquired particularly at what time and place and in what manner this disorder began and i believe there are at least threescore witnesses alive and ready to testify what follows when i went from bristol he contracted an acquaintance with some persons who were not of the same judgment with me he was soon prejudiced against me quickly after when our society were met together in kingswoodhouse he began a vehement invective both against my person and doctrines in the midst of this he was struck raving mad and so he continued till his friends put him into bedlam and probably laid his madness too to my charge  i fear there may also be some instances of real madness proceeding from a different cause  suppose for instance a person hearing me is strongly convinced that a liar cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven he comes home and relates this to his parents or friends and appears to be very uneasy these good christians are disturbed at this and afraid he is running mad too they are resolved he shall never hear any of those fellows more and keep to it in spite of all his entreaties they will not suffer him when at home to be alone for fear he should read or pray and perhaps in a while they will constrain him at least by repeated importunities to do again the very thing for which he was convinced the wrath of god comes upon the children of disobedience  what is the event of this sometimes the spirit of god is quenched and departs from him now you have carried the point the man is as easy as ever and sins on without any remorse but in other instances where those convictions sink deep and the arrows of the almighty stick fast in the soul you will drive that person into real settled madness before you can quench the spirit of god i am afraid there have been several instances of this you have forced the mans conscience till he is starkmad but then pray do not impute that madness to me had you left him to my direction or rather to the direction of the spirit of god he would have been filled with love and a found mind but you have taken the matter out of gods hand and now you have brought it to a fair conclusion  how frequent this case may be i know not but doubtless most of those who make this objection of our driving men mad have never met with such an instance in their lives the common cry is occasioned either by those who are convinced of sin or those who are inwardly converted to god mere madness both as was observed before to those who are without god in the world yet i do not deny but you may have seen one in bedlam who said he had followed me but observe a madmans saying this is no proof of the fact nay and if he really had it should be farther considered that his being in bedlam is no sure proof of his being mad witness the wellknown case of mr periam and i doubt more such are to be found yea it is well if some have not been sent thither for no other reason but because they followed me their kind relations either concluding that they must be distracted before they could do this or perhaps hoping that bedlam would make them mad if it did not find them so  and it must be owned a confinement of such a sort is as fit to cause as to cure distraction for what scene of distress is to be compared to it to be separated at once from all who are near and dear to you to be cut off from all reasonable conversation to be secluded from all business from all reading from every innocent entertainment of the mind which is left to prey wholly upon itself and day and night to pore over your misfortunes fortunes to be shut up day by day in a gloomy cell with only the walls to employ your heavy eyes in the midst either of melancholy silence or horrid cries groans and laughter intermixed to be forced by the main strength of those who laugh at human nature and compassion to take drenches of nauseous perhaps torturing medicines which you know you have no need of now but know not how soon you may possibly by the operation of these very drugs on a weak or tender constitution here is distress it is an astonishing thing a signal proof of the power of god if any creature who has his senses when that confinement begins does not lose them before it is at an end  how must it heighten the distress if such a poor wretch being deeply convinced of sin and growing worse and worse as he probably will seeing there is no medicine here for his sickness no such physician as his case requires be soon placed among the incurables can imagination itself paint such a hell upon earth where even hope never comes that comes to all  for what remedy if a man of sense and humanity should happen to visit that house of woe would he give the hearing to a madmans tale or if he did would he credit it do we not know might he say how well any of these will talk in their lucid intervals so that a thousand to one he would concern himself no more about it but leave the weary to wait for rest in the grave  the first public appearance of the rev mr george whitefield of pembroke college oxford who was an ordained clergyman of the church of england about london was in the year      when he and his associates preached up and down in the fields to vast multitudes of people with an energy that struck every one particularly in moorfields on kennington common blackheath etc and for some time they were admitted also into the churches to declare their peculiar opinions till the indolent clergy were roused by their extraordinary popularity and the churchwardens fearing damages to their pews etc etc they were generally refused the use of the public pulpits the uncommon fervor they expressed a simple yet persuasive eloquence and the mortified and laborious life they led procured them not only most numerous auditors but their doctrines such a multitude of followers as astonished the guardians of our church but whilst they themselves indolently persisted in their old rout of stated preaching mr whitefield particularly with a rapid progress took from them thousands of their hearers particularly of the lower sort and brought many more to a sense and abhorrence of their vices and to attend his preaching who perhaps had never been at any kind of worship before whilst the clergy raved both in the pulpit and in print against this novel doctrine as they styled it and with what justice may be seen above this itinerant preacher despising all danger and fatigue not only formed societies in england of his followers but traversing time after time immense tracks of land and water proselyted multitudes in all parts of north america and extended his cares even to the inhabitants of the infant colony of georgia where that wise and excellent governor mr oglethorpe well knowing that an attachment to religious principles and a life of virtue and self denial were spurs to industry and economy received him with open arms and gave him all manner of assistance here he at length erected an orphanhouse for poor and deserted children an institution that bid fair to be of extraordinary benefit in that country the most authentic account of which establishment by an impartial eyewitness and published in justice to the methodists may be seen in the london magazine for the year      page  0  in these christian labors perilous voyages and painful journies through the wilderness of america he was followed by mess john and charles wesley his faithful and able coadjutors who with a zeal and constancy second only to those which actuated the primitive apostles and disciples of our savior thought no hardships insurmountable no dangers too terrifying in prosecuting the work they supposed themselves appointed to of his own and his brothers conversion etc and of the necessity of becoming field preachers mr john wesley gives the following account i was ordained deacon in      and priest in the year following but it was many years after this before i was convinced of the great truths above recited during all that time i was utterly ignorant of the nature and condition of justification sometimes i confounded it with sanctification particularly when i was in georgia at other times i had some confused notion about the forgiveness of sins but then i took it for granted the time of this must be either the hour of death or the day of judgment i was equally ignorant of the nature of saving faith apprehending it to mean no more than a firm assent to all the propositions contained in the old and new testament as soon as by the great blessing of god i had a clearer view of these things i began to declare them to others also i believed and therefore i spoke wherever i was now desired to preach salvation by faith was my only theme my constant subjects were believe in the lord jesus christ and thou shall be saved him has god exalted to be a prince and a savior to give repentance and remission of sins these i explained and enforced with all my might both in every church where i was asked to preach and occasionally in the religious societies of london and westminster to some or other of which i was continually pressed to go by the stewards or other members of them things were in this posture when i was told i must preach no more in this and this and another church the reason was usually added without reserve because you preach such doctrine so much the more those who could not hear me there flocked together when i was at any of the societies where i spoke more or less though with much inconvenience to as many as the room i was in would contain but after a short time finding those rooms could not contain a tenth part of the people that were earnest to hear i determined to do the same thing in england which i had often done in a warmer climate namely when the house would not contain the congregation to preach in the open air this i accordingly did first at bristol where the societyrooms were exceedingly small and at kingswood where we had no room at all afterward in or near london and i cannot say i have ever seen a more awful fight than when on rosegreen or the top of hannammount some thousands of people were calmly joined together in solemn waiting upon god while they stood and under open sir adored the god who made both air earth heaven and sky and whether they were listening to his word with attention still as night or were lifting up their voice in praise as the sound of many waters many a time have i been constrained to say in my heart how dreadful is this place this also is no other than the house of god this is the gate of heaven be pleased to observe   that i was forbidden as by a general consent to preach in any church though not by any judicial sentence for preaching such doctrine this was the open avowed cause there was at that time no other either real or pretended   that i had no desire or design to preach in the open air till long after this prohibition   that when i did as it was no matter of choice so neither of premeditation there was no scheme at all previously formed which was to be supported thereby nor had i any other end in view than this to save as many souls as i could   fieldpreaching was therefore a sudden expedient a thing submitted to rather than chosen and therefore submitted to because i thought preaching even thus better than not preaching at all first in regard to my own soul because a dispensation of the gospel being committed to me i did not dare not to preach the gospel  dly in regard to the souls of others whom i every where saw seeking death in the error of their life  the effects of their preaching are thus described by the same hand just at this time when we wanted little of filling up the measure of our iniquities two or three clergymen of the church of england began vehemently to call sinners to repentance in two or three years they had sounded the alarm to the utmost borders of the land many thousands gathered together to hear them and in every place where they came many began to show such a concern for religion as they never had done before a stronger impression was made on their minds of the importance of things eternal and they had more earnest desires of serving god than they had ever had from their earliest childhood thus did god begin to draw them toward himself with the cords of love with the bands of a man many of these were in a short time deeply convinced of the number and heinousness of their sins they were also made thoroughly sensible of those tempers which are justly hateful to god and man and of their utter ignorance of god and entire inability either to know love or serve him at the same time they saw in the strongest light the insignificance of their outside religion nay and often confessed it before god as the most abominable hypocrisy thus did they sink deeper and deeper into that repentance which must ever precede faith in the son of god and from hence sprung fruits meet for repentance the drunkard commenced sober and temperate the whoremonger abstained from adultery and fornication the unjust from oppression and wrong he that had been accustomed to curse and swear for many years now swore no more the sluggard began to work with his hands that he might eat his own bread the miser learned to deal his bread to the hungry and to cover the naked with a garment indeed the whole form of their life was changed they had left off doing evil and learned to do well but this was not all over and above this outward change they began to experience inward religion the love of god was shed abroad in their hearts which they continue to enjoy to this day they love him because he first loved us and withheld not from us his son his only son and this love constrains them to love all mankind all the children of the father of heaven and earth and inspires them with every holy and heavenly temper the whole mind that was in christ hence it is that they are now uniform in their behavior unblameable in all manner of conversation and in whatsoever state they are they have learned therewith to be content insomuch that now they can in every thing give thanks they more than patiently acquiesce they rejoice and are exceeding glad in all gods dispensations toward them for as long as they love god and that love no man takes from them they are always happy in god thus they calmly travel on through life being never weary nor faint in their minds never repiing murmuring or dissatisfied casting all their care upon god till the hour comes that they should drop this covering of earth and return unto the great father of spirits then especially it is that they rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory you who credit it not come and see    in london particularly a great change was soon perceived in the majority of the common people an unusual seriousness appeared in their countenances they refrained from profane cursing and swearing and the alehouses were deprived of their usual inebriated guests meantime the more abandoned of the canaille whom no precepts could reach no future denunciations of punishment deter from wickedness spared not reproaches and even frequently proceeded to open insults and abuses of the preachers who were as warmly defended by their partisans so as often to occasion tumults and riots that were mutually charged by the methodists and their opposers on each other and kept the public for some years in perpetual dispute and agitation but at length now increased to a prodigious number they began to form societies apart for worship in their own way and to appoint stewards and other officers for the better regulation and government of those societies the principal of which in london are the tabernacle and foundery near moorfields the tabernacle in tottenham court road with many others in the city and suburbs their founders have increased their numbers in scotland and ireland also where they pursued their mission with the utmost success and in many places in england where religion was seldom heard of they have produced order humanity civility and a serious regard to divine things particularly amongst the colliers of kingswood and the fells about newcastle if the reader desires to enter into particulars with regard to their history he would do well to peruse the several journals of mess whitefield and wesley as i only propose here a general view of their rise etc indeed it is a peculiar circumstance that no sect in so few years ever became so numerous though they have met with mild treatment from the government and have endured no persecution for their opinions which has generally helped to increase rather than to deter the followers of a new system of doctrines with regard to the common people or the mob which is ever of the national religion so far as drinking swearing and rioting for it extends the appearance of the founders of methodism in the usual vestments of clergymen captivated them and prevented many disorders that would have arisen had persons not distinguished by that reverend garb endeavored to exhort and instruct them and yet according to mr wesleys account farther appeal part iii p    and seq  he himself was once particularly in great danger of losing his life and the methodists suffered by the spoils and ravages of desperate and wicked mobs in staffordshire in the year      to the amount of  0 l   s at the lowest computation owing to a shameful connivance perhaps underhand encouragement of those who should have restrained or punished them for their diabolical excesses in fact too many of their opposers merit the character mr wesley has given them  farther appeal part iii p     i have heard some affirm says he that the most bitter enemies to the present work of god were pharisees they meant men who had the form of godliness but denied the power of it but i cannot say so the sharpest adversaries thereof unless we might except a few honorable men whom i may be excused from naming were the scum of cornwall the rabble of bilston and darleston the wild beasts of walsal and the turnkeys of newgate  in fine the very enemies of these people will scarce deny that they have greatly contributed to reform and establish order and civility amongst the common people that they are i mean the real methodists for presbyterians quakers and every other sect have been personated as well as they for interested or villainous purposes are a peaceable upright and praiseworthy set of people that they cannot upon their principles distress but must add strength to the hands of government and that their rise and amazing progress has roused the established clergy from that lethargy into which they had fallen and invigorated them to be more attendant on the charge to which they were so solemnly appointed their favorite doctrines have found their way also into the pulpits of our churches and many excellent preachers who do not leave the church on that account enforce them at this day from their pulpits the great spread of methodism has certainly contributed to set people in general upon thinking of matters of the greatest moment to them and i will venture to assert from my own observation that there has been such an appearance of seriousness and such a concern for religion visible in all ranks of people since it has so much prevailed as cannot be remembered in any such period of time since the restoration  i shall conclude this head with a brief account of their manner of worship church discipline etc  with regard to their manner of worship it is like that of the church of england save that they allow themselves to continue long in extempore prayer and that they sing such hymns as are approved by the society indeed they allow of laypreachers or suffer unlearned men to preach or exhort in their places of worship i am bold to affirm says mr wesley that these unlettered men have help from god for that great work the saving souls from death seeing he has enabled and does enable them still to turn many to righteousness thus has he destroyed the wisdom of the wise and brought to naught the understanding of the prudent when they imagined they had effectually shut the door and blocked up every passage whereby any help could come to two or three preachers weak in body as well as soul who they might reasonably believe would humanly speaking wear themselves out in a short time when they had gained their point by securing as they supposed all the men of learning in the nation he that sits in heaven laughed them to scorn and came upon them by a way they thought not of out of the stones he raised up those who should beget children to abraham we had no more foresight of this than you nay we had the deepest prejudices against it until we could not but own that god gave wisdom from above to these unlearned and ignorant men so that the work of the lord prospered in their hand and sinners were daily converted to god  indeed in the one thing which they profess to know they are not ignorant men i trust there is not one of them who is not able to go through such an examination in substantial practical experimental divinity as few of our candidates for holy orders even in the university i speak it with sorrow and shame and in tender love are able to do  there have been some differences amongst the leaders of this people particularly between mr whitefield and mr wesley relative to the doctrine of reprobation but they agree in fundamentals in smaller points each thinks and lets think and mr wesley says he reverences mr whitefield both as a child of god and a true minister of jesus christ i could wish all religious disputes had been managed with equal candor  as to the discipline of the methodists i cannot give a better account of it than is contained in a small tract entitled the nature design and general rules of the united societies in london bristol kingswood and newcastle upon tyne  th edit      which i shall therefore lay before my readers    in the latter end of the year      eight or ten persons came to me in london who appeared to be deeply convinced of sin and earnestly groaning for redemption they desired as did two or three more the next day that i would spend some time with them in prayer and advise them how to flee from the wrath to come which they saw continually hanging over their heads that we might have more time for this great work i appointed a day when they might all come together which from thenceforward they did every week namely on thursday in the evening to these and as many more as desired to join with them for their number increased daily i gave those advices from time to time which i judged most needful for them and we always concluded our meeting with prayer suited to their several necessities    this was the rise of the united society first in london and then in other places such a society is no other than a company of men having the form and seeking the power of godliness united in order to pray together to receive the word of exhortation and to watch over one another in love that they may help each other to work out their salvation    that it may the more easily be discerned whether they are indeed working out their salvation each society is divided into smaller companies called classes according to their respective places of abode there are about twelve persons in every class one of whom is styled the leader it is his business   to see each person in his class once aweek at the least in order to inquire how their souls prosper to advise reprove comfort or exhort as occasion may require to receive what they are willing to give toward the relief of the poor   to meet the minister and the stewards of the society once aweek in order to inform the minister of any that are sick or of any that walk disorderly and will not be reproved to pay to the stewards what they have received of their several classes in the week preceding and to show their account of what each person has contributed    there is one only condition previously required in those who desire admittance into these societies a desire to flee from the wrath to come to be saved from their sins but wherever this is really fixed in the soul it will be shown by its fruits it is therefore expected of all who continue therein that they should continue to evidence their desire of salvation  first by doing no harm by avoiding evil in every kind especially that which is most generally practiced such is the taking the name of god in vain the profaning the day of the lord either by doing ordinary work thereon or by buying or selling drunkenness buying or selling spirituous liquors or drinking them unless in cases of extreme necessity fighting quarrelling brawling brother going to law with brother returning evil for evil or railing for railing the using many words in buying or selling the buying or selling uncustomed goods the giving or taking things on usury i e unlawful interest uncharitable or unprofitable conversation particularly speaking evil of magistrates or of ministers doing to others as we would not they should do unto us doing what we know is not for the glory of god as the putting on of gold and costly apparel the taking such diversions as cannot be used in the name of the lord jesus the singing those songs or reading those books which do not tend to the knowledge or love of god foftness and needless selfindulgence laying up treasures upon earth borrowing without a probability of paying or taking up goods without a probability of paying for them    it is expected of all who continue in these societies that they should continue to evidence their desire of salvation  secondly by doing good by being in every kind merciful after their power as they have opportunity doing good of every possible sort and as far as is possible to all men to their bodies of the ability which god gives by giving food to the hungry by clothing the naked by visiting or helping them that are sick or in prison to their souls by instructing reproving or exhorting all we have any intercourse with trampling under foot that enthusiastic doctrine of devils that we are not to do good unless our heart be free to it by doing good especially to them that are of the household of faith or groaning so to be employing them preferably to others buying one of another helping each other in business and so much the more because the world will love its own and them only by all possible diligence and frugality that the gospel be not blamed by running with patience the race that is set before them denying themselves and taking up their cross daily submitting to bear the reproach of christ to be as the filth and offscouring of the world and looking that men should say all manner of evil of them falsely for their lords sake    it is expected of all who desire to continue in these societies that they should continue to evidence their desire of salvation  thirdly by attending upon all the ordinances of god such are the public worship of god the ministry of the word either read or expounded the supper of the lord family and private prayer searching the scriptures and fasting or abstinence    these are the general rules of our societies all which we are taught of god to observe even in his written word the only rule and the sufficient rule both of our faith and practice and all these we know his spirit writes on every truly awakened heart if there be any among us who observe them not who habitually break any one of them let it be made known unto them who watch over that soul as they that must give an account we will admonish him of the error of his ways we will bear with him for a season but then if he repent not he has no more place among us we have delivered our own souls  may        john wesley charles wesley   the methodists have in some places as in tottenhamcourt road built almshouses for their more destitute poor they have also at times raised considerable sums for the relief of foreign protestants and their works of love during the late war will ever be remembered to their honor i need not remind my reader that mr whitefield has lately received the thanks of the legislature at boston in new england for the bountiful collection made by him toward the relief of the sufferers by the late fire in that city  i shall now conclude my history of the methodists with another quotation from mr wesley in answer to the current report of his receiving great emoluments from his present situation as director of the methodists  but perhaps you have heard that we in truth regard no church at all that gain is the true spring of all our actions that i in particular am well paid for my work having thirteen hundred pounds a year as a reverend author accurately computes it at the foundery alone over and above what i receive from bristol kingswood newcastle and other places and that whoever survives me will see i have made a good use of my time for i shall not die a beggar  i freely own this is one of the best devised objections which has ever yet been made because it not only puts us upon proving a negative which is seldom an easy task but also one of such a kind as scarce admits of any demonstrative proof at all but for such proof as the nature of the thing allows i appeal to my manner of life which has been from the beginning ye who have seen it and not with a friendly eye for these twelve or fourteen years last past or for any part of that time have ye ever seen any thing like the love of gain therein did i not continually remember the words of the lord jesus it is more blessed to give than to receive ye of oxford do ye not know these things are so what gain did i seek among you of whom did i take any thing from whom did i covet silver or gold or apparel to whom did i deny any thing which i had even to the hour that i departed from you ye of epworth and wroote among whom i ministered for nearly the space of three years what gain did i seek among you or of whom did i take or cover any thing ye of savannah and frederica among whom god afterward proved me and showed me what was in my heart what gain did i seek among you of whom did i take any thing or whose food or apparel did i covet for silver or gold had ye none no more than i myself for many months even when i was in hunger and nakedness ye yourselves and the god and father of our lord jesus christ know that i lie not  but it is said things are fairly altered now now i cannot complain of wanting any thing having the yearly income of a bishop of london over and above what i gain at other places at what other places my friend inform yourself a little better and you will find that both at newcastle bristol and kingswood the only places beside london where any collection at all is made the money collected is both received and expended by the stewards of those several societies and never comes into my hands at all neither first nor last and you or any who desire it shall read over the accounts kept by any of these stewards and see with your own eyes that by all these societies i gain just as much as you do  the case in london stands thus in november      two gentlemen then unknown to me mr ball and mr watkins came and desired me once and again to preach in a place called the foundery near moorfields with much reluctance i at length complied i was soon after pressed to take that place into my own hands those who were most earnest therein lent me the purchasemoney which was    l mr watkins and mr ball then delivered me the names of several subscribers who offered to pay some four or six some ten shillings a year toward the repayment of the purchasemoney and the putting the buildings into repair this amounted one year to near  00l the second to about   0 and so the last  the united society begun a little after whose weekly contribution chiefly for the poor is received and expended by the stewards and comes not into my hands at all but there is also a quarterly subscription of many of the society which is nearly equal to that abovementioned  the uses to which these subscriptions have been hitherto applied are  st the payment of that    l  dly the repairing i might almost say rebuilding that vast uncouth heap of ruins at the foundery  dly the building galleries both for men and women  thly the enlarging the societyroom to near thrice its first bigness all taxes and occasional expenses are likewise defrayed out of this fund and it has been hitherto so far from yielding any overplus that it has never sufficed for these purposes yet so far from it that i am still in debt on these accounts near  00l so much have i hitherto gained by preaching the gospel besides a debt of   0l still remaining on account of the schools built at bristol and another of above  00l on account of that now building at newcastle i desire any reasonable man would now sit down and lay these things together and let him see whether allowing me a grain of common sense if not of common honesty he can possibly conceive that a view of gain would induce me to act in this manner  you can never reconcile it with any degree of common sense that a man who wants nothing who has already all the necessaries all the conveniences nay and many of the superfluities of life and these not only independent on any one but less liable to contingencies than even a gentlemans freehold estate that such an one should calmly and deliberately throw up his case most of his friends his reputation and that way of life which of all others is most agreeable both to his natural temper and education that he should toil day and night spend all his time and strength knowingly destroy a firm constitution and hasten into weakness pain diseases death  to gain a debt of six or seven hundred pounds  but supposing the balance on the other side let me ask you one plain question for what gain setting conscience aside will you be obliged to act thus to live exactly as i do for what price will you preach and that with all your might not in an easy indolent fashionable way eighteen or nineteen times every week and this throughout the year what shall i give you to travel seven or eight hundred miles in all weathers every two or three months for what salary will you abstain from all other diversions than the doing good and the praising god i am mistaken if you would not prefer strangling to such a life even with thousands of gold and silver  the history of the antinomians this sect is so named from antinomy a word formed of the greek  contra and  lex signifying a contradiction between two laws and between two articles of the same law  they have never been a very numerous body at any time but in the late civil war they were most so as great numbers of them were in the parliament army at present by what i can learn they are but a few meeting at two or three places of worship in london they took their origin from john agricola who lived about the year      and who taught that the law is no way necessary under the gospel that good works do not promote our salvation nor ill ones hinder it that repentance is not to be preached from the decalogue but only from the gospel or in other words he was for carrying gospel liberty above all moral regards and for slighting the motives of virtue as insufficient to salvation   they met with hard measure not only from the government but from the other sects in the several reigns of the stuarts and under the usurpation they were written against by luther rutherford sedgwick gataker and bull and their opinions were as warmly defended by crisp tobias crisp d d who died in the year      he was a good preacher and a good man was first zealously attached to the principles of arminianism but changing his opinions ran into the contrary extreme of antinomianism the publisher of his works says that his life was so innocent and free from all evil so zealous and fervent in all good that it seemed to be designed as a practical confutation of the slander of those who would insinuate that his doctrine tended to licentiousness he was possessed of a very large estate with which he did a great deal of good  richardson eaton saltmarsh mr john saltmarsh of magdalen college cambridge a man of a fine active fancy says neale no contemptible poet and a good preacher and chaplain in the parliamentarmy the manner of his death as related by rushworth was very extraordinary december        being at his house at ilford in essex he told his wife that he had been in a trance and received a message from god which he must immediately deliver to the army he went that night to london and next day to windsor being come to the council of officers he told them that the lord had left them that he would not prosper their consultations but destroy them by divisions among themselves because they had sought to destroy the people of god those who had stood by them in the greatest difficulties he then went to the general and without moving his hat told him that god was highly displeased with him for committing of saints to prison the like message he delivered to cromwell and required him to take effectual measures for the enlargement of the members of the army that were committed for not complying with the general council he then took his leave of the officers telling them he had now done his errand and must leave them never to see them any more after which he went to london and took leave of his friends there telling them his work was done and desiring some of them to be careful of his wife thursday december   he returned to iford in perfect health next day he told his wife that he had now finished his work and must go to his father saturday morning december    he was taken speechless and about four in the afternoon he died  and williams from which defenders writings the committee of the westminster general assembly of divines appointed to peruse their writings drew out some of the most dangerous positions which when reported to the assembly in      they were not only condemned but confuted in their public writings and sermons  this is as much as is necessary to premise of the bistory of a sect that as such has made no great noise in the world and now i shall give some account of their principles just informing my readers that the learned wigandus published a comparison between ancient and modern antinomianism  they believe that the whole work of mans salvation was accomplished by jesus christ on the cross  that christs blood and our sins went away together  that then all our sins were taken away by christ and blotted out for ever  that nothing else beside faith is required in order to justification and salvation  that there is but one duty which is that of believing one must do nothing but quietly attend the voice of the lord the gates of heaven are shut upon workers and open to believers if we do nothing for heaven we do as much as god requires to believe certainly that christ suffered death for us is enough we want no more we are justified by our submitting in our judgments to the truth of gods grace in christ jesus it is not necessary that a man do any works that he may be justified and saved god does not require thee to do any thing that thou may be saved or justified the law sets thee to work but the gospel binds thee to do nothing at all nay the works are not only not required but forbidden god forbids us to work for justification and when the apostle paul presses men to believe it is as much as if he had bid them not to work  that the moral law is nothing to man from any demand of the law no man is obliged to go one step to give away one farthing to eat or omit one morsel for what did our lord do with the law he abolished it the expressions i here make use of are taken from several late writers who are much followed   that a spiritual man beholds justifying grace in believing without his obedience to commands for external worship and good works col ii  0  that outward things do nothing avail to salvation if love to god and love to our neighbor and relieving the poor be altogether unprofitable and unavoidable either to justification or salvation then these outward works in submitting to outward ordinances viz the ordinances of christ are much less available  those persons bring in the most dangerous kind of popery and pervert the gospel of christ who persuade men that if they do not submit to the ordinances of the lord jesus he will not confess them before his father it is better not to practice outward ordinances at all than to practice them on these gospeldestroying principles to the ruining of our souls  a believer has no inherent righteousness god will save us to the utmost without any righteousness or holiness of our own to look for inherent righteousness is to deny the spirit and trample under foot the blood of the covenant but believers have not any inherent righteousness in them our righteousness is nothing but the imputation of the righteousness of christ a believer has no holiness in himself but in christ only the trials of the spirit commonly called sanctification such as love gentleness longsuffering goodness meekness temperance neither make us holy before god nor in our own consciences i e we are not made good or holy by any inward qualities or dispositions but being made pure and holy in our consciences by believing in christ we bear forth inwardly and outwardly the fruits of holiness a believer does not increase in holiness as he increases in the love of god and man the very moment he is justified he is wholly sanctified and he is neither more nor less holy from that hour to the day of his death entire justification and entire sanctification are in the same instant and neither of them is thenceforth capable of increase or decrease we are to grow in grace but not in holiness the moment we are justified we are as pure in heart as ever we shall be a new born babe is as pure in heart as a father in christ there is no difference  in addition to this collective detail of the principles of the antinomians i shall give my readers the substance of a letter received from one of them which perhaps is a more perfect view of the principles of the sect and of many popular preachers who yet do not separate from the church or the sects with which they are united on that account  this i have had occasion to observe that no sooner does a person believe and profess salvation alone by christ without works of righteousness as done by him but immediately upon his embracing such a profession he shall be branded with the name of an antinomian though he should be at the same time notwithstanding his change of profession as to his behavior and deportment in life as unblameable as the strictest legalist whatever from whence it is pretty evident that the name of an antinomian is given to many by way of reproach or ridicule and that there are many so accounted to whom the charge does not justly belong because they disown all their own works in point of merit or acceptance with god yet that is no proof but what they may be found in the practice of all such good works as are necessary for good government and economy in society they own the reasonableness and necessity of these but that they do not make up or constitute any part of that kingdom which is spiritual and is not of this world as i am far from thinking that the religion of jesus consists merely in externals neither do i think that an intricate system of doctrines such as are superior to a common understanding is in the least necessary but rather prejudicial to those who would be edified by what they profess there seems to me to be two very essential points absolutely necessary namely the knowledge of ourselves of the true state of human nature and the knowledge of salvation in and through the promised messiah or redeemer or in other words that jesus is the son of god that he died for our sins and rose again for our justification agreeable to the scripture testimony that man is a sinner reason and revelation afford us the most ample proof from whence it is likewise evident that he stands convicted in his best doings and performances by the law of his maker which spiritual and divine commandment entails condemnation on all who hope for mercy and acceptance by a partial and imperfect obedience as opposites tend to illustrate so does an acquaintance with ourselves with the frailty and infirmity of our nature serve to illustrate the beauty and extent of divine grace as manifest in the person of christ our savior to speak with candor and impartiality for myself without reference to any person or party whatever as a christian i acknowledge christ as the only foundation of my hope toward god my acceptance with him and rejoicing in him i rest all my concerns for time and eternity with him as my wisdom to guide me through all the mazes of life i see mercy consistent with justice and a plenitude of grace extending to the guilty and all in harmony with every attribute of deity in and through the one mediator between god and man the man christ jesus the harmony and consistency of the sacred pages i likewise see in him of whom moses and the prophets spoke every precept fulfilled by him every threatening endured by him and every promised blessing i lay claim unto as my lawful inheritance in and through him my glorious and exalted head in consequence of this relation between christ as the head and the church his members unspeakable great and extensive are the privileges which they have a claim unto and yet with reverence they acknowledge the preeminence of their head in all things the name of jesus a savior is to me a sound more striking more excellent more harmonious than the most melodious notes from the best tuned instrument the whole creation in its vast extent and variety is to me as so many striking figures of that consummate beauty and perfection which dwells in his adorable person every amiable character by which he stands distinguished is to me full fraught with instruction admiration and consolation he is precious and honorable in my esteem and the language of the apostle is with me very familiar i e i count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of christ jesus my lord etc while i hear of various sounds from the various sectaries as having learned to distinguish the voice of the true shepherd i know that never varies i see no danger of running into error while i have recourse to and gather all my supplies from him as the fountain of truth itself thus i go on in dependence upon and intercourse with my lord and savior as having a glimpse of his glory i sometimes contemplate the pleasures that must necessarily result from a happy and immortal existence till that period shall commence my prevailing prayer and supplication is that he would teach me in all things by his influence and spirit that under a sense of my own insufficiency i may rely upon his fullness that with a becoming gratitude of soul i may acknowledge every instance of his goodness in all the dispensations of his providence and grace that i may have a continued sense of his presence which contains the fullness of joy the views of his reconciled countenance which makes life pleasant and gives a true relish for every rational enjoyment in forming a just estimation of persons and things imploring in all submission to the divine will so as to be able to justify him in the whole of his dealings toward the children of men but perhaps you will say what is all this without the external or practical part i answer as the lesser must of consequence be subservient to the greater so where the religion of jesus has its proper influence on the mind every thing that is commendable and praiseworthy every thing becoming a reasonable man becoming a christian will be the natural product as much as good fruit is the natural product from a good tree perhaps persons acquainted with the principles of the modern antinomians will be surprised at some things in this letter and the vein of christian charity that is visible in it in short the writer seems not to be willing to be called by that name  one quotation more and i conclude my account of the antinomians  a remarkable dialogue published in the london gazetteer of july         introduced by a serious and affecting letter to the minister and members of the society meeting for what they call the worship of god in coachmakers hall noblestreet between j n of broadstreet and one of the champions of the antinomian faith  ques   did our lord jesus christ die for all or only a part of mankind  ans he died for all  ques   if for all why then are not all saved  ans all are and will be saved he being an offering for sin none of adams race can perish or be lost for could that be the case then christ died in vain  ques   is faith necessary to salvation  ans nor faith nor works in man can avail any thing man of himself can do nothing but faith is the sum and substance of faith imputed to us as ours  ques   then contrary to scripture without holiness men may see the lord  ans the lord is our holiness therefore holiness is not required in man nor can avail otherwise than as the holiness of christ imputed to him  ques   is prayer for the pardon of sin necessary  ans if man prays to eternity it will avail nothing because the prayers of christ have reached heaven for all the race of adam  ques   is repentance for sin necessary  ans no not in man because christ has repented for us and his obedience is sufficient  ques   did christ come to reform the world or to save the world unreformed  ans the reformation of man can avail nothing christ having reformed the world in himself  ques   suppose then a man continues in notorious sins through the whole of life unrepented of can any faith in christ save him whose works from first to last denied him  ans yes because christ being his holiness he lived for him believed for him and was obedient for him therefore god wanted nothing of fallen man  ques   how then can it be said with any propriety that man will be judged hereafter according to the deeds done in the body  ans there will be no judgment after this life for judgment is already past christ having justified us before god has made us a free people  ques  0 if no judgment to come will there be any resurrection of the dead  ans this body of flesh will rise no more but our spirits will exist in christ we being the members of his body shall live in him as our all in all  ques    will there be any future punishment of any kind  ans no christ having overcome him that had the power of death and hell has brought in everlasting righteousness  ques    if no place of punishment the devil being overcome by the death of christ is he annihilated or restored to mercy  ans the latter by the sacrifice of christ who by his spirit went to preach to them that were in prison  the history of the moravians in giving my readers the history of this brotherhood i am under some difficulty they themselves have published little to the purpose and are a set of people not very communicative what can be done in this case all that can be done is to take it as well as the account of their principles etc from those who have wrote professedly against them and who having been initiated into their mysteries afterward forsook their society in which i am also justified by the moravians having never returned any proper answer to these writers so that their veracity remains at present unimpeached i should have been better pleased to have received the proper intelligence from themselves and their writings but after much patience exercised upon the occasion found myself disappointed the character of mr henry rimius is so well established for honor and veracity that i shall venture to give their history and discipline in his own words  candid narrative p   and seq printed in      where are references to the authorities made use of which i omit in this brief account nicholas lewis count of zinzendorf is the author of herrnhutism and it is to him that the progress this sect has hitherto made is to be ascribed according to the account he gives of himself he formed from the tenth year of his age a design to gather together a little society of believers amongst whom he might live and who should entirely employ themselves in exercises of devotion under his direction when he became of age which was in the year      his thoughts were wholly bent on executing his project and being joined by some persons that were of his way of thinking he settled at bertholsdorf in upper lusatia an estate which he had purchased giving the curacy of that village then vacant to a student in whom he had perceived sentiments analogous to his own  bertholsdorf soon came to be known for this sort of piety news thereof was brought to moravi by a carpenter named christian david who according to le long had been before in that country and there instilled into the minds of several people a distaste to the superstition of the romish church and an inclination to the protestant religion having engaged two or three of these proselytes to leave that country with their families count zinzendorf received them with gladness at bertholsdorf they were directed to build an house in a wood about half a league from that village which soon was finished so that on st martins day      these people held their first meeting there it is said that they foresaw that god would kindle a light in this place that should enlighten all the country christian david was so sure of the future growth of this settlement that he already divided the spot of ground round it into quarters and marked out in what directions the streets were to run the event has not contradicted this prognostication a good many people from moravia and elsewhere to shelter themselves under the protection of count zinzendorf flocked to this new settlement and built houses and the count himself fixed his residence there in a few years it became a considerable village having an orphanhouse and other public buildings thirtyfour houses were already built there in      and in      the number of inhabitants amounted to six hundred an adjacent hill called the huthberg gave occasion to these colonists to call their dewlling place huth des herrn and afterward herrnhuth which may be interpreted the guard or protection of the lord and from this the whole sect has taken its name  the herrnhuters soon established among themselves a sort of discipline which closely unites them to one another divides them into different classes puts them under an entire dependence on their superiors and confines them to certain exercises of devotion and to the observing of different little rules one may call it a monastic institution  the difference of age sex and the situation their members are in with respect to matrimony constitute these different classes there are classes of married men married women widowers widows maids bachelors children each has its director chosen by its members the same employments the men have among themselves are among the women which are exercised by persons of their own sex every member is daily visited by one of his class who gives him exhortations and takes notice of the actual state of his soul whereof he makes a report to the elders frequent particular assemblies are held in each class and general ones by the whole society the overseers or leaders have also their private meetings to instruct one another in matters concerning the guidance of souls the members of each class are subdivided into people that are dead awaked ignorant willing disciples disciples that have made a progress proper assistance is given to each of these subdivisions but above all great care is taken of those that are spiritually dead  they pay an uncommon attention to the instruction of youth besides those that have the care of orphans there are others that are entrusted with that of all the other children count zinzendorfs zeal has sometimes carried him so far as to take children to his own home to instruct them to the number of twenty whereof nine or ten slept in his bedchamber there are assemblies held of little children that are not yet in a condition to walk they are carried thither hymns are sung in these meetings and prayers made even sermons are preached to them suitable to the capacity of these infanthearers  the elder coelder the viceelder superintend all the classes there are likewise informers by office some of them known some kept secret besides a great many other employments and titles the detail of which would be too long and too tedious here  a great part of their worship consists in singing they pretend that children in particular are instructed in their religion by hymns count zinzendorf relates a very extraordinary thing in his natural reflections viz that the chanters of the society must have received a particular and almost inimitable gift of god for when they are obliged to sing at the head of the congregation their songs are always a connected repetition of those matters that had been preached just before  at all hours whether day or night some persons of both sexes are appointed by rotation to pray for the society and what is most remarkable these people without call clock or watch are acquainted by an inward feeling when their hour comes in which they are to perform their duty  when the brethren perceive that the zeal of the society is declining their devotion is revived by celebrating agapes or love feasts  the casting of lots is much practiced among them they make use of it to learn the will of the lord  the elders have the sole right of making matches no promise of marriage is of any validity without their consent the maids devote themselves to the savior not that their intent is never to marry but to marry only such a person with respect to whom god shall have made known to them with certainty that he is regenerated instructed in the importance of the conjugal state and appointed by the divine director to enter into that state  all is extraordinary at herrnhut the most stubborn diseases vanish there without help very rarely one dies there of a violent fever but it is common to die there of a cold defluxion or such like other slight indisposition these are at least things count zinzendorf affirms in a writing dated january         and presented to the ministry of the court of dresden  i do not find that the herrnhuters to the year      pretended to be any thing more than members of the lutheran church at bertholsdorf indeed they were all of them either born among lutherans or converted from popery to the faith of the augsburg confession and if some amongst them entertained ideas of calvinism count zinzendorf took care to cure them of it but from this time the herrnhuters undoubtedly with a view to set their society off to better advantage would pass for a sprig of those bohemian and moravian brethren who a long time before luther lived separated from the romish church and who in the time of the reformation entered into brotherly correspondence with the two great protestant societies but without uniting with either of them and count zinzendorf has since that time ever talked in this strain he pretends that these brethren originally were of the greek church and in process of time had united with the waldenses who derived their original from the latin church he bestows the greatest encomiums on this moravian church so much renowned in former times eclipsed and forgot afterward and at length if credit may be given him revived under his auspices at herrnhut he gives her the most pompous titles as the church of the cross  the church of the lamb  the church of the blood and wounds  the theocracy  a people whereunto never was seen the like  they are the hundred forty four thousand servants of god marked on their foreheads  whereof st john makes mention in his revelation  this descent would without doubt do honor to herrnhutism but there is a necessity of proving it first let us examine whether it ever has yet been proved so far from it that even setting aside the doctrine of the herrnhuters which openly contradicts this vainglorious pretension it has been acknowledged and proved by one of their own bishops that the ancient moravian brethren mixed with the reformed in poland and that not one of those that professed their doctrine remained in bohemia and moravia where it has been entirely extirpated ever since the year    0 the moravians who retired to herrnhut and who are the most inconsiderable part of the inhabitants of that village have nothing common with the ancient bohemian and moravian brethren they are roman catholics converted to the protestant religion as the herrnhuters themselves acknowledge  as the herrnhut society was begun upon the estate of count zinzendorf under his protection by his care and benefactions and according to his ideas and views it was but natural he should have a very great authority over it and so it happens he has always been the soul the oracle and the primum mobile of it he tells us himself that he has always been at the head of his sect both in temporals and spirituals and his disciples say the same though titles could add nothing to his authority yet he has not disdained them he has even made alterations in them at different times from the year      he was called the trustee or guardian of the brethren which happened in a singular manner as he tells us himself christian david the carpenter of whom mention has been made being once in the counts apartment to talk with him all on a sudden gave him this title which afterward was confirmed by the unanimous consent of the society in the month of march    0 he resigned this dignity in september      the society pressed him to take it upon him delivering to him an appointment or call for that purpose in form of an act signed by the brethren and sisters that were of the privy council of the society at that time he refused to comply but granted their request some months after upon a new appointment dated january         in      count zinzendorf who from the age of seventeen had believed he had a call from providence to an ecclesiastical state or condition of life and who had already publicly preached in some of the lutheran churches got himself consecrated bishop of his sect from that time according to the custom of bishops he made use of his christian name and of that of his see viz ludovicus moraviensis the prelate of this newfashioned creation nevertheless did not suffer himself to be dazzled by the luster of his mitre he tells us himself that he had very little forwardness to make a figure as a bishop and in the third general synod of herrnhutism held at gotha in    0 he laid down his episcopal dignity which however had made no change with respect to his office of trustee or guardian of the brethren it appears at least that he was still vested with it in      because at that time the brethren discharged him from it but this was only done with a view to give him a much more honorable title viz that of minister plenipotentiary and oeconomist with power to nominate a successor and an express clause that nothing of importance should be done or concluded without his consent he did not accept this new promotion till toward the close of the following year lately we see him style himself lord advocate of the unitas fratrum  count zinzendorf has very early been about extending his sect he has sent his fellow laborers throughout the world he himself has been over all europe and at least twice in america from the year      a new herrnhut has been set up in groenland and before the end of the preceding year the missionaries of herrnhutism had already passed the line the society possesses bethlehem in pensylvania it has a settlement amongst the hottentots china is entered into its plan but it has no where made better conquests than in the british european dominions in the united provinces and in wetteravia in the last province however where their views were discovered they have again lost ground they have also been turned out of the danish dominions where they had made a settlement  a discipline so much overburdened as that of herrnhutism could not very well take place but in a small society and we find that in proportion as this sect came to spread abroad it was thought necessary to forego in some measure the rigor of its rule in order to accommodate the institution to the taste humor and ideas of the new proselytes this gave rise to the modifications forms and different usages now in being among these sectaries count zinzendorf calls them tropes types and at this very time there are three of them viz the moravian trope or type which is the most ancient the lutheran which appears to him to be the most salutary to the children of god and the reformed or calvinist trope for which he also has a great regard and whereof mr de watteville his soninlaw was elected bishop in      i cannot exactly say wherein the above three modifications differ from each other these are secrets probably known by the adepts alone thus much they have thought fit to acquaint the public with that the bohemian confession is received by the first trope the confession of augsburg by the second and that of the reformed churches in the united provinces by the third indeed from the year      count zinzendorf has made all the tropes receive the augsburg confession however it is pretended that this has made no confusion among these several modifications  condescension being what has given rise to these tropes count zinzendorf from the same motive shows a general inclination to all christian communions he would have wrote to the pope had he known what title to give him he has even been persecuted for having maintained that the pope was not the antichrist he has sent a deputation to the patriarch of constantinople which has been very well received he shows a great attachment to lutheranism whereof he constantly pretends himself to be a member he boasts of being a minister of that church and affirms in spite of all that can be said to the contrary that he and his brethren have no other doctrine than what is taught by that communion he is of late become more favorable to calvinism than he was in the beginning it was in his power says he to have rooted it out from among the brethren he however declined it although according to him the taking of oaths is not prohibited yet the society wherever it settles is known to be averse to them and that probably out of complaisance to the mennonists or anabaptists he declares in general that whoever embraces herrnhutism need not change his religion such advances as these cannot but infinitely facilitate the propagation of the sect which already boasts of decimating all nations and pretends it has a right to all the children of god of whatever persuasion they be  though count zinzendorf tells us that he has sometimes met with resistance from the brethren and that they have contradicted him yet it appears in general that they have showed great docility both for him and those he has been pleased to make partakers of his authority submission to the will of the superiors of the society is a very essential article of his system he teaches in his sermons to the synod of zeist that god obeys the voice of his servants that is to say of the brethren but that it is required that first of all they agree with their friend that they act in concert with their chief the tractableness which he prescribes them must go so far as to suffer themselves to be led step for step like little children by men whom he calls ministers of the holy ghost and of the church representing them as being so many living images of our blessed savior the irksomeness of thus obeying without reserve is great it must be owned but then it is much alleviated by the notion that is instilled into them that their superiors receive from christ himself the orders that are given this the count inculcates among his flock with equal care and assiduity every thing is done by the saviors injunction jesus will have it so the lamb commands it this is the style of the ministers of the society according to them the savior gives his orders on the very moment they are to be executed he will not suffer that those who are to obey them have time to consider thus business is done quickly all at once and as it were in posthaste these are the counts own expressions who looks upon this method of the savior as a condescension he has for his children with whose weakness he is not unacquainted he knows adds he for instance how it is with a maid when she is apprised she is to marry therefore he does not willingly let persons know their destination much beforehand  the sending of missionaries according to this sect is a business in which the savior is particularly concerned count zinzendorf informs us minutely what the savior prescribes in this matter for instance some of the society earnestly desiring that those of their brethren who had been pitched upon to be sent away should be dispatched a day sooner than the savior had appointed the count opposed this motion with so much steadiness that it was dropped it was to no purpose they objected that the captains who were to take them on board at rotterdam would pay no regard to the day appointed by the savior he resolutely answered they will do it or if not our missionaries will come in another manner to the place for which they are destined this example of the counts faith will appear less astonishing when we attend to what he tells us further viz that he has found by experience that the brethren when the savior directed them in their travels have performed amazing things things which no art no human precaution ever could attain to he himself has once without human assistance made a voyage in eleven weeks which another herrnhuter could not compass in less than sixtysix because he was in the hands of men the savior continues this great apostle in a prophetical strain in his   d sermon preached at zeist protects his people in a quite wonderful manner my wishes and desires are that i could bring it to pass that we could have a couple of ships no matter of what bulk that belonged solely to the society and which the maritime powers might not suspect of carrying on a trade or being employed in smuggling which may be possible to obtain and depends only on a favorable moment then we should see wonders for at present our affairs are too much blended with the business of men with their interest and views this makes a great alteration and cannot but have some way or other an influence over the brethren but were it once to become the saviors business alone then he would let us see wonders on the sea he would not only cause us to make voyages with great swiftness but to land where never any body landed a tempest would be sufficient to bring us to the intended place in case leave was denied us to enter a port we should be conveyed into some inaccessible bay at some miles distance from the port where we might land and no body could find fault with it because it would appear that we were arrived there by stress of weather this would cost nothing to the savior it would be a play to his angels  count zinzendorf tells us himself that the commission of the society was never calculated for a general conversion of the heathen that the time of this great event is not as yet come but that the society being an  an election a chosen people it must have an  the firstlings or first fruits here and there among the heathen the little number the brethren have hitherto converted to the christian faith is but a comfort which the savior has granted them to make them amends for their labors and they believe themselves well rewarded for their toil if in two hundred voyages they make but one hundred converts he also tells us that the herrnhuters in order to acquire the firstlings of paganism choose to look out for them amongst those heathen that have had the least or no communication at all with the pretenders to christianity rather than among the last  as the brethren have always a great number of laborers on the roads oftentimes among these their chief himself with his family and retinue and as besides their undertakings and the acquisitions they make require considerable expense it is necessary they should have what is called the sinew of all great schemes money thus we find they have betimes established a fund called by them the lambs or the saviors chest which is become very considerable by the contributions and donations of the proselytes of herrnhutism and its favorers from the beginning two brethren were trusted with it of whom one kept the chest and the other the key but count zinzendorf has always had the principal direction over it this addition of temporal concerns must infallibly have crushed him under its weight he being already so much taken up with the spiritual ones of the society had he not found in the countess his spouse a proper assistant to share his fatigues with him in a manuscript history of the society whereof the count gives us some abstracts in the appendix of his natural reflections it is said that this lady during a time of twentysix years has so well husbanded the scanty funds of the society that nothing was ever wanting either in his family or amongst the brotherhood though there had been a necessity of furnishing from thence above one million of crowns for sundry undertakings upon the whole it is well known that whoever desires to be received as a brother is not welcome among them unless he contributes to the chest the count says himself that the oeconomists of the society may say to a young rich man either give us all thou have or get thee gone give us all thou have or thou can not be with us  i have already hinted at the rapid progress made by herrnhutism here follows another curious detail which count zinzendorf himself gives us in his natural reflections etc wrote in the years      and      this will show if credit may be given to what he says what situation the sect was in at that time the society says he had almost a thousand laborers dispersed all over the world this number however was not yet sufficient for in proportion as they worked the harvest increased twentyfour nations had been awakened from their spiritual drowsiness by the care of these apostles we preach says he to an innumerable number of souls in fourteen languages amongst whom without reckoning those that do not belong to the protestant religion nor the jews and heathens there are at least twenty thousand people that were not born lutherans whom we nevertheless bring to the augsburg confession and indeed we cannot recommend to them a better constitution than the church of the brethren we have adds he ninetyeight establishments amongst which are castles that have  0  0 or  0 apartments the missionaries of the herrnhuters do not go and preach in every place where their ministry is required on the   th of february      they had received above one hundred and seventy invitations only from easter of the foregoing year with regard to which they had not as yet taken any resolution in the mean while they are not idle in the year    0 they had already made two hundred voyages by sea as to the progress the sect has made abroad for these three years past i shall not venture to speak of as i have not sufficient materials for the purpose but as for the success they have met with in these kingdoms and are daily making every body is an eyewitness of it is to be supposed that their success from the year      must surpass that of the two years abovementioned  since the publication of the above account the moravians have not perhaps increased as the writings of mr riius and the narrative of andrew frey have done them great disservice with the sober part of mankind they were established here in england by an act passed many years since in june       and are in considerable numbers in this kingdom and its plantations as well as in ireland and scotland the public has yet felt no inconveniency from their admission and toleration nor are likely to feel any as they are in general an industrious set of people  candid narrative p    and seq where what is said as above is supported by quotations from count zinzendorfs sermons etc in german and translated into english i come now to the tenets of herrnhutism as long as herrnhut belonged to the church at bertholsdorf the society was held in great esteem and not at all suspected to differ from the confession of augsburg this was the reason for which the theological faculty at tubingen did not scruple to grant them those testimonials to which count zinzendorf has since that time always referred himself to prove the soundness of his doctrine they afterward however passed a judgment against them viz in       i do not know nor is it material to inquire whether count zinzendorf began to broach his new doctrine immediately upon the beginning of the first establishment of the society at herrnhut it seems more likely that as he enlarged his plan he enlarged his notions also thus much is certain that it is no easy matter to come at the tenets of this sect on account of the great obscurity affected by their teachers they make it their study to speak and write that they may not be understood it is a rule among them to speak to those that are not initiated into the mysteries of the theology of blood and wounds that is to say their own theology in a manner that they may not be able to tell again any thing of what they have heard they act says count zinzendorf himself in the same manner as one would do who to catch people that are too curious writes in a character they are not able to decypher they succeed wonderfully in this kind of style sometimes they are quite unintelligible at other times they begin to express themselves clearly but on a sudden become too obscure to be understood they are seldom entirely clear and nevertheless show often too great a clearness this has been very apparent to the author of this history  for indeed those things that escape them and are easy to be understood do no honor either to their judgment or understanding the reader will be convinced of it by the specimens i am going to lay before him i shall take a great number of them from count zinzendorfs theological opinion and his sermons preached in america and at zeist in the province of utrecht these last to the number of fiftysix were delivered to the synod of the brethren held at the last mentioned place in      and are printed and published by the society in one volume the count has not put his name to it for according to a letter inserted in siegfrieds bescheidene beleuchtung directed by him to all kings electors princes etc he has left off long ago to put his name to his writings but it is impossible to read these sermons without perceiving him to be the author besides this he declares himself very clearly in the preface where he says that the business of the author of these sermons is to exercise the office of syndic of the synods to superintend the records to administer the liturgy to prepare matters and propose them i the more willingly make use of these sermons as they have been preached for the instruction of several fellow laborers english and dutch lately received among the sect and since the preacher proposes there to himself to put into a better light certain central ideas by which one ought to regulate ones actions words and thoughts if it be possible to meet any where with the tenets of herrnhutism it must be in them  i begin with the idea this sect has of the scripture though count zinzendorf does not as yet think proper to disown the scripture yet the indifferent manner in which he gives his opinion of it shows what he aims at he says in a sermon preached at philadelphia that the style of the scripture is sometimes like that of a carpenter sometimes like that of a fisherman or of a tollgatherer christ himself had spoke very meanly and used many a phrase becoming a peasant which is now looked upon to imply something of quite a different nature since we are unacquainted with the manner of speaking used by the journeymen at nazareth he prescribes a method to his missionaries how to deal with the comptrollers of the scripture by whom he means those that desire proofs of every doctrine out of the scripture viz that they ought to prove all such things by the defects or imperfections of these writings which those comptrollers pretend to make good by the perfection and infallibility of the scripture the reading of the scripture appears to him to be more dangerous than useful to the society  according to count zinzendorf the doctrine that god the father is our creator the son our redeemer and the holy ghost our sanctifier is a false doctrine and one of the capital errors that reign in christendom creation and sanctification ought not to be ascribed to the father and holy ghost to avoid idolatry people ought to be taken from the father and holy ghost and conducted to christ with whom alone we have to do the ancients never dreamt of a trinity whoever adores the father and the holy ghost differs not from a servant of jupiter mercury apollo or of any great hero to whom the ancients gave the title of god our great doctor appears so positive of the orthodoxy of his new opinion that he calls the theology received among christians a dry one and good for nothing else than to amuse dogs and swine unbelievers and atheists invented by the devil and that such as teach it are satans professors satan has thought within himself says he men shall not come to see the father that is the true father who is the savior according to count zinzendorf i will conduct them round about the savior i will represent to them a phantom of a father and they shall think as the jews formerly did that this is their god thus the savior shall not get them by this means i will keep them in my power whilst they think within themselves they are very wise the mistake among christians adds he arises from their not comprehending that it is honor enough for the father to be the father of god the creator of all things and to be his own and only father  the holy ghost is called by the herrhuters the eternal wife of god the mother of christ the mother of the faithful the mother of the church count zinzendorf in the sixth part of his natural reflections gives a long detail to justify this change he makes in the common theology he looks upon it as important and necessary complaining much that since the reformation people are in gross ignorance concerning the person of the holy ghost and that the divines in this article commit a very palpable omission he adds that such as cannot comprehend the mystery of the trinity in the manner he explains it want undoubredly uprightness of heart more than understanding  thus it appears that the son is chiefly the object of the herrnhuters worship though count zinzendorf in plain words calls him the carpenter jesus having taken along with him into his glory the poor figure he made in this world yet the most tender names are given him he is called their lamb their little lamb their little jesus they make this name of the feminine gender calling him their mother their mamma jesua the creation redemption and sanctification is the work of christ but the father and holy ghost minister to him in all of them which is the identical word they use in expressing themselves on this head whoever believes in christ though he knows nothing more of the godhead will be saved the apostles to avoid idolatry had not baptized in the name of the father the son and holy ghost but in christs name only god had darted his son as a flash of lightning and the son by his incarnation had made a parenthesis in the godhead what in common life is called a grandfather a fatherinlaw such was the father of our lord jesus christ the son had taken it as a favor that he was allowed to become man and go out of the godhead christ had not conquered as god but as a man with the same strength we conquer god had assisted him and he assists us also christ had not had the least power more than we have he had laid aside his godhead and wrought miracles as men are able to do  they have a great devotion for the five red wounds of the crucifixion but that which christ received in his side is extolled above all the rest this is their favorite wound the very dear little holy opening the precious and thousand times pretty little side they kiss this wound they kiss the spear that made it and would kiss the soldier whose hand conducted the spear they thank him for it it is in this opening that the faithful reposes himself there he breathes there he sports there he lays down sometimes lengthwise sometimes crosswise there is his country his house his hall his little bed his little table there he eats there he drinks there he lives there he praises the dear little lamb  the herrnhuters have this distinguishing character of fanaticism that they reject reason reasoning and philosophy the children of god do not instruct themselves out of books to demonstrate religion to make it as evident as four times four are sixteen is an useless and superfluous labor faith does not require the least demonstration it is brought forth in the heart by the holy ghost the children of god believe because they find pleasure in believing nevertheless this faith produced without reasoning serves them instead of all other things no other commandment should be preached to men than that of believing this is count zinzendorfs doctrine  regeneration comes of itself without our being required to do any thing toward it it is a capital truth says our moravian bishop that such as have not received grace that are not yet children of god that have not yet a feeling of their reconciliation that do not know yet upon what terms they are with their creator and savior ought not to be engaged to prepare themselves for it by any action good works good resolutions see the foregoing account of the antinomians  they must be told that all that has been believed hitherto to be a preparation for coming to god is rather an hindrance to their salvation regeneration is brought about suddenly all at once one moment is sufficient to make us free to receive grace to be transformed to the image of the little lamb  a person regenerated enjoys great liberty he does what the savior gives him an inclination to do and what he has no inination for he is not obliged to do he does what the savior makes him do for he is the master in whose power it is to make laws and to repeal them who at all times can change the economy of salvation make criminal what was virtuous and virtuous what was criminal  it is wrong to say that a regenerated person does any thing properly speaking they do nothing it is the savior that acts for them he is with respect to the savior as a child whose hand one guides yet who believes it is himself that writes and rejoices at it  on the great day of judgment the herrnhuters will not be placed on the saviors left hand among those that are goats this is to be understood of course nor will they be amongst those called the sheep on the righthand of the judgment seat a place of honor they look upon too mean to be assigned them count zinzendorf tells us that the words holy angels coming with the savior in his glory denote the saints coming along with him and that the herrnhuters will be those saints that accompany him he adds that such as do not die herrnhuters will have mercy on that day provided they think favorably upon their dying bed of those belonging to that sect  the circumcision of the savior has according to them served to show of what sex he was it has likewise restored to honor that part of the human body which as a consequence of adams fall was become a disgrace to it insomuch that it is at present the most noble and the most respectable part of a mans body the sisters are exhorted never to think of it but with sentiments of the most profound veneration they are even thought to make a scruple of respecting men for any other reason the organ of generation of the other sex is no less honorable it has been sanctified by the birth of the savior i abate of the strength of my authors expressions whilst i abridge him for fear of offending the modesty of my readers  all the souls are of the feminine sex there are only animae and no animi says the moravian bishop with great elegance to think that there are malesouls would be according to this profound divine the greatest folly a chimera which ought not to enter the thoughts of a christian were he even in the midst of an high fever all that is of the male quality and was adapted to our body is detached from it as soon as it is interred it belongs not to its natural and primitive state it is an addition made to it afterward it is the seal of the office which the male sex is entrusted with for our sex is an employment an office jesus is the spouse of all the sisters and the husbands in the most proper sense are his procurators his agents in every respect like those ambassadors in ancient times who on marrying a princess in the name of their master put a booted leg in the weddingbed a husband is also properly no more than a chamberlain of his wife his office is but for a time and ad interim however the titles which the count gives him are not less glorious he is vicechrist vicegod the sisters are conducted to jesus by the ministry of their husbands who thus are their saviors in this world when therefore a marriage is made what is the reason of it because there was a sister who should be brought to the true spouse by the mediation of such a procurator count zinzendorf in a conference on this subject held at oly with the seventhday men made use of the following expressions which to avoid scandal as much as possible i choose to give in latin viz in ipso actu conjugali moriturus possem dicee salvatori veni de isto actu h e quem nomine tuo peregi  from what has been said two consequences naturally result which have not escaped the count the one is that whoever knows himself to be a man ought to acknowledge the dignity that is in him and honor the choice that has been made of his person the other that marriage is the most precious depositum the savior has entrusted with his church that is to say without doubt to the society of herrnhuters and the most important mystery to which he has given them the key considering this we cannot at all be surprised at being told that they look upon all that are married out of their society to live in fornication and adultery  the male sex consists of married men unmarried ones and widowers according to the primitive plan of the savior all that had passed the twentieth or twentyfirst year should be married after these years the state of unmarried people is a brutish state a state of madness where one does not know ones self besides this division of men into three classes there is another more general one by which they are distinguished into two choirs one includes the married people of both sexes and the other the unmarried ones count zinzendorf is not entirely pleased with either of the choirs and much less with the first than the second he rebukes the husbands and upbraids them with i do not know what abstraction or remissness in another sermon he observes that when the children of god will not experience physically certain things suitable to a certain age it is casting off human nature they become unhappy they forge to themselves chimeras they say i dont feel the same thing as other people this appears a little obscure but could perhaps be explained by what the sublime doctor elsewhere relates of a i do not know what mortification caused by i do not know what nonuse  i would here recommend to my readers a perusal of the dispassionate and wellwritten expostulatory letter addressed to nicholas lewis count zinzendorf and lord advocate of the unitas fratrum by george whitefield a b etc published in      which will still more elucidate what has been said above relative to the discipline and tenets of this society  the following account of their belief is somewhat more methodical  they believe and teach wesleys short view etc p     that christ has done all which was necessary for the salvation of all mankind that consequently we are to do nothing as necessary to salvation but simply to believe in him that there is but one duty now but one command viz to believe in christ that christ has taken away all other commands and duties having wholly abolished the law that a believer is therefore free from the law is not obliged thereby to do or omit any thing it being inconsistent with his liberty to do any thing as commanded that there is no such thing as degrees in faith or weak faith since he has no faith who has any doubt or fear that we are sanctified wholly the moment we are justified and are neither more nor less holy to the day of our death entire sanctification and entire justification being in one and the same instant that a believer is never sanctified or holy in himself but in christ only he has no holiness in himself at all all his holiness being imputed not inherent that a man may feel peace which passes all understanding may rejoice with joy full of glory and have the love of god and of all mankind with dominion over all sin and yet all this may be only nature animal spirits or the force of imagination that if a man regards prayer or searching the scriptures or communicating as matter of duty if he judges himself obliged to do these things or is troubled when he does them not he is in bondage he has no faith at all but is seeking salvation by the works of the law that therefore till we believe we ought to be still i e not to pray search the scriptures or communicate  thus i have given the best account i can collect of the principles of this very mysterious sect for whom in the words of mrs le fevre i pity and pray  i have been acquainted with some of them and have found them modest and inoffensive in their behavior and much resigned to the ways of providence but it is plain they make an idol of jesus christ and transfer the love and worship due to the supreme god and father of all to the son as fully appears from the preceding account in short i may say with mr oswald edwards when speaking of another sect i hate their notions but love the men  a dictionary of sects of lesser

the jews paid him called aurum corunarium some assert that before jesus christ they had another sort of apostle whose business was to collect the half skekel which was to be paid by every israelite to

to be a creature made out of nothing and in time this doctrine was condemned in the nicene council a c     but it was established in the council of rimini a c     arius the principal broacher of this doctrine died in     arianism the doctrine of arius who asserted that the son is not unbegotten nor in any manner a part of the unbegotten god nor from any part of the material world but that by the will and council of the father he existed before all time and ages perfect god the only begotten and unchangeable and that therefore before he was begotten or formed he was not but that there never

faith and holiness is promised and afforded on our sincere asking it but that the scripture does not require us to pray to nor pay adoration to the holy ghost they also believe that jesus christ offered himself an acceptable sacrifice or oblation to god but not as an adequate satisfaction they speak very ambiguously of the prescience of god at least episcopius and some of them for arminius taught that god elected the faithful according to his foreknowledge they maintain that there is an universal grace given to all men that every man is a moral agent at liberty to reject or embrace this grace they disclaim all human authority over the faith and consciences of others and inculcate charity and unity with christians of different denominations arnoldists a kind of sectaries in the   th

the church of sprinkling ashes on the heads of such as were then admitted to penance the ashes must be made from branches of the olive tree then they are laid upon the altar and blessed by the officiating priest afterward signed with the sign of the cross then they are strewed on the heads of the priests and then of the laity when this ceremony took its rise we cannot precisely determine the use of ashes and the ceremonies were forbidden in england by order of council in the reign of edward vi      this omission is at present supplied by reading publicly on ash wednesday the curses denounced in the holy scriptures against several kinds of sins the people repeating after such curse amen assuritans a sect of christians in the reign of constantius a d     they were a branch of the

superior to nature some denominate these speculative atheists and others whose wicked lives lead them to believe or wish there was no god are styled practical atheists augustins an order of religious who observe the rule of st augustine they are popularly called austin friars and were originally hermits congregated into one body by pope alexander iv under their general lanfranc      aulic council so called from the latin a hall it being in the hall of the university that this council is generally held a superior court or council which has an universal jurisdiction and without appeal over all the subjects of the empire in all processes entered therein the name is likewise applied to the officers who preside or assist in it it is composed of a president who is a catholic a vice chancellor eighteen assessors viz nine catholics and nine protestants auricular confession is that made in the ear privately enjoined by pope innocent iii passed into an article of faith in the lateran council      autocephali bishops this denomination was given to such bishops in the primitive church as were exempted from the jurisdiction of others before the setting up of patriarchs all metropolitans were accountable to no superior but a synod and even after the advancement of patriarchs several metropolitans continued thus independent this was likewise a privilege of the ancient british church insomuch that dinothus told austin in the name of all the britannic churches that they owed no other obedience to the pope than they did to every godly christian besides these there were another sort subject to no metropolitan but at what time this sort of independent bishoprics took place is uncertain autode fe or act of faith is a solemn day held by the inquisition for the punishment of heretics and the absolution of the innocent accused they usually contrive the auto to fall on some great festival that the execution may pass with the more awe and regard at least it is always on a sunday the criminals are first led to church where their sentence is read to them either of condemnation or absolution those condemned to death are here delivered up to the secular power with an earnest entreaty that no blood may be shed but if they persist in their supposed errors they are burnt alive those who suffer on this account meet with much less compassion and humanity than those who are put to death for capital crimes azymites christians who administer the eucharist or holy communion with unleavened bread authors are not agreed as to this being an occasion of a rupture between the romish and greek church but bingham mentions it as his opinion that the use of wafers and unleavened bread was not known in the church till the   th or   th century and he tells the following story in confirmation of it as gregory the great was administering the bread to a certain woman in the usual form the body of our lord jesus christ etc she fell a laughing and being asked the reason of it said because he called that the body of jesus christ which she knew to be bread that she had made with her own hands besides the ancients say their bread was common bread and not objected to till  0   but this is much more controverted by f sirmond in a dissertation wherein he shows that the latins had constantly communicated in leavened bread till the  0th century and thomas aquinas maintains that during the first ages of the church none but unleavened bread was used in the church that the primitive church did it in imitation of our savior who celebrated the last supper with unleavened bread upon the whole in the council of florence it was decreed that the point lay at the discretion of the church and that either leavened or unleavened bread might be used the western church has preferred the latter b bagnolenses a sect of heretics in the  th century who were mostly manichees rejected the old testament and part of the new held the world to be eternal and that god did not create the soul when he infused it into the body baptistery the place in which the ceremony of baptism is performed in the ancient church it was generally a building separate and distinct from the church it consisted of an anteroom where the persons to be baptized made their confession of faith and an innerroom where the ceremony of baptism was performed thus it continued to the  th century at which time the baptistries began to be taken into the church barallots a sect of heretics at bologna in italy who had all things even their wives and children in common barbes the name which the vaudois or waldenses a protestant sect in provence languedoc etc gave to their pastors the term signifies in the venetian language an elder the reason why their ministers were called by this name was that they might thereby conceal their function in remote parts and times of persecution the barbes made the education of youth and the superintendency of the public schools an important branch of their employment out of these scholars they selected such as had the best capacities for the ministry and in order to form and fit them for that office retained them for a time in their own houses however the exercise of the ministry was no manner of obstruction to their practice of some manual occupation or some other science particularly physic or surgery in which many of them were very great proficients they held a synod every year at which time the students in divinity were examined ordained and appointed either to go abroad or to preach in some of their churches their young pupils were accustomed to an unlimited obedience some of the barbes were married men though the majority of them observed celibacy that they might discharge their functions with the less obstruction or encumbrance bardesanists a sect of ancient heretics so denominated from their leader bardesanes a syrian of edessa in mesopotamia they believed that the actions of men depended altogether on fate and that god himself is subject to necessity they denied the resurrection of the body and the incarnation and death of our savior barnabas one of the fathers flourished a c    his works were printed at oxford      st barnabass day a christian festival celebrated on the   th of june st barnabas was born at cyprus and descended of the tribe of levi whose jewish ancestors are thought to have retired thither to secure themselves from violence during the troublesome times in judea his proper name was joses to which after his conversion to christianity the apostles added that of barnabas signifying either the son of prophecy or the son of consolation the first respecting his emment prophetic gifts the other his great charity in selling his estate for the comfort and relief of the poor christians he was educated at jerusalem under the great jewish doctor gamaliel which might probably lay the foundation of that intimate friendship which was afterward contracted between this apostle and st paul the time of his conversion is uncertain but he is generally esteemed one of the seventy disciples chosen by our savior himself barnabites an order of religious thus called from the church of st barnabas at milan where they were first established and not as some have imagined because st barnabas was their patron in reality st paul is the patron of the barnabites the barnabites are regular priests of the congregation of st paul their habit is black and the same with that they wore when first established in      by the express bulls of pope clement vii their office is to instruct catechize and serve in missions st bartholomews day a festival of the christian church celebrated on the   th of august st bartholomew was one of the twelve apostles and is esteemed to be the same as nathaniel one of the first disciples that came to christ the reason of this opinion is because as st john never mentions bartholomew in the number of the apostles so the other evangelists never mention nathaniel and as in st john philip and nathaniel are joined together in their coming to christ so in the rest of the evangelists philip and bartholomew are constantly put together what renders this still more probable is that nathaniel is particularly mentioned among the apostles to whom our lord appeared at the sea of tiberias after his resurrection where were present simon peter thomas and nathaniel of cana in galliee and the two sons of zebedee and two other of his disciples who were probably andrew and philip bartholomites a religious order founded at genoa in the year   0  in      the sultan of egypt coming into armenia committed great cruelties in that country and particularly persecuted the monks of st basil settled at monte negro many of whom suffered martyrdom and others escaped it by flight some of the latter flying into europe came to genoa under the conduct of one father martin they were well received and offered a settlement in that city basil st order of the most ancient of all the religious orders taking its name from st basil bishop of caesarea about the middle of the fourth century basilidians a sect so called from basilides in the second century and cotemporary with saturninus who flourished at antioch basilides in alexandria the peculiar tenets he held were that the supreme god whom he styled abraxas begot the thais or understanding from the thais was the logos cerived from the logos phrenesis or as tertullian translates it providence from phrenesis sophia and dynamis i e wisdom and power from sophia and dynamis sprung powers principalities and angels whom he calls the first by which angels were the first heaven created and then from them other angels by way of derivation arose who made and possessed another heaven and the head of all these angels was the god of the jews the creator of our world that jesus christ was his first begotten but that he did not become incarnate only appeared in human form etc etc beatification in the romish church the act whereby the pope declares the person happy after death it differs from canonization in the former the pope does not act as a judge in determining the state of the beatified but only grants a privilege to certain persons to honor him by a particular religious worship without incurring the penalty of superstitious worshippers but in canonization the pope speaks as a judge and determines ex cathedra upon the state of the canonized it was introduced when it was thought proper to delay the canonization of saints for the greater assurance of the truth and manifestation of the rigorous steps taken in the procedure beghardi beguardi or begghardi the name of an heretical sect in germany which sprung up toward the end of the   th century their head was one dulcinus their principal tenets were that man in this life might be impeccable and that he might rise to a degree of perfection not to be exceeded that this state is as happy as heaven which when once obtained men are no longer obliged to observe the fasts of the church nor obey their superiors that every intellectual creature is selfhappy they disregarded good works as of no avail to salvation and took great pains to spread abroad their impious doctrines these fanatics who wore the habit of monks without paying regard to any other rule or observing celibacy were condemned under pope clement v at the council of vienna in      beguins devout societies of young women established in several parts of flanders picardy and lorrain who maintain themselves by the work of their own hands leading a middle kind of life between the secular and religious but make no vows benedictius or benedictin order is an order of monks who profess to follow the uses of st benedict the benedictins are those properly called monachi monks the other orders may properly be denominates friars in the canon law the benedictins are called black maks being distinguished from the other orders by the color of their habit and not by the firname of their patriarch st benedict among us they wear formerly denominated black friars the benedictins wore a loose black gown with large wide sleeves and a capuche on their heads ending in a point behind benedictions the hebrews under this name understand the presents which friends make to one another in all probability because they are generally attended with blessings and compliments both from those who give and those who receive them benefice benefitium in an ecclesiastical sense a church endowed with a revenue for the performance of divine service or the revenue itself assigned to an ecclesiastical person for life in return for his performing the service of the church berengarians a religious sect in the eleventh century which adhered to the opinions of berengarius archdeacon of angers who in the year  0   began to propagate his doctrine concerning the eucharist in a manner agreeable to the tenets not only of bertram and scotus but of the whole primitive church asserting that the bread and wine in the lords supper is not really and essentially but only figuratively changed into the body and blood of christ several of the monks strenuously opposed berengarius at length in the year  0 0 he was condemned in a synod held at rome by pope leo ix and excommunicated as he was also the same year in a synod held at verceil in piedmont and in another held at tours in france at which lanfranc archbishop of canterbury assisted in the year  0   berengarius maintained his opinion in a synod held at rome before pope nicholas ii his followers were divided on the head of the eucharist but they all agreed that the bread and wine were not essentially changed some allowing that the body and blood of christ were contained in them though concealed under an impanation others denying any change at all bernardins or bernardites a christian fect extended over a great part of europe being an improvement on the order of st benedict first made by robert abbot de moleme and further reformed by st bernard abbot de clervaux whence they take their name  their usual habit is a white gown with a black scapulary but when they officiate they put on a large white cowl with great sleeves and a hood of the same color  they differ very little from the cistercians they had their origin toward the beginning of the twelfth century bethlchemites a christian sect called starbearers because they were distinguished by a red star having five rays which they wore on their breast in memory of the star which appeared to the wife men and conducted them to bethlehem several authors have mentioned this order but none have told us their origin nor where their convents were situated if we except matthew paris who says that in the year      they obtained a settlement in england which was at cambridge in trumpingtonstreet bible this word comes from the greek biblos which signifies a book we give this name to the collections of the sacred writings and call it bible or book by way of eminence and distinction the hebrews call it mikra which signifies lesson lecture or scripture  the books of the old testament were written chiefly in hebrew there are some parts of daniel written in chaldee but for the book of wisdom it was never written in any other than in greek  the books of the new testament were all written in greek except st matthew which was written in hebrew that is to say in syriac which was the language spoken at that time in judea but it is disputed whether st mark wrote in greek or latin and whether the epistle to the hebrews was not at first written in hebrew but it appears most certain that they were originally composed in greek  for an account of the different translations of the books of the old and new testament see calmet  bidellians from john biddle a schoolmaster at gloucester who was principal in the socinian scheme except that with the pneumatomachi of old he admitted the personality of the holy ghost and denying only its divinity asserted it to be no more than chief among the holy angels he met with great opposition and persecution this name was in good measure lost in the more common appellation of socinians or which they rather chose for themselves that of unitarians their first rise was in      bogomili or bogarmitae a sect of heretics sprung from the manichees or massalians toward the close of the eleventh century whose chief basil was burnt alive by order of the emperor alexander comnenus they denied the trinity maintaining their god had a human form that the world was created by evil angels etc etc etc bons fieux in english good sons a congregation of religious of the third order of st francis so called it was founded at armantieres a little town of flanders upon the lis in the year      by five pious artisans the oldest of whom was named henry pringuel a native of that town they lived in common and formed a little community in a house belonging to pringuel their habit was black and not distinguished from that of seculars three of them spent their time in making linen cloth one taught youth and the fifth made lace thus they lived till the year      when they embraced the third rule of st francis their order increased and in    0 it consisted of two congregations that of armantieres and that of lisle in the diocese of tournay in      they made a third settlement at st venant in the diocese of st omer lewis xiv gave them the direction of all his hospitals at dunkirk burgues and ypres their congregation is at present composed of seven houses and hospitals or rather seven families according to their manner of speaking breviary the roman catholic common prayer book generally in latin there are some in england latin and english  the roman

illiterate persons who devote themselves in some convent to the service of the religious  a lay brother wears a different habit from that of the religious he never enters into the choir nor is present at the chapters he is not in any orders nor makes any vow except of constancy and obedience he is employed in the temporal concerns of the convent and has the care of the kitchen gate etc the institution of lay brothers began in the eleventh century the persons on whom this title and office were conferred were too ignorant to become clerks and therefore applied themselves wholly to bodily work in which they expressed that zeal for religion which could not exert itself in spiritual exercises  in the nunneries there are also lay sisters who are retained in the convent for the service of the nuns in like manner as the lay brothers are for the monks budnaeans or budneists a sectary in poland      who disclaimed the worship of christ like those in transylvania met with much opposition yet propagated their opinions at cracow in the reign of sigismund they and their opposers ran into many wild hypotheses construing many natural effects into supernatural phenomenon in favor of each other bull a written letter dispatched by order of the pope from the roman chancery and sealed with lead it is a kind of apostolical rescript or edict and is chiefly in use in matters of justice and grace if the former be the intention of the bull the lead is hung by a hempen cord if the latter by a silken thread it is this pendent lead or seal which is properly speaking the bull and which is impressed on the one side with the head of st peter and st paul and on the other with the name of the pope and the year of his pontificate the bull is written in an old round gothic letter and is divided into five parts the narrative of the fact the conception the clause the date and the salutation in which the pope styles himself servus serverum the servant of servants  these instruments besides the lead hanging to them have a cross with some texts of scripture or religious motto about it thus in those of pope licius iii the device was adjuva nos deus salutaris noster that of urban

gallican church c calixtins a party or sect of christians in bohemia and meravia in the   th century the principal point in which they differed from the church was the use of the chalice calix or communicating in both kinds they were a branch of the hussites or followers of john huss caloyers a general name given to the monks of the greek church these religious consider st basil as their father and founder and look upon it as a crime to follow any other rule than his there are three degrees among them the novices who are called archari the ordinary professed called microchemi and the more perfect called magalochemi they are likewise divided into coenobites anchorets and recluse in the monasteries the religious rise at midnight and repeat a particular office called from thence mesonycticon which takes up the space of two hours after which they retire to their cells till five oclock in the morning when they return to the church to say mattins at nine oclock they repeat the terce sexte and mass after which they repair to the refectory where is a lecture read till dinner at four oclock in the afternoon they say vespers and at six go to supper after supper they say an office from thence called apodipho and at eight each monk retires to his chamber and bed till midnight every day after mattins they confess their faults on their knees to their superior they have four lents the first and greatest is that of the resurrection of our lord they call it the grand quarantain and it lasts eight weeks during this lent the religious drink no wine and their abstinence is so great that if they are obliged in speaking to name milk butter or cheese they always add this aparenthesis timitis a gias sarocostis i e save the respect due to holy lent the second lent is that of the holy apostles which begins eight days after whitsuntide its duration is not fixed it continuing sometimes three weeks and at other times longer during this lent they are allowed to drink wine the third lent is that of the assumption of our lady it lasts fourteen days during which they abstain from fish excepting on sundays and the day of the transfiguration of our lord the fourth lent is that of advent which they observe after the same manner as that of the apostles the caloyers besides the usual habit of the monastic life wear over their shoulders a square piece of stuff on which are represented the cross and the other marks of the passion of our savior with these letters jc xc nc i e jesus christus vincit calvinism the doctrine and sentiments of calvin and his followers with regard to matters of religion calvinism subsists in its greatest purity in the city of geneva whence it was propagated over france the united provinces and england in france it was abolished by the revocation of the edict of nantz in      it has been the prevailing religion in the united provinces ever since the year      in england it has dwindled since the time of queen elizabeth and is now chiefly confined among the dissenters though it still subsists a little allayed in the articles of the established church and in its rigor in scotland of the thirteen swiss cantons there are six who profess calvinism which likewise obtains in the palatinate except that of late popery is there become the reigning religion the distinguishing tenets of calvinism are  st that predestination and reprobation are prior to the prescience of good or evil works  dly that predestination and reprobation depend on the mere will of god without any regard to the merits or demerits of mankind  dly that god gives to those whom he has predestined a faith which they cannot lose a necesstating grace which takes away the freedom of the will and that he imputes no sin to them  thly that the righteous cannot do any good work by reason of original sin which cleaves to them  thly that men are justified by faith only the modern calvinists reject or palliate some of these articles in france the calvinists are distinguished by the name of huguenots and among the common people by that of parpaillots in germany they are confounded with the lutherans under the general title protestants only sometimes distinguished by the name reformed camaldolites or camaldules a religious order founded by st romuald a native of ravenna and descended from the illustrious house of its dukes romuald had tasted all the pleasures and passed through all the vices incident to youth but continual remorse of conscience determined him at last to renounce the world and dedicate himself wholly to god and religion for which purpose he retired to mount cassin where the conversation of a religious whom he met with there confirmed him in his resolution and induced him to take the habit in that monastery the manner of life which he enjoined his disciples to observe was this they dwelt in separate cells and met together only at the times of prayer some of them during the two lents of the year observed an inviolable silence and others for the space of an hundred days on sundays and thursdays they fed on herbs and the rest of the week only on bread and water cameronites a party of presbyterians which sprung up in scotland in the reign of king charles ii they took their name from one archibald cameron a fieldpreacher who was the first that separated in communion from the other presbyterians who differed from him in opinion concerning the minister who had accepted of an indulgence from the king he affirmed that it was countenancing the supremacy in church affairs whilst they alleged that it was only making use of the liberty to exercise the pastoral function from which they had been unduly restrained the cameronians in the fury of their zeal separated from the kirk they affirmed that the king had forfeited his right to the crown by breaking the solemn league and covenant which were the terms on which he received it they pretended both to dethrone and excommunicate him and broke out into an open rebellion which was suppressed by the duke of monmouth at bothwellbridge upon the revolution they were reconciled to the kirk and the preachers of their party submitted to the general assembly of the church of scotland in    0 see the history of that church canon this term signifies rule according to the import of the greek it is particularly used in the language of the church to signify such rules as are prescribed by councils concerning faith discipline and manners it is made use of likewise to denote those books of scripture which are received as inspired and canonical and to distinguish them from either profane apocryphal or disputed books there have been various collections of the canons of the eastern councils but there are four principal ones each ampler than the preceding ones the first according to usher a d   0 containing only those of the first ecumenical council and the five principal ones they were but     in number to these dionysius exiguus in the year   0 added the fifty canons of the apostles and those of other general councils the greek canons in this sacred collection and with those of the council of chalcedon to which are subjoined those of the council of sardica and the african councils the fourth and last collection comes down as low as the second council of nice and it is on that balsamon and zonaras have commented canon is also used as before observed for the authorized catalogue of the holy writings the ancient canon or catalogue of the books of the old testament was made by the jews and is ordinarily attributed to esdras this is the canon allowed to have been followed by the primitive church till the council of carthage and according to st jerome consisted of no more than twentytwo books but that council enlarged the canon very considerably taking into it the books which we call the apocrypha which the council of trent have farther enforced injoining all these to be received as books of holy scripture upon pain of anathema and being attainted of heresy canonization a declaration of the pope whereby after a great deal of solemnity they enter into the list of the saints some person who has lived an exemplary live and wrought miracles the word canonization seems to be of later origin than the thing there being no instance of the use of the word before the   th century whereas st uldaricus was canonized in the tenth the name is from canon in regard the primitive canonizations were only orders of the popes or bishops whereby persons eminent for piety etc were inferred in the canon of the mass that they might be commemorated in the service for that in those days the use of martyrologies was unknown in the church mabillon distinguishes two kinds of canonization a general and particular the first made by a general council or a pope the second by a bishop a particular church or a provincial council there are instances likewise of canonization at least something very like them by abbots at first only martyrs were canonized by degrees they came to confessors it is disputed whether the martyrdom does not supply the want of miracles canonization anciently consisted in inserting the saints name in the sacred diptychs or canon of saints in appointing a proper office for invoking him and erecting churches under his invocation with altars for mass to be celebrated on taking up the body from the first place of its burial and the like ceremonies by degrees other formalities were added processions made with the saints image in triumph the day of his death is declared a feast and to render the thing still more solemn honorius iii in      added several days indulgence to a canonization canons a particular order of religious distinct from monks their original can be carried no higher than the fourth century and is unanimously ascribed to the famous st augustine bishop of hippo in africa who first prescribed a way of living to clerks who would voluntarily live in common and possess nothing after the example of the monks capuchins religious of the order of st francis in its strictest observance the capuchins are thus called from capuce or capuchon a stuff cap or cowl wherewith they cover their heads they are clothed with brown or gray always barefooted are never to go in a coach nor ever shave their beard the capuchins are a reform made from the minors commonly called cordeliers set on foot in the sixteenth century by matthew baschi a religious observant of the monastery of montefiascone who being a roman was advertised several times from heaven to practice the rule of st francis to the latter upon this he made application to pope clement in      who gave him permission to retire into a solitude and not only him but as many others as would embrace the strict observance which some did accordingly in      they obtained the popes bull in      the order was brought into complete form matthew was elected general and the chapter made constitutions in      the right of preaching was taken from the capuchins by the pope but in      it was restored to them again with honor in      there were already seventeen general chapters in the order of capuchins cardinal is more particularly used for an ecclesiastic prince one who has a voice both active and passive in the roman conclave at the election of a pope some say the cardinals were so called from the latin incardinatio which signifies the adoption any church made of a priest of a foreign church driven thence by misfortune and add that the use of the word commenced at rome and ravenna the revenues of the churches of which cities being very great they became the common refuge of the unhappy priests of all other churches the cardinals compose the popes council or senate in the vatican are a constitution of pope john which regulates the rights and titles of cardinals in which he declares that as the pope represents moses so the cardinals represent the seventy disciples who under the pontifical authority decide private and particular differences cardinals in their first institution were only the principal priests or incumbents of the parishes of rome in the primitive church the chief priest of a parish who immediately followed the bishop was called presbyter cardinalis to distinguish him from the other petty priests who had no church nor preferment the term was first applied to them in the year   0 others say under pope silvester in the year  00 these cardinals alone were allowed to baptize and administer the eucharist when the cardinal priests became bishops their cardinalate became vacant they being then supposed to be raised to a higher dignity under pope gregory cardinal priests and cardinal deacons were only such priests or deacons as had a church or chapel under their care and this was the original use of the word leo iv in the council of rome held in     calls them presbyteros sui cardinalis and their church is parochios cardinales the cardinals continued on this footing till the eleventh century but as the grandeur of his state and holiness became exceedingly augmented he would have his council of cardinals make a better figure than the ancient priests had done it is true they still preserved their ancient title but the thing expressed by it was no more it was a good while however ere they had the precedence over bishops or got the election of the pope into their hands but when they were once possessed of those privileges they soon had the red hat and purple and growing still in authority became at length superior to the bishops by the sole quality of being cardinals carmelites an order of religious making one of the four tribes of mendicants or begging friars and taking both its name and original from carmel a mountain of syria formerly inhabited by the prophets elias and elisha and by the children of the prophets from whom this order pretends to descend in an uninterrupted succession the manner in which they make out their antiquity has something too ridiculous to be rehearsed some among them pretend they are descendants from jesus christ others go farther and makes pythagoras a carmelite and the ancient druids regular branches of their order carpocratians a branch of the ancient gnostics so called from carpocrates who in the second century revived and improved upon the errors of simon magus menander saturninus and other gnostics he owned with them one sole principal and father of all things whose name as well as nature was unknown the world he taught was created by angels vastly inferior to the first principle he opposed the divinity of jesus christ making him a mere man begotten carnally on the body of mary by joseph though possessed of uncommon gifts which set him above other creatures he inculcated a community of women and taught that the soul could not be purified till it had committed all kinds of abominations making that a necessary condition of perfection carthusians an order of religious instituted by s bruno about the year  0   remarkable for the austerity of their rule which obliges them to a perpetual solitude a total abstinence from flesh even at the peril of their lives and absolute silence except at certain stated times their houses were usually built in deserts their fare coarse and discipline severe it is observed that the monastical piety is better preserved in this than in any of the others m labbe de la trappe however endeavors to show that the carthusians do not live up to the austerity enjoined by the ancient statutes of guigues their fifth general m masson at present general of the order answers that abbot and shows that what he calls the statutes or constitutions of guigues are in reality only customs compiled by father guigues and that they did not become laws till long after catechism catechize are greek terms which signify instruction to instruct catechist he who instructs catechumen the person to be instructed in order to his being admitted a member of the christian church cathedral a church wherein a bishop has a see or seat the denomination cathedral seems to have taken its rise from the manner of sitting in the ancient churches or assemblies of primitive christians in these the council i e the elders and priests was called presbyterium at their head was the bishop who held the place of chairman cathedralis or cathedraticus and the presbyters who sat on either side were also called by the ancient fathers assessores episcoporum the episcopal authority did not reside in the bishop alone but in all the presbyters whereof the bishop was president a cathedral therefore originalty was different from what it is now the christians il the time of constantine having no librty to build any temple by their churches they only meant their assemblies and by cathedrals nothing more than consistories whence appears the vanity of some authors especially the spaniards who pretend their cathedrals to have been built in the time of the apostles catholic this term is originally greek it signifies universal or general thus the church of jesus christ is called catholic because it extends throughout the world and is not limited to time or place in the strict sense of the word there is no catholic church in being that is no universal communion and therefore when in rehearsing the apostles creed we profeis to believe the holy catholic we must mean as mr chillingworth expresses it the right that the church of christ or rather to speak properly the gospel of christ has to be universally believed and therefore the article may be true though there were no christian church in the world cerdonians a sect of erroneous christians in the first century who espoused most of the opinions of simon magus and the manicheans he asserted two principles a good and a bad the first he called the father of jesus christ the latter the creator of the world he denied the incarnation of jesus christ rejected the books of the old testament he likewise denied the resurrection his disciple marcion espoused and propagated the same sentiments cerinthians ancient heretics who denied the deity of jesus christ they took their name from cerinthus one of the first heretics in the church he being cotemporary with st john cerinthus was a zealous defender of the circumcision as well as the nazarenes and ebionites st epiphanius says he was the head of a faction which rose at jerusalem against st peter on account of some circumcised persons with whom that apostle had eat he believed that jesus christ was a mere man born of joseph and mary but in his baptism a celestial virtue descended on him in form of a dove by means whereof he was consecrated by the holy spirit and made christ it was by this celestial virtue therefore that he wrought so many miracles which as he received it from heaven quitted him after his passion and returned to the place where it came so that jesus whom he called a pure man really died and rose again but that christ who was distinguished from jesus did not suffer at all cesarins or caesarians a religious order being a reform of that of st francis who began to erect one with such magnificence for which he exacted large contributions of the order as was neither suitable to the humility which that saint had made profession of nor to the poverty which he had enjoined his followers cestertian monks a religious order founded in the  th century by st robert a benedictin and abbot of moleme certain anchorets of a neighboring forest having heard of st robert then abbot of st michael de la tonnee entreated him to take upon him the direction of them but the prior of his monastery and some of the ancient monks obstructed his complying with their request those monks of tonnere lived under so great a relaxation of discipline that the abbot lost all hopes of reforming them and therefore left them and retired to the abbey of montierlacelle in which he had formerly been a monk soon after he was chosen prior of the monastery of st augulphus which was dependent on that abbey then it was that the aforementioned anchorets applied themselves to the pope who granted them a brief which directed the abbot of montierlacelle to deliver robert to them they having made choice of him to govern them robert was well pleased with the popes order and accordingly joined those anchorets whom he led into the forest of moleme where they built themselves little cells made of the boughs of trees and a little oratory in honor of the holy trinity but these hermits falling into relaxation and robert not being able to reclaim them he left them and retired to a desert called haur where there were religious men who lived in much unity and simplicity of heart and who chose him for their abbot but those of moleme made use of the authority of the pope to oblige him to return and govern them as he had done before chalice the cup or vessel used to administer the wine in in the eucharist and by the romanists in the mass bid affirms that the chalice used by jesus christ at the supper had two handles and held just half a pint which the ancients imitated but in the modern times they are generally made of silver or gold chapter capitulum a community of ecclesiastics belonging to a cathedral or collegiate church the chief or head of the chapter is the dean the body consists of canons or prebendaries the chapter has now no longer share in the administration of the diccese during the life of the bishop but succeeds to the whole episcopal jurisdiction during the vacancy of the sea the origin of the chapters is derived from hence that anciently the bishops had their clergy residing with them in their cathedrals to assist in performance of sacred offices and in the government of the church and even after parochical settlements were made there were still a body of clerks who continued with the bishops and were indeed his family maintained out of his income charity of our lady religious hospitallers called the order of this order was founded about the end of the   th century guy lord of toinville in france having built on his own lands in a place called boucheraumont in the diocese of chalons an hospital for the necessity of the sick and the poor gave the care of it to some secular persons who formed a community among themselves and took the holy virgin for their patroness and as charity was the principal motive of their union the hospital was named the charity of our lady soon after their founder procured them a new settlement at pris and in the year   00 pope boniface viii confirmed this order and honored it with the protection of the holy see the religious of this order observed the third rule of st francis philip the fair in      gave them a house adjoining to their church they had several convents in different parts of the kingdom but in length of time these religious growing disorderly and irregular their order dwindled and at last became extinct in      their convent at paris was given to the carmelites which was confirmed by letterspatent of king lewis xiii charity of st hippolytus religious hospitallers of that order about the year      in the pontificate of gregory xiii one bernardin alvarez a mexican founded an hospital at a little distance from the city of mexico with the permission of the archbishop and dedicated it to the honor of st hippolytus the martyr patron of the city of mexico bernardin drew up constitutions for the government of those who joined themselves with him in the pious design of serving the poor and got them approved by pope gregory xiii afterward some other hospitals were built in imitation of this the number of which increasing they united and formed a congregation under the name of the charity of st hippolytus which still subsists chazinzarians a sect of heretics which arose in armenia in the seventh century they are so called from the armenian word chazus which signifies a cross because they are charged with adoring the cross whence in greek they are likewise called staurolatrae childermas day called also innecents day an anniversary feast of the church held on the   th of december in memory of the children of bethlehem massacred by order of herod chorepiscopi in the ancient church when the dioceses became enlarged by the conversion of pagans in the country and villages at a great distance from the citychurch the bishops appointed themselves certain assistants whom they called chorepiscopi because by their office they were bishops of the country there have been great disputes among the learned concerning the nature of this order among the schoolmen and canonists it is a received opinion that they were mere presbyters others think there were two sorts of chorepiscopi some that had episcopal ordination and others that were mere presbyters but a third and the most probable opinion is that they were all bishops this is the sentiment of bishop barlow dr hmmond dr beveridge and dr cave see christian chrism oil conscrated by the bishop and used in the romish and greek churches in the administration of baptism confirmation ordination and extreme unction the chrism is prepared on holy thursday with a world of ceremony in spain it was anciently the custom for the bishop to take onethird of a sol for the chrism distributed to each church on account of the balsam that entered its composition du cange observes there are two kinds of chrism the one prepared of oil and balsam used in baptism confirmation and ordination the other of oil alone consecrated by the bishop used anciently for the catechumens and still in extreme unction the maronites before their reconcilement with rome besides oil and balsam used musk saffron cinnamon roses white frankincense and several other drugs mentioned by rynaldus in      with the doses of each the jesuit dandini who went to mount libanus in quality of the popes nuncio ordained in a synod held there in      that chrism for the future should be made only of two ingredients oil and balsam the one representing the human nature of jesus christ the other his divine nature the action of imposing the chrism is called chrismation this the generality of the romish divines hold to be the next matter of the sacrament of confirmation the chrismation in baptism is performed by the priest that in confirmation by the bishop that in ordination etc is more usually styled unction christ an appellation usually added to jesus and together therewith denominates the messiah or savior of the world the word in the original greek signifies anointed sometimes the word christ is used singly by way of antonomasis to denote a person sent from god an anointed prophet or priest christian one who professes the christian religion or one who believes in jesus christ and is baptized in his name christians a name first given at antioch to the followers of christ they were sometimes called brethren faithful saints believers friends etc the names of nazarenes and gallileans were likewise given them by the gentiles it is the opinion of some that christian was derived originally from the greek word christos good useful etc and applied to their kings as denoting authority or sacred hence the king of france bears the title or surname of the most christian king rex christianissimus the french antiquaries trace the original of the appellation up to gregory the great who writing a letter to charles martel occasionally gave him that title which his successors have since retained the christians were sometimes styled gnostics i e men of understanding and knowledge a name which was aped and abused by a perverse sort of heretics who are commonly distinguished by the name of gnostics because of their pretenses to knowledge and science falsely so called another name which frequently occurs in the writings of the ancients is that of theophori which signifies temples of god and is as old as ignatius we sometimes also meet with the name christophori used in the same sense yet it is very observable that in all the names they chose there were some peculiar relation to christ or god for partynames and human appellations they ever professed to abhor eusebius records a story of one sactus a deacon of the church of vienna who suffered in the persecution under antoninus being put to the rack and examined by the magistrate concerning his name his country his city and his quality his answer to all these questions was i am a christian this he said was to him both name and city and kindred nor could his persecutors extort any other answer from him the first christians distinguished themselves in the most remarkable manner by their conduct and their virtues the faithful whom the preaching of st peter had converted hearkened attentively to the exhortations of the apostles who sailed not carefully to instruct them as persons who were entering upon an entirely new life they went every day to the temple with one heart and one mind and continued in prayers doing nothing different from the other jews because it was not yet time to separate them but they made a still greater progress in virtue for they sold all that they possessed and distributed their goods in proportion to the wants of their brethren they eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart praising god and having favor with all the people st chrysostom examining from what source the eminent virtue of the first christians slowed ascribes it principally to their divesting themselves of their possessions for says that father persons from whom all that they have is taken away are not subject unto sin whereas whoever has large possessions wants not a devil or a tempter to draw him into hell a thousand ways christians of st john a very ancient but corrupt set of christians very numerous in bassora and the neighboring towns they inhabited along the river jordan where st john baptized and from him they had their name they hold an anniversary feast five days during which they all go to their bishop and are baptized they have no canonical books and deny the third person in the trinity christians of st thomas or san thoma a sect of ancient christians found in the east indies when the europeans touched at the port of callicut who pretend to be descended from those st thomas converted in the indies whence the name the natives call them by way of contempt nazarenes their more honorable appellation is mappuleymer christmas g d christi missa i e the mass of christ a festival celebrated on the   th day of december in commemoration of the birth of christ by the particular service of the church church is a religious assembly or the large fair building where they meet sometimes means a synod of bishops or presbyters and in some places the pope and a general council bellarmine and the romish divines to this definition add under the same pope sovereign pontiff and vicar of jesus christ on earth in which circumstance it is that the romish and reformed notion of church differ amelotte and others make a visible head or chief essential to a church accordingly among the catholics the pope in england the king are respectively allowed heads of the church bishop hoadley sets aside the notion of a visible head christ alone according to him is head of the church which position he has maintained with great address in a celebrated sermon before king george i on these words my kingdom is not of this world and in the several vindications thereof sometimes we consider church in a more extensive sense and divide it into several branches the church militant is the assembly of the faithful on earth church triumphant that of the faithful already in glory to which the catholics add the church patient that of the faithful in purgatory ecclesia  synonymous with our church is used in the greek and latin profane authors for any kind of public assembly and even for the place where the assembly is held the sacred and ecclesiastical writers sometimes also use it in the same sense but ordinarily restrain the term to the christians as the term synagogue which originally signifies the same thing is in like manner restrained to the jews thus in the new testament the greek  signifies almost always either the place destined for prayer as   cor xiv    or the assembly of the faithful diffused over the whole earth as ephesians v    or the faithful of a particular city or province as   cor viii     or even of a single family as romans xvi   or the pastors or ministers of a church as matt xvii    collect in the liturgy of the church of england and the mass of the romanists denotes a prayer accommodated for any particular day occasion or the like in general all the prayers in each office are called collects either because the priest speaks in the name of the whole assembly whose sentiments and desires he sums up by the word oremus let us pray as is observed by pope innocent iii or because those prayers are offered when the people are assembled together which is the opinion of pamelius on tertullian the congregation itself is in some ancient authors called collect the popes gelasius and gregory are said to have been the first who established collects colluthians a christian sect who rose about the beginning of the fourth century on occasion of the indulgence shown to arius by alexander patriarch of alexandria several people being scandalized at so much condescension and among the rest colluthus a priest of the same city he hence took a pretense for holding separate assemblies and by degrees proceeded to the ordinaton of priests as if he had been a bishop pretending a necessity for this authority in order to oppose arius to this schism he added heresy teaching that god did not create the wicked and that he was not author of the evils that befall men he was condemned in a council held at alexandria by osius in the year     collyridians arabian heretics in the fourth century so denominated from idolizing the virgin mary worshipping her as a goddess and offering to her cakes st epiphanius wrote against this extravagant superstition and showed them how to distinguish between the honor which ought to be paid to the virgin and that worship which is due only to god collobium a garment worn by bishops and presbyters in the primitive ages it was a short coat with short sleeves it was an usual garment among the romans and therefore a bishop or presbyter wearing a collobium is no proof that the clergy in those early times were distinguished by their habit from the laity as some have thought but is rather a proof of the contrary commendam in the canon or ecclesiastical law is the charge trust or administration of a benefice given either to a layman to hold by way of depositum for six months in order for repairs etc or to another ecclesiastic or beneficed person to perform the pastoral duties thereof till such time as the benefice is provided of a regular incumbent anciently commendams were a very laudable institution for when an elective benefice became vacant for which the ordinary could not for some reason immediately provide the care of it was recommended to some man of merit who took upon him the direction of it till the vacancy was filled up but who enjoyed none of the profits commendam in the church of rome is likewise a real title of a regular benefice such as an abbey or priory given by the pope to a secular clerk or even to a layman with power to dispose of the fruits thereof during life and by the popes bulls the commendatory abbot has the full authority of the regular abbot to whom he is substituted except ing only in spiritualibus the direction of which is left to the claustral prior benefices in commendam are vested in the crown by a statute of henry viii this right was contested in the reign of king james i who designing to give in commendam a vacant church it was disputed in the court of common pleas not only whether the king might grant a commendam to a bishop either before or after his consecration but also whether commendams were to be granted without necessity the point was solemnly argued by the judges who were severely reprimanded at the council board by the king for daring to attack the prerogative royal communion the being united in doctrine and discipline in this sense of the word different churches are said to hold communion with each other and in the primitive christian church every bishop was obliged after his ordination to send circular letters to foreign or remote churches who professed the same faith to signify that he was in communion with them to maintain this unity of the faith entire every church was ready to assist all others in communion with her by opposing all fundamental errors and heresies and this gave occasion to most of the provincial and national synods we read of in which novel and what they thought erroneous doctrines were condemned by a council of bishops this unity was also further maintained by the readiness of each church and every member of it to join with all other churches in the performance of doctrine worship and all holy offices as occasion required by a mutual consent in ratifying all legal acts of discipline regularly exercised in any church whatsoever by unanimously receiving the customs of the church of rome and adhering to the decrees of councils both general and national all the christian churches were originally in communion with each other having one common faith and discipline in process of time a diversity of opinions prevailed and occasioned some churches to separate from the rest and to form the distinct communions into which the christian church is at present divided the three grand

also gregory xv and alexander vii conclave the place in which the cardinals of the romish church meet and are shut up in order to the election of a pope the ecclesiastical constitutions allow the cardinals to choose the place of the conclave notwithstanding which it is always held in the vatican on account of the spaciousness of the building the convenience of its open square and its galleries which will hold a number of servants the conclave is a range of small cells ten feet square made of wainscot they are numbered and drawn for by lot they stand in a line along the galleries and half the vatican with a small space between each such cardinals as were created by the late pope hang their cells with violetcoloured stuff and the rest with green serge each cell has the arms of the respective cardinal strong guard is kept at the door of the vatican and round the conclave and many precautions with much ceremony made use of to prevent any intelligence being conveyed or interest or

primitive church used to be administered or made use of immediately after baptism if the bishop was present at the solemnity it was made a sacrament of the church of rome in the melensian council this rite was reserved to bishops by theodoris     by the church of rome the sacrament of confirmation is that which makes us perfect christians and impresses an indelible character upon us after baptism and imparts to us the spirit of fortitude whereby we are enabled to confess christianity even at the hazard of our lives not so the protestants for confirmation with them is no sacrament no federal rites are declared to belong to it it is no new stipulation but rather a ratification of our baptismal engagements congregation an assembly of several ecclesiastics united so as to constitute a body the term is principally used for assemblies of cardinals appointed by the pope and distributed into several chambers for the discharge of certain functions and jurisdictions after the manner of our offices and courts  the first is the congregation of the holy office or the inquisition the second that of jurisdiction over bishops and regulars the third that of councils with power to interpret the council of trent the fourth that of customs ceremonies precedencies canonizations called the congregation of rites the fifth that of st peters fabric which takes cognizance of all causes relating to piety and charity part whereof is due to the church of st peter the sixth that of waters rivers roads the seventh that of fountains and streets the eighth that of the index which examines the books to be printed or corrected the ninth that of the government of the whole state of the church the tenth de bono regimine of which the cardinals nephew is chief the eleventh that of money the twelfth that of bishops wherein those who are to be promoted to bishoprics in italy are examined this is held before the pope the thirteenth that of consistorial matters the chief whereof is cardinal dean there is also a congregation of alms which takes care of what relates to the subsistence of rome and the state of the church consistory or roman consistory denotes the college of cardinals or the popes senate and council before whom judiciary causes are pleaded du cange derives the word from consistorium i e locus ubi consistitur used chiefly for a vestible gallery or antechamber where the courtiers wait for admission and called a consistente multitudine the consistory is the first court or tribunal of rome it never meets but when the pope pleases to convoke it and the pope presides in it in person mounted on a magnificent throne and habited in his pontificalia on the right are cardinal bishops and priests and on the left cardinal deacons the place where it is held is a large hall in the apostolical palace where princes and ambassadors of kings are received the other prelates prothonatories auditors of rota and other officers are seated on the steps of the throne the courtiers sit on the ground ambassadors on the right and consistorial and fiscal advocates behind the cardinals besides the public consistory there is also a private one held in a retired chamber called the chamber of papegay the popes throne here being only raised two steps high no body is here admitted but the cardinals whose opinions are collected and called sentences here are first proposed and passed all bulls for bishoprics abbeys etc hence bishoprics and abbeys are said to be consistorial benefices in regard they must be proposed to their consistory the annates be paid to the pope and his bulls taken anciently they were elective but by the concordat which abolishes elections they are appointed to be collated by the pope alone on the nomination of the prince consistory was always the name of a court under constantine where he sat in person and heard causes the members of this court were called consites consistory is also used among the reformed for a council or assembly of ministers or elders to regulate their affairs discipline etc constitution an establishment ordinance decision regulation or law made by authority of a prince or other superior ecclesiastical or civil the constitutions of the roman emperors make a part of the civil law the constitutions of the church make a part of the canon law some of the papal constitutions are in form of bulls others of briefs apostolical constitutions denote a collection of regulations attributed to the apostles and supposed to have been collected by st clement whose name they likewise bear they are divided into eight books consisting of a great number of rules and precepts relating to the duties of christians and particularly to the ceremonies and discipline of the church authors are divided about their genuineness the generality hold them spurious and endeavor to prove them posterior to the apostolical age maintaining they were unknown till the fourth century which if so shows st clement had no hand in them convocation a general assembly of the clergy of a province summoned by the kings writ to consult of the more weighty affairs of the church as often as a parliament is convoked to consult those of the state the kings writ is directed to the archbishop of each province requiring him to summon all bishops deans archdeacons of cathedral collegiate churches etc the place where the convocation of the province of canterbury have been usually held is st pauls church whence of late they have been prorogued to st peters in westminster in the chapel of henry vii or the jerusalem chamber where there is an upper and lower house the power of the convocation is limited by a statute of king henry viii they are not to make any canons or ecclesiastical laws without the kings license nor when permitted to make any can they put them in execution but under these restrictions   such canons must not be contrary to the kings prerogative   they must not contradict any statute or the common law   nor must they alter any known custom of the realm they have the examining and censuring all heretical and schismatical books and persons etc but there lies an appeal to the king in chancery or to his delegates the clergy in convocation and their servants have the same privileges as members of parliament cope an ecclesiastical habit by an act of king edward vi whenever the bishop shall celebrate the holy communion in the church he shall have upon him besides his rochet a surplice or albe and a cope etc it answers to the collobium or episcopal habit of the ancient church and was at first a common habit being a coat without sleeves but was afterward used as a churchvestment only made very rich by embroidery and the like the greeks pretend it was first used in memory of the mock robe put upon our savior copiotae a particular order of men in the primitive christian church whose business it was to inter the dead they were so called either from the pains they took or else because they committed the bodies of the dead to the grave a place of ease and rest they were instituted in the time of constantine or his son constantius in two of whose laws they are expressly mentioned their particular office was to prepare the graves wrap up the bodies of the dead and then bury them and because this was ever accounted a work of piety and religion therefore the copiotae though not in holy orders were considered as bearing a relation to the clergy and vested with the same immunities their number was very great constantine is said to have appointed no less than eleven hundred but by a law of honorius and theodosius they were reduced to nine hundred and fifty though anastasius afterward brought them back to the first number corporal in the christian church it is a fair linen cloth thrown over the consecrated elements at the celebration of the eucharist it was so called by the latins from being spread over the body of our lord jesus christ and according to isidore pelusiola was designed to represent the body of our savior being wrapped in fine linen by joseph of arimathea the institution of it is ascribed to eusebius bishop of rome about the year  00 covenant the first covenant between god and man was that which he made with adam at his creation when he required him to forbear the use of the forbidden fruit the second covenant is that which god made with man after his fall by promising him not only forgiveness provided he repented but also the coming of the messiah who should redeem him and all the human race from death a third covenant is that which god made with noah when he directed him to build an ark a fourth covenant is that which god made with abraham the mark and seal of which was circumcision but the greatest most solemn most excellent and most perfect which god ever made with man is that which he entered into with us through the mediation of jesus christ that eternal covenant which must subsist to the end of ages the priesthood sacrifice

wore in ceremony and when they assist at the office the other black wore on ordinary occasions in the streets etc f mabillon maintains the coul to be the same thing in its origin with the scapular the author of the apology of the emperor henry iv distinguishes two forms of couls the one a gown reaching to the feet having sleeves and a capuchon used in ceremonies the other a kind of hood to work in called also scapular because it only covers the head and shoulders council primitive and ecclesiastical is a free public ecclesiastical meeting especially of bishops and also of other doctors lawfully deputed by diverse churches for the examining of ecclesiastical causes according to the scriptures and those according to the power given by common suffrage without favor of parties to be determined in matters of faith by canons in cases of practice by precedents in discipline by decrees and constitutions these are not called for deciding political controversies this properly belonging to diets parliaments etc neither is it an office or prerogative of the pope to join them unless he be specially elected thereto by the assembly to sit as president neither may others unless bishops or some otherwise deputed pass a determinate sentence no sentence or decree is to be admitted as necessary to salvation unless it is founded on the word of god but all decrees made are obligatory and not to be rejected by private persons till an authority dispense with it equal to that which did at first bind them in brief it is a synod or assembly of prelates and doctors met for the regulating of matters relating to the doctrine or discipline of the church councils that called the first of the apostles was held at jerusalem a c    for the substituting matthias in the room of judas acts i     the second was when the twelve apostles called the multitude of the disciples and directed them to look out among themselves seven men of honest report full of the holy ghost and wisdom for deacons acts vi      the third was also held at jerusalem wherein they dispensed with an observation of the ceremonial law seeing that the christian dispensation was sufficient to the salvation of its votaries acts xv    a c     the fourth was for the toleration of some legal observations for a time that by such condescension the weaker part both of jews and gentiles might be gained to the belief and profession of christianity acts xxi    a c  0 the first general council that we find mentioned by tradition was held under the pontificate of pope victor a c     to adjust the celebrated controversy about keeping easter and to suppress the growing faction of the montanists mentioned by eusebius book v cap xv  councils ecumenical or general are assemblies of all the prelates in christendom in the strict sense of it but to constitute a general assembly it was never deemed necessary for all the prelates to be actually present it is sufficient that the council be regularly appointed and that they are called to be there a proxy might represent them or if they choose to absent themselves it will nevertheless be esteemed ecumenical general councils are sometimes called by ecclesiastical authors plenary councils the romanists reckon eighteen whereof only the four first are admitted by the reformed the eighteen are thus numbered viz two of nice four of constantinople one of ephesus one of chalcedon five of the lateran two of lions one of venice one of florence and the last of trent which last ordained provincial councils to be held every three years yet the last held was at bourdeaux in france more than  00 years ago  the canons and decrees of councils have been often collected viz by dr merlin of paris      another at venice in      another at rome in   0  one of

was to supply the omission of their former councils with respect to discipline they made  0  canons many of them trifling in their nature others very severe and oppressive to such as differed in point

the tartars and the holy land against the saracens to regulate the affair of the nonresidence of the clergy in what circumstances and for what part of their beces it should be permitted and appointed for the relief of the holy land the  0th part of all revenues of benefices and the tenth of the revenues of the people and cardinals but exempted the croisade priests from all manner of contributions  in this council the pope likewise excommunicated the emperor frederic from the communion of the church and dispossessed him of his empire from a suspicion of his having been dilatory in the supply of the papal chair which being now elected to himself he was mirded to show his authority and resentment this implacable proceeding did not however much affect the emperor b  greatly injurious to the german empire  the fourteenth general council and second of lions was appointed by poe gregory x according to his bull of indiction        for the  of the greek church   for the relief of the holy

decree to be made to oblige them to embrace a regular and monastic course of life or to retire and accordingly dunstan archbishop of canterbury the bishops of worcester and westminster turned the old clergymen out of most part of the churches and put monks in their place the archbishop likewise sharply reproved king edgar and imposed on him a penance for seven years croisade cruzade or cruzado a holy war or an expedition against infidels and heretics particularly against the turks for the recovery of palestine people anciently flocked on these croisades out of devotion the popes bull and the preaching of the priests of those days making it appear a point of conscience hence several orders of knighthood took their rise those who meant to go on this errand distinguished themselves by crosses of different colors wore on their clothes and were thence called croises the english wore them white the french red the flemish green the germans black and the italians yellow they reckon eight croisades for the conquest of the holy land the first undertaken in  0   at the council of clermont the second in      under louis vii the third in      by henry ii of england and philip augustus of france the fourth in      by pope celestin iii and the emperor henry vi the fifth published in      by order of innocent iii wherein the french germans and venetians engaged the sixth under the same pope began tumultuously in      and ended in the rout of the christians the seventh resolved on at the council of lions in      undertaken by st louis the eighth which was the second of st louis and the last of all in      it is said that it was the cistertian monks who first projected the croisades philip augustus solicited the execution thereof with the holy see and innocent iii raised the first standard of the cross it was the council of clermont who ordered that those embarked herein should bear the cross in their banner and that those who entered themselves into the service should also wear it on their clothes the abbot justiniani makes an order of knighthood of the croises who served in the croisades toward the middle of the   th century there was also a croisade of the saxons against the pagans of the north wherein the archbishop of magdeburgh the bishops of halberstadt munster mersburgh brandenburg etc with several lay lords embarked and toward the beginning of the same century under the pontificate of innocent there was also a croisade undertaken against the albigenses who were become powerful in languedoc etc croisier the pastoral staff so called from its likeness to a cross which the bishops formerly bore as the common ensign of their office and by the delivery of which they were invested in their prelacies hence the officer who like our vergers sometimes went before a bishop carrying his cross had the name of crociary or crossbearer cross the instrument of punishment to which jesus christ was fastened and on which he died this method of suffering was esteemed the greatest mark of infamy and therefore commonly inflicted on persons of the meanest rank and for the worst of crimes it was a common manner of punishment among the syrians egyptians persians greeks and romans the cross to which our savior was nailed was in the form of a t that is of the old samaritan tau the manner of crucifixion was by fastening the criminals with nails one through each hand and one through each foot and sometimes the persons were scourged with whips but the history of our lords crucifixon and passion are so particularly related by the evangelists that they need not be repeated the respect paid by the ancient christians to our saviors cross was by no means such a superstitious regard as is paid by the romanists to the representation of it in their churches and other places the devotion of the cross makes a very considerable part of the religion of the romish church toward the close of the  th century the  th general council of constantinople decreed that jesus christ should be painted in a human form upon the cross the more strongly to set before the eyes of christians the death and passion of our savior this also gave the first rise to the use of crucifixes among the romanists crosses are set up in churches placed on altars consecrated with great solemnity carried in procession placed in the streets at places of public resort and homage required to be paid to them their bishops wear a pectoral or breastcross which hangs by a goldchain or silverstring about their necks these modern representations of the cross are called crucifixes before the reformation it was esteemed a piece of devotion to erect crosses on hills in churchyards or over the tombs of great personages etc cross exaltation of a festival of the greek and romish churches observed on the   th of december in the reign of heraclius cosroes king of persia sacked jerusalem and together with other plunder carried off that part of the cross left there in memory of our savior by the empress helena which he sent into persia after many battles in which the persians were always defeated heraclius had the good fortune to recover the cross this prince carried it to jerusalem himself and laying aside his imperial ornaments marched with it on his shoulders to the top of mount calvary from whence it had been taken the memory of this action was perpetuated by the festivals of the reestablishment or as it is now called the exaltation of the cross the latter name was given to this festival because on this day they exalted or set up the cross in the great church at constantinople in order to show it to the people this festival is distinguished among the coptic or egyptian christians by the benediction of a particular cross which is afterward thrown into the river nile in order to make its waters fall away or rather as a grateful acknowledgment of the inestimable blessings which attend its overflowing crusade in spanish la cruciata a society or body of men from whom the court of inquisition in spain receives no small service their business is to have an eye over the behavior of all roman catholics and to inform against them in case they omit any duties of the christian profession this society is vastly rich and as powerful as it is wealthy for it consists of the bishops archbishops and most of the grandees of spain the spaniards are persuaded that had it not been for the inquisition and crusade their kingdom would have been overrun by the heretics who had near possessed themselves of the other kingdoms and states of europe cup this word is often taken in scripture both in a proper and a figurative sense in the proper sense it signifies a common cup which people drink out of at their meals or a cup of ceremony made use of at solemn and religious festivals as at the passover or some other hereditary bowls made use of in friendly entertainments  in the figurative sense is it generally taken for the afflictions which god sends to drink of the cup signifies to endure those punishments which god has seen and thought fit to exercise one under  the cup of blessing is that which was blessed in entertainments of ceremony thus our savior in the last supper blessed the cup and gave it to all his apostles to drink  the cup of salvation mentioned in the psalms is a cup of thanksgiving which while people drank they blessed the lord and were thankful for his mercies the jews have still at this day cups of thanksgiving which are blessed in their marriageceremonies and in entertainments made at the circumcision of their children d dalmatica a vestment or habit of a bishop and deacon so called because it was first invented in dalmatia pope sylvester appointed it to be used by the deacons it was a royal garment having been worn by the emperor pertinax and it was called chirodota or manicata because it had sleeves to distinguish it from the collobium which had none the dalmatica was all of white before but behind had two purple lines or stripes pope eutychianus decreed that the bodies of the martyrs should be wrapped up in the dalmatica virgins are sometimes represented in this dress for there is at rome a picture of st caecilia in the church of that saint habited in the dalmatica see collobium damianists so called from damianus a bishop a branch of the ancient acephalous severites who with the catholics admitted the fourth council but disowned any distinction of persons in the godhead and prefessed one single nature incapable of any difference datary an officer in the popes court he is always a prelate and sometimes a cardinal deputed by his holiness to receive such petitions as are presented to him touching the provision of benefices the datary has power to grant without acquainting his holiness therewith all such benefices as do not exceed twentyfour ducats annually but for such as amount to more he is obliged to get the provisions signed by the pope who admits him to audience every day if there be several candidates for the same place he has the liberty of bestowing it on which of them he thinks proper provided he has the requisite qualifications this officer has likewise a substitute but he can confer no benefice at all when a person has obtained the popes consent for a benefice the datary subscribes his petition annuit sanctissimus i e the most holy father consents to it after the petition has passed the proper offices and is registered it is carried to the datary who dates it and writes these words datum romae apud etc given at rome in the pontifical palace etc afterward the popes bull granting the benefice is dispatched by the datary and passes through the hands of more than  000 persons belonging to fifteen different offices who have all their stated fees the reader may guess at the revenue of the datary especially when the popes bull is procured for some large benefices davidists davidici a sect of heretics the adherents of david george a glazier or as others say painter of ghent who in      began to preach a new doctrine publishing himself to be the true messiah and that he was sent thither to fill heaven which was quite empty for want of people to deserve it he rejected marriage etc and laughed at the selfdenial so much recommended by christ he died in      but having promised his disciples to rise again at the end of three years the magistrates of basil where he died ordered his body to be dug up and burnt together with his writings by the common hangman day lammas the first of august celebrated as a festival in the romish church in memory of st peters imprisonment eudocia the wife of theodosius the emperor having made a journey to jerusalem was there presented with the fetters which st peter was loaded with in prison these she presented to the pope who afterward laid them up in a church built by theodosius in honor of st peter eudocia in the mean time having observed that the first of august was celebrated in memory of augustus caesar who had on that day been saluted augustus and upon that account given occasion to the changing the name of the month from sextilis to august that princess thought it not reasonable that a holyday should be kept in memory of an heathen emperor and therefore obtained a decree of theodosius that this day should for the future be kept holy in remembrance of st peters bonds this festival is known in the roman calendar by the name of the feast of st peter in vinculis in fetters it was called among us lammas day from a fond conceit the popish people had that st peter was patron of the lambs because our savior said to him feed my lambs upon which account they thought the mass of this day very beneficial to make their lambs thrive deacon signifies minister servant this word is made use of in the language of the church to denote those whose office it is to assist the bishop or priest in the distribution of the eucharist and besides this in the service of the poor and administering what is necessary for them the number of the disciples increasing daily at jerusalem the greeks i e the gentile converts began to murmur against the hebrews and to complain that their widows were neglected in the distribution of alms which was made every day hereupon the apostles called the multitude of believers together and said it is not reasonable that we should leave the word of god wherefore look you out among you seven men of honest report full of the holy ghost and wisdom whom ye may appoint over this business they therefore chose seven viz stephen philip prochorus nicanor timon parmenas and nicholas these they presented to the apostles and they were ordained by prayer and imposition of hands acts vi     timothy ii       those in the romish church sometimes baptized and preached in the absence of their bishop or priest and prepared catechumens for baptism see particularly their office in the histories of the church of scotland the presbyterians etc etc deaconesses were allowed in the primitive church but now laid aside certain devout women who consecrated themselves to the service of the church and rendered those offices to women which men could not decently do as in baptism for instance which was conferred by immersion on women as well as men deaconry a name still reserved to the chapels and oratories in rome under the direction of the several deacons in their respective regions or quarters dean a prime dignitary in most cathedral and collegiate churches being usually the president of the chapter it is a title also applied among us to diverse persons that are the chief of some peculiar churches and chapels as the dean of the kings chapel of the arches of battle etc etc death this word is taken in scripture not only for the death of the body when the soul is separated from the body but likewise for the second death a condemnation to misery it also signifies imminent danger of death for the plague and contagious diseases for poison and any great misfortune by the gates of death the grave is signified and the state of the dead after this life by the vessels or instruments of death dangerous and deadly weapons are meant by the bonds or snares of death the snares which are laid to destroy an enemy a son of death a man who merits death or is condemned to death by the dust of death the state to which the dead person is reduced in the grave love is as strong as death says solomon no one can resist death or love decalogue the ten commandments engraven on two tables of stone and given to moses declamation a feigned discourse or speech made in public in the tone and manner of an oration among the greeks declamation was the art of speaking indifferently on all subjects and on all sides of a question of making things appear just that were unjust and triumphing over the best and soundest reasons such sort of declamations m de st evremond observes were fit only to corrupt the mind by accustoming men to cultivate their imagination rather than to form their judgment and to seek for verisimilitudes to impose upon rather than solid reasons to convince the understanding among us declamation is restrained to certain exercises which scholars perform to teach them to speak in public decree in canon law an ordinance which is enacted by the pope by and with the advice of his cardinals in council assembled without being consulted by any person thereon decree of election and reprobation with some modern divines is that council or determination of god by which from all eternity he absolutely chose and set apart some in order to become good and happy but passed by the rest i e the far greater part of mankind forming his resolves in either case abstractedly from all consideration of any merit or demerit of theirs a notion which seems founded on some misconstrued passages of scripture and in particular those referred to in   pet iii    but of which we do not find the least traces in antiquity before the close of the fourth or beginning of the fifth century dedication the act of consecrating a temple altar statue place etc to the honor of some deity it is very ancient both in the heathen times and amongst the christians the feast of the dedication or rather the feast day of the saint and patron of a church was celebrated not only by the inhabitants of the place but by those of all the neighboring villages who usually reforted thither the custom is still retained in diverse places under the names of feasts wakes or vigils definition an enumeration of the chief simple ideas whereof a compound idea consists in order to ascertain or explain its nature and character the schoolmen give very imperfect notions of definition some define it to be the first notion or conception that arises of a thing whereby it is distinguished from every other and from which all the other things that we conceive of it are deduced but the usual definition of it is oration explicans quid res est a discourse explaining what a thing is that is as some further explain it a discourse setting forth those attributes which circumscribe and determine the nature of a thing for to explain is to propose the parts separately and expressly which were before proposed conjunctly and implicitly so that every explication has regard to some whole hence according to the diverse kinds of parts in any thing viz physical parts metaphysical parts etc arise so many different kinds of definitions of the same thing thus man is either defined an animal consisting of soul and body or a reasonable animal etc deists a sect or class of people known under the denomination of freethinkers whose distinguishing character it is not to profess any particular form or system of religion but only to acknowledge the existence of a god without rendering him any external worship or service the deists hold that considering the multiplicity of religions the numerous pretenses to revelation and the precarious arguments generally advanced in proof thereof the best and surest way is to return to the simplicity of nature and the belief of one god which is the only truth agreed to by all nations they complain that the freedom of thinking and reasoning is oppressed under the yoke of religion and that the minds of men are ridden and tyrannized by the necessity imposed on them of believing inconceivable mysteries and contend that nothing should be required to be assented to or believed but what their reason clearly conceives the appellation deist is more particularly given to such as are not altogether without religion but reject all revelation as an imposition and believe no more than what natural light discovers to them as that there is a god a providence a future state with rewards and punishments for the good and the bad that god must be honored and his will so far as we can learn it performed but that each person is to do this after his own manner and as his own conscience suggests the number of deists is said to be daily increasing in england a great part of the men of speculation and letters are pretended to incline that way and the like is observed in some of our neighbor nations where freedom of speaking writing and thinking are indulged  dr clarke gives us a succinct character of several sorts of deists viz the first sort are those who profess to believe the existence of an eternal infinite independent and intelligent being and that this supreme being made the world but they fancy that god does not at all concern himself in the government of the world nor has any regard to or concern about what is done therein nor is the doctrine of some philosophers much different who ascribe every thing to matter and motion and speak of god as an intelligentia supramundana which is the very language of epicurus and lucretius  a second sort of deists profess to believe not only the being but also the providence of god that is that every natural thing that is done in the world is produced by the power appointed by the wisdom and directed by the government of god though not allowing any difference between moral good and evil they suppose that god takes no notice of the morally good or evil actions of men these things depending as they imagine merely on the arbitrary constitution of human laws  another sort of deists there are who have right apprehensions concerning the natural attributes of god and his allgoverning providence and seem also to have some notion of his moral perfections also they believe him to be a being infinitely knowing powerful and wise and in some sense a being of justice as of goodness and truth that he governs the world by these perfections and expects suitable obedience from all his rational creatures but they are prejudiced against the immortality of human souls and insist that men perish at death entirely and that one generation shall perpetually succeed another and that there will be no future restoration or renovation of things  a fourth sort there are who profess to believe the being and attributes of god the obligations of natural religion and that there will be a future state of rewards and punishments but all this so far only as it is discoverable by the light of nature alone without believing any divine revelation these he concludes are the only true deists but there is now no consistent scheme of deism in the world the heathen philosophers those few of them who taught and lived up to the obligations of natural religion had indeed a consistent scheme of deism so far as it went socrates and tully appear to be wise and steady in their principles and conduct and they were thence led to hope for a revelation and we wish the same spirit prevailed in our modern deists then we might readily conclude they would embrace and not ridicule christianity  to this i shall subjoin what i have farther received from an honest and consistent deist himself  a deist or theist is one that believes a god who rejects revelation and follows his reason only this general definition i imagine will be granted by all the deists or theists in the world some of them who believe man to be a free agent have not much better or different notions of god than other people believing him to be a perfect rational and moral being somewhere distinct from the universe once from all eternity existing by himself before any thing was created but that his wisdom power and goodness is infinitely extended according as he wills to display it some of them believe free will and others not which is the most material difference between them and this difference arises from some mens making more strict natural inquiries than others the one think the doctrine of necessity of dangerous consequence the other believing things are as they are appointed or must be conceive this doctrine can no more alter the conduct of men than the nature of things which are unalterable and eternal being governed and directed by the wisdom of god his spirit being in all operates in all that in him all creatures live and have their being for he is their life exists in them and they in him and is to the universe what the soul is to the body and all the appearances of things to us are the clothing of deity for we see not things as they are in themselves but as they are to us and so we judge of them therefore we judge for ourselves not for god we cannot judge of them as he judges that of all things generated which appear and disappear it may be said as the author of the epistle to the hebrews says they all wax old as does a garment and as a vesture god folds them up but he is the same and his years do not change neither had the ungenerated parts of the universe a beginning nor will ever end there is no beginning nor end to time motion and the existence of things and as god unites the whole there is no vacuum in nature no place void of life and existence that vegetable animal and rational life are but different degrees of the same life different powers communicated from or different manifestations of god who makes and unmakes builds and destroys according to his will which is the same as his wisdom and power for these in him are one  those who maintain necessity have as much regard to moral virtue as others but not to any kind of worship therefore are more of the philosophic than of the religious class like the epicureans they think honorably of god respecting the greatness wonderfulness and dignity of his nature but unlike them they ascribe nothing to chance they conceive that the divine unchangeable nature it not wrought upon by the prayers of men nor regards their praises that the whole of our duty whether you allow it to be religion or not is acting in the best manner we can toward one another as mens different wants are and our different abilities are to assist them that god is not indebted to man for any of his good deeds though men are to one another for no man has any good quality from whence any good deed proceeds that is not the gift of god that god makes each of us what we are and virtue carries its own reward with it as the ancient philosophers maintained the like does wisdom so has god ordered the affairs of this world for if he does not things that are right in this world how do we know he will do right in any other who we have reason to believe is in all worlds the same and governs all by universal mathematical mechanic and unchangeable laws  in the select pieces of m de voltaire i find one on theism p     where he says that theism is a religion diffused through all other religions it is a metal that mixes with all others and whose veins extend under the earth to the four corners of the world this ore is most uncovered and most wrought in china every where else it is concealed and the secret is in the hands of none but the adepts there is no country in which there are more of these adepts than in england  many have asked if theism separately considered and without any other religious ceremony is in reality a religion the answer is easy he who acknowledges a god only as a creator he who considers god only as an infinitely powerful being and who sees nothing in his creatures but admirable machines is no more religious with respect to him than an european who admires the king of china is on that account the subject of that prince  but he who thinks that god has condescended to put a connection between himself and mankind that he has made them free capable of good and evil and that he has given to all a moral sense which is the instinct in man and on which is founded the law of nature he without doubt has a religion and a religion much better than all the sects out of our church for all these sects are false and the law of nature is true for a revealed religion can only be this law of nature perfected thus theism is good sense not yet enlightened by revelation and other religions good sense perverted by superstition  all sects are different because they come from men morality is every where the same because it comes from god  it may be asked that since there are five or six hundred sects of which scarcely any are free from the guilt of spilling human blood from whence does it happen that the theists who are every where so numerous have never caused the least tumult it is because these are philosophers now philosophers may reason falsely but they can never engage in intrigues therefore those who persecute a philosopher under pretense that his opinions may be dangerous to the public are guilty of as great an absurdity as a person who should be afraid lest the study of algebra should raise the price of bread we ought therefore to pity a reasonable being who is in an error but the persecutor is a fool and an object of horror we are all brethren if any of my brothers full of respect and filial piety and animated by the most ardent fraternal love does not salute our common father with the same ceremonies as i ought i to cut his throat and tear out his heart  deprecatory or deprecative in theology a term applied to the manner of performing some ceremonies in the form of prayer among the greeks the form of absolution is deprecatory being conceived in these terms may god absolve me whereas in the latin and even some of the reformed churches it is in the declarative form i absolve you description an imperfect or inaccurate definition of a thing giving a sort of knowledge thereof from some accidents and circumstances peculiar to it which determine it enough to give an idea that may distinguish it from other things but without explaining its nature or essence grammarians content themselves with descriptions philosophers require definitions of things a description is an enumeration of diverse attributes of a thing most of which are only accidental as when a person is described by his deeds his sayings his writings his honors etc a description as to its outward appearance resembles a definition and is even convertible with the thing described but does not explain it for instead of bringing several things essential to the thing described it only brings a number of accidents belonging thereto e g peter is the tall young man who lives on the green wears black clothes frequents the college courts n  etc where it is evident we do not give any explication of peter as not bringing things that are in peter but only circumstances or things about him tall young living wearing frequenting courting etc a description therefore is no proper answer to the question quid est what is he but to that quis est who is he descriptions in effect are principally used for singulars or individuals for things of the same species do not differ in essence but only as to hic and ille which difference contains nothing very notable or distinguishable but individuals of the same kind differ much in accidents e g george is a king and william a citizen charles is a male and anne a female henry is wife and john a blockhead etc thus a description is an accumulation of accidents whereby things are notably distinguished from each other though they scarce differ at all in essence divocanonical an appellation given to certain books of the holy scripture which were added to the canon after the rest either by reason they were not wrote till after the compilation of the canon or by reason of some dispute as to their canonicity the books so called in the modern canon are the book of esther the pistle to the hebrews that of james that of jude the second of st peter the second and third of st john and the revelation the deuterocanonical parts of books are the hymn of the three children the prayer of azariah the history of susanna of bell and the dragon the last chapter of st mark the bloody sweat and the appearance of the angel in st luke chap xxii and the history of the adulterous woman in st john chap viii deuteronomy the last of mosess five books the greeks gave it the name of deuteronomy or the second law or the repetition of the law because moses therein makes a kind of recapitulation of what he had ordained or done in the preceding books the hebrews call it ellehaddebarim which are the first words of this book in the hebrew text some rabbis call it mishnah that is to say the second law others the book of reprehensions by reason of the reproaches wherewith moses reproached the israelites diaconicon sacristy a place adjoining to the ancient churches where the sacred vestments with the vessels and other ornaments of the altar were preserved diet an assembly of the states of germany i shall only take notice in this place of the more remarkable of those which have been held on the affairs of religion    the diet of augsburg in the year    0 was assembled to reunite the princes of the empire in relation to some religious matters the emperor himself presided in this assembly with the greatest magnificence imaginable the elector of saxony followed by several princes presented the confession of says called the confession of augsburg the emperor ended the diet with a decree that no alteration should be made in the doctrine and ceremonies of the romish church till a council should order it otherwise    the diet of augsburg in      was held on account of the electors being divided concerning the decisions of the council of trent the emperor demanded that the management of that affair should be referred to him and it was resolved that every one should conform to the decisions of the council    the diet of augsburg in      was assembled to examine some memorials relating to the confession of faith but the commissioners not agreeing together the emperor named three divines who drew the design of that famous interim so well known in germany and elsewhere    the diet of augsburg in    0 in this assembly the emperor complained that the interim was not observed and demanded that all should submit to the council which they were going to renew at trent which submission was resolsed upon by a plurality of votes    the diet of nuremberg in      here pope adrian vis nuncio demanded the execution of leo xs bull and charles vs edict against luther but the assembly drew up a list of grievances which were reduced to an hundred articles some whereof aim at the destruction of the popes authority and the discipline of the romish church however they consented that the lutherans should be commanded not to write against the roman catholics    the diet of nuremberg in      in this assembly the lutherans having the advantage it was decreed that the pope should call a council in germany but that in the mean time an assembly should be held at spire to determine what was to be believed and practiced but charles v prohibited the holding this assembly    the diet of ratisbon in      was held for reuniting the protestants with the roman catholics the emperor named three roman catholics and three protestant divines to agree upon articles the roman catholics were julius phlug john gropper and john eckius and the protestants were philip melanchton martin bucer and john pistorius but after a whole months consultation they could agree upon no more than five or six articles which the emperor consented the protestants should retain forbidding them to solicit any body to change the ancient religion    the diet of ratisbon in      decreed that the council of trent was to be followed which was opposed by the protestant deputies and this caused a war against them    the diet of ratisbon in      demanded a conference between some famous doctors of both parties which conference was held at worms in september between twelve roman catholics and twelve lutheran divines but was soon dissolved by the lutherant being divided among themselves   0 the diet of spire in      in this assembly wherein presided the archduke ferdinand the duke of saxony and the landgrave of hesse demanded the free exercise of the lutheran religion upon which it was decreed that the emperor should be desired to call a general or national council in germany within a year and that in the mean time every one should have liberty of conscience     the diet of spire in      decreed that in the countries which had embraced the new religion it should be lawful to continue in it till the next council but that no roman catholic should be allowed to turn lutheran against this decree six lutheran princes viz the elector of saxony the marquis of brandenburg the two dukes of lunenburg the landgrave of hesse and the prince of anhalt with the deputies of fourteen imperial towns pretested in writing from which solemn protestation came the famous name of protestants which the lutherans presently after took     the

nullity letters dimissory cannot be given by the chapter sede vacant dimoeritae a name given to the apolinarists who first held that the word only assumed a human body without taking a reasonable soul like ours but being at length convinced by fomal texts of scripture they allowed that he did assume a soul but without understanding the word supplying the want of that faculty directory a kind of regulation for the performance of religious worship drawn up by the assembly of divines in england at the instance of the parliament in the year      it was designed to supply the place of the liturgy or book of common prayer the use of which they had abolished it consisted of some general heads which were to be managed and filled up at discretion for it prescribed no form of prayer or circumstances of external worship nor obliged the people to any responses excepting amen  to give a short abstract of the directory it forbids all salutations and civil ceremony in the churches the reading the scriptures in the congregation is declared to be part of the pastoral office all the canonical books of the old and new testament but not of the apocrypha are to be publicly read in the vulgar tongue how large a portion is to be read at once is left to the minister who has likewise the liberty of expounding when he judges it necessary it prescribes heads for the prayer before sermon among which part of the prayer for the king is to save him from evil council it delivers rules for managing the sermon the introduction to the text must be short and clear drawn from the words or context or some parallel place of scripture in dividing the text the minister is to regard the order of the matter more than that of the words he is not to burden the memory of his audience with too many divisions nor perplex their understandings with logical phrases and terms of art he is not to start unnecessary objections and he is to be very sparing in citations from ecclesiastical or other human writers ancient or modern the directory recommends the use of the lords prayer as the most perfect model of devotion it forbids private or lay persons to administer baptism and enjoins it to be performed in the face of the congregation it orders the communion table at the lords supper to be so placed that the communicants may sit about it the dead according to the rules of the directory are to be buried without any prayers or religious ceremony discipline ecclesiastical the christian church being a spiritual community or society of persons professing the religion of jesus and as such governed by spiritual or ecclesiastical laws her discipline consists in putting those laws in execution and inflicting the penalties enjoined by them against several sorts of offenders to understand the true nature of church discipline we must consider how it stood in the ancient christian church and first the primitive church never pretended to exercise discipline upon any but such as were within her pale in the largest sense by some act of their own profession and even upon these she never pretended to exercise her discipline so far as to cancel or disannul their baptism but the discipline of the church consisted in a power to deprive men of the benefits of external communion such as public prayer receiving the eucharist and other acts of divine worship this power before the establishment of the church by human laws was a mere spiritual authority or as st cyprian terms it a spiritual sword affecting the soul and not the body sometimes indeed the church craved assistance from the secular power even when it was heathen but more frequently after it became christian but it is to be observed that the church never encouraged the magistrate to proceed against any one for mere error or ecclesiastical misdemeanor farther than to punish the delinquent by a pecuniary mulct or bodily punishment such as a confiscation or banishment and st austin affirms that no good men in the catholic church were pleased that heretics should be prosecuted unto death lesser punishments they thought might have their use as a means sometimes to bring them to consideration and repentance nor was it a part of the ancient discipline to deprive men of their natural or civil rights a master did not lose his authority over his family a parent over his children nor a magistrate his office or charge in the state by being cast out of the church but the discipline of the church being a mere spiritual power was confined to   admonition of the offender   the lesser and greater excommunication  as to the object of ecclesiastical discipline they were all such delinquents as fell into great and scandalous crimes after baptism whether men or women priests or people rich or poor princes or subjects that princes and magistrates fell under the churchs censures may be proved by several instances particularly st chrysostom relates that babylas denied communion to one of the roman emperors on account of a barbarous murder committed by him st ambrose likewise denied communion to maximus for shedding the blood of gratian and the same holy bishop absolutely refused to admit the emperor theodosius the great into his church notwithstanding his humblest entreaties because he had inhumanly put to death seven thousand men at thessalonica without distinguishing the innocent from the guilty disciples of christ those who learned the doctrine of christ and took him for their teacher and master a believer a christian a scholar a follower of jesus christ or his apostles acts vi   acts ix  0 the name disciple is often set down for that of apostle but in other places they are distinguished from disciples as they were particularly chosen by jesus christ out of the number of his disciples and were appointed more immediately the propagators of his religion dissenters separatists from the church of england and the service and worship thereof at the revolution a law was enacted that the statutes made in the reign of queen elizabeth and king james i concerning the discipline of the church should not extend to protestant dissenters but persons dissenting are to subscribe the declaration of the  0th of charles ii cap i and take the oaths or the declaration of fidelity etc besides this they are not to bold their meetings till their place of worship is certified to the bishop or to the justices of the quarter sessions and registered also they are not to keep the doors of their meeting houses locked during the time of worship and to secure to them the free exercise of their religion whoever disturbs or molests them in the performance of divine worship on conviction at the sessions is to forfeit  0 l by statute  st of king william and queen mary deminicans an order of religious called in some places jacobins predicants or preaching friars they take this name from their founder dominic de guzman born in    0 at calarvega in old castile the order was approved of in      by innocent iii and confirmed in      by a bull of honorius iii under the rule of st augustine and the title of preaching friars this order is diffused throughout the whole known world it has fortyfive provinces under the general who resides at rome and twelve particular congregations or reforms governed by vicarsgeneral they reckon three popes of this order above sixty cardinals several patriarchs one hundred and fifty archbishops about eight hundred bishops etc etc there are also nuns of this order called preaching sisters donatists ancient schismatics in africa so named from their leader donetus they arose in the year     their errors were that baptism out of their sect was null that there was no church but in africa all the rest of the churches they held as prostitute and fallen they were also accused of arianism they afterward split into many parties amongst themselves donative in the ecclesiastical sense of the word is a benefice given by the patron to the priest without presentation of the ordinary and without institution and induction as to the origin of donatives it was one of these two ways first by royal license thus sir edward coke says the king may not only found a church or free chapel donative but may license any subject to do the same secondly donatives may be grounded upon peculiar privilege as when a lord of a manor in a great parish at a remote distance from his parish church offers to build and endow a church there provided it shall entirely belong to him and his family to put in what incumbent they shall think fit the bishops to encourage such a work may have permitted them to enjoy this liberty which being continued time out of mind is turned into a prescription dort synod of consisted of the states general of the united provinces deputies from the protestant states of germany from the remonstrants and contraremonstrants deputies from england etc for settling the constitution and government of the protestant churches and for determining such points of says as should be deemed essential to constitute a person a true protestant etc this synod commenced the   th of november      and continued their deliberations one hundred and eighty sessions ending the   th of may      this synod favored the doctrine of predestination and some decrees passed against the remonstrants for denying it which with other transactions of this synod perhaps no less arbitrary and severe are related by brandt in his history of the reformation vol iii p      0 doxology an appellation given by the greeks to the   th verse of the second chapter of st luke glory be to god in the highest etc because beginning with the greek word  glory this they distinguish by the name of great doxology and the gloria patri glory be to the father they call the less doxology as beginning with the same word e easter a festival of the christian church observed in memory of our saviors resurrection the latins and others call it pascha an hebrew word which signifies passage and it is applied to the jewish feast of the passover to which the christian festival of easter corresponds this festival is called in english easter from the saxon eastre an ancient goddess of that people worshipped with peculiar ceremonies in the month of april concerning the celebration of this festival there were anciently very great disputes in the church though all agreed in the observation of it in general yet they differed very much as to the particular time when it was to be observed some keeping it precisely on the same stated day every year others on the fourteenth day of the first moon in the new year whatever day of the week it happened on and others on the first sunday after the first full moon this diversity occasioned a great dispute in the  d century between the asiatic churches and the rest of the world in the course of which pope victor excommunicated all those churches but the council of nice in the year     decreed that all churches should keep the pascha or festival of easter on one and the same day which is always on a sunday this decree was afterward confirmed by the council of antioch in the year     yet this did not put an end to all disputes concerning the observation of this festival for it was not easy to determine on what sunday it was to be held because being a moveable feast it sometimes happened that the churches of one country kept it a week or a month sooner than other churches by reason of their different calculations therefore the council of nice is said to have decreed farther that the bishops of alexandria should adjust a proper cycle and inform the rest of the world on what sunday every year easter was to be observed notwithstanding which the roman and alexandrian accounts continued to differ and sometimes varied a week or a month from each other and no effectual cure was found for this till in the year     dionysius exiguus brought the alexandrian canon or cycle entirely into use in the roman church mean time the churches of france and britain kept to the old roman canon and it was two or three ages after before the new roman that is the alexandrian canon not without some struggle and difficulty was settled among them ebionites christian heretics in the first century so called from their leader ebion the ebionites as well as the nazarenes had their origin from the circumcised christians who had retired from jerusalem to pella during the war between the jews and romans and made their first appearance after the destruction of jerusalem about the time of domitian or a little before ebion the author of the heresy of the ebionites was a disciple of cerinthus and his successor he improved upon the errors of his master and added to them new opinions of his own he began his preaching in judea he taught in asia and even at rome his tenets infected the isle of cyprus st john opposed both cerinthus and ebion in asia and it is thought that this apostle wrote his gospel in the year    particularly against this heresy the ebionites held the same errors as the nazarenes they united the ceremonies of the law with the precepts of the gospel they observed both the jewish sabbath and the christian sunday they called their place of assembling a synagogue and not a church they bathed every day which was the custom of the jews in celebrating the eucharist they made use of unleavened bread but no wine they added to the observance of the law diverse superstitions they adored jerusalem as the house of god like the samaritans they would not suffer a person of another religion to touch them they abstained from the flesh of animals and even from milk and lest any one should object to them that passage of the gospel where jesus says he desires to eat of the passover they corrupted it when they were sick or bitten by a serpent they plunged themselves into water and invoked all sorts of things to their assistance they disagreed among themselves in relation to christ some of them said he was born like other men of joseph and mary and acquired sanctification only by his good works others of them allowed that he was born of a virgin but denied that he was the word of god or had a preexistence before his human generation they said he was indeed the only true prophet but yet a mere man who by his virtue had arrived at being called christ and the son of god they supposed that christ and the devil were two principles which god had opposed the one to the other though the ebionites observed the law yet they differed from the jews in many points they acknowledged the sanctity of abraham isaac jacob moses aaron and joshua but they laughed at all those who came after them they rejected some parts of the pentateuch and when they were too closely pressed by this book they entirely abandoned it of the new testament they acknowledge only the gospel of st matthew that is that which was written in hebrew and which they called the gospel according to the hebrews but they took from it the two first chapters and corrupted other passages of it they absolutely rejected st paul as an apostate and an enemy of the law and published several calumnies against him they had likewise false acts of the apostles in which they mixed a great many fables as to their manner of life they imitated the carpocratians the most infamous of all heretics they rejected virginity and continence they obliged children to marry very young they allowed married persons to separate from each other and marry again as often as they pleased st justin st irenaeus and origin wrote against the ebionites symmachus author of one of the greek versions of the scriptures was an ebionite ecclesiastes the hebrew title of this book is coheleth which is a feminine word the literal signification of which is she who speaks in public or she who convenes the assembly but the greeks and latins without having any regard to the gender have called it ecclesiastes that is to say an orator one who speaks in public solomon who is the author of this book describes himself in the very first verse in these words the words of coheleth the son of david king of jerusalem he speaks of his works his riches and his buildings and in particular of his proverbs or parables eicetae heretics of the  th century who made profession of the monastic life their devotion consisted in music and dancing eithesis a name which the emperor heraclius gave to a confession of faith published by him in     it favored the error of the monothelites and established one will alone in jesus christ elcesaites ancient heretics so denominated from their prophet elcesai his fundamental doctrines were that jesus christ who was born from the beginning of the world had appeared from time to time under diverse bodies etc elders among the jews were persons the most considerable for age experience and wisdom of this sort were the seventy men whom moses associated to himself in the government of his people such likewise afterward were those who held the first rank in the synagogue the president or head of which was styled elder by way of eminence in the first assemblies of the primitive christians those who held the first place or rank had likewise the denomination of elders the word presbyter which occurs so often in the new testament is of the same signification hence the first councils of christians were called presbyteria or councils of elders elders is a denomination still preserved in the presbyterian discipline they are officers who in conjunction with the pastors or ministers or deacons compose the consistories or sessions of the kirk in scotland the number of elders is indefinite being generally twelve in each parish emberweeks or days in the christian church they are certain seasons of the year set apart for the imploring gods blessing by prayer and fasting upon the ordinations performed in the church at such times and this in conformity to the practice of the apostles who when they separated persons for the work of the ministry prayed and fasted before they laid their hands on them these ordinationfasts are observed four times in the year viz the wednesday friday and saturday after the first sunday in lent after whitsunday after the   th of september and after the   th of december it being injoined by a canon of the church that deacons and ministers be ordained or made only upon the sundays immediately following these emberfasts some derive the term ember from a german word which signifies abstinence others from one which signifies ashes because it was customary with the ancients to accompany their fastings with sprinkling of ashes or sitting upon them dr marshall derives t from a saxon word which signifies course or circuit so that these fasts being not occasional but returning every year in certain courses may properly be said to be emberdays because fasts in course the emberweeks were formerly observed in different churches with some variety but were at last settled as they are now observed by the council of placentia a d  0   st auoustin who lived in the fifth century speaks of the emberfaits but mentions them only as observed in the diocese of rome from whence we may conclude that the observation of them was not at that time general in the church the council of mentz convened by charlemagne in     mentions the ember weeks as a new establishment introduced in france in conformity to the roman church encoenia the dedication of christian churches see dedication encratites christian heretics followers of tatian the assyrian who founded this sect in the reign of marcus aurelius a d    he established the first school of the encratites in mesopotamia from whence they spread to antioch and into cilicia psiola and other provinces of asia minor and even as far as rome and into gaul aquitaine and spain they were called encrati or continentes because they gloried in abstaining from marriage the use of wine and animals they acknowledged a power  the devil independent of god they made great use of the  of st andrew st john and st thomas and other apocryphal pieces such as the gospel of the egyptians their chastity however was a little suspected because they used ll sorts of means to draw women into their sect and were always seen in company with them energici a name given to a religious sect of the sixteenth century because they held the eucharist was the energy and virtue of jesus christ not his body nor a representation thereof enomaeans or eunomians a sect who held that article which had been the capital topic of all arians namely the fathers being selfexistent or unoriginate which was urged to destroy all similitude of substance between him and the son who was begotten or derived from the father enthusiasm this is the name whereby that poetical fury is distinguished which transports the mind inflames the imagination and causes it to utter things surprising and sublime virgil describes very finely the enthusiasm of apollos priestess whom aeneas consulted before he made his journey to hell virg aen vi  of enthusiasts particularly in religion such high pretenders having given up themselves to their own fancy and imagination without any fixed principles that can bind them and being accustomed to feel some very warm emotions in their minds which are always apprehended to come immediately from heaven and which they always regard as symbols of the divine presence endearing tokens of his peculiar love and favor toward them they cannot but entertain an extravagant conceit of their own worth and excellency as if they were the beloved the peculiar people to whom he has revealed himself in so extraordinary a manner and thus viewing themselves in high favor with the deity from which they believe the rest of mankind are excluded hence those visionaries have their minds always turned in their gloomy manner to contemplate god and heavenly things and particularly the high station to which they vainly think they are exalted in the divine grace and favor and with this sullen frame of devotion which is continually hanging about them do they spiritualise and sanctify all things whatsoever even the greatest absurdities and the blackest villainies according as they happen to suit their particular temper and circumstances for those conceited beings are so far from submitting themselves to the government of reason that they look upon this dim light as they are pleased to call it and all its fixed principles and every stated rule whatsoever especially such as are of human authority to be fit only for common servile souls and much below the notice of those who have immediate access to the fountain of all light and who distinctly perceives all the measures of their behavior in supernatural revelations and when they have a strong inclination to indulge they do not consult and hearken to the dictates of reason they go to god with it and lay the matter before the lord as they are used to speak in their familiar manner to implore his light and direction and loudly call for an answer now in their opinion a favorable answer to prayer consists in divine joys and raptures that seize upon the soul and make it sensible of the immediate presence and countenance of god so that till they find something of this nature springing up within them and warming and agitating their breast they fancy to have received no return from heaven and therefore they do still insist and with great importunity do they labor till they wrestle themselves into those mechanical heats and emotions which they take for a gracious answer to their prayers this may be farther described by an extract from a little diary annexed to some letters published in      said to be wrote by mrs le fevre and by some thought scarcely to be paralleled for piety  tuesday the latter end of october      it was given me to say jehovah is my lord and my god     saturday september        after spiritual desertion and wandering some days in the wilderness the love of god returned to my soul and i again rejoiced in christ as my savior glory be to god for his free and boundless mercy to the vilest of sinners to the most unworthy and ungrateful of all human beings and oh lord life and light of my soul leave me not again i humbly beseech thee let every outward comfort be withdrawn and every outward torment be inflicted and i will rejoice so thou leave me not my helpless soul hangs upon thee my jesus and well thou know what i have suffered in thy absence how my parched soul has fainted for thy refreshing streams how it has stretched itself out after thee and even agonised to find thee and then miserably sunk and been overwhelmed under the mountain of fin but now thou art returned the sun of righteousness has rose with healing in his wings and the mountains have flowed down at thy presence where are my sins washed away in the blood of the lamb where is my unbelief suddenly vanished i have no doubt now jesus is mine and god the father is now my reconciled father through him and god the holy ghost is my comforter and guide oh unspeakable transport unbounded happiness let this paper bear witness for one of the free mercies of my god     oh sweetest and most compassionate jesus how do thy tender mercies follow and support my soul and still i am ungrateful and still i am not as thou would have me to be oh when will thou make a full end of sin and bring in thy perfect righteousness all things are possible to thee and do i not know do i not taste that thou art gracious oh my sun my shield life of my life look into my heart i dare appeal to thine allsearching eye that there is nothing so dear to it but i would this moment part with it for thee and why then dearest lord will thou not form thy whole blessed image in my soul my unworthiness i know is greater than that of any other creature in the universe but this unworthiness will the more magnify thy mercy i have only my unworthiness to plead and i have no hope but in thine atoning blood oh let this blood which has bought my peace cleanse me also from every sin and let that blessed spirit who has sealed and witnessed this peace to my soul cleanse me from every sin and so purify me even as  oh glorious prospect heartenlivening hopes let me sink into the dust before thee god of glory god of purity i am lost in selfabasement but have thou not promised and will thou not fulfill thine own gracious word oh give me then perfect sanctification of body soul and spirit  and let every bitter cup which thou permittest to be given me be joyfully received as serving in some degree to conform me to thy suffering and let me in all things though ever so contrary to my corrupt nature give thanks and say continually lord not my will but thine be done amen  the authoress likewise gives us a specimen of this peculiar turn of mind in the following lines o love how charming is thy ray all pain before thy presence flies care anguish sorrow melt away wherever thy healing streams arise o jesu nothing may i see nothing hear feel or think but thee   enthusiasts then in the religious sense of the word are those who pretend to extraordinary revelations and impulses from heaven immediate revelation being a more easy way for men to establish their opinions and regulate their conduct than the tedious and not always successful labor of reasoning it is no wonder that some have been very apt to pretend to revelation and to persuade themselves that they are under the peculiar guidance of heaven in their actions and opinions especially in those of them which they cannot account for by the ordinary methods of knowledge and principles of reason hence we see that in all ages men in whom melancholy has mixed with devotion or whose conceit of themselves has raised them into an opinion of a great familiarity with god and a nearer admittance to his favor than is afforded to others have often flattered themselves with a persuasion of an immediate intercourse with the deity and frequent communications from the divine spirit their minds being thus prepared whatever groundless opinion comes to settle itself strongly upon then fancies is an illumination from the spirit of god and presently of divine authority and whatsoever odd action they find in themselves a strong inclination to do that impulse is concluded to be a call or direction from heaven and must be obeyed it is a commission from above and they cannot err in executing it this i take to be properly enthusiasm  epicureans philosophers who placed their supreme happiness in pleasure not in voluptuousness and in irregular ignominious pleasures but in sensible pleasures under proper regulations and government they denied providence and the immortality of the soul cicero intimates the practice of this sect to be generally better than their principles epiphany a christian festival otherwise called the manifestation of christ to the gentiles it is observed on the  th of january  the gentiles to whom our savior on this day manifested himself were the magi or as we render the word wise men whose visit and presents to the infant jesus are recorded by st matthew there are several questions in relation to this whole transaction as first what that star was which is said to have directed the wise men in their journey that it was not in reality a star is certain because it went before them and stood over where the young child was which could not be true of any one of the heavenly bodies it must therefore be a luminous appearance or seeming star in the lower region of the air observed by the wise men to differ from the ordinary stars of heaven which as a new and prodigious sight seemed to them to presage something of great moment and consideration some authors have suggested that this seeming star which appeared to the wise men in the east might be that glorious light which shone upon the shepherds of bethlehem when the angels came to impart to them the tidings of our saviors birth and which at a distance might appear like a star another question is how the wise men could guess at the birth of our savior from the appearance of this star the most probable answer is that they did not collect the birth of jesus christ from this uncommon appearance which only served as their guide in finding him out but were determined to their journey by the general expectation the eastern world was then in of an universal monarch the feast of epiphany was not originally a distinct festival but made a part of that of the nativity of christ which being celebrated twelve days the first and last of which according to the custom of the jews in their feasts were high or chief days of this solemnity either of these might be fitly called epiphany as that word signifies the appearance of christ in the world equanimity is an even uniform temper of mind amidst all the varieties and revolutions of time and chance is the result of magnanimity and the proof and evidence of it erastians a religious sect or faction which arose in england during the time of the civil wars so called from thomas erastus their leader whose distinguishing doctrine was that the church had no right to discipline i e no regular power to excommunicate exclude censure absolve decree or the like essenes or essenians so ancient that we are not acquainted with their original pliny says they had been some thousand years in being without marriage and without any conversation with persons of the other sex and that they had been for some time established into a society before hircanus was high priest of the jews and before christ  0  they were the most virtuous sect of the jews eternity an attribute of god by eternity we mean infinite duration or existence without beginning and without end the selfexistent being says the learned dr clarke must of necessity be eternal the ideas of eternity and selfexistence are so closely connected that because something of necessity must be eternal independently and without any outward cause of its being therefore it must necessarily be selfexistent and because it is impossible but something must be selfexistent therefore it is necessary that it must likewise be eternal to be selfexistent is to exist by an absolute necessity in the nature of the thing itself now this necessity being absolute and not depending upon any thing eternal must be always unalterably the same nothing being alterable but what is capable of being affected by somewhat without itself that being therefore which has no other cause of its existence but the absolute necessity of its own nature must of necessity have existed from everlasting without end  as to the manner of this eternal existence it is manifest it herein infinitely transcends the manner of the existence of all created beings even of such as shall exist for ever that whereas it is not possible for their finite minds to comprehend all that is past or to understand perfectly all the things that are present much less to know all that is future or to have entirely in their power any thing that is to come but their thoughts knowledge and power must of necessity have degrees and periods and be successive and transient as the things themselves the eternal supreme cause on the contrary must of necessity have such a perfect independent unchangeable comprehension of all things that there can be no one point or instant of his eternal duration wherein all things that are past present and to come will not be as entirely known and represented to him in one single thought or view and all things present and future be equally and entirely in his power and direction as if there was no succession at all but all things were actually present at once evangelist this word signifies one who publishes good news they therefore who write as well as they who preach the gospel of jesus christ are called evangelists and in general all they who declare any happy tidings in isaiah the lord says that he will give to jerusalem one that brings good tidings or an evangelist in the acts of the apostles philip one of the deacons is called an evangelist they were generally ranked below the apostles and prophers though their office and duty was honorable and sacred in the beginning of christianity there were evangelists and preachers who without being fixed to any church went and preached wherever they might be most useful lastly we commonly call matthew mark luke and john evangelists lists who are the authors of the four gospels which only are acknowledged by the church to be canonical euchitae a sect of ancient heretics so called because they prayed without ceasing imagining that prayer alone was sufficient to save them eudoxians a sect of christians in the  th century they were arians who put themselves under the direction of eudoxus bishop of constantinople this heresiarch had been educated by lucian the martyr as he was of a subtle and penetrating genius he thought to raise his reputation by undertaking the support of arianism the success answered his hopes he was chosen by the arians bishop of germanicia in syria he opposed the divinity of the word in the council of antioch in     and afterward in the arian councils of sardica sirium and seleucia he became the patriarch of constantinople by the favor of the emperor constantius he engaged the emperor valens by an oath to support the cause of arianism after the death of arius he became head of the arian party who from him took the name eudoxians eulogiae so the greek church calls the panis benedictus or bread over which a blessing is pronounced and which is distinguished to those who are unqualified to communicate the name eulogiae was likewise anciently given to the consecrated pieces of bread which the bishops and priests sent to each other for the keeping up a friendly correspondence those presents likewise which were made out of respect or obligation were called eulogiae eunomioeupsychians a sect of heretics of the  th century being the same with those called eutychians eustathians a name given to the catholics of antioch in the  th century on occasion of their refusing to acknowledge any other bishop besides st eustathius who was deposed by the arians also a sect in the  th century called so from their leader eustathius a monk who excluded all married people from salvation prohibited praying in houses and obliged them to quit all they had as incompatible with the hopes of salvation eutychians a sect of christians disciples of eutyches a monk and abbot of constantinople in the  th century eutyches animated by a false zeal against the errors of nestorius fell into the opposite impiety and maintained that there was but one nature in jesus christ because there was but one person he pretended that the divine nature by its superiority had so entirely swallowed up the human that the latter could not be distinguished in jesus christ insomuch that according to eutyches jesus christ was merely god that he had nothing of humanity but the appearance flavian patriarch of constantinople strongly opposed this doctrine and eutyches was condemned in a council held in     which sentence was confirmed by the general council of chalcedon in     eutyches resisted the council of constantinople and would not alter his expressions against the two natures in jesus christ because he would not he said condemn the holy fathers paticularly st cyril and st athanesius who had expressed themselves in the same manner the partisans of eutyches supported by the officers of theodosius the younger exercised great violences against the orthodox which gave occasion to the false council of ephesus leontius superior of the scythian monks revived the heresy of eutyches about the year  00 and maintained that we ought to say one of three persons in the trinity suffered on the cross exarch in the greek church is an officer under the patriarch who has the care and inspection of the patriarchal monasteries or such as depend immediately on the patriarch his business is to visit them to hear the complaints of inferiors against their superiors to impose penance and chastise those monks who neglect their duty and the obedience they owe their superiors when a superior of a patriarchal monastery is dead the exarch is to take care and send the person elected by the monks to succeed him to the patriarch for imposition of hands he is to take an exact account of all the monasteries depending on the patriarch of their revenues sacred vessels and ornaments for this purpose the exarch receives letters testimonial from the patriarch which he is obliged to produce and show to the monks that they may not doubt of his authority excommunication an ecclesiastical penalty whereby they who incur the guilt of any heinous sin are separated from the communion of the church and deprived of all spiritual advantages there are two or three sorts of excommunication the greater whereby the person offending is separated from the body of the faithful thus st paul excommunicated the incestuous christian   cor vi   the lesser whereby the sinner is forbidden to adminster or receive the sacraments and lastly that which deprives him only of the company of the faithful of which there is some mention made   cor iii   and by st austin theophilact says that even this separation was formerly esteemed a great punishment the primitive christians very rarely excommunicated and when they were it was for very important reasons with great seriousness and concern excommunication of emperors kings etc by the authority of the pope began in the  th century extreme unction one of the sacraments of the romish church the fifth in order administered to people dangerously sick by anointing them with holy oils and performing several prayers over them f faith is a theological virtue whereby we hold for certain that there is a god and are persuaded to believe those truths revealed in the scriptures this faith accompanied with the practice of good works is the life of a righteous man the just shall live by faith it may be considered either as proceeding from god who reveals his truths or man who yields his assent to them and in both these senses it is called faith shall the unbelief of the jews make the faith of god of none effect says st paul that is to say his sovereign and infallible truth faith is taken also for a firm confidence in god whereby we are induced to address ourselves to him for favors faith is sometimes taken for honesty fidelity in performing promises truth and in this sense it is applied both to god and man faith in general is the assent of the mind to the truth of any proposition fanatic a wild extravagant visionary enthusiastical person who pretends to revelation and inspiration and believes himself possessed of a divine spirit see enthusiasm farrellists a christian sect which sprung up in the   th century so called from their founder william farrel a native of dauphiny who about the year      taught at geneva the doctrines of the samaritans particularly the efficacy of the sacraments he persuaded his disciples that a man to save life and goods might deny or dissemble his faith before persecutors by this means he gained over a great number of followers who outwardly professed all sorts of religion but secretly followed only their own doctrine which consisted in believing alone without being obliged to practice any good works calvin whose influence in geneva was very great prevailed with the magistrates to banish farrel who retired to neufchatel where he exercised the office of a minister some years and died in      fasting this has in all ages and among all nations been an exercise much in use in time of mourning sorrow and affliction but we find no example of it or injunction for it before moses the jews at this time are very strict in the observance of them in their common fasts they begin the observance of them the preceding evening after sunset and fast till the same hour the next evening and on the great day of atonement they continue their fast twentyeight hours during this fast they not only abstain from all sorts of food but from bathings perfumes odours cordials etc they go barefoot are continent and make no use of marriage this is the idea which the eastern people have of fasting it is an abstinence from every sensual gratification as well as every kind of eating and drinking fasts days of religious abstinence such solemnities have been observed in all ages and nations especially in times of mourning and affliction we meet with no examples of fasting properly so called before moses who yet enjoins no other than the solemn day of expiation which was generally and strictly observed besides the solemn fast of expiation instituted by divine authority the jews appointed certain times of fasting and humiliation called the fasts of the congregation but besides the public fasts which the jews were obliged by their law to observe there were others of a private nature which the zealous and most pious among them prescribed to themselves the common way of fasting among the jews is to take no food nor any drink from the foregoing evening till sunset the day following they are allowed some particular herbs and butter but not eggs they must not be shaved or powdered or bathe themselves they esteem fasting as a supplement to the old sacrifices and place great merit in it the ancient christians had two sorts of solemn fasts the one weekly the other annual their weekly fasts called jejunia quartae and sextae feriae were observed on wednesdays and fridays because on wednesday our lord was betrayed by judas and on friday crucified by the jews these fasts lasted till the ninth hour that is till three oclock in the afternoon at which time they received the eucharist they called these fasts stations and the remains of them are yet observed in our church which by her   th canon has ordained that though wednesdays and fridays be not holy days yet that weekly upon those times the minister and people shall resort to church at the accustomed hour of prayer their annual fast was that of lent they had likewise their occasional fasts observed at extraordinary and unusual seasons according as the variety and necessity of their circumstances required such were times of great and imminent danger either to the church or state and times of public calamities as plague or persecution these occasional fasts were appointed by the bishops of every church as they thought fit they were called by way of eminence jejunia the greeks have four solemn fasts the first commences on the   th of november or forty days before christmas it is observed in commemoration of mosess fasting forty days on mount sinai the second falls in with our lent the third is called the fast of the holy apostles which they observe upon a supposition that the apostles prepared themselves by prayer and fasting for the promulgation of the gospel this fast commences the week after whitsuntide and continues till the festival of st peter and st paul their fourth fast commences the first of august and lasts until the   th the greeks are so superstitious and extravagant in the observation of their fasts that they will admit of no cases of necessity sufficient to justify a dispensation the patriarch himself cannot authorize any person to eat meat when the church has enjoined the contrary the romanists distinguish between fasting and abstinence and different days are appointed for each of them in that church on their days of fasting they are allowed but one meal in twentyfour hours but on days of abstinence provided they abstain from flesh and make but a moderate meal they are indulged in a collation at night the times of fasting appointed by that church are all lent except sundays the ember days the vigils of the more solemn feasts and all fridays except those that fall within the twelve days of christmas and between easter and the ascension their days of abstinence are all the sundays in lent st marks day if it does not fall in easter week the three rogation days all saturdays throughout the year with the fridays before excepted unless either happens to be christmas day the church of england though it appoints days of fasting and abstinence for it makes no distinction between them does not determine what food is proper for such seasons and there is a statute which declares that whosoever by preaching teaching writing etc affirms it to be necessary to abstain from flesh for the saving of the soul of man or for the service of god is to be punished as a spreader of false news but notwithstanding this the church declares in one of her homilies that fasting by the decree of the   0 fathers assembled at the council of chalcedon which was one of the first four general councils who grounded their determinations upon the sacred scriptures and long continued usage or practice both of the prophets and other godly persons before the coming of christ and also of the apostles and other devout men in the new testament is a withholding meat drink and all natural food from the body for the determined time of fasting the times she sets apart as proper for this duty are the same with those observed in the earliest ages of the church feasts god in his great wisdom appointed several festivals among the jews   to perpetuate the memory of these great events and wonders which he had wrought in favor of his people   to keep them firm to their religion   to encourage them by intervals of rest and pleasure for their festivals were accompanied with rejoicings with feasts of charity and with innocent diversions   for instruction for at those times there were seasons when the law of god was read and explained   to renew and confirm their acquaintance and friendship with their tribes the hebrews had a great number of feasts as the sabbath the sabbatical year the passover the feast of pentecost of trumpets of new mons of expiation of tabernacles and occasional as that at the dedication of the temple etc feasts or festivals days of religious feasting such solemnities have obtained in every age and nation  festivals among the ancient grecians were instituted upon various accounts first in honor of the gods especially if they had conferred any signal savours on the public or on private persons secondly in order to procure some especial favor from the gods or to appease their anger in times of public calamity thirdly in memory of deceased friends or of those who had done any remarkable service to or died valiantly in defense of their country fourthly at a time of ease and rest from their labor in the ancient christian church besides the festivals which peculiarly related to our lords conomy on earth such as the nativity easter pentecost etc there was another sort instituted by the church in honor of the apostles and martyrs the first original of these festivals is not certainly known but learned men commonly carry it as high as the second century these they called their natalitia or birthdays meaning not their natural birth but a glorious crown in the kingdom of heaven they were celebrated at the graves or monuments of the martyrs and were mostly confined to those particular churches where the martyrs lay buried for which reason it was customary for every church to have its particular fasti or calendar of martyrs in which was a distinct narrative of the acts and sufferings of each martyr and these acts and sufferings were commonly read in the church on the anniversary commemoration and proper festival of the martyr to these they commonly added a panegyrical oration or sermon on the virtue of the martyr they observed the virgil or eve of these festivals with psalmody and prayer till break of day  another sort of festivals observed by the ancient christians were annual thanksgiving days for favors and blessings vouchsafed by god to his church thus the church of alexandria kept an anniversary thanksgiving on the twentyfirst of july for their deliverance from a terrible earthquake in the reign of julian among these we may reckon the thanksgivings for signal victories of the emperors which generally lasted no longer than the life of the emperor on whose account they were instituted  in the romish church there are double feasts half double and simple feasts the name of double feasts was given to those whose service is fuller and more solemn than the rest the other denominations took their rise from singular reasons the chief difference between them being the greater or less solemnity used in them the churches are established and the altars adorned according to the rank each saint holds in his respective church all high festivals have an octave consisting of the feast itself and the seven following days  in italy certain festivals are celebrated which occur only in the calendar of the lovers of that country to understand this you are to know that when a lover is desirous of giving his mistress the highest testimonies of his gallantry he immediately makes her the idol of his devotion he has vespers and even masses said in her honor for this purpose he makes choice of some saint whose name she bears and though the saint has the name they manage matters so that the devotion of the festival is plainly relative to the lovers mistress  when upon the reformation the liturgy of the church of england was settled the observation of festivals was enjoined by several statutes which were revived in the first year of queen elizabeth and continued in the first year of king james and when upon the restoration king charles issued out a commission for reviving the liturgy the alterations made in it were synodically agreed upon and confirmed by the king and parliament as the act of uniformity testifies feasts of god in french fete de dieu a solemn festival in the romish church instituted for the performing a peculiar kind of worship to our savior in the eucharist it is observed the thursday after the octaves of whitsuntide its institution is ascribed to pope urban iv in the year      the office for the solemnity was drawn up by the famous thomas aquinas the church being at that time disturbed by the faction of the guelss and gibolines pope urbans bull for this festival was not every where obeyed afterward at the general council of vienne in      under pope clement v the kings of england france and arragon being present this bull was confirmed and ordered to be every where observed in      pope john xxii to heighten the solemnity added an octave to it and ordered the holy sacrament to be carried in procession fermentarii a denomination which those of the latin church have given to the greeks on account of their consecrating and using leavened or fermented bread in the eucharist  as the greeks call the latins azymites the latins in return call them fermentarii feuillants a religious order in the romish church being a reform of the order of cistertians don john de la barriere of the illustrious family of turenne in querc being promoted to the abbey of feuillans in      undertook to reform his monks who not relishing his great austerities unanimously agreed to quit the monastery but the fame of his capacity soon drew to him a great number of followers who not only revived the ancient fervor of the cistertian order but even surpassed it they went barefooted and bareheaded lay in their clothes on the boards and eat their victuals on the floor some of them never drank out of any thing but dead mens skulls they lived upon nothing but broth made of herbs and black bread such was the life of john de la barriere and his disciples first fruits see annates flagellantes a sect of heretics who chastised and disciplined themselves with whips in public it had its rise at perusa in    0 its author being one reinier an hermit they ran into strange notions particularly that the blood thus spilt was mixed with that of jesus christ and the by a flagellation of twentyfour days they gained the pardon of all their sins floriniani a sect of heretics of the second century so called

combined together in any cloister or convent but only agreeing among themselves to observe the rule of their order g gaianitae a sect of ancient heretics sprung from the eutychians they denied that jesus christ after the hypostatical union was subject to any of the infirmities of human nature they had their name from gaian a bishop of alexandria in the sixth century galileans a sort of judaizing christians that sprung up about the latter end of the fourth or the beginning of the fifth century galileans a sect of the jews which sprung up in judea some years after the birth of our savior though it is likewise a name that was given to the disciples of jesus christ they sprang from one judas a native of gaulam in upper galilee about the year of the world  0 0 in the  0th year of jesus christ upon occasion of augustuss appointing the people to be mustered which they looked upon as an instance of servitude which all true israelites ought to oppose with all their power the galileans according to jesephus agreed in every thing with the pharisees only a peculiar predominant love of liberty they held that god alone is the head and prince we are to obey  in the gospel we find them mentioned by the name of herodians who addressed themselves to our lord and asked him if it were lawful or not to pay tribute to caesar this was the great question and principal object of their sect and when jesus christ appeared before pilate his accusers would fain have rendered him suspected of this heresy in order to prejudice pilate against him genesis the first book of the sacred scriptures it is called genesis or generation because it contains the genealogy of the first patriarchs from adam to the sons and grandsons of jacob this book is called berischith in hebrew because in the original language it begins with this word it includes the history of      years from the beginning of the world to the death of the patriarch joseph genevieve fathers of st genevieve the name of a congregation of regular canons of the order of st augustine established in france it was begun by st charles faure in the year      it now consists of above an hundred monastics it takes its name from the abbey of st genevieve which is the chief of the order and whose abbot is the general thereof the abbey itself took its name from st genevieve the patroness of the city of paris who died in the year     gentiles the hebrews called the gentiles by the general name of goiim which signifies the nations that have not received the faith or law of god all who are not jews and circumcised are comprised under the word goiim before jesus christ opened the door to life and justification to the world by the belief and profession of the jewish religion those who were converted and embraced judaism they called proselytes but since the preaching of the gospel the true religion is not confined to any one nation or people as heretofore god who had promised by the prophets to call the gentiles to the faith has executed this promise so that the christian church is composed of few other than gentile converts and the jews who were too proud of their particular privileges for the most part have persisted in disowning jesus christ their messiah and redeemer st pauls epistles are generally comprehended under the name of greeks judaeus and graecus signify jew and gentile george religious of the order of st george of which there are diverse orders and congregations particularly canons regular of st george in alga at venice established in   0  another in scily etc gilbertines

inheritance gnosimachi an ancient sect whose distinguishing character was that they were professed enemies to all studied knowledge in divinity gnostics a sect of christians in the first and second centuries who arrogated to themselves a high degree of knowledge and looked upon all other christians in comparison of them to be simple and ignorant st irenaeus supposes that st paul greatly reflects upon this sectary in his epistle to timothy which may be the reason why these epistles were in aftertime rejected by them some imagine they proceeded from simon magus and from this root they branched into various other sects as valentinians cerinthians basilidians marcienites colobarsian etc one thing in justice to truth is observable and whoever impartially examines the fathers portraiture of these ancient heresies will find there the first seeds and elements of those controversies which so much disturbed the peace of the church for several centuries and indeed it could be wished the chief patrons of some doctrines which our first reformers either started themselves or brought with them out of the romish church would carefully examine st irenaeus were it only to see under what class that ancient writer would have ranged them whether within the pale of the primitive church or among the errors which she unanimously exploded and indeed i must refer the reader to that author for a full account of them their principal tenets are first the notion of the probolae or internal productions by which they meant something originally residing within the essence of god and formed by him into a distinct personal substance from him a doctrine not only inconsistent with the simplicity and immutability of the divine nature but which also is attended with this manifest contradiction viz the supposing one and the same essence to be both derived and underived selfexistent and begotten anaximander says this ancient father and meaning the pagan philosopher so called affirmed that which is immense to be the father of all things containing after a seminal manner within himself the production of all this notion they have borrowed from him and applied to their bithus or aeons i e to their supreme father and the whole system of divine personages derived from him and on the same principle they attempted to explain the production of the animal and material world not by gods creating it out of nothing for this valentinius denied but by some flux or emanation of substance or passion from one of their aeons in much the same way they accounted for the origin of moral good and evil not by founding them wholly on the will of the free agent but in his substance or nature made up it seems of certain qualities originally implanted in him qualities in which his own consent and will was not the least concerned as being coeval with his existence and as i before observed interwoven with his very nature from hence came the cosmocrater or diabolic power and to use their phraseology the whole spiritual substance of wickedness and from hence  dly descending lower i mean to the human species they divided it into the material animal and spiritual the first class whose souls were of much the same kind with that of the brutes they affirmed was absolutely incapable of salvation and accordingly they absolutely denied the resurrection of the body and affirmed that the souls departed were immediately conveyed beyond the seventh heaven and admitted to the beatific vision of god the second were candidates for happiness and were trained up for it by faith and good works and under this division says irenaeus they place us who are of the church for which reason they say a good life or practice is necessary for us absolutely so but as for themselves that they shall be saved not by practice but being by nature spiritual and having the seeds of election they assert in relation to our savior that he assumed the first fruits of whatever he intended to save accordingly he assumed both a soul and spirit as belonging to the second and third class but they absolutely denied his assuming any thing material or a body of the same kind as ours this soul they called the animal christ in contradistinction from the divine personage that came down from heaven and it was this animal christ or human soul and not the savior from above which suffered for us they had other strange opinions and they have gone through different forms and characters in a long series of time though it is in the main the same and what most of the heresies of former times may be in good measure deduced from of which the reader will be in some measure satisfied by searching into the tenets of the valentinians homousans montanists originism etc the gnostics carried images about them of our savior in gold silver ivory etc which they paid a superstitious veneration to god so we call the supreme being the first cause or creator of the universe and the only true object of religious worship god says sir isaac newton is a relative term and has respect to servants it denotes indeed an eternal infinite absolutely perfect being but such a being without dominion would not be god the word god frequently signifies lord but every lord is not god the dominion of a spiritual being or lord constitutes god true dominion true god the supreme supreme pretended pretended from such true dominion it follows that the true god is living intelligent and powerful and from his other perfections that he is supreme or supremely perfect he is eternal and infinite omnipotent and omniscient that is he endures from eternity to eternity and is present from infinity to infinity he governs all things that exist and knows all things that are to be known he is not eternity or infinity but eternal and infinite he is not duration of space but he endures and is present he endures always and is present every where and by existing always and every where constitutes the very things we call duration and space eternity and infinity he is omnipresent not only virtually but substantially for power without substance cannot subsist all things are contained and more in him but without any mutual passion that is he suffers nothing from the motion of bodies nor do they undergo any resistance from his omnipresence it is confessed that god exists necessarily and by the same necessity he exists always and every where hence he must be always similar all eye all ear all brain all arm all perception intelligence and action but after a manner not at all corporeal not at all like men after a manner altogether unknown to us he is destitute of all body and bodily shape and therefore cannot be seen heard or touched nor ought to be worshipped under the representation of any thing corporeal we know him only by his properties or attributes by the most wise and excellent structure of things and by final causes but we adore and worship him only on account of his dominion for god setting aside dominion providence and final causes is nothing else but fate and nature  the existence of such a being or first cause of all things is thus beautifully proved and illustrated by the ingenious author of the religion of nature delineated suppose a chain hung out of the heavens from an unknown height and though every link of it gravitated toward the earth and what it hung upon was not visible yet it did not descend but kept its situation and upon this a question should arise what supported or kept up this chain would it be sufficient to answer that the first or lowest link hung upon the second or that next above the second or rather the first and second together on the third and so on ad infinitum for what holds up the whole a chain of ten links would fall down unless something able to bear it hindered one of twenty if not staid by something of yet greater strength in proportion to the increase of weight and therefore one of infinite links certainly if not sustained by something infinitely strong and capable to bear an infinite weight and thus it is in a chain of causes and effects tending or as it were gravitating toward some end the last or lowest depends or as one may say is suspended upon the cause above it this again if it be not the first cause is suspended as an effect of something above it etc and if they should be infinite unless agreeably to what has been said there is some cause upon which all hang or depend they would be but an infinite effect without an efficient and to assert there is any such thing would be as great an absurdity as to say a finite or little weight wants something to sustain it but an infinite one or the greatest does not good friday a fast of the christian church in memory of the sufferings and death of jesus christ it is observed on the friday in holy or passion week and it is called by way of eminence good because of the blessed effects of our saviors sufferings which were a propitratory or explating sacrifice for the sins of the world the commemoration of our saviors sufferings has been kept from the very first ages of christianity and was always observed as a day of the strictest fasting and humiliation among the saxons it was called longfriday but for what reason except on account of the long fastings and offices then used is uncertain on good friday the pope sits on a plain form and after service is ended when the cardinals wait on him back to his chamber they are obliged to keep a deep silence as a testimony of their sorrow in the night of good friday the greeks perform the obsequies of our savior round a great crucifix laid on a bed of state adorned with flowers these the bishops distribute among the assistants when the office is ended the armenians on this day set open a holy sepulcher in imitation of that of mount calvary gospel the recital of the life actions death resurrection ascension doctrine of jesus christ the word gospel is saxon and signifies gods relation or good saying the latin term evangelium signifies glad tidings or good news the history of our blessed savior being the best news that could be published to mankind this history is contained in the writings of st matthew st mark st luke and st john who from thence are styled evangelists the christian church never acknowledge any more than these four gospels as canonical notwithstanding which several apocryphal gospels are handed down to us and others are entirely lost the word gospel is often used in general to signify the christian religion and preaching the gospel is preaching the doctrines of christianity government or political power is a right of making laws with penalties of death and consequently all less penalties for the regulating and preserving of property and of employing the force of the community in the execution of such laws and in the defense of the commonwealth from foreign injury and all this only for the public good grabatarii such persons as deferred to receive baptism till the hour of death from an opinion that baptism washed away all former sins h hallelujah a term of rejoicing compounded of two hebrew words st jerome first introduced this word into the church service for a considerable time it was only used once a year in the latin church viz at easter but in the greek church it was much more frequent st jerome mentions its being sung at the interments of the dead which it still continues to be in that church as also on some occasions in the time of lent in the time of gregory the great it was appointed to be sung all the year round in the latin church which raised some complaints against that pope as giving too much into the greek way harpooratians see carpeeratians heaven without defining is so well known a word that i begin this article by observing that heaven was the first object of false worship the scriptures often speak of worshipping the host of heaven and the poet ennius makes the visible heaven and jupiter to be the same thing aspice hoc sublime candens quem invocamus omnes jovem cast your eyes up to yon burning vault which we all invoke under the name of jupiter the pagans considered heaven as the residence only of the celestial gods and into which no mortals after death were admitted unless they had been first deified or made gods as for the souls of men they were consigned to the elysian fields the hebrews acknowledged three heavens the first the aerial heaven where the birds fly the winds blow and the showers are formed the second the heaven or firmament wherein the stars are disposed the third the heaven of heavens the place of gods residence and where the saints and angels dwell this third heaven is mentioned by st paul in the account which he gives of his rapture juvenal ignorantly accuses the jews of paying divine adoration to the visible heaven hell though there are various significations of this word yet it is here to be understood only in a restrained sense to denote the place of divine punishment after death in contradistinction to heaven the place of divine recompense so that as in the latter the souls of good men receive the due reward of their virtuous actions in the former the souls of the wicked men are justly punished for their bad actions as all religions have supposed a future state of existence after this life so all have their hell or place of torment in which the wicked are supposed to be punished helvidians a sect of ancient heretics denominated from their leader helvidius an arian whose distinguishing principle was that mary the mother of jesus did not continue a virgin but had other children by joseph hemerobaptists a sect among the ancient jews thus called from their washing and bathing every day in all seasons heracleonites a sect of christians followers of heracleon of whom origin gives a large account he refined upon the gnostic divinity and in order to make himself the head of a sect departed from the usual exposition of many texts of scripture and sometimes changed the reading to make it comply with his notions he maintained that the world was not the immediate production of the son of god but that he was only the occasional cause of its being created by the demiurgus the heracleonites denied the authority of the prophecies of the old testament maintaining that they were mere random sounds in the air and that john the baptist was the only true voice which directed to the messiah heresiarch archheretic the founder or inventor of an heresy or a chief and ringleader of a sect of heretics heretics the general name of such persons under any religion but especially the christian as maintain or teach opinions in religion contrary to the orthodox or established faith the term heresy is of greek original and signifies option choice or sect as is applied to the voluntary choice a man makes of doctrines supposed to be contrary to the true faith heresies began very early in the christian church eusebius fixes the beginning of most of them to the reign of the emperor adrian and yet it is certain that simon magus had published his errors before that time and set up a sect which gave rise to most of the ancient heresies the laws both of the church and state were very severe against those who were adjudged to be heretics those of the states made by the christian emperors from the time of constantine are comprised under one title de hereticis in the theodosian code the principal of them are first the general note of infamy affixed to all heretics in common secondry all commerce forbidden to be held with them thirdly the depriving them of all offices of profit and dignity fourthly the disqualifying them to dispose of their estates by will or receive estates from others fifthly the imposing on them pecuniary mulcts sixthy the proscribing and banishing them seventhly the inflicting corporal punishment on them such as scouring etc before banishment besides these laws which chiefly affected the persons of heretics there were several others which tended to the extirpation of heresy such as first those which forbad heretical teachers to propagate their doctrines publicly or privately secondly those which forbad heretics to hold public disputations thirdly such laws as prohibited all heretical meetings and assemblies thirdly those which deny to the children of heretical parents their patrimony and inheritance unless they returned to the church and fourthly such laws as ordered the books of heretics to be burned there were many other penal laws made against heretics from the time of constantine to theodosius jun and valentinian iii but the few already mentioned may be sufficient to give an idea of the rigor with which the empire treated such persons as held or taught opinions contrary to the faith of the catholic church whose discipline toward heretics was no less severe than the civil laws for first the church was used to pronounce a formal anathema or excommunication against them thus the council of nice ends her creed with an anathema against all those who opposed the doctrine there delivered and there are innumerable instances of this kind to be found in the volumes of the councils secondly some canons debarred them from the very lowest privileges of church communion forbidding them to enter into the church so much as to hear the sermon or the scriptures read in the service of the catechumens but this was no general rule for liberty was often granted to heretics to be present at the sermons in hopes of their conversion and the historians tell us that chrysostom by this means brought over many to acknowledge the divinity of christ whilst they had liberty to come and hear his sermons thirdly the church prohibited all persons under pain of excommunication to join with heretics in any religious offices fourthly by the laws of the church no one was to eat or converse familiarly with heretics or to read their writings or to contract affinity with them their names were to be struck out of the diptyches or sacred registers of the church and if they died in heresy no psalmody or other solemnity was to be used at their funerals fifthly the testimony of heretics was notto be taken in any ecclesiastical cause whatsoever these are the chief ecclesiastical laws against heretics as to the terms of penance imposed upon relenting heretics or such as were willing to renounce their errors and to be reconciled to the church they were various and differed according to the canons of different councils or the usage of different churches the council of eliberis appoints ten years penance before repenting heretics are admitted to communion the council of agde contracted this term into that of three years the council of epone reduced it to two years only the ancient christian church made a distinction between such heretics as contumaciously resisted the admonitions of the church and such as never had any admonition given them for none were reputed formal heretics or treated as such till the church had given them a first and second admonition according to the apostles rule the romish church is very rigorous in her treatment of those persons whom she deems to be heretics particularly in those countries where the inquisition prevails there the utmost severities of imprisonment racks and tortures of various shapes are employed against them and if the civil magistrate whose assistance they implore when the punishment is capital should go about to mitigate it he himself would be suspected of favoring heretics and would run the risk of excommunication there is no express law in england which determines what shall be called heresy it is true the statute   elizabeth cap i directed the high commission court to restrain the same to what had been adjudged to be so by the authority of the scriptures or by the first four general councils or to what should be determined to be such by parliament the convocation assenting the archbishop or bishop of any diocese has by the common law power to convict persons of heresy the convocation may declare what tenets are heretical heresy was anciently treason and the punishment for it was burning by virtue of the writ de heretico comburendo but the heretic forfeited neither lands nor goods because the proceedings against him were pro salute animi by statute    car ii cap ix the proceedings on such writ and all punishments by death in pursuance of ecclesiastical censures are taken away but an obstinate heretic being excommunicated is liable to be imprisoned by virtue of the writ de excommunicatio capiendo and denying the christian religion or the divine authority of the holy scriptures is liable for the second offense to three years imprisonment and diverse disabilities by the statutes   and  0 of william cap xxxii those says st jerome who interpret scripture to any sense repugnant to that of the holy spirit though they should never withdraw themselves from the church yet may be justly called heretics hermeani a sect of heretics in the  d century they held that god was corporeal and that christ did not ascend into heaven with his body but left it in the sun hermits of st augustine a religious order more frequently called augustines or austin friars see augustines hermits of brittini see augustines hermogenians a sect of ancient heretics denominated from their

aetians hieracites a sect of christians of the  d century so called from their leader hierax a philosopher and magician of egypt who about the year     taught that melchisedeck was the holy ghost denied the resurrection and condemned marriage he likewise held that no one could be saved who was not arrived at the age of adults and consequently that all who die in infancy are damned the disciples of hierax taught that the word or son of god was contained in the father as a little vessel is in a great one from whence they had the name of metangimonists from a greek word which signifies contained in a vessel hieromnemon the name of an officer in the greek church whose principal function it was to stand behind the patriarch at the sacraments and other ceremonies of the church and to show him the prayers psalms etc in the order in which they were to be rehearsed he likewise assisted the patriarch in putting on his pontifical vestments and assigned the places to those who had a right to sit around him when seted on his throne his office in this latter respect was the same as that of master of the ceremonies to the pope the hieromnemon was commonly a deacon though sometimes in priests orders in which case he was excused from dressing the patriarch the name is of greek original and signifies a sacred monitor hominicolae a name which the apollinarists gave to the orthodox to denote them worshippers of man i e godman homoousans homousians homoousianists homousiasts names which the arians anciently gave to the orthodox by reason that they held that god the son

corinthians in the  st century by the theodosians in the  d by the artemonians at the beginning of the third and by the samosatenians or paulians toward the close of the same a council was assembled at antioch in     wherein paulus samosatenus bishop of antioch was condemned and deposed and a decrce published wherein christ is asserted to be god of god i e  consubstantial with the father

christians in syria and mesopotamia so called either from one jacob a syrian who lived in the time of the emperor mauricius or from one jacob a monk firnamed zanzales who flourished in   0 the jacobites are one of the two sects which sprung from the followers of dioscorus and eutyches who refused to consent to the council of chalcedon they are divided among themselves some following the rites of the latin church and others continuing separated from the church of rome there is also at present a division among the latter who have two rival patriarchs one of whom resides at caramit and the other at derizapharan as to their belief they are monophysites that is they hold but one nature in jesus christ which was the sentiment of dioscorus they pretend however that they explain themselves in this manner concerning the union of nature and person in christ only to keep at a distance from the nestoriaus but that in effect they do not differ far from the church of rome which establishes two natures in christ with respect to purgatory and prayers for the dead they are of the same opinion with the greeks and the other eastern christians they consecrate the eucharist with leavened bread they neglect confession believing it not to be of divine institution the jacobites perform divine service in the chaldaean language though they speak arabic turkish and armenian their priests say mass in hebrew they administer the eucharist to the people and even to young children in both kinds they hold the real presence and transubstantiation and honor the holy sacrament when the catholic priests carry it to the sick person whereas the syrians of the greek church refuse this respect to the eucharist consecrated by catholics pope nicholas iv sent a confession of faith to the jacobites in the year      exhorting them to an union with the church of rome but his instances had no effect jansenists from cornelius jansen bishop of ypres in flanders in    0 the whole doctrine is reducible to these five points i some commands of god are impossible to righteous men even though they endeavor with all their powers to accomplish them the grace being wanted by which they should be able to perform them ii in the state of corrupted nature a man never resists inward grace iii to merit or demerit in the present state of corrupt nature it is not necessary or requisite that a man should have that liberty which excludes necessity that which excludes constraint is sufficient iv the semipelagians admitted the necessity of inward preventing grace to each act in particular and even to the beginning of faith but held they were heretics in regard they asserted this grace was such as that the will of man might either resist or obey it v it is semipelagianism to say that jesus christ died or shed his blood for all men in general iconoclastes breakers of images a name which the church of rome gives to all who reject the use of images in religious matters iconolatra one who

he himself gave to such as were present the habit they were to wear they followed the rule of st augustine and were ranked among the order of mendicants for two centuries they were mere laybrothers

called aqua vitaemongers being very rich in the state of venice that republic solicited their suppression and obtained it of clement ix their effects being employed toward the support of the war in candia jesuits a most famous religious order in the romish church their founder was inigo or ignatius loyola who was born in      in the province of guipuscoa in spain he was bred up in the court of ferdinand king of spain in his youth he discovered a martial disposition and signalised himself in the siege of pampelona where he was wounded and taken prisoner by the french during his confinement and illness he read some books of piety which occasioned his first resolution of devoting himself wholly to god as soon as he was cured he undertook a pilgrimage to our lady of montserrat in catalonia where he dedicated himself to the virgin and took a resolution to travel to jerusalem it is believed he here wrote his spiritual exercises which he afterward published at rome in      he arrived at jerusalem sept        where he visited the holy places and performed all the pious exercises of a pilgrim being returned to spain he began to study grammar at barcelona and afterward went through his courses of philosophy and divinity at alcala ignatius had then four companions who were all clothed like himself in a brown woollen habit and applied themselves to the same exercises his same increasing the number of those who came to hear his instructions increased likewise this giving umbrage to the inquisitors of the city of alcala he was taken up and imprisoned by order of the grand vicar but was soon released with an injunction to go clothed like the other scholars and to abstain from talking to the people concerning religion till he had studied four years in divinity upon this he retired to salamanca where he continued to discourse both in public and private upon moral subjects here he was again imprisoned upon an information of the dominicans against him he being released resolved to quit spain and to go to paris with a firm resolution to apply himself closely to study in that city in      ignatius having assembled ten of his companions at rome chosen mostly out of the university of paris proposed to them to make a new order paul iii confirmed the plan of his institution by a bull in    0 calling them therein the company of jesus the order was confirmed by several succeeding popes who added many new rights and privileges to it the end principally proposed by this order is to gain converts to the romish church with which view they disperse themselves in every country and nation and with amazing industry and address pursue the ends of their institution no difficulty so great that they cannot surmount no danger so imminent that they will not undergo and as has been apparent no crimes so shocking that have not been perpetrated by them for the service of their causes they have been very conspicuous by their missions into the indies and by their other employments relating to the study of the sciences and the education of youth they have lately however from the practice of their abominable maxims been expelled the kingdoms of france and portugal and the order seems every where upon the decline illumind illuminati a churchterm anciently applied to such persons as had received baptism this name was occasioned by a ceremony in the baptism of adults which consisted in putting a lighted taper in the hand of the person baptized as a symbol of the faith and grace he had received in the sacrament they are also the names of a sect of heretics who sprung up in spain about the year      their principal doctrines were that by means of a sublime manner of prayer which they had attained to they entered into so perfect a state that they had no occasion for ordinances sacraments nor good works and that they could give way even to the vilest actions without sin image worship was first attempted to be introduced in the fourth century but occasioned great controversy and insurrections in the eastern empire by the iconoclastes in     it occasioned the council of nice began sept    and ended in october     but was not practiced in the french church till near a d  00 nor in germany till after the year   00 the second council of nice in the  th year of the reign of irene and her son constantine determined that images should not only be received into churches but be adored and worshipped there a d     image of god in the soul is a theological phrase and is generally distinguished into natural and moral by natural is meant the understanding reason will and other intellectual faculties by the moral image the right use of those faculties or what we comprehend in the notion of holiness and virtue in which latter the dignity of human nature consists imagination is a bodily impression which inclines us to believe without any authority from reason for such a persuasion the present or future existence of things which neither

supposed to save the sinner from purgatory infallibility was not ascribed to the pope in the ninth century the pope being then obliged to transmit his confession of faith at his election and take the solemn oath of religion infinity an attribute of god the idea of infinity or immensity is so closely connected with that of selfexistence that because it is impossible but something must be infinite independently and of itself therefore it must of necessity be self existent and because something must of necessity be selfexistent therefore it is necessary that it must likewise be infinite a necessary existent being must be every where as well as always unalterably the same for a necessity which is not every where the same is plainly a consequential necessity only depending upon some external cause whatever therefore exists by an absolute necessity in its own nature must needs be infinite as well as eternal to suppose a finite being to be selfexistent is to say that it is a contradiction for that being not to exist the absence of which may yet be conceived without a contradiction which is the greatest absurdity in the world from hence it follows that the infinity of the selfexistent being must be an infinity of fullness as well as of immensity that is it must not only be without limits but also without diversity defect or interruption it follows likewise that the selfexistent being must be a most simple unchangeable incorruptible being without parts figure motion divisibility or any other such properties as we find in matter for all these things do plainly and necessarily imply finiteness in their very notion and are utterly inconsistent with complete infinity as to the particular manner in which the supreme being is infinite or every where present this is as impossible for our finite understandings to comprehend and explain as it is for us to form an adequate idea of infinity the schoolmen have presumed to assert that the immensity of god is a point as his eternity they think is an insiance but this being altogether unintelligible we may more safely affirm that the supreme cause is at all times equally present both in his simple essence and by the immediate and perfect exercise of all his attributes to every point of the boundless immensity as if it were really all but one single point infralapsarii the name of a sect of predestinarians who

are three kinds of legates viz legates a latere legates de latere and legates by office or legati nati of these the most confiderable are legates a latere such are those whom the pope commissions to take his place in councils so called in regard that the pope never gives this office to any but his favorites and confidents who are always at his side a latere these are usually cardinals a legate a latere has the power of conferring benefices without mandate of legitimating bastards to hold offices and has a cross carried before him as the ensign of his authority the legates de latere are those who are not cardinals but yet are instituted with an apostolical legation legates by office are those who have not any particular legation given them but who by virtue of their dignity and rank in the church become legates such are the archbishops of rheims and arles but the authority of these legates is much inferior to that of the legates a latere the power of a legate is sometimes given without the title some of the nuncios are invested with it it was one of the ecclesiastical privileges of england from the norman conquest that no foreign legate should be obtruded upon the english unless the king should desire it upon some extraordinary emergency as when a case was too difficult for the english prelates to determine hence in the reign of henry ii when cardinal vivian who was sent legate

declus who abjured their faith in private and were by a certificate of such a juration sheltered from any further molestation on account of their religion libertines libertini a religious fact which arose in the year      whose principal tenets were that there is but one only spirit which is that of god who is diffused through all things who is and lives in all creatures that our souls are nothing but this spirit of god that the soul dies with the body that sin is a mere chimera and only subsists in opinion so that it is god that does all both good and evil that paradise is a dream and hell a phantom invented by priests and religion a statetrick to keep men in awe that spiritual regeneration only consists in stifling the remorse of conscience repentance in avowing to have done no evil and that it is lawful and even expedient to dissemble in matters of religion to these they added horrid blasphemies against jesus christ saying he was nothing but a mere je ne scai quoi composed of the spirit of god and of the opinion of men these maxims occasioned their being called libertines and the word has been used in an ill sense ever since the libertini principally spread in holland and brabant their leaders were one quintin a picard and another called chopin who joined with him and became his disciple how similar their opinions and maxims are with those of the libertines of the present age the reader need not desire to have pointed out liberty religious the ground of the reformation and what was asserted by all protestants in the beginning of it as appears from the famous protestation of six princes and fourteen free cities against the diet at spire from which incident the name of protestant took its rise they pray for liberty to dissent from the decree of the diet in a matter which concerned the salvation of their souls they were very willing others should enjoy the same liberty within their dominions as they desired for themselves in their own that no doctrine was so certain as that of gods word and nothing should be taught besides it that obscure passages of scripture could not be explained better than by other plain places that this was the only sure and infallible way but the traditions of men had no certain foundation limbus a term used in the romish theology for that place where the patriarchs are supposed to have waited for the redemption of mankind and where they imagine our savior continued from the time of his death to that of his resurrection it is also according to the catholics the place destined to receive the souls of infants who die without baptism the fathers call this place limbus eo quod sit limbus inferiorum as being the margin or frontier of the other world litany in greek  in latin supplicatio and rogatio the word litany in its original meaning is but another name for prayer in general and is used as such by heathen authors in the christian sense of the word a litany is a solemn form of supplication to god eusebius speaking of constantines custom of making solemn addresses to god in his tent says he endeavored to render god propitious to him by his supplication and litanies and arcadius in one of his laws against heretics forbids them to hold profane assemblies in the city either by night or by day to make their litany at that time the public prayers hymns and psalmody were all comprised under the general name of litany afterward the word came to signify a peculiar sort of prayers used in the church concerning the original of which learned men are not agreed at first the use of litanies was not fixed to any stated time but they were employed only as exigencies required they were observed in imitation of the ninevites with ardent supplications and fastings to avert the threatening judgments of fire earthquakes inundations or hostile invasions the days on which they were used were called rogationdays several of these days were appointed by the canons of different councils till the seventeenth council of toledo decreed that litanies should be used every month throughout the year and so by degrees these solemn supplications came to be used weekly on wednesdays and fridays the ancient stationary days in all churches as to the form in which litanies are made namely in short petitions by the priest which responses by the people st chrysostom derives the custom from the primitive ages when the priest began and uttered by the spirit some things fit to be prayed for and the people joined the intercessions saying we beseech thee to hear us good lord when the miraculous gifts of the spirit began to cease they wrote down several of these forms which were the original of our modern litanies st ambrose has left us one agreeing in many things with that of our own church about the year  00 litanies began to be used in processions the people walking barefoot and repeating them with great devotion it is pretended several countries were delivered from great calamities by this means about the year  00 gregory the great out of all the litanies extant composed the famous sevenfold litany by which rome it is said was delivered from a grievous mortality this has been a pattern to all the western churches since to which ours of the church of england comes nearer than that in the present roman missal in which later popes have inserted the invocation of saints which our reformers justly expunged those processional liturgies having occsioned much scandal it was decreed that the litanies for the future should only be used within the walls of the church the days appointed by the fifteenth canon of our church for using the litany are wednesdays and fridays the ancient fastingdays of the primitive church to which by the subric sundays are added as being the days of the greatest assembly for divine service before the last review of the common prayer the litany was a distinct service by itself and used some time after the morningprayer was over at present it is made one office with the morningservice being ordered to be read after the third collect for grace instead of the intercessional prayers in the daily service liturgy denotes all the ceremonies in general belonging to divine service in a more restrained signification liturgy is used among the romanists to signify the mass and among us the common prayer prayer all who have written on liturgies agree that in the primitive days divine service was exceedingly simple clogged with a very few ceremonies and consisting of but a small number of prayers but by degrees they increased the number of external ceremonies and added new prayers to make the office look more awful and venerable to the people at length things were carried to such a pitch that a regulation became necessary and it was found proper to put the service and the manner of performing it into writing and this was what they called a liturgy liturgies have been different at different times and in different countries we have the liturgy of st chrysostom that of st peter of st james the liturgy of st basil the armenian liturgy the liturgy of the maronites of the cophtae the roman liturgy the gallican liturgy the english liturgy the ambrosian liturgy the spanish and african liturgies etc liturgy of the church of england this book is entitled the book of common prayer and administration of the sacraments and other rites and ceremonies of the church according to the use of the church of england before the reformation the liturgy was only in latin being a collection of prayers made up partly of some ancient forms used in the primitive church and partly of some others of a later original accommodated to the romish religion at that time the religion of england but when the nation in king henry viiis time was disposed to a reformation it was thought necessary both to have the service in the english or vulgar tongue and to correct and amend the liturgy by purging it of those gross corruptions which had gradually crept into it and first the convocation appointed a committee a d      to compose a book which was entitled the godly and pious institution of a christian man containing a declaration of the lords prayer the ave maria the creed the ten commandments and the seven sacraments etc this book was again published in    0 with corrections and alterations under the title of a necessary erudition of any christen man in the same year a committee of bishops and other divines was appointed by king henry viii to reform the rituals and offices of the church and the next year the king and clergy ordered the prayers for processions and litanies to be put in english and to be publicly used afterward in      came out the kings primer containing the whole morning and evening prayer in english not very different from what it is in present from our common prayer thus far the reformation of our liturgy was carried in the reign of henry viii  in the year      the first of king edward vi the convocation unanimously declared that the communion ought to be administered in both kinds whereupon an act of parliament was made ordering it to be administered then a committee of bishops and other learned divines was appointed to compose an uniform order of communion according to the rules of scripture and the use of the primitive church the committee accordingly met in windsor castle and drew up such a form this made way for a new commission impowering the same persons to finish the whole liturgy by drawing up public offices for sundays and holydays for the baptism confirmation matrimony burial and other special occasions lollards this sect spread throughout germany had for their leader walter lollard who began to disperse his opinions about the year      he despised some of the sacraments in the romish church her ceremonies and constitutions observed not the feasts of the church norts abstinencies acknowledged not the intercession of the saints nor believed that the damned in hell would one day be saved irithemius who has given a history of this sect says that the greater part defended their peculiar sentiments even to death in england the followers of wickliffe were so called by way of eproch from some affinity there was between some of their tenets though others are of opinion the english lollards came from germany lords prayer a short form of prayer prescribed by our blessed lord to be used by his disciples and from them taken up by the christian church and used in her iturgies or form of divine service it is evident beyond dispute that the primitive church constantly used this form after the fourth century in her holy offices and the practice was so universal and well known that lucian the heathen is thought to refer to it in one of his dialogues where he speaks in the person of a christian of a prayer which began with our father there was indeed some difference in the manner of using it in the greek and the gallian churches it was said by the priest and all the people together but in the latin church by the priest alone the mosarabic liturgy in spain differed from both these as to the use of the lords prayer for there the priest repeated every petition by itself and the people answered to each petition separately amen love the family of a sect of enthusiasts which arose in holland and being propagated cross the channel appeared in england about the year    0 these sectaries pretended to a more than ordinary sanctity which gained upon the affections of the common people they affirmed that none were of the number of the elect but such as were admitted into their family and that all the rest were reprobate and consigned over to eternal damnation they held likewise that it was lawful for them to swear to an untruth before a magistrate for their own convenience or before any person who was not of their society in order to propagate their opinions they dispersed books translated out of dutch into english entitled the gospel of the kingdom documental sentences the prophecy of the spirit of love the publishing of peace upon earth etc these familists could by no means be prevailed on to discover their author nevertheless it was found afterward to be henry nicolas of leyden who blasphemously pretended that he partook of the divinity of god and god of his humanity queen elizabeth issued a proclamation against these impious sectaries and ordered their books to be publicly burnt lucianists or lucanists a religious sect so called from lucianus or lucanus a heretic of the second century being a disciple of marcion whose errors he followed adding some new ones to them epiphanius says he abandoned marcion teaching that people ought not to marry for fear of enriching the creator and yet other authors mention that he held this error in common with marcion and other gnostics he denied the immortality of the soul asserting it to be material there was another sect of lucianists who appeared some time after the arians they taught that the father had been a father always and that he had the name even before he begat the son as having in him the power or faculty of generation and in this manner they accounted for the eternity of the son luciferians a religious sect who adhered to the schism of lucifer bishop of cagliari in the fourth century st augustine seems to intimate that they believed the soul transmitted from the children to their fathers theodoret says that lucifer was the author of a new error the luciferians increased mightily in gaul spain egypt etc the occasion of the schism was that lucifer would not allow any acts he had done to be abolished there were but two luciferian bishops but a great number of priests and deacons the luciferians bore a peculiar aversion to the arians m macedonians erroneous christians in the fourth century followers of macedonius bishop of constantinople he was pretty much of the sentiments of arius and as he governed the church in an imperious manner and removed the body of constantine from the church of the apostles to that of acacius the martyr be was by the council of constantinople deposed his principal tenet was that the holy ghost was a mere creature though above the angels this sect made extraordinary professions of austerity and they became pretty numerous as most of the arians fell in with them magdalen st religious of a denomination given to many communities of nuns consisting generally of penitent courtezans sometimes also called magdalenettes such as those of metz established in      those at paris in      those of naples in      and endowed by queen sancha to serve as a retreat for public courtezans who should quit the trade and betake themselves to repentance and those of rouen and bourdeaux which had their original among those of paris in each of these monasteries there are three kinds of persons and congregations viz first those who are admitted to make vows who bear the name of st magdalen the second those who are not admitted to make vows and who are called of st martha and thirdly the congregation of st lazarus composed of such as are detained by force the religious of st magdalen at rome were established by leo x clement viii settled a revenue upon them and ordered that the effects of all public prostitutes should be theirs dying intestate and that the testaments of the rest should be invalid ununless they bequeathed at least a fifth of their effects to them manichees manicheans or manichoei a sect of ancient heretics who asserted two principles so called from their author manes or manicheus a persian by nation he established two principles viz a good one and an evil one the first which he called light did nothing but good and the second which he called darkness nothing but evil this philosophy is very ancient and plutarch treats of it at large in his isis and oiris our souls according to manes were made by the good principle and our bodies by the evil one these two principles being coeenal and independent of each other he borrowed many things from the ancient gnostics on which account many authors confider the manicheans as a branch of the gnostics in truth the manichean doctrine was a system of philosophy rather than of religion they made use of amulets in imitation of the basilidians and are said to have made profession of astronomy and astrology they denied that jesus christ assumed a true human body and maintained it was only imagiary they pretended that the law of moses did not come from god or the good principle but from the evil one and for this reason it was abrogated they abstained entirely from eating the flesh of any animal following herein the doctrine of the ancient phythagores the rest of their errors may be seen in st epiphanius and st augustine which last having been of their sect may be presumed to have been thoroughly acquainted with them though the manichees professed to receive the books of the new testament yet in effect they only took so much of them as suited with their opinions they first formed to themselves a certain idea or scheme of christianity and to this adjusted the writings of the apostles pretending that whatever was inconsistent with this had been foisted in the new testament by latter writers who were half jews on the other hand they made fables and apocryphal books pass for apostolical writings and even are suspected to have forged several others the better to maintain their errors st epiphanius gives a catalogue of several pieces published by manes and adds extracts front some of them manes was not contented with the quality of apostle of jesus christ but also assumed that of the paraclete whom christ had promised to send he left several disciples and among others addas thomas and hermas these he sent in his lifetime into several provinces to preach his doctrine manes having undertaken to cure the king of persias son and not succeeding was clapped into prison upon the young princes death whence he made his escape but was apprehended soon after and burnt alive toward the middle of the   th century the sect of manichees took a new face on occasion of one constantine an armenian and adherer to it who took upon him to suppress the reading of all other books besides the evangelists and the epistles of st paul which he explained in such a manner as to make them contain a new system of manicheism he entirely discarded all the writings of his predecessors rejected the chimeras of the valentinians and their thirty aeons the fable of manes with regard to the origin of rain which he made to be the sweat of a young man in hot pursuit after a maid and other dreams but still retained the impurities of basilides in this manner he reformed manicheism insomuch that his followers made no scruple of anathematizing scythian buldas and even manes himself constantine being now their great apostle after he had seduced an infinite number of people he was at last stoned by order of the emperor marcellianism the doctrines and opinions of the mercellians a sect of ancient heretics so called from marcellus of ancyra their leader who was accused of reviving the errors of sabellius marcionites a very ancient and popular sect of heretics in the time of epiphanius so called from their author marcion the son of a bishop of pontus he laid down two principles the one good the other evil he denied the real birth incarnation and passion of jesus christ and held them all to be only apparent he taught two christs one sent for the salvation of all the world and another whom the creator would send to reestablish the jews he denied the resurrection of the body and allowed none to be baptized but those who preserved their continence but these he granted might be baptized three times and held other strange opinions marcites a sect of heretics in the  d century who made profession of doing every thing with a great deal of liberty and without any fear they were so called from one marcus who conferred the priesthood and the administration of the sacraments on women marcosians an ancient sect a branch of the gnostics they had a great number of apocryphal books which they held for canonical and of the same authority with ours out of these they picked several fables touching the infancy of jesus christ which they put off for true histories many of these fables are still in use and credit among the greek monks vide tourneforts voyages maronites a sect of eastern christians who follow the syrian rite and are subject to the pope their principal habitation being on mount libanus where they have a patriarch who resides in the monastery of connubin and assumes the title of patriarch he is elected by the clergy and people according to the ancient custom but fince their reunion with the church of rome he is obliged to have a bull of confirmation from the pope he keeps a perpetual celebrate as well as the rest of the bishops his suffragans but for the rest of the ecclesiastics they are allowed to marry before ordination and yet the monastic life is in great esteem among them their monks are of the order of st antony and live in the most obscure places in the mountains far from the converse of the world as to their faith they agree in the main with the rest of the eastern church marriage a contract both civil and religious between a man and a woman by which they engage to live together in mutual love and friendship for the procreation of children etc this has too near a connection with religion to be omitted in this place the first inhabitants of greece lived promiscuously without marriage cicrops king of athens was the first author of this honorable institution among that people this is mentioned by the poet nonnos the jews had their nuptial contracts and ceremonies the present form among the jews which appears to be very ancient is very simple and significant though our blessed savior had encouraged the institution of marriage by his own presence at a wedding feast and st paul has declared that marriage is honorable in all and the bed undefiled yet there wanted not men in the first ages of the christian church who departed from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils forbidding to marry and others who taught men to commit fornication with license and impunity the ancient christian church laid several restraints upon her members in relation to marriage such were the rules forbidding christians to marry with infidels and heathens this restraint they founded upon the apostles words who leaves a widow at liberty to marry whom she will only in the lord   cor vii    and upon this precept of the same apostle be ye not unequally yed with unbelievers   cor vi    this restriction extended likewise to jews heretics and all persons of different persuasions with whom it was unlawful for an orthodox christian to be jined in wedlock another restraint of the church laid on persons intending to marry related to consanguinity and affinity which would have made the marriage incestuous by coming within the degrees prohibited by god in scripture a third restriction in this matter was that children under age should not marry without the consent of their parents guardians and next relations the romish church has advanced marriage to the dignity of a sacrament the ritual tells us that the end of the sacrament of marriage is that man and wife may mutually help and comfort each other in order that they may spend this life in a holy manner and thereby gain a blessed immortality and to contribute to the edification of the church by the lawful procreation of children and by the care of procuring them a spiritual regeneration and an education suitable to it they require that every person before he enters into wedlock beseech god to join him with such a person as he may work out his salvation with and examine whether or no the person he has fixed his affections on has the fear of god before her eyes is prudent discreet and able to take care of a family etc in our church the form and manner of marriage is too well known to need mention martyr from a greek word which signifies a witness a person who suffers torments and even death in defense of the truth of the gospel scarce any says or religion but pretends to its martyrs mahometans heathens idolaters etc etc have all their martyrs martyrology a register or catalogue of martyrs the word is also used in the romish church for a roll or register kept in the vestry of each church containing the names of all the saints and martyrs both of the universal church and of the particular ones of that city or monastery it is also applied to the painted or written catalogues in the romish churches

troublesome to the church the other was one of the seven jewish sects before the coming of jesus christ mass the romanists understand by this word the office or prayers used at the celebration of the eucharist or in other words the consecrating the bread and wine into the body and blood of christ and offering them so transubstantiated as an expiatory sacrifice for the quick and the dead massalians certain sectaries so called from a hebrew word signifying prayer it being their distinguishing tenet that a man is to pray without ceasing in the literal ense of the words and that this was all that was necessary to salvation many monks who loved a life of laziness joined the massalians but they were soon made ashamed or weary of this kind and degree of devotion so inconsistent with the state and

sometimes called theodosians melchites a religious sect in the levant and syria who scarce differ from the greek church either in faith or practice they deny purgatory the primacy of the pope admit the arabic canons as of equal validity with those of the romish church but are equally superstitious with them mendicants beggars there are four principal orders of friars mendicant viz the carmelites jacobines franciscans and augustines among them are also ranked the capuchins recollects minims and others who are branches of the former mennonites a sect of christians in the united provinces that first appeared about the year      they held that there is no original sin that in speaking of the father son and holy ghost we must not use the word person nor that of trinity that jesus christ did not take his flesh from the substance of his mother but that he brought it from heaven and that the union of the divine and human nature was so effected that he was capable of dying or suffering in his divine as well as human nature they forbid all kind of swearing deny that magistrates ought to use the sword though for punishment of crimes disallow of war forbid ministers of the gospel preaching for hire refuse the baptism of infants and believe the souls of good men are reserved in some unknown place to the day of judgment there are two sorts of them viz those of friezeland and those of flanders the latter are most strict in their church discipline both recommend toleration in religion and will receive all denominations of christians to their communion provided they be of good morals and believe the scriptures to be the word of god however divided they may be with respect to articles of faith metempsychi ancient heretics who in imitation of pythagoras held the metempsychosis or transmigration of souls millenarians a sect of christians in the first century who believed that the saints shall reign with christ on earth a thousand years this opinion was indeed embraced as a principle of faith by many other sectaries as the cerinthians the marcienites the montanists the melceians and the apollinarians and by several ecclesiastical writers and even martyrs as papias justin irenaeus nepos victorinus lactantius and sulpitius severus they held that after the coming of antichrist and the destruction of all nations which shall follow there shall be a first resurrection but of the just only that all who shall be found upon the earth both good and bad shall continue alive the good to obey the just who are risen as their princes the bad to be conquered and

patriarchs and prophets or by the appearance of god thereon upon these eminences the superstitious israelites often adored idols and committed a thousand abominations in groves and caves this inflamed the zeal of several pious kings and prophets to suppress and destroy the high places but there was another reason why it was not lawful to worship even the true god on these hills namely because the temple being built and the place prepared for the fixed settlement of the ark it was no longer allowed to sacrifice out of jerusalem these high places and the idolatrous worship paid thereon were not wholly destroyed till the reign of josiah who broke in pieces the images cut down the groves and filled the places with the bones of men thus rooting out all the remains of idolatry after it had been

made a great noise toward the close of the last century the name is taken from a sort of aboute rest and inaction which the soul is supposed to be in when arrived at the state of perfection which in their language is called the unitive life to arrive at this a man is first to pass through the purgative way that is through a course of obedience inspired by the fear of hell hence he is to proceed into the illuminative way before he arrives at perfection to go through combats and violent pains i e not only the usual drinesses of the soul and the common privations of grace but infernal pains he believes himself damned and the persuasion that he is so continues upon him very strongly several years st francis de salis say the quietists was so fully convinced thereof that he would not allow any body to convince him therein but the man is at length sufficiently paid for all this by the embraces of god and his own deification the sentiments of the quietists with regard to god are wonderfully pure and disinterested they love him for himself on account of his own perfections independantly of any rewards and punishments the soul acquiesces in the will of god even at the time when he precipitates it into hell insomuch that instead of stopping him upon this occasion b angelo de foligny cried out haste lord to cast me into hell do not delay if thou have abandoned me but finish my destruction and cast me into the abyss at length the soul after long travel enters into rest into a perfect quietude here it is wholly employed in contemplating its god it acts no more thinks no more desires no more but lies perfectly open and at large to receive the grace of god who by means thereof drives it where it will and as it will in this state it no longer needs prayers or hymns or vows prayers where the spirit labors and the mouth opens are the lot of the weak and the imperfect the soul of the saint is as it were laid in the bosom and between the arms of its god where without making any motion or exerting any action it waits and receives the divine grace it then becomes happy quitting the existence it before had it is now changed it is transformed and as it were sunk and swallowed up in the divine being insomuch as not to know or perceive its being distinguished from god himself fenelon maxims des saints quinquagesima sunday shrovesunday so called as being about the

extraordinary gifts to eve for having first caten of the tree of knowledge told mighty things of mary the sister of moses as having been a prophetess etc they added that philip the deacon had four daughters who were all prophetesses and were doubtless of their sect in their assemblies it was usual to see the virgins enter in white robes personating prophetesses the quintilians bore a good deal of resemblance to the modern quakers r raca or racha a syriac term found in the gospel of st matthew chapter v ver    and preserved in most translations father simon observes that the greek translator

founded all the latin copies having raca and all the greek ones  or with hesychius  which is the same thing all i mean but st irenaeus and bezas copy now at cambridge which have  in effect the origin

rather post albis s deosita as some ritualsts call it i e the sunday of putting off the chrysomes because those who were baptized on easter day on this day laid aside the white robe or chrysome which

secret decree   that this term once elapsed he makes them no farther offer of repentance or salvation but takes away from his word all the power it might have to convert them   that pharaoh saul judas

reformers or protestants denominated from their leader uri zuinglius this eminent divine was born at wildehausen in the county of toggenburgh in switzerland in      soon after luther took up arms against rome zuinglius joined him preached openly against indulgences then against the intercession of the saints then against the mass the hierarchy the vows and celebate of the clergy abstinence from flesh etc as to the eucharist interpreting hoc est corpus meum by h significat corpus meum he maintained that the bread and wine were only bare significations or representations of the body and blood of jesus christ but in this he differed from luther who held a consubstantiation in a conference held with the deputies of the bishop of constance in      he procured most of the external ceremonies of religion to be abolished as to matters of grace zuinglius seemed inclined to pelaginism giving all to free will considered as acting by the mere strength of nature in which he differed from calvin conclusion thus having given a full account not only of the pure and undefiled religion instituted by the redeemer of mankind but also of the various sects and parties which have arisen in the christian church from superadding to or abstracting from or erroneously understanding or interpreting the scriptures on the one hand or from superstition or franic enthusiasm on the other many readers before not much versed in se matter may be apt to think lightly of religion itself from the weakness or knavery of its professors and conceive an opinion that scriptures so indeterminate and capable of such various senses are not to e depended upon as the rule of faith and practice and the guide to eternal salvation to such i would address the few following words  amidst the several religious parties in the world there is such a thing as true religion abstracted from the consideration of all those parties and which the sensible and virtuous part of mankind are of consisting in a reverential regard to the supreme being and in seeking by the practice of virtue to secure his approbation in this state and in any future state of existence  the excellent faculties and powers men are endued with the vast improvements they are capable of and the desire if they are virtuous and apprehensions if vicious of an hereafter seem at least to be strong presumptions of such a state and certainly if there may be a future state and much more if it be probable there will we ought to have a regard to it in our actions and conduct in this life in such a state of things where vice and bigotry seem almost to divide the world between them a wise man will take care that he be neither irreligious or profane on the one hand nor a bigot or enthusiast on the other among the several sorts of what are called revelations i am assured you will find the christian to be most agreeable to reason and the nature of things and if rightly understood to be a most perfect representation of all moral virtues i advise you therefore to cultivate a veneration for the writings wherein it is contained and for its divine author difference of style difference of customs and the different tenets of mankind in different ages and countries may as you have seen together with some corruptions and interpolations have occasioned much obscurity to us in several parts of these books but all the rules of a good life and virtuous conduct are sufficiently plain and intelligible public worship if for the good of mankind in general as we know it is ought to be kept up though the manner of it in some religious assemblies may be lame and defective and in others too superstitious i advise you therefore diligently to search the oracles of truth and to work out your salvation with fear and embling from those excellent sources if you inquire with an unprejudiced and candid mind after imploring the divine assistance you will find what you seek you will know and learn to practice your duty toward
