  the perjured husband or the adventures of venice a tragedy as it is acted at the theater royal in drury lane by his majestys servants  written by mrs centlivre  london printed for w feales at rowes head over against st clements church in the strand mdccxxxvii  to his grace wriothesly duke of bedford may it please your grace it is the just prerogative of true greatness to be universally admired by all and one so eminently possessed of it as your grace can no more escape the tribute of our praise and admiration than you can cease to deserve it not that it is in the power of any one or even the applause of multitudes to reach half your merit yet may we be allowed according to the proportion of our poor stock to throw in our mite and not be frightened from the hopes of your graces patronage by considering the unworthiness of the offering for were none but worthy offerings made the gods themselves would lose their sacrifice and they that deserve most our praise should have it least because it is hardest to give them their due  and it is impossible my lord this poem should find sanctuary any where but in the umbrage of your favor for the eyes of all mankind are so fixed upon your grace that twoud be a disappointment to the public to lay at any others door what is so much your duee and though i hit not a wildair for the humor of the town in my play i may boldly say i have copied the greatest part of mankind in the just admiration of your grace  your particular art in appearing free complaisant and conversible without quitting a noble greatness proper to yourself makes us at once approach you with freedom and with awe your goodness that makes you stoop to your inferiors loses nothing by being viewed near at hand but is the more admired for it and thus we consider your grace arrived at the height of greatness without a mortifying reflection on the lowness of our own condition nor does the world envy the truly great who by their goodness and affability make mankind partake of their felicity  i may plead prescription in excuse of this presumption and tell how poets in all ages have pretended a right to lay their works at some noblemans feet but i would rather submit to your graces goodness for if i have offended it is a fault of the best kind and proceeds from too much zeal to let the world know how much i am  my lord your graces most obedient and devoted humble servant susanna centlivre  preface i should not trouble my reader with a preface if mr collier had taught manners to masks sense to beaus and good nature to critics as well as morality to the stage the first are sure to envy what they cannot equal and condemn what they dont understand the beaus usually take a greater liberty with our sex than they would with their own because there is no fear of drawing a duel upon their hands the latter are a sort of rude splenatick men that seldom commend any thing but what they have had a hand in these snarling sparks were pleased to carp at one or two expressions which are spoken in em aside by one of the inferior characters in the drama and without considering the reputation of the persons in whose mouths the language is put condemn it strait for loose and obscure now with submission to better judges i cannot believe that a prayer book should be put into the hands of a woman whose innate virtue will not secure her reputation nor is it reasonable to expect a person whose inclinations are always forming projects to the dishonor of her husband should deliver her commands to her confident in the words of a psalm i heartily wish that those that find fault with the liberty of my style would be pleased to set a pattern to the town by retrenching some of their debaucheries for modesty thrives best by example modest language from the truly virtuous is expected i mean such as will neither act ill nor suffer ill to be acted it is not enough that lucy says she is honest in having denied the brutal part who ever thinks virtue centers in that has a wrong notion of it no virtue is a tender plant which cannot live in tainted ground virtue is what the air of flattery cannot blast nor the vile sordid dross of gain poison and she that can withstand these two shocks may be styled truly virtuous i ask my readers pardon for my bluntness but i hope none of my sex so qualified will condemn me for exposing the vices of the seeming religious  i fear there are but too many hit by the character of signora pizalta i wish for the sake of the reverse party there were fewer or they better known since the malicious world are so apt to judge of peoples inclinations by the company they keep which is sometimes authentic but not always an infallible rule i shall say little in justification of the play only desire the reader to judge impartially and not condemn it by the shortness of its life since the season of the year never promised much better success it went off with general applause and it is the opinion of some of our best judges that it only wanted the addition of good actors and a full town to have brought me a sixth night there having been worse plays within this twelvemonth approved of  the prologue by a gentleman spoken by mrs oldfield such dreadful laws of late against wit are made it dares not in the city show its head no place is safe each cuckold turns informer if we make merry  it must be in a corner and here is tonight what doubly makes it sweet a private table and a ladys treat at her reflections none can be uneasy when the kind creature does her best to please ye humbly she sues and it is not for your glory tinsult a lady  when she falls before ye but since no human wit can stand the test with gorman and the champion of the west she will fill the lists and then you cannot slight her with honor safe for she is a fair inviter expects no favor but at honors call defies the boldest briton of you all whateers her fate she is sure to gain the field for women always conquer when they yield the epilogue by mr b  spoken by mr jo haines too long the poets brought before the bar have with their bold accuser waged the war they now plead guilty and confess the stage has been immoral and debauched the age nay they will mend  but wish that in their station all men were pleased to forward reformation first let no politicians with vain fears about suceeeding kings create new jars let lawyers now no more perplex the laws nor with malicious quibbles split a cause let magistrates consider it is but fitting that as they take down bills they would put down cheating let our young heroes who would be commanders brag less over coffee and fight more in flanders let cheapside doctors in a frantic fit no more make impious war with sacred wit let city wives but that is too hard a task mimick no more townladies in a mask nor from their prentices the favor ask let no old castoff miss assume the saint let cowards cease to huff and beaus to paint let at yond corner house the wits and bards gain by religion what they lose at cards let snarling peevish critics cease to bite or in a false sublime dull plays to write let galleries no more for judges sit but leave to the

sir draw   bass this action speaks you noble  be likewise just and let me know the cause that moves your anger by heaven i would rather call you still my friend than be your enemy  yet if i wronged you i will give you satisfaction   alon trifler away  too well thou know the cause and now would sooth my wrongs with flattery but my resolve is fixed as heavens decrees and one of us must fall  let the surviver dispose of that base false perjured aurelia as both his love and honor shall direct if my propitious stars defend my life you shall not die alone  the adulterous fair shall bear you company  now draw  bass oh hold one moment hold i must unfold this riddle adulterous fair say you  alon yes she is my wife  bass ha  your wife sure there is a curse entailed upon that name aside what your real wife  alon if the command of an expiring father and her own vows can make her mine she is so indeed the marriage rites are yet to come which slily she delayed these two months past on slight pretense of finishing the time of mourning for her father  but it is plain i was a property to your base love and only designed to fill up your place when surfeited you should return to turin hell  furies draw or in my just revenge i will pin you to the earth   bass oh woman woman aside yes i will draw  but ere the fatal stroke is past recall i swear aurelias virtue is clear and spotless like dianas self nor was i prompted on this early visit but with design to take my last farewell having last night received my princes orders to haste to turin  therefore if i fall i hope she will meet with mercy  now come on  alon hold hold my lord oh could i credit this i would ask pardon and entreat your friendship  bass it is true upon my honor  but if you doubt my words i am ready  though i have reason to decline this combat at least at present  oh placentia aside oh my placentia why should i abuse thee  alon my lord you seem disturbed   bass oh alonzo alonzo should i acquaint you with my wretched fate you would find that life itself is grown a burden i cannot bear since i can never be happy but it is a story that must never be told let it suffice to settle your repose that turin holds the cause of my misfortunes  alon then i am happy aside my lord i wish twere in my power to serve you i would do it as a friend   bass generous sir i thank you as far as i am capable i am alonzos exit alonzo oh force of treacherous love to gain my end i wrong a wife a mistress and a friend ex bassino the end of the second act act iii scene i aurelia s lodgings enter aurelia florella aur oh how i tremble for my dear bassino haste fly florella brings me news he lives or else expect to see thy mistress die  flor madam be patient  consult your reputation and consider that the least noise you make on this occasion reflects upon your virtue   aur away away  talk not of reputation when loves in the other scale  but what can shock my reputation heavens my witness i never lodged a thought for count bassino that could wrong my virtue perhaps the gods pursue me with their hatred because i break my promise to alonzo but then why did they not secure me his why must weak mortals be exposed to passions which are not in our power to subdue and yet account for what they prompt us to but i will think no more  almighty love now hear my last resolve  if angry heaven refused to guard my dear bassinos life aurelia too shall fall and leave his murderer accursed for ever   enter alonzo flor oh heaven where will this end  aur ha  aside the gods have sent him to decide my fate how now how dare you meet my angry view or think i will ever forgive the base affront this very day you offered to my fame  aur just heaven refuses not a penitent therefore i cannot think that fair aurelia whose charms are all divine should sail in goodness oh let my love atone for my rash deed the count and i are friends why should aurelia be more severe  aur he lives blessed news do then rash actions speak your love to me must i in public bear with your insults before i am yours what must i then expect when the strict ties of marriage shall confirm your jealous passions no you have taught me to avoid the shelf i was just running on  know base alonzo that from this moment i resume my freedom i disingage you from your former vows and will henceforth be mistress of myself  alon ha  aside this sudden coldness has another spring than my rash carriage  oh my jealous fears but i am resolved to trace her winding thoughts and fetch the secret forth  madam i hope you do but try my love i cannot think aurelia would be false besides you cannot recall what is registered in heaven  aur then stay till we come there  there you will have witness  alon witness oh faithless perjured woman can thou think upon thyself and bid me call my witness yes you are mine  by all the gods you are and shall there be a power on this side heaven to stop my bliss no  by my love i swear i now can guess at your perfidious meaning and though that cowardly villain slily thought to blind me with a tale his guilt had framed it is plain he is your minion  yet wants courage to own his treachery  aur detracting slanderous villain how dare you treat me thus oh for the look of a fierce basilisk to punish this audacious insolence  alon marry thee no  by heavens i had rather be racktd to death  and for thy vile injustice none shall enjoy thee while this sword is mine lays hold on his sword nor shall your lover escape to serve your lust till he has forced a passage through this breast points to his breast  aur oh my bassino aside oh cruel man are not you then contented to wreak your spite on poor aurelia why must your rage involve the innocent oh let me fall your passions sacrifice let my blood wash the stain you fix on me but do not blast your name with base revenge   alon by heaven she dotes on him oh cunning woman but this pretense will not serve to save his life i will not be caught again  no siren no bassino dies  nor will i leave to fortune the vengeful stroke but take a safer way  aur oh heaven kneels what words shall i invent to sooth his rage aside and save my dear bassino oh alonzo my oncelovd dear will you not here me speak oh i conjure you by our plighted loves whose purity outshone the stars above hear me this time then use me as you please  alon oh woman woman  aur if ever aurelia so much as in her thoughts did wrong alonzo may sudden death pursue her perjured steps heaven forgive aside the purjury since i have no other way to save bassinos life   alon aurelia rise  raising her oh could i credit this how happy were alonzo but something tells me that thou art forsworn and yet thou seem as fair as truth itself how is it possible that guilt can look with so a divine a face  aur oh kill me instantly kill me i beg you kill me let me not linger out an age in pain for such is every moment of your anger i cannot bear to live in your displeasure  alon by heaven she is true  hence frivolous fears be gone  she is only mine come to my breast my bright aurelia come embraces her to that soft shrine that holds that sacred image which triumphs over my soul and grasps it all i knew my boundless treasure and the thought of losing thee had raised my love to madness but now i am calm  no more shall that fierce passion rude jealousy disturb my peaceful mind do but forgive the faults my rage committed and you will find our loves will grow the purer just as the sky looks brighter when the storm is chased away and phoebus smiles again  aur since both have been to blame let it suffice we both repent and will offend no more  alon oh never never i will never suspect you more  only resolve me this   aur what is it  alon why was bassino admitted to your view and i denied  aur he came to take his leave and t had been rude not to admit a man of his high birth on this occasion nor was you denied but through by womans fears of your suspicions she thought you would misconstrue the counts visit as you have really done  i blamed her for it indeed this is the truth  i hope alonzo believes me now   alon believe thee yes  as willingly as martyrs a state of endless joy i will so love my dear that all mankind shall look with envy on our mutual bliss i am like a merchant tossed at sea by storms who his last course with prayers and toil performs and the rich cargo safely brought on shore he hugs it thus and vows to part no more embraces her  aur  aside so in a flowery mead a serpent lurks and the unwary traveller surprises where he suspects least danger cursed cheat aside oh that i could disclose the fatal story but it must never out  i beg alonzo you would leave me for a while and rest secure you have my love   alon then the bright sun in all his circling turn cannot behold a man more truly happy what you command i readily obey farewell my dear  exit alonzo aur where art thou now aurelia how will thou escape that dreadful precipice on which thou art hurried on by thy fatal passion with conscious horror i deceived alonzo i hate this base treachery but twas unavoidable the truth had been more fatal  more fatal  no  for i must never wed my dear bassino whilst alonzo lives oh the distracting thought what shall i do why die aurelia that is the only way to keep thy vows to both  ha  die said i but whether then who knows what punishment just heaven prepares for guilty souls like mine but i must think no more lest i grow mad with thought if there is a power that guards us here below oh look with pitying eyes on poor aurelia appease the tumults of my anxious fear and load me with no more than i can bear  exeunt aurelia florella scene ii lady pizalta s lodgings l piz well you are an admirable girl what would half the ladies in venice
