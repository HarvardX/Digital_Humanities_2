dedication kindly vouchsafed to recommend her warmest patron ablest friend who with more skill than warwick lane pale spleen can cure in thcomic vein then sir receive this hasty birth a slight attempt at harmless mirth which dares not hope much critic praise conceived and born within eight days your smiles much credit must reflect on him who signs with just respect the author  scrubs trip to the jubilee spoken by mr weston from stratford arrived  piping hot  gentle folks from the rarest fine shows and most wonderful jokes your simple acquaintance scrub comes to declare twas fuller by far than our litchfield great fair such crowds of fine ladies serenading and singing such firing of loud pateraroes and ringing to tell it in london must seem all a fable and yet i will tell it as well as i am able first something in linguo of schools called an ode all critics they told me allowed very good one said  you may take it for truth i assure ye twas made by the little great man of old drury by my brother martin  for whose sake do you hear this night i would a mind for a touch at shakespeare this alludes to mr westons intention of playing richard  but honestly speaking i take more delight in a bit of good fun than drums trumpets and fighting the procession twas said would have been a fine train but could not move forwards  oh la for the rain such tragical comical folks and so fine  what pity it was that the sun did not shine since ladies and baronets aldermen squires all went to this jubilee full of desires in crowds as they go for to see a new play and when it was done  why they all came away dont let me forget  a main part of the show was long tailed fine comets by famed angelo some turtle i got which they called pashapee  but honest roast beefs the best turtle for me i hate all ragouts and like a bold briton prefer good plumb pudding to ought i ever bit on i drank too  and now i a poet may be  from a charming fine cup of the mulberry tree to bed i must go  for which like a ninny i paid  like my betters  no less than a guinea for rolling  not sleeping  in linen so damp as struck my great toe ever since with the cramp thus fleeced  in my pocket i felt a great smarting yet grieved not when i and the splinters were parting twas worth ten times more to hear sweet brother martin he spoke till poor scrub was just fit with one eye to laugh while the other was ready to cry which makes me now tell you without any brag he is second to none but the warwickshire wag the jubilee over i come to this place to tell you my story and sue for your grace you never refused it  yet never before with granting such kindness bound gratitude more i love but to own with a diligent spirit your favors have ever outrun my slight merit the reader will easily perceive that this prologue is merely occasional  to the public the author thinks it incumbent upon him to observe that the following occasional piece was imagined and put into its present state within the space of a very few days and has some reason to believe that it would have been presented at the theater royal in the haymarket if the thought had been suggested in time for mr footes season some kind and perhaps partial friends having urged the publication it thus steps into life with many imperfections on its head yet not the author flatters himself without some degree of merit to apologize for submitting it to public perusal  dramatis personae men lord spangle sir john hearty sir charles planwell scrapeall captain blarney pasquin toby dumplin sleekem longcork women lady shanker mrs dumplin emmeline jackonet

country corporation  no no gentlemen all the world will be here   sir john the devil it will   long true upon my honor  i will engage you might fire cannon from the royal exchange to st jamess to

best part of london  a very fine thing indeed if east india stock south sea three per cents consols and lottery tickets were left for jubilee which as i have heard is a rank piece of popery sir john   sir john popery adso if that is the case it is time for me to look about  i will call a bench upon it  i will  but i am not of the peace for this county however at our quarter sessions i can move for a petition against such things   long lackaday gentlemen you need not be so angry  do you think if there was any religion in the matter so many persons of fashion and quality would be concerned with

to the market old dowagers also repair with borrowed complexions teeth eyebrows and hair each wooes with her purse for better for worse the female that is wealthy must surely be fair kept mistresses

apes haste hither to show their fine clothes and fine shapes they know shakespeares name and have heard of his fame though his merit their shallow conception escapes some authors some critics some actors advance gay fiddlers of rome and trim barbers of france lords ladies and squires confess strong desires to join the gay round of our jubilee dance would any one miss then this great jubilee where so much you may hear and so much you may see since in approbation the wise corporation will give each a slip of the mulberry tree  scrapeall a mighty hopeful description i must confess   sir john ay ay the songs well enough but there is a blind fiddler that plays at my house who sings three times as loud he rattles away old roger the hunting of the fox bumper squire jones and roast beef till he makes my great hall ring again  body of me it would do any body good to hear him   scrapeall ah sir john there is nothing better than old songs  but old gold   sir john well friend you must order us a couple of beds with well aired sheets and well think of somewhat for supper presently   longcork supper you may have gentlemen from five shillings to five guineas but as to a bed in this house you could not have one for any sum   sir john not a bed  how so fellow   long lord sir they have been all bespoke these sixweeks would you believe it lord blazingstar has engaged the roost of

deals in lottery tickets and if i meet with a chap it shall go hard if i do not tickle his soft side out of as much as will pay our thievish expenses   sir john well said old twoandgothree in the mean

have been serviceable in the affairs of love and may be so again  any of the game expected here   long great plenty my lord of practiced ladies for country gentlemen and i make no doubt but there will be rare poaching for experienced sportsmen among unflushd game we shipped off from bowstreet and the garden three wagon loads last week  fortyfive as we call bet tawdry is to pass here for a baronets daughter  sall bottlenose for a young clergymans widow suky trapes for a country girl and peggy nimwell all your lordships acquaintances  for an east india captains lady   l spangle excellent  the game hunted down by us gallants of fashion do well enough for mistresses or even wives for fellows in this part of the world but have you fixed your eye on nothing fresh yet longcork no soft blooming languishing fair on whom a few soft words a few promises with a silk gown or two could prevail point out such a one and ten goldfinches in one cage shall chirp a most engaging piece of music to reward

nobility that a peer can not debauch his neighbors wife or daughter with any safety and hypocrisy is become almost as essential to us as to a moorfields preacher   long insolent villains their pens

time i will recommend thee to a snug place in the customs  men of merit should be rewarded   long i thank your lordship but i would not give up my present perquisites to be any thing under a comptroller besides i can only just scrawl my name   l spangle that is hard  then thou art fit for nothing but a commissioner  hey day either my glass deceives me or that spirited fairone lady spanker approaches  it is see faith  enter lady spanker what no people of fashion yet  no real jubilee  oh my lord spangle your presence has relieved me from the deplorable apprehensions that i was the only person of condition arrived   l spangle your ladyships most obedient stratford has on shakespeares account been always admitted the region of poetry bur enlightened by lady spankers presence it shines forth the hemisphere of beauty   l spanker politely flattering i confess my lord bur perhaps at present i am flushed with a little accidental beauty for about half an hour since as i was driving my phaeton and four at the rate of fourteen miles an hour an odious chimney sweepers savage ass set up his horrid bray started my cream colors turned them out of the road and tipped me headforemost into a ditch   l spang alarming chance both the two legged and the four legged ass should have been sacrificed to your hardships perilous situation i am determined to bring in an act next sessions to prevent any such animals from appearing by daylight   l spank why indeed my lord it is a pity that creatures who have no adequate idea of quality should exist at all  i will request my uncle sir toby hubblebubble to support your patriotic motion  has your lordship any thing at newmarket for the next meeting   l spang nothing madam  my roan by regulus broke down in a trial sweat last week and must forfeit two hundred  my gray filly has put out a spavin and my bay by sampson has slipped a shoulder   l spank quite unfortunate i am matched against captain clumsy a three mile heat which i expect to win hollow for you know he rides like a woolpack   l spang true madam  ha ha ha   l spank i have a match depending also with lord scapegrace for five hundred a side on leaping five barred gates  bets run pretty even   l spang i will back your ladyship in both  six to four for any sum   l spank that is encouragement however  and i have been in close training these six weeks  do not you think my lord the sampsons have shown more bottom than foot of late  little gimcrack he is the star of the turf i would freely give two thousand for him then as a groom there is singleton beats the globe i hope when he dies for he must fall as well as alexander marlborough and other great men i hope there will be a jubilee of commemoration appointed for him at newmarket  i am sure he deserves it much better than the old musty scribbler shakespeare so fine a finger so steady a hand so firm a seat in short he rides so well that if the fellow had but genteel blood in his veins i think no lady could refuse him for a husband   l spang your ladyships approbation does his merit singular honor and the preference given against shakespeare is most happily judicious no critic of any delicacy can bear the fellows hum drum pieces now   l spank quite intolerable  though if some of them were turned into singing affairs they might be endured well enough the opera of hamlet the opera of othello the opera of richard in short the opera of ever thing to banish that antiquated barbarous word tragedy  but my lord have you fixed upon your character for the masquerade yet   l spang not yet madam if your ladyship as in real life will personate venus i must consequently attempt the character of adonis   l spank infinitely polite but my choice rather bends to the queen of the amazons   l spang then madam you will metamorphose me into alexander who was her admirer   l spank well since i find there is no escape from your excessive gallantry it shall be so  that valuable creature mr pasquin the habitman from tavistockstreet is to be here with at infinite variety if it is agreeable to your lordship we will have a view   l spang it is happiness to attend lady spanker any where   l spank then we will step first to the stable give some directions about my cream colors and proceed immediately exeunt   enter emmeline and jackonet emmel well i vow jackonet this flying from place to place is pure what would my old papa say now if he knew that i was come to the jubilee   jack say why the same that all such old cuffs as he would say upon the same occasion that you was a wild madheaded girl that you was a flaunting baggage that you did not know the pains required to get money nor the value of it when got that your head runs upon whirligigs and that you think of nothing but plays assemblies fine clothes and fine sweethearts   emmel ha ha ha well i vow you take him off to a hair if it was not for my aunt fiddlededee i should have known no circumstance of polite life i should have been fit for nothing but mending stockings and making pies if it was not for her i should not have you to wait on me jackonet  he would have brought me up just such an unfashionable creature as himself but nature has given me spirit and my aunt has given me taste so i am resolved not to be shut up in the horrid smoke of watling street any longer   jack you are perfectly in the right of it madam get yourself tranlplanted to grosvenor berkley or cavendish square as soon as possible set up a visavis bespeak an elegant sedan of four hundred guineas price hire two of the handsomest chairmen and six of the genteelest footmen than can be found with every other article of a grand household keep visiting days routs etc and shine forth an ornament of the gay world   emmel ravishing picture  what an unreasonable mortal is this papa of mine to think i would give up such a round of delights for that hateful creature omnium the change broker and his country house at islington did i ever sing you a song i made upon being plagued to have him jackonet   jack not that i recollect madam   emmel then you shall have it  song how cruel papa to insist upon that which nature must always deny how can you resist a denial so flat before you shall force me i will die it is base in the tongue to proclaim a fair show when filled with abhorrence the heart cries out no love only shall ever dispose of my hand love only shall make me a wife no parent has justly a right to command to command away comfort for life my tongue then shall never proclaim a fair show when filled with abhorrence my heart cries out no  jack a good resolution and well expressed madam i recollect a short ballad much to the same purpose i will endeavor to give it you as well as i can   emmel i long to hear it of all things   jackonet song the subject of marriage so often meets miscarriage it is ticklish for maidens to try gallants in this matter so often lie and flatter we scarce can tell how to comply since seeking a blessing we often meet a curse when blushing we answer for better for worse should parents presuming like tyrants assuming unkindly forbid a free choice the girl who has spirit will freedom inherit by listening to natures kind voice if i am to be wretched i will choose my own curse and the man of my heart take for better for worse  emmel admirable jackonet you shall be first lady of my bedchamber and shall have my wedding clothes  sir charles promised to meet me here this evening and when the enchanting jubilee is over we shall fly for scotland immediately   jack a charming convenient country that for matrimonial affairs madam  heigh ho  i wish i was taking a trip there with one i know upon the same occasion  the invitation which carried your father into yorkshire at this critical time was very fortunate   emmel the luckiest thing in the world the very name of a jubilee would have frightened him out of his senses  but jackonet  what would you have me get for the masquerade   jack lard madam there is such a variety that it is almost impossible to advise when i lived with lady bab rattle she employed six hours a day for three months and could scarce fix upon any thing at last  one day she would be a turk the next a christian the third a chinese the fourth a dutch woman next a heathen goddess then a savoyard soon after a gipsy a witch and twenty others  at last she thought of transforming herself into a moving beehive intimating that beauty is pregnant with the stings of love  but alas upon entering the ballroom she saw two other beehives dancing a cotilion with the sun the moon a bear an ostrich hamlets ghost and an animated buttercask  this had such an effect upon her that she retired immediately and almost fretted herself into a consumption   emmel poor lady such terrible shocks must hurt any constitution i have cause enough myself but a good heart and pleasing hopes bear me up  i would have a dress odd and whimsical  i will make a bargain with you jackonet you shall choose for me and i will choose for you   jack as you please madam  bless me yonder is one of sir charless men come post haste into the yard  his master must be near at hand   emmel oh dear i am so tumbled and tossed with the journey  my head is in such terrible disorder  i cannot see sir charles in this pickle positively   jack if you please madam i will call the chambermaid to show a private room and put you to rights in a quarter of an hour you shall look so killingly that the baronets impatience for scotland shall make him think the jubilee seven years long   emmel come then dear jackonet  do make me look very killingly and every silk sack and petticoat i have at present shall be yours when we return from scotland exeunt   end of the first act act the second scene the first sir john heart and scrapeall sir john what no lottery gudgeons in this town   scrapeall no no sir john i could pick up nothing but a premium of ten shillings for number fortyfive  they are all jubilee gudgeons here  when i asked a bookselling fellow who dabbles a little that way whether he wanted any tickets  he answered  shakespeare is to be crowned tomorrow and his wife before i could open my mouth again said there was to be a masquerade tomorrow which everybody would be at  for my part i think they are all shakespearemad and i wish we were fairly out of the town   sir john body of me why so cannot people be merry and wise  for my own part i should like to stay and see the fun  ay and we will old truepenny  when it is over i will take you to such gardens groves and purling streams in yorkshire as shall make you young again   scrapeall with your leave sir john i had rather go back to london  pray where can you find a garden of equal value to that of covent garden  where can you match the golden grove of lombard street  where meet more delightful retreats than the arbours of the alley  where more comfortable walks than those of the exchange or a stream equal to the thames between bridge and deptford besides i am very uneasy about my girl she is at the ticklish age of nineteen has twenty thousand pounds at her own disposal when of age besides the inheritance of all my estate   sir john what then friend touch and take ten to one do all you can she will please herself at last and throw herself away upon some povertystruck lord who being out at the elbows will marry her money to mend bad circumstances then keep a mistress to please his inclinations   scrapeall i am no friend to popery yet i wish we had nunneries amongst us to lock up headstrong young hussies  ah why had not i a son by this time he might have been thoroughly educated in those schools of useful knowledge lloyds and jonathans  i might have lived to see him double my fortune   sir john why then old boy since you cannot be sure who will get it or how it may go take my advice and regale yourself with a little of it before you are shipped off for the other world  now i am here i am resolved to see what sort of an affair this jubilee is  though i suppose it will not be half so good as a country feast or a fox chase   scrapeall no nor half so fine as my lord mayors show which may be seen for nothing into the bargain   sir john nothing prithee dont grumble so in the gizzard  it is my humor to see what all this bustles about and if you will promise to throw off your melancholy face body of me i will bring you off scot free  i will pay for both i have three hundred pounds a quarter and dont wish to save a shilling of it   scrapeall as you please sir john  what a prodigal old fool it is aside   sir john besides man i never saw a coronation in my life and for aught i know the crowning of king shakespeare may be as pretty a piece of diversion as the crowning of any other king  so brush up your phiz and well sally forth to see what is stirring   scrapeall i follow sir john  i wish i knew how east india stock was done today and what news there is from the nabobs exeunt   scene ii a masquerade shop pasquin and sleekem pasquin well if every freedom presented in a mulberrybox was to produce a masquerade i could wish all the authors actors and critics in england were made burgesses of stratford  i shall love the name of shakespeare as long as i live what a delightful bustle does this jubilee make so many country squires and their ladies who know nothing of the matter apply for dresses that we can fleece them genteelly  but what of that they in return will rack their tenants and the tenants consequently raise provisions so that upon the whole nobody is affected but the low mechanical vulgar whom nature has formed as mere necessary utensils for the sport and profit of us in polite spheres of life   sleekem why sir this promises fair to beat the royal masquerade   pasquin most certainly  we had too many of the knowing ones there  here we shall have wellfledged tame pigeons to pluck in plenty  let me hear how articles stand in the memorandumbook for to day   sleekem touchstones dress for alderman numskull   pasquin never were the cap and bells more happily adapted though in choosing the dress his worship observed that as the world thought him a wise man he was for once resolved to look and play the fool  which in reality he does every day of his life   sleekem for mr alderman    pasquin pshaw pshaw skip all the corporation  i furnish them and their wives for nothing which is a little hard but as they have countenanced this polite sheep shearing i must make other people pay for them and the unconscionable long credit expected by most of my quality customers   sleekem lady giggle the habit of a vestal   pasquin a vestal ha ha ha ha  most admirable as numskulls outside will describe exactly what he is  her ladyships garment will show what she absolutely is not  go on   sleekem the vest drawers and axe of an execution for mr whim  the mask to be truly dismal   pasquin how what an executioner and an axe  who the devil ever heard of such a character in a masquerade  you might as well introduce a rope at st giless  scratch it out immediately  why it would not only frighten all the ladies but half the noblemen present out of their senses  out with it i will lend no memento mori unless it be hamlets ghost   sleekem nancy pickup from the garden  a nuns dress   pasquin very good the reverse of reality again  a wolf in lambs clothing  this article goes on tick but nancys a girl of honor and will pay well if the bait takes   sleekem mr eitherside a nabobs dress   pasquin what dick eitherside

raise public curiosity so he claims it gratis as a right and says if you dont comply he will anatomize you but if you do he promises to recommend and promote masquerades as much as possible   pasquin well let the poor rascal have his humor this once  what is next   sleekem sir john asiaticus the apparatus of a blind fiddler   pasquin heyday  heyday why this is masquerading with a witness nabob
