a dialogue upon the gardens of the right honorable the lord viscount cobham at stow in buckinghamshire  here order in variety we see where all things differ yet where all agree mr pope london printed for b seeley bookseller in buckingham and sold by j and j rivington in st pauls churchyard  m dcc xlviii  price one shilling  the advertisement we read of a great prince of antiquity who would suffer his portrait to be taken only by the greatest artist and he thought justly without question a great object ought ever to be handled by a great master but yet i am apt to think that if apelles had not offered his service the monarch rather than have had his form unknown to posterity would have been glad to have employed some meaner hand  if stow had been as fortunate in this particular as alexander i need not now have taken up my pencil but as this charming landscape is yet untouched by a titian or a poussin a mere bungler has been tempted to venture upon it  but in excuse for the meanness of the performance it may be said that it is not designed to be considered as a finished piece this view was not taken upon the spot as it ought to have been but only from my memory and a few loose scratches if the public therefore will call it only a rough draught or at best a colored sketch my ambition will be fully satisfied the curious therefore must purchase it rather from their necessity than its merit as they do meaner engravings of the cartoons where dorignys are not to be had it is true gentlemen says the printseller they are far from being good but take my word for it you will meet with no better  a dialogue upon the gardens of the right honorable the lord viscount cobham etc polypthon was a gentleman engaged in a way of life that excused him two months in the year from business which time he used generally to spend in visiting what was curious in the several counties around him as he had long promised his friend callophilus to pass away his vacancy at some time or other in buckinghamshire he determined upon it this year and accordingly paid him a visit at    stow was one of the first places where his curiosity carried him and indeed he had scarce got his foot within the gardendoor before he broke out into the following exclamation  why here is a view that gives me a kind of earnest of what my expectation is raised to  it is a very fine one indeed replied callophilus i do not wonder it should catch your sight the old ruin upon the left of the canal the opening to the pyramid the view toward the house the river the beautiful disposition of the trees on the other side of it and that venerable old temple make a fine variety of objects but your eye is so taken up with views at a distance that you neglect something here at hand very well worth your notice what do you think of these two pavilions  polypth why really they are light genteel buildings enough i like these rough paintings too they are done in a very free masterly manner pray sir do you know the stories   calloph they are both taken from pastor fido the disconsolate nymph there poor dorinda had long been in love with sylvio a wild hunter of barbarous manners in whose breast she had no reason to believe she had raised an answering passion as she was roving in the woods she accidentally met his dog and saw her beloved hunter himself at a distance hollowing and running after it she immediately calls the hound to her and hides it amongst the bushes sylvio comes up to her and enquires very eagerly after his dog the poor nymph puts him off and tries all her art to inspire him with love but to no purpose the cold youth was quite insensible and his thoughts could admit no other object but his dog almost despairing she at length hopes to bribe his affections and lets him know she has his dog which she will return if he will promise to love her and give her a kiss sylvio is overjoyed at the proposal and promises to give her ten thousand kisses dorinda upon this brings the dog but alas see there the success of all her pains the youth transported at the sight of his dog throws his arms round its neck and lavishes upon it those kisses and endearments in the very sight of the poor afflicted lady which she had been flattering herself would have fallen to her share  on this other wall disdain and love have taken different sides the youth is warm and the nymph is coy poor myrtillo had long loved amarillis the lady was engaged to another and rejected his passion gladly would he only have spoke his grief but the cruel fair one absolutely forbid him her presence at length a scheme was laid by corisca the young lovers confidant which was to gain him admission into his dear amarilliss company the lady is enticed into the fields with some of coriscas companions who were let into the plot to play at blindmans buff where myrtillo was to surprise her see there he stands hesitating what use to make of so favorable an opportunity which love has put into his hands  if you have satisfied your curiosity here let us walk toward the temple of venus but hold we had better first go down toward that wilderness and take a view of the lake   polypth upon my word here is a noble piece of water   calloph not many years ago i remember it only a marsh it surprised me prodigiously when i first saw it floated in this manner with a lake observe pray what a fine effect that old ruin has at the head of it its ornaments too the cascade the trees and shrubs half concealing and half discovering the ragged view and the obelisk rising beyond it are objects happily disposed   polypth yes indeed i think the ruin a great addition to the beauty of the lake there is something so vastly picturesque and pleasing to the imagination in such objects that they are a great addition to every landscape and yet perhaps it would be hard to assign a reason why we are more taken with prospects of this ruinous kind than with views of plenty and prosperity in their greatest perfection benevolence and goodnature methinks are more concerning in the latter kind   calloph yes but cannot you make a distinction between natural and moral beauties our social affections undoubtedly find their enjoyment the most complete when they contemplate a country smiling in the midst of plenty where houses are well built plantations regular and every thing the most commodious and useful but such regularity and exactness excites no manner of pleasure in the imagination unless they are made use of to contrast with something of an opposite kind the fancy is struck by nature alone and if art does any thing more than improve her we think she grows impertinent and wish she had left off a little sooner thus a regular building perhaps gives us very little pleasure and yet a fine rock beautifully set off in claroobscuro and garnished with flourishing bushes ivy and dead branches may afford us a great deal and a ragged ruin with venerable old oaks and pines nodding over it may perhaps please the fancy yet more than either of the other two objects  you old hermitage situated in the midst of this delightful wilderness has an exceeding good effect it is of the romantic kind and beauties of this sort where a probable nature is not exceeded are generally pleasing  this opening will lead us again into the terrace  that large bulding the inscription lets you see is a temple dedicated to venus   polypth upon my word a master has been at work here i cannot say i have met with any modern touching this long time that has pleased me better i see very little to be cavilled at with regard either to the design coloring or drawing these stories are taken from the fairyqueen i dare say they look like spencers ideas   calloph yes that lady is the fair hellinore who having left a disagreeable husband and wandering in the woods was met by the polite set of gentry she is dancing with she likes their manner of life and resolves to enjoy it with them her old spouse malbecco is inconsolable for his loss he wanders many days in search of her and at length finds her you see him at a distance peeping from behind a tree revelling with a beastly herd of satyrs when the evening comes on he follows the company to their retirement takes a commodious stand and to his great torment sees every thing that passes among them after they were all laid asleep he creeps gently to his lady and you see him in the other painting offering to be reconciled to her again if she will return back with him but hellinore threatens to awake the satyrs and get him severely handled if he does not immediately leave her upon which the poor cuckold is obliged to fly and soon after runs distracted   polypth this loose story these luxurious couches and the embellishments round the walls give the place quite a cyprian air and make it a very proper retreat for its incontinent inhabitant upon the roof  but let us move forward toward yon cubico pyramidical building it looks like a mighty substantial one i fancy it is sir johns he is generally pretty liberal of his stone however it terminates this terrace extremely well the ascent up to it too has a good effect  pray do you know what that field there upon the right is to be improved into   calloph i am surprised the beauty of it in its present form does not strike you at first sight it is designed like a glass of bitters before dinner to quicken your appetite for the elegant entertainment that is to follow for my part i assure you i find it a very great relief to my eye to take it from these grand objects and cast it for a few minutes upon such a rural scene as this do not you think that haycock contrasts extremely well with this temple such oppositions in my opinion are highly pleasing  that building there is called the belvidere whatever you may think of it from this stand it has its use i assure you in several prospects in the gardens  there is a very good copy of the roman boxers   polypth i like its situation extremely it terminates these alleys and that opening from the terrace very beautifully much better i think than the fighting gladiator and sampson killing the philistine do that other vast terrace the objects there in my opinion are too small for the distance here both are justly proportioned   calloph your criticism i think is rather too refined i cannot see what occasion there is always for a confined view a more open one sometimes makes variety   polypth you mistake me i am not against a prospects being bounded even by the blue hills in the country all i mean is this that where objects are set up to terminate a view they ought to be of such a nature as to afford pleasure at any distance they are designed to be viewed from these statues i have been mentioning are objects so small that at one end of the terrace it is impossible to make out what is offered you at the other  i have too much envy in my temper you must know to bear to see any thing perfect and i came in here fully determined to cavil if i saw the least grounds but this is a sad place i find for a malicious spirit to enter he whose chief entertainment is finding fault will here meet with a very slender repast as the devil did at sight of the creation in spite of envy he must cry out terrestrial heaven  with what delight could i have walked thee round if i could joy in ought sweet interchange of hill and valley rivers woods and plains now land now sea and shores with forest crowned rocks dens and caves  but what have we got here   calloph this is the building we took notice of from the temple of venus i know you are no friend to a clothed statue so i question whether you will meet with any thing here to your taste   polypth there is something extremely grand and noble i have always thought in several of the old clothed statues and particularly in some of the roman consular ones yet i must confess i am always better pleased when i find them without their finery marble though admirably fitted to express the roundness of a muscle very often fails when it attempts to give you the folds of drapery the ancients it must be owned even in their draperies are often successful but amongst our modern attempts in this way how many horrid pieces of rockwork have i beheld   atram desinet in rupem mulier  michael angelo whenever he found himself obliged to cloth his statues used to do it with wet linen which is unquestionably the most advantageous kind of clothing for a statue   calloph since you are not to be pleased here let us pass on to something else there is no occasion to turn down to that pyramid it is an object not designed to be viewed at a yards distance but you will see its use by and by in a variety of beautiful views let us pursue our walk along this terrace   polypth why here we entirely lose sight of the garden our elegant prospects are all vanished i cannot conceive what this impertinent hedge does here   calloph did you never experience in a concert vast pleasure when the whole band for a few moments made a full pause the case is parallel you have already had a great many fine views and that you may not be cloyed this hedge steps in to keep your attention awake one extreme recommends another the moralists observe that a little adversity quickens our relish for the enjoyment of life and it is the man of tastes care not to distribute his beauties with too profuse a hand for a reason of the same kind  let not each beauty every where be spied where half the skill is decently to hide but if you must have something to look at the park there upon your left hand affords you some very fine views i like that equestrian statue extremely it is in my opinion a very beautiful circumstance what a number of fine vistas it terminates through the trees varying its appearance in each of them  there you have a charming view struck out toward the temple of ancient virtue   polypth methinks that statue of the faun stands a little aukwardly he might at least i should think have fixed himself in the middle of the semicircle   calloph you do not certainly attend to his use he stands there to receive the eye placed at the other end of that opening  that elegant little building i think they call nelsons scat   polypth the painting is done masterly enough the inscriptions i see explain the designs those boys fixing the trophies are prettily imagined from hence that round building terminates the view extremely well let us walk to it   calloph hold  turn to the right a little we must first pay a visit here to the temple of bacchus   polypth we have had a pretty long walk suppose we sit down here a moment these walls seem to promise us some entertainment   calloph here sir you see represented the triumphs and happiness of drunkenness those musical ladies too are not improper companions to this mirthfullydisposed deity   polypth some of those smaller figures are really done extremely well and those two vases are delightfully touched i cannot say i am so much pleased with the jolly inhabitant even bacchus himself certainly never made so enormous a figure   calloph i am admiring the fine view from hence so great a variety of beautiful objects and all so happily disposed make a most delightful picture dont you think this building too is a very genteel one and is extremely well situated these trees give it an agreeable cool air and make it i think as elegant a retreat for the enjoyment of a summers evening as can well be imagined  but it is mere trifling to sit here let us walk toward the rotunda  this little alley will carry us to didos cave   polypth didos cave why it is built of hewn stone here she is however and her pious companion along with her   calloph those two cupids joining their torches i never see but i admire extremely they are very finely painted   polypth i think they are indeed but let us be a little complaisant and not interrupt these kind lovers too long i want to see this rotunda   calloph there then you have it i hope you cannot complain of an heavy building here i do not know any piece of stonework in the whole garden that shows itself to more advantage than this does or makes a more beautiful figure in a variety of fine views from several parts of the garden several parts of the garden likewise return the compliment by offering a great many very elegant prospects to it there you have an opening laid out with all the decorations of art a spacious theater the area floated by a canal and peopled with swans and wildducks her late majesty is the principal figure in the scene and around her a merry company of nymphs and swains enjoying themselves in the shade   polypth i must confess i cannot very much admire    calloph come none of your cavils  observe how this view is beautifully contrasted by one on the opposite side of a different kind in which we are almost solely obliged to nature you must know i look upon this as a very noble prospect the field is formed by that semicircle of trees into a very grand theater the point of sight is centred in a beautiful manner by the pyramid which appears to great advantage amongst those venerable oaks two or three other buildings half hid amongst the trees come in for their share in the prospect and add much to the beauty of it   polypth i agree with you entirely nor do i think this other view inferior to it that variety of different shades amongst the trees the lake spread so elegantly amongst them and glittering here and there through the bushes with the temple of venus as a termination to the view make up a very beautiful landscape   calloph here is a vista likewise very happily terminated by the canal and the obelisk rising in the midst of it there is another close view likewise toward nelsons seat   polypth upon my word we have a variety of very elegant prospects centred in this point i could sit here very agreeably a little longer   calloph nay if you are inclined to rest come along with me i will carry you to where you may indulge your humor with great propriety deep in the retirement of that wood the god of sleep has reared his habitation where he will afford you every convenience to make a nap agreeable  it comes into my head that i forgot to carry you to a little place which it is hardly worth while to travel back to from this distance it is called st austins cave and answers its title very well it appears quite celllike stands retired and is made of no other materials but roots and moss in the inside a straw couch offers you an hard seat and the walls three humorous inscriptions in monkish verse you may buy them bound up with copies of all the other inscriptions in a sixpenny pamphlet that will be offered us at the inn  there sir is the temple of sleep   polypth why really i must confess ovid himself could scarce have buried the senseless god in an happier retirement this gloomy darkness these easy couches and that excellent epicurean argument above the door would incline me wonderfully to indulge a little if these beautiful ornaments did not keep my attention awake there is wanting too a purling stream to sing a requiem to the senses though the want is in some measure made up by the drowsy lullibies of that murmuring swarm which this shade has invited to wanton beneath it you would laugh at me or i should certainly throw myself down upon one of these couches i am persuaded i should need no opium to close my eyes   calloph i own sleeping is a compliment as much due to this place as admiration and attention are to raphael at hampton court but try if your curiosity cannot keep you awake come leave these drowsy abodes they are infectious like luscious food they will blunt your appetite before the entertainment is half over walk down that alley and pop your head into the first door you come to   polypth what the d  l have we got here what wretched scrawler has been at work upon these walls   calloph i assure you sir i look upon this as a very great masterpiece you must know this house is inhabited by a necromancer and that inscription lets you see the hand that has been employed to paint it the composition drawing and pencilling i can allow you are not the most elegant yet if the design and figures are the artists own i can assure you he has shown excellent humor and an exceeding good invention that consultation is well imagined and so are these witches and wizards their employments likewise their form and attitudes are well varied  but i see this is a scene not suited to your taste our next i hope will please you better   polypth pray what building is that before us i cannot say i dislike the taste it is designed in it seems an antique   calloph it is the temple sir of ancient virtue the place i am now conducting you to you will meet within it a very illustrious assembly of great men the wisest lawgiver the best philosopher the most divine poet and the most able captain that perhaps ever lived   polypth you may possibly sir engage yourself in a dispute by fixing your epithers in such an absolute manner there are so many competitors in each of these ways that although numbers may be called truly eminent it will be a difficult matter to fix preeminence upon any   calloph you will hardly i fancy dissent from me when i introduce you to these great heroes of antiquity there stands lycurgus there socrates there homer and there epaminondas illustrious chiefs who made virtue their only pursuit and the welfare of mankind their only study in whose breasts mean selfinterest had no possession to establish a wellregulated constitution to dictate the soundest morality to place virtue in the most amiable light and bravely to defend a peoples liberty were ends which neither the difficulty in overcoming the prejudices and taming the savage manners of a barbarous state the corruptions of a licentious age and the illusage of an invidious city neither the vast pains of searching into nature and laying up a stock of knowledge sufficient to produce the noblest work of art nor popular tumults at home and the most threatening dangers abroad could ever tempt them to lose sight of or in the least abate that ardency of temper with which they pursued them   polypth a noble panegyric upon my word why sir these great spirits have inspired you with the very soul of oratory however in earnest i confess your encomium is pretty just and i am apt to believe that if any of those worthy gentlemen should take it into his head to walk from his nitch it would puzzle the world to find his equal to fix in his room  that old ruin i suppose is intended to contrast with this new building   calloph yes sir it is intended to contrast with it not only in the landscape but likewise in its name and design walk a little nearer and you will see its intention   polypth i can see nothing here to let me into its design except this old gentleman neither can i find any thing extraordinary in him except that he has met with a fate that he is entirely deserving of which is more than falls to the share of every worthless fellow   calloph have you observed how the statue is decorated   polypth o i see the whole design a very elegant piece of satyr upon my word this pompous edifice is intended i suppose to represent the flourishing condition in which ancient virtue still exists and those poor shattered remains of what has never been very beautiful notwithstanding i see they are placed within a few yards of a parish church are designed to let us see the ruinous state of decayed modern virtue and the moral is that glory founded upon true worth and honor will exist when fame built upon conquest and popular applause will fade away this is really the best thing i have seen i am most prodigiously taken with it   calloph i intend next to carry you to a scene of another kind i am going to show you the grotto a place generally very taking with strangers  i thought that piece of satyr would catch your attention i hope likewise you will be as well pleased here this gate will carry us into the romantic retirement what do you think of this scene   polypth why really sir it is quite a novelty this profusion of mirrors has a very extraordinary effect the place seems divided into a thousand beautiful apartments and appears fifty times as large as it is the prospects without are likewise transferred to the walls within and the sides of the room are elegantly adorned with landskips beyond the pencil of titian with this farther advantage that every view as you change your situation varies itself into another form and presents you with something new   calloph dont you think that serpentine river as it is called is a great addition to the beauty of the place   polypth undoubtedly it is water is of as much use in a landscape as blood is in a body without these two essentials it is impossible there should be life in either one or the other yet methinks it is a prodigious pity that this stagnate pool should not by some magic be metamorphosed into a crystal stream rolling over a bed of pebbles such a quick circulation would give an infinite spirit to the view i could wish his lordship had such a stream at his command he would show it i dare say to the best advantage in its passage through the gardens but we cannot make nature the utmost we can do is to mend her  i have heard a scotch gentleman speak of the river upon which the town of sterling stands which is as remarkable a meander as i have ever heard of from sterling to a little village upon the banks of this river by land it is only four miles and yet if you should follow the course of the water you will find it above twenty  there is an house likewise that stands upon a narrow isthmus of a peninsula formed by this same river which is mighty remarkable the water runs close to both ends of it and yet if you sail from one to the other you will be carried a compass of four miles  such a river winding about this place would make it a paradise indeed  as we are got into the north i must confess i do not know any part of the kingdom that abounds more with elegant natural views our wellcultivated plains as you observed before are certainly not comparable to their rough nature in point of prospect about three years ago i rode the northern circuit the weather was extremely fine and i scarce remember being more agreeably entertained than i was with the several charming views exhibited to me in the northern counties curiosity indeed rather than business carried me down and as i had my time pretty much to myself i spent it in a great measure in hunting after beautiful objects sometimes i found myself hemmed within an amphitheatre of mountains which were variously ornamented some with scattered trees some with tufted wood some with grazing cattle and some with smoking cottages here and there an elegant view likewise was opened into the country  a miles riding perhaps would have carried me to the foot of a steep precipice down which thundered the whole weight of some vast river which was dashed into foam at the bottom by the craggy points of several rising rocks a deep gloom overspread the prospect occasioned by the close wood that hung round it on every side  i could describe to you a variety of other views i met with there if we here wanted entertainment in the way of landscape one however i cannot forbear mentioning and wishing at the same time that his lordship had such materials to work with and it could not be but he would make a most noble picture  the place i have in view is upon the banks of the river eden which is indeed one of the finest rivers i ever saw i scarce know a fitter place for a genius in this way to exert itself in there is the greatest variety of garnished rocks shattered precipices rising hills ornamented with the finest woods through which are opened the most elegant vales that i have ever met with not to mention the most enchanting views up and down the river which winds itself in such a manner as to show its banks to the best advantage which together with very charming prospects into the country terminated by the blue hills at a distance make as fine a piece of nature as perhaps can any where be met with   calloph i admire your taste in landscape extremely you have marked out just such circumstances as would take me most in a view i am i find almost as enthusiastic a lover of nature as you are yet though i can allow her to have an excellent fancy i do not think she has the best judgment though nature is an admirable colourist her composition is very often liable to censure for which reason i am for having her placed under the direction of art and the rule i would go by should be mr popes  treat the goddess like a modest fair not overdress nor leave her wholly bare   suppose therefore we leave your romantic nature and continue our view of her here where she is treated according to this prescription of the poet  that building is called the temple of contemplation those basrelief heads it is adorned with are i assure you extremely good ones   polypth pray sir what kind of a building have we yonder that struck our sight as we crossed that alley   calloph we will walk up to it if you please it is a chinese house   polypth a mighty whimsical appearance it makes truly   calloph in my opinion it is a pretty object enough and varies our view in a very becoming manner its cool stand upon the lake and those canvas windows designed as well to keep out the sun as let in the air give us a good notion of the manner of living in an hot country it is finely painted in the inside will you look into it   polypth finely painted indeed our travelers tell us the chinese are a very ingenious people and that arts and sciences flourish amongst them in great beauty but for my part whenever i see any of their paintings i am apt i must confess in every thing else to call their taste into question it is impossible for one art to be in perfection without introducing the rest they are all links of the same chain if you draw up one you must expect the rest will follow cognoscitur ex socio is an old rule you know in judging of men and i believe it may be applied with as much propriety in judging of arts it is hardly to be imagined that any art perfect in its kind would claim any kindred or even bear to keep company with such a wretched art of painting as prevails amongst the chinese its whole mystery consists in dawbing on glaring colors correctness of drawing beauty of composition and harmony of coloring they seem not to have even the least notion of   calloph i like your reflections extremely we should certainly have some more elegant productions from china if they were able to answer the character i have sometimes heard given of them they have very little of true manly taste i fancy among them their ingenuity lies chiefly in the knickknack way and is i imagine pretty much of the dutch kind  hold sir this way if you please we will walk again toward the river and pursue it to the canal  it is divided you see into three parts one takes its rise from the grotto another from the pebble bridge as it is called which is i think a pretty object and the third issues from a dark wood  there sir let me present you to an illustrious set of your gallant countrymen this place is called the temple of british worthies and is gloriously filled you see with the greatest wits patriots and heroes that are to be met with in our chronicles  unspotted names and memorable long if there be force in virtue or in song does not your pulse beat high while you thus stand before such an awful assembly is not your breast warmed by a variety of grand ideas which this sight must give birth to  there you have a view of the calm philosophers who sought virtue in her retirement and benefited mankind by thought and meditation  some took the human mind for their theme examined the various powers it is endowed with and gave us to know ourselves  others took nature for their subject looked through all her works and enlarged our notions of a god  while others warmed with a generous resentment against vice and folly made morality their care to the cool reasoner serious philosophy without any ornament but truth was recommended to the gayer disposition the moral song was directed and the heart was improved while the fancy was delighted to those who were yet harder to work upon the force of example was made use of folly is put to the test of ridicule and laughed out of countenance while the moral scene like a distorting mirror shows the villain his features in so deformed a manner that he starts at his own image with horror and affright  on the other side you are presented with a view of those illustrious worthies who spent their lives in action who left retirement to the cool philosopher entered into the bustle of mankind and pursued virtue in the dazzling light in which she appears to patriots and heroes inspired by every generous sentiment these gallant spirits founded constitutions stemmed the torrent of corruption battled for the state ventured their lives in the defense of their country and gloriously bled in the cause of liberty   polypth what an happy man you are thus to find an opportunity of moralizing upon every occasion what a noble view you have displayed before me when perhaps if i had been alone i should have entertained myself no otherwise than in examining the busts or if i read the inscriptions they would only have drawn a remark from me that they were well wrote  the assembly yonder on the opposite side of the water will be i suppose the next subject for your rapsody pray what titles are those gentry distinguished by at this distance i can hardly find out whether they are philosophers or milkmaids   calloph why sir you have there a view of the kingdom of parnassus that assembly is composed of apollo and his privy council but as i believe they will hardly pay us by any beauty in their workmanship for our trouble should we go round and make them a visit it is my advice that we walk directly from hence to the temple of friendship and so return by that terrace back again to those parts of the garden that remain yet unseen   polypth with all my heart but let us turn in here i beseech you and walk as much in the shade as possible for the day grows vastly warm   calloph i am ready to follow you amongst the trees not more out of complaisance than inclination i like a cool retreat as well as you when i plan a garden i believe i shall deal much in shady walks wherever i open a grand terrace i intend to lengthen out by its side a close vista through the one i shall lead strangers in the other enjoy my friends i am a great admirer of walking in a shade it is a kind of emblem of the most agreeable situation in life the retired one every fantastic view is hid from us and we may if we please be poets or philosophers or what we will i own i admire the taste of these buzzing insects sporting themselves in the shade a glaring sun shine neither in the world nor in a walk is agreeable to my way of thinking   polypth if all the world thought as you do we should have neither statesmen to mend our laws nor cobblers to mend our shoes we should all run and hide ourselves amongst trees and what then would become of society   calloph if i thought you did not wilfully mistake my meaning i would take the trouble of telling you that i am an advocate for no other retirement than such as is consistent with the duties of life a love for which kind of retirement properly qualified is health to the mind but when it is made up unskillfully it throws us into a fatal lethargy from whence begins the date of an useless life every virtuous mind in a greater or a less degree has a turn this way and the best i believe ought to be at the most pains to guard against carrying this inclination into the extreme   polypth and yet the annals of most nations let us see that their greatest men have often indulged it and much for the benefit of mankind too witness many of the illustrious worthies we have just been visiting you forget the panegyric you bestowed upon them   calloph no sir but do you remember that i placed these cool reasoners on the best side of a comparison with those who entered into the world and spent their lives in action on the contrary this latter kind of men have always stood fairest in my esteem the life of a recluse i would recommend to none but a valetudinarian we were intended to assist each other as much as we are able for my part it has always been my opinion that one good man does more service in the world than a thousand good books  but well drop our argument at present because i see we have finished our walk   polypth is that building the temple of friendship i cannot say that i extremely admire it but i hope i shall meet with more entertainment within than i am able to do without  well this is elegant i must confess   calloph ay look round and tell me if you are not struck by several very beautiful objects those busts i assure you are all pretty well done and some of them extremely well   polypth so they are indeed but i am chiefly intent upon the painting which i am much taken with it is by the same hand i dare say with that in the temple of venus that emblem of friendship above the door those of justice and liberty and those other ornaments upon the walls are well touched what is that painting upon the cieling i do not rightly understand it   calloph why sir it is a piece of satyr i am sure you will like it if you will give yourself the trouble to examine it it is in your taste i know exactly  there you see sits britannia upon one side are held the glory of her annals the reigns of queen elizabeth and edward iii and on the other is offered the reign of  which she frowns upon and puts by with her hand   polypth excellent upon my word faith this is good never accept it honest lady till corruption is at an end and public spirit revives   calloph with so little malevolence as i know you are possessed of i do not think i ever met with any body in my life so eager to catch at any thing to blame or to whom an opportunity of that kind afforded a more seeming real pleasure than it does to you  but i know it proceeds from an honest nature  well suppose we continue our walk  i look upon that statue as one of the finest in the world i would give all the money in my pocket for a sight of the original   polypth the posture always to me appears a little too much strained i can scarce throw myself into such an attitude yet it is fine i must confess   calloph you have the best view of it sir from hence most of the engravings i have met with give us the back view but i think the statue appears infinitely to the best advantage when taken in front the air of the head is delightful and cannot be hid without depriving the figure of half its life  i am leading you now to that genteel piece of building which goes by the name of the palladian bridge   polypth i have seen i think something like it at my lord pembrokes   calloph i believe sir the model was taken from thence though if i remember right the roof is there supported by pillars on both sides   polypth i think it is  but what have we got there you are taking me past something curious   calloph i beg your pardon indeed i had almost forgot the imperial closet and i wonder i should for i assure you i have the greatest veneration for its inhabitants  there sir is a noble triumvirate titus trajan and aurelius are names which want not the pomp of title to add a luster to them   polypth i wish you could persuade all the kings in europe to take them as patterns but god knows public spirit is now at a low ebb amongst us there is more of it in that single honest sentiment pro me si merear in me than i believe is to be found in this degenerate age in half a kingdom   calloph i see my good friend you can moralize upon occasion too   polypth moralize the d  l take me if i would not this moment in spite of    calloph nay come dont grow serious you know i have long since laid it down as a rule to stop my ears when you get into your political vein i am not now to learn that there is no keeping you within the bounds of temperance upon that topic   polypth well then let us have something else to talk about  yon wall at this distance seems to promise us some bassrelief   calloph yes sir you are there presented with a view of the different quarters of the world bringing their various products to britannia it is a pretty ornament enough for a bridge which like the art of navigation joins one land to another   polypth i cannot say i much admire the workmanship there is a great degree of auk wardness in several of the figures   calloph why really i am so far of your way of thinking that i must own i am no great admirer of this kind of work except it be extremely fine  the best thing in this way that ever i met with is a piece of altrelief which his lordship keeps within doors we shall scarce i believe have time now but we must take an opportunity of seeing it before you leave the country you will meet with likewise in those apartments several very good pictures i remember spending an afternoon about half a year ago in a very agreeable manner amongst them but this piece of altrelief struck me beyond every thing the story is dariuss tent and it is so charmingly told that i have had i can tell you a meaner opinion of le brun upon that subject ever since i have seen it the composition is so just the figures so graceful and correct nay the very drapery so free and easy that i declare i was altogether astonished at the sight of it   polypth well i shall find some opportunity of paying it a visit there is so much art required and so much difficulty attends doing any thing in this way as it ought to be that when we do meet with a good piece of workmanship of this kind it affords us an extreme pleasure  so sir william have i met you here i should rather have expected to have seen you among the british worthies  this same penn sir i assure you is a great favorite of mine i esteem him one of the most worthy legislators upon record his laws i am told act still with great force in pensylvania and keep the honest inoffensive people there in extreme good order   calloph our sailors mention his colony as a very happy set of people they live entirely at peace amongst themselves and bred up in a strict observance of probity without any knowledge of an art military amongst them are able to preserve the most sociable terms with their neighbors  these busts seem to have escaped your observation   polypth no sir i am not so incurious as to suffer any thing that has been in italy to slip my notice some of those particularly that stand on the side next rawleigh i was exceedingly taken with   calloph pray what is your opinion of checquered marbles being made use of in busts   polypth why sir i never see any of these partycolored faces but i am moved with indignation at the sculptors ridiculous humor it is so absurd a taste that i cannot conceive how it should ever enter into a workmans head to make every feature of a mans face of a different color and it amazes me i assure you that we meet with daily so many instances of such absurdity  in several parts of the garden i have had various views of that old gothic building we are now at last i hope moving toward it i am so wonderfully pleased with its outward appearance that i shall be disappointed if i dont meet some thing answerable within   calloph why sir as old as it looks i assure you it is not yet finished you will meet with nothing ornamental in the inside so i would have you persuade yourself it has already done all in its power to entertain you and upon my word i think it has done a great deal without it i am sure this part of the garden would be quite naked and lifeless nor would any other part appear with so much beauty it puts one in mind of some generous patriot in his retirement his own neighborhood feels most the effects of that bounty which in some measure spreads itself over a whole country   polypth i like this disposition within i assure you altogether as well as its form without  there are two or three pieces of the best painted glass that i have any where met with those little historical pieces are exceedingly beautiful and so are those landskips likewise  this hill i think appears rather too naked   calloph throw your eye over it then and tell me if you are not ravished with the view before you nothing certainly in the kind can be more beautiful or great than that pompous pile rising in so magnificent a manner above the wood the building cannot possibly be shown to greater advantage the appearance it makes presents you with an idea sufficiently grand yet your imagination cannot be persuaded but that it is in fact much grander and that the wood hides a great part of what is to be seen from your eye this is a most delightful manner of pleasing a grand object left to a good imagination to improve upon seldom loses by its assistance our view likewise is greatly added to in point of beauty by those several other smaller buildings which offer themselves some only half hid amongst the branches and others just peeping from amongst tufted trees which make very beautiful little garnished dishes in this most elegant entertainment   polypth as you have thus painted the near objects let my pencil i beg come in for a few rough touches in the backgrounds without something of an offskip your man of art you know seldom esteems his view perfect and in this landscape there are as many beautiful objects thrown off to a distance as can well be imagined that variety of fine wood that bright surface of water with the pointed obelisk in the midst of it those two pavilions upon the banks of the canal and the still more distant view into the country are objects which in my opinion make no small addition to the beauty of your landscape or to carry on your allusion may very well come in as a second course in your entertainment  our attention i think in the next place is demanded by this venerable assembly that old gentleman there sits with great dignity i like his attitude extremely if i understood the runic character i might have known probably for this inscription i fancy would inform me by what title he is distinguished but the gracefulness of his posture discovers him to have been nothing less than an hero of the first rank he puts me in mind of a roman senator sitting in his curule chair to receive the gauls   calloph why sir you have done him great honor i must own but you have not yet honored him according to his dignity he is nothing less sir i assure you than the representative of a saxon deity you see here thor and woden fabled gods  with the whole system of your ancestors theology walk round the assembly they will smile upon a true briton and try if you can acknowledge each by his distinct symbol   polypth i must confess they do not to me seem accoutered like gods for my part i should rather suspect them to be statues of heroes and lawgivers metamorphised into divinities by the courtesy of the place i shall not however go about to dispute their titles but like my good ancestors before me acquiesce piously in what other people tell me  though i cannot say but that lady there bearing the sun who represents i suppose sunday looks whimsical enough and makes just such an appearance as i could imagine the misled conception of an enthusiastic saxon might mould his deities into but in these other figures i must own i cannot see superstition at all characterized which you may observe generally forms its objects of worship into the most miscreated things that can possibly enter the imagination of man   calloph why sir amongst the greeks and romans you may observe several very wellshaped deities the hercules the apollo and the venus are at this day standards of beauty   polypth yes but i am apt to attribute this rather to the imagination of their sculptors than their priests to show art rather than to express religion was the point aimed at in these enchanting pieces of workmanship  but when superstition acted without control when the fantastic notions of priests were put into the hands of ordinary workmen even amongst the polite greeks and romans themselves lord what misshapen monsters crowded into temples and reared themselves aloft above altars search other countries likewise egypt and africa china and japan or any place either ancient or modern where superstition prevails and i dare engage in the whole catalogue of their deities you will scarce meet with one that bears any thing like the human shape   calloph why their demigods or canonized heroes of which all pagan nations had abundance were generally i fancy represented in the human form and these saxon divinities i suppose pretend not to any superior rank  but however as no degree of veneration is exacted from you you may i think let them rest quietly upon their pedestals without any farther molestation  we have a good view into the country from hence those woods are extremely elegant in their kind we must certainly contrive to take a ride thither some evening they are laid out in a very fine manner and cut into very beautiful ridings   polypth ay that is the kind of improvement that takes most with me let us step in here a moment we are caught i see in a shower i am altogether of the poets opinion that it is use alone that sanctifies expense were i a nobleman i should endeavor to turn my estate into a garden and make my tenants my gardiners instead of useless temples i would build farmhouses and instead of cutting out unmeaning vistas i would beautify and mend highways the country should smile upon my labors and the public should partake in my pleasures what signifies all this ostentatious work is any man the better for it is it not money most vilely squandered away   calloph so far from it that i assure you considered even in a public light i look upon it as an expense that may very properly be said to be sanctified by use   polypth i suppose you are going to tell me that it feeds two or three poor laborers and when you have said this i know not what more you can say to defend it but how is it possible for a man to throw away his money without doing some service in the world   calloph how why by spending it in gaming to the encouragement of cheats and sharpers by squandering it away upon lusts and appetites in the support of stews and bawdyhouses or by dealing it out in bribes in opposition to honesty and to advance corruption in arts like these what numbers consume their wealth it is not enough for them to prevent mankinds being benefited by their affluent mankinds being benefited by their affluent circumstances but they do their utmost while they diminish their fortunes to make all they can influence as worthless as themselves so that i assure you i should look upon it as a very great point gained if all our men of fortune would only take care that their wealth proves of no disservice to mankind though i am far from desiring they should stop there i would have them endeavor to turn it into some useful channel and in my opinion it is laid out in a very laudable manner when it is spent as it is here in circulating through a variety of trades in supporting a number of poor families and in the encouragement of art and industry   polypth well sir i confess wealth thus laid out is beneficial to a country but still you keep from the point i ask whether all these good ends would not be answered and more too were this wealth laid out according to my scheme in public works or something of an useful nature   calloph and so you have no notion of any use arising from these elegant productions of art you cannot conceive how they should be of any service to the public why you are a mere goth an unpolished vandal were you empowered to reform the age i suppose i should see you like one of those wild misguided people coursing furiously round the land and laying desolate every thing beautiful you met with but in my opinion sir these noble productions of art considered merely as such may be looked upon as works of a very public nature do you think no end is answered when a nations taste is regulated with regard to the most innocent the most refined and elegant of its pleasures in all polite countries the amusements of the people were thought highly deserving a legislators inspection to establish a just taste in these was esteemed in some measure as advancing the interest of virtue and can it be considered as a work entirely of a private nature for a superior genius to exert itself in an endeavor to fix a true standard of beauty in any of these allowed and useful kinds of pleasure in the way of gardening particularly the taste of the nation has long been so depraved that i should think we might be obliged to any one that would undertake to reform it while a taste for painting music architecture and other polite arts in some measure prevailed amongst us our gardens for the most part were laid out in so formal auk ward and wretched a manner that they were really a scandal to the very genius of the nation a man of taste was shocked whenever he set his foot into them but stow it is to be hoped may work some reformation i would have our country squires flock hither two or three times in a year by way of improvement and after they have looked about them a little return home with new notions and begin to see the absurdity of their clipped yews their boxwood borders their flourished parterres and their lofty brickwalls  you may smile but assure you such an improvement of public taste though there is no occasion to consider it as a matter of the first importance is certainly a concern that ought by no means to be neglected perhaps indeed i may carry the matter farther than the generality of people but to me i must own there appears a very visible connection between an improved taste for pleasure and a taste for virtue when i sit ravished at an oratorio or stand astonished before the cartoons or enjoy myself in these happy walks i can feel my mind expand itself my notions enlarge and my heart better disposed either for a religious thought or a benevolent action in a word i cannot help imagining a taste for these exalted pleasures contributes toward making me a better man   polypth good god what an enthusiast you are polite arts improve virtue an assertion indeed for a philosopher to make why are they not always considered as having a natural tendency to luxury to riot and licentiousness   calloph no more in my opinion than a wholesome meal has to a surfeit or reading the scriptures to heresy all things are capable we know of abuse and perhaps the best things the most capable and though this may indeed argue a depravity in us yet it by no means i think argues a tendency in them to deprave us however to let what i have yet said stand for nothing i can tell you one very great piece of service arising to the country from wealth laid cut in this elegant manner which you seem so much to grumble at and that is the money spent in the neighborhood by the company daily crouding hither to satisfy their curiosity we have a kind of a continual fair and i have heard several of the inhabitants of the neighboring town assert that it is one of the best trades they have their inns their shops their farms and shambles all find their account in it so that in my opinion viewed in this light only such productions of art may be considered as very great advantages to every neighborhood that enjoys the lucky situation of being placed near them  to this advantage might be added the great degree of pleasure from hence derived daily to such numbers of people a place like this is a kind of keeping open house there is a repast at all times ready for the entertainment of strangers and sure if you have any degree of benevolence you must think an useful end answered in thus affording an innocent gratification to so many of your fellow creatures a sunday evening spent here adds a new relish to the day of rest and makes the sabbath appear more cheerful to the labourer after a toilsome week for my part i assure you i have scarce experienced a greater pleasure than i have often felt upon meeting a variety of pleased faces in these walks all care and uneasiness seems to be left behind at the gardendoor and people enter here fully resolved to enjoy themselves and the several beautiful objects around them in one part a face presents itself marked with the passion of gaping wonder in another you meet a countenance bearing the appearance of a more rational pleasure and in a third a set of features composed into serene joy while the man of taste is seen examining every beauty with a curious eye and discovering his approbation in an halfformed smile  to this i might still add another advantage of a public nature derived from these elegant productions of art and that is their tendency to raise us in the opinion of foreigners if our nation had nothing of this kind to boast of all our neighbors would look upon us a stupid tasteless set of people and not worth visiting so that for the credit of the country i think something of this kind ought to be exhibited amongst us our public virtues if we have any would not i dare say appear to less advantage when recommended by these embellishments of art   polypth i wonder you should not know me better than to imagine i am always in earnest when i find fault my thoughts and yours i assure you agree exactly upon this subject i only wanted to engage you in some discourse till the shower was over and as the sky seems now quite clear if you will well venture out and visit what we have yet to see   calloph you are a humorous fellow this is not the first time you have made me play my lungs to no purpose  as we walk along this terrace you may observe the great advantage of low walls by this means the garden is extended beyond its limits and takes in every thing entertaining that is to be met with in the range of half a county villages works of husbandry groups of cattle herds of deer and a variety of other beautiful objects are brought into the garden and make a part of the plan even to the nicest taste these rural scenes are highly delightful   polypth nay you may add that whoever has no relish for them gives reason for a suspicion that he has no taste at all  straight mine eye has caught new pleasures whilst the landscape round it measures russet lawns and fallows gray where the nibbling flocks do stray mountains on whose barren breast the laboring clouds do often rest meadows trim with daisies pide shallow brooks and rivers wide towers and battlements it sees bosomed high in tufted trees where perhaps some beauty lies the cynosure of neighboring eyes hard by a cottage chimney smokes from betwixt two aged oaks  calloph can you repeat no more i could have listened with great pleasure if you had gone on with the whole piece it is quite nature that view of an old castle bosomed high in tufted trees pleases me exceedingly and the two following lines where perhaps some beauty lies the cynosure of neighboring eyes give it an elegant romantic air and add greatly to the idea before conceived  but to pursue our former argument it must be owned indeed that these walks want such openings into the country as little as any place can well be imagined to do yet even stow itself i assure you is much improved by them they contrast beautifully with this more polished nature and set it off to greater advantage after surfeiting itself with the feast here provided for it the eye by using a little exercise in traveling about the country grows hungry again and returns to the entertainment with fresh appetite besides there is nothing so distasteful to the eye as a confined prospect where the reasonableness of it does not appear especially if a dead wall or any other such disagreeable object steps in between the eye naturally loves liberty and when it is in quest of prospects will not rest content with the most beautiful dispositions of art confined within a narrow compass but as soon as the novelty of the sight is over will begin to grow dissatisfied till the whole limits of the horizon be given it to range through   polypth the eye according to your account seems to be something like a be plant as many flowers as you will near its hive yet still the little insect will be discontented unless it be allowed to wander over the country and be its own caterer  i have got a few very severe exclamations at my tongues end which i will not vent till you have told me the architects name who has loaded the ground with that monstrous piece of building though i believe i can guess him without your information   calloph suffer me to intercede in his behalf you are so unmerciful a reprover that i have not patience to hear you the room above is designed i am told to be fitted up in a very elegant manner but as very little is yet done to it we shall find nothing i fancy to answer the trouble of going up stairs  this part of the garden you see is yet unfinished if we have the pleasure of your company in this country next year you will see i dare say great alterations here that base is to shoot up into a lofty monument and several of those objects you see before you are to take new forms upon them   polypth yonder likewise seems to be a monument since this view of the gardens was taken the monument here spoken of has been finished the following lines are a translation of its inscription which in the original is wrote in latin as a monument to testify both his applause and grief richard lord viscount cobham erected this naval pillar to the memory of his nephew captain grenville who commanding a ship of war in the british fleet under admiral anson in an engagement with the french was mortally wounded upon the thigh by a fragment of his shattered ship yet with his last breath had the bravery to cry out how much more desirable is it thus to meet death than convicted of cowardice to meet justice may this noble instance of virtue prove instructive to an abandoned age and teach britons how to act in their countrys cause  rising pray who is it intended to do honor to   calloph why sir it is intended to do honor to a gentleman who has done honor to his country it is dedicated to the memory of captain grenville and joins with the nation in applauding a man who pushed forwards by honor and a love for his country met danger and death with the spirit of a roman  well how do you like the plan which you see laid out before you   polypth as far as i can judge of the future landscape from this sketch it will be an admirable one i am extremely taken with it that basin has a very fine effect  i could return back the same round with great pleasure but my watch informs me that mr  has been expecting us this half hour   calloph is it so late the time has stole off very slily however you need be under no apprehensions that honest gentleman is seldom very hasty in his motions  having thus finished their round our two gentlemen directed their faces back again toward the gate   polypthon notwithstanding the sour humor he had given so many evidences of in his walk began now to relent and could talk of nothing but the agreeable entertainment that had been afforded him sometimes he would run out into the highest encomiums of the many beautiful terminations of the several walks and vistas and observe how many uses each object served and in how many different lights it was made to vary itself for instance says he the pavilion you showed me from the temple of venus terminates that terrace in a very grand manner and makes likewise a very magnificent appearance where it corresponds with another of the same form at the entrance into the park yet the same building like a person acquainted with the world who can suit his behavior to time and place can vary itself upon occasion into a more humble shape and when viewed through a retired vista can take upon it the lowly form of a close retreat  when he had enlarged pretty copiously upon this subject he would next launch out into the highest praises of the vast variety of objects that was every where to be met with men of all humors says he will here find something pleasing and suited to their taste the thoughtful may meet with retired walks calculated in the best manner for contemplation the gay and cheerful may see nature in her loveliest dress and meet objects corresponding with their most lively flights the romantic genius may entertain itself with several very beautiful objects in its own taste and grow wild with ideas of the enchanted kind the disconsolate lover may hide himself in shady groves or melancholy wander along the banks of lakes and canals where he may sigh to the gentle zephyrs mingle his tears with the bubbling water or where he may have the best opportunity if his malady be grown to such an height of ending his despair and finishing his life with all the decency and pomp of a lover in a romance in short says he these gardens are a very good epitome of the world they are calculated for minds of every stamp and give free scope to inclinations of every kind and if it be said that in some parts they too much humor the debauched taste of the sensualist it cannot be denied on the other hand but that they afford several very noble incitements to honor and virtue  but what beyond all other things seemed most to please him was the amicable and beautiful conjunction of art and nature through the whole he observed that the former never appeared stiff or the latter extravagant  upon many other topics of praise polypthon run out with great warmth callophilus seemed surprised and could not forbear asking him by what means his opinions became so suddenly changed why says he sir i have said nothing now that contradicts any thing i said before i own i met with two or three objects that were not entirely to my taste which i am far from condemning for that reason though if i should it is nothing to the purpose because i am now taking a survey of the whole together in which light i must confess i am quite astonished with the view before me besides i hate one of your wondering mortals who is perpetually breaking out into a note of admiration at every thing he sees i am always apt to suspect his taste or his sincerity it is impossible that all geniuss can alike agree in their opinions of any work of art and the man who never blames i can scarce believe is qualified to commend besides finding fault now and then adds weight to commendation and makes us believed to be in earnest however notwithstanding what you may think of my frequent cavils i assure you with the greatest sincerity i never before saw any thing of the kind at all comparable to what i have here seen i shall by no means close this day with a diem perdidi nor would the roman emperor himself i believe have made the reflection if he had spent his condemned hours in this place  by this time the gentlemen were come to the gate through which polypthon assured his friend he passed with the greatest reluctance and went growling out of this delightful garden as the devil is said to have done out of paradise  finis
