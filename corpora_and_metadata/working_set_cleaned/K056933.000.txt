an historical account of the bitter sufferings and melancholy circumstances of the episcopal church in scotland under the barbarous usage and bloody persecution of the presbyterian church government with an essay on the nature and necessity of a toleration in the north of britain  edinburgh printed in the year mdccvii  an historical account of the bitter sufferings and melancholy circumstances of the episcopal church in scotland under the barbarous usage and bloody persecution of the presbyterian church government etc it is neither to answer the clamours of those who rail at the scots in general nor to vindicate the church or nation in that part of britain against the outcries and complaints of the episcopal party that this tract is at this time made public  the first of these deserves no answer being noise without ground and clamor without fact and will as al such furious inconsistent escapes generally do die with time the second needs no answer that party being fully answered and fairly silenced already partly by the conviction of their own consciences and completely by the late reverend and worthy doctor rule principal of the college of edinburgh in his answer to five pamphlets printed in bhalf of the episcopal clergy  but this design seems to me equally necessary both to the protestant interest in this island and to the general peace which every good man wishes and hopes for among us and which by the late happy union seems nearer in is approach to us and in order to which i thought it a very useful piece of work to state the matter of fact between the church of scotland and the dissenters there and enquire into some things in which the world has been not a little imposed upon  i do confess when i came first into scotland i was in nothing more surprised than in the matter of the dissenters i had with the generality of people in england always believed tho i had wished it otherwise that the episcopal clergy in scotland were entirely deposed and suppressed persecuted and not permitted to keep up any form of a separation in religious matters  and i think my self obliged to enter into this case not only to do the kirk of scotland justice and defend her against her enemies but to defend her against her friends if a rake or a scoundrel illreat me i think it not worth my notice it is below my concern he does it because he is a rake and a scoundrel and the slander goes but a little way but if a man of virtue a man of sense a man of religion if a good man censures me i am concerned at it on a twofold account   because his mistake will wound me with other good men and make the slander be believed   because i am willing to undeceive him and prevent his exposing himself in his reproaching me of which when it shall appear i am innocent he will be ashamed and it is a friendship to him to prevent his blushes  that the church of scotland has carried it with great heat and rigid severity to put it now in the softest terms i can toward the episcopal clergy dissenting from them and deposed by them at the revolution is the charge i have always met with against them and this is not only published in print with aggravations exclamations etc by their own party and that in several pamphlets and industriously spread over england and which i esteem worst of all it has passed too much for granted and been too much received and believed among the best sort of people in england friends to the constitution and friends to the establishment of religion in that kingdom who tho they do not take all for granted by whole sale which noisy and claorous people have published yet having never seen any authick vindication or direct answer to these charges are bught to believe so much of it as makes them entertain ustly a too mean opinion of their brethren in scotland  to undeceive such is worth any honest mans while and tho i am perfectly a volunteer in this work on all sides i am persuaded the church of scotland or the reverend the ministers of that church cannot think it a needless undertaking to let them right in the judgment of those with whom they are now more nearly joined and clsser allied than ever and to remove as far as possible all causes of jealousy coldness or want of charity between those who are so nearly knit both in religious reltion as protestants and also in civil interest as to safety liberty and right  the honest but priudiced people in england who have been imposed upon by the public cries of sufferings persecutions cruelties and merciless usage of the episcopal party in scotland will i doubt not be pleased to be undeceived and be glad to restore the church of scotland to their entire charity and good opinion and to have that damp removed which they had on good ground as they supposed felt on their thoughts when they believed that the excesses pretended to had truth enough in them to merit real blame and that the warmth of northern zeal had carried the scots beyond that moderation which is the beauty and glory of the protestant religion and which i doubt not to make appear the church of scotland has given reason to believe she at this time practices and from the revolution to this time has done as much as any church in the world  it is for these reasons i write it is for the sake of these this book is published it is to undeceive the friends to truth and the lovers of peace to remove the prejudices of those that would be informed not of those that seek to be imposed upon and hunt about for subject to cavil and debate it is to clear up the reputation of the church of scotland among her friends not among her enemies among the friends to religion in england and among the protestant churches abroad his is the reason of this work and the author professes to have no other design  not but that it may also serve to stop the mouths of some people who with an uncharitable zeal have raised a cloud and cast dirt on the established church of scotland on this account and perhaps they may here find some occasion to alter their measures and with respect to their own reputation change their note for it always weakens the reputation of either person or party to assert falsehoods to raise stories that must if examined into appear to be forged and contrived only to defame  slander always flies back upon the head of the slanderer and first or last the dirt he throws at others sticks upon himself at least leaves some of the filth behind it when time truth and innocence clears up the reputation of the other  when therefore these sheets are a little read and considered in the world i make no question but several sorts of people may find occasion to blush and i cannot have so little charity as not to hope they will suffer the convictions of truth in fact so far to prevail upon their reason and temper as to cause them to detest the practices of those who having not been able by any legal fair proceedings to charge the church of scotland with any thing unbecoming her as a christian a national or a protestant church have thought to supply that defect with the assistance of most abominable slanders depending upon the distance of place and darkness of circumstances as difficulties which would obstruct the discovery and at least concluding it would serve a turn for a time delude the ignorant and uninquiring part of the world and in general help to make the reformation and establishment in scotland odious and contemptible and thereby fix a prejudice in the people of this island one against another a temper they had so often occasion to make use of and was so constantly subservient to their mischievous designs that they could not fail always to reap some advantage by it bad is that cause that flourishes only in national confusion and that is always best propagated by mischief and dissension  nor could the promoters of these things find a better handle in the world to take hold of in order to defame and render contemptible the scots presbyterians than the charge of cruelty and persecution  persecution is a word particularly hateful among protestants as what every protestant church in the world has first or last been suffering under and the churches of this island in especial manner   when therefore they had gotten hold as they thought of this matter they seemed fully satisfied that they had the reputation not of the church of scotland only but of presbyterians and dissenters in general under foot  first to prove the dissenters in england were of persecuting principles cruel and tyrannical was the ready way to ruin all the prospects of joining interests in england between them and the moderate church men a thing the high party foresaw was coming forward and which they knew if it ever come to pass would ruin the highflying interest and secondly nothing could furnish them with a more plausible ground of suggesting this upon the dissenters in england than first to charge it upon the church of scotland directly  thus the charge upon the presbyterian church in scotland of being tyrannical of a persecuting spirit and the ke served the high church cause in england a great many ways and if we were to ener into the secret history of it we should find that most of this scandal was both formed in england and calculated for purposes particular to that part of britain the several pamphlets printed on that subject were all printed in england industriously spread ther and with as much industry endeavored to be concealed in scotland the service they were to do was in england and they could in no wise be directly contradicted but from scotland  it is with regret i am obliged to acknowledge this artiic of the party has had but too much success first to impose upon the easy and credulous people of their own party and possess them with a belief of all the pretended cruelti and violences practiced by the presbyterian church in scotland upon the episcopal ministers etc  and by consequence fill them with prejudice against the dissenters in their own country as of the same principle and only wanting the same ower to exercise it  secondly but this is not all nor had it been all had this piece been ever wrote since the mischief had been but of small consequence and among themselves but i cannot help observing in the several occasions the world has had of late to speak of scotland more than usual this has taken too much root among even the dissenters in england and these of them who have been the best friends to scotland that they have been made to believe there has been at least too much truth in the general charge and that really the episcopal party have been persecuted and severely treated  nothing has been more common than in talking of these things to have the honest people speak with concern about it and bring it out with an i wish the scots would use the episcopal party more gently and the like when they have been told it is otherwise they would shake their heads doubting and return i am afraid there is some truth in it and to this day i believe i may speak it without any hesitation the greatest part even of the dissenters in england are of this opinion that the presbyterian church of scotland to really crush oppress persecute and use hardly the ministers of the episcopal party  and indeed if we consider the tile of the several pamphlets written on this subject the assurance of the authors how positively they have asserted things their strange yet frequent descending to particulars which nevertheless were false in fact and how strangely they have imposed upon the world  and withal that not any man in england at least has ever formally taken up this cause it is no wonder that both friend and enemy have received impressions to the prejudice of the church of scotland and have taken up an opinion of the truth of these things as most certain and not to be denied  before i enter into the matter of fact as it now stands in scotland i think it is very proper to quote a few of the particulars which the people of whom i have been speaking charge upon the church of scotland and which they call persecution which first of all cannot e called persecution if true and secondly if they were to be called persecution can by no means be laid to the charge of the church  as first the violences of the common people upon the revolution    dly the deposing the ministers  as to the violences of the mob i would by no means have english men call that persecution because the rabbles in the affair of the revolution were equally violent in england a in scotland and promiscuous in the persons both church of england rabble and presbyterian rabble none of which can be accused by one another nor were ever that i remember justified by either  but no church man ought to exclaim against a presbyterian rabble lest the papist double it upon him with a history of the church rabbles upon them and they should be distinguished by this unhappy circumstance that in scotland the rabbles used violence with those who had murdered their fathers mothers and near relations who had dipped their hands in blood and had prompted and appeared in the greatest barbarities that any age or nation can parallel and had thereby provoked them to the highest degree whereas in england the rabbles rifled plundered and insulted the houses parks and lands of peaceable gentlemen who had been perfectly unconcerned in any of king jamess malversations and against whom they had no manner of objection but that they were roman catholics or as they called it in others disaffected  for this reason i would advise the gentlemen that talk of this as part of the persecutions they complain of to leave it out of the list  and let it ly as an accident of the revolution and an effect of the  a prked people in which religion had no  ut that power being given by the circumstance of the time these shewe them the resentment of their bloody treatment in a manner however violent and unjustifyable yet much short of what they had really deserved and still more short of what they might reasonably have expected  let all the excesses of the multitude therefore ly buried under the same charity gentlemen that covers your former barbarous treatment and if they did not pistol in cold blood if they did not ty the women to stakes in the sea and let the tide flow over them if they did not drag you out of your houses and shoot you without giving you time to commend your souls to gods mercy if these things were not done you ought to believe none of the posterity of these poor innocents that so suffered were alive to revenge them or that you had more mercy from their hands than you had reason to expect  these things therefore cannot be called persecution and the violences of the rabbles of the revolution should be razed out of the catalogue  an english highchurchman should not call it persecution because at their revolution it was practiced by them at home a scots episcopalman should not because of the just provocation his party had given the poor people to treat them more violently  again if by nice distinctions they should chance to say they have proved this to be persecution  what is this to the church it might be done by presbyterians of the church but it can never be said it was done y the presbyterians as a church it was done by no act of the church no nor of the government nor did either the church or the government ever approve justify or employ any of the persons  it is true there was no public punishing the actors neither did the government in england punish neither was it a time to punish those excesses and particularly the government in england thought fit by parliament so far to bear with them as to stop all process against trespasses etc  there is also another unhappy circumstance that so ffectually clears the church of this charge that i cannot but wonder the party could ever make use of it as an argument or bring this matter of rabbling into the charge and that is that these tumults plunderings and driving away the episcopal ministers were all done and over before there was any such thing as a presbyterian church i mean established or in any power to act as a judicatory or as a body so that to charge the church with this is like indicting a man for a murder committed before he was born  i shall therefore take up none of my time here to vindicate the church of scotland from any part of this harge being what can with no color of reason put the least reflection upon her and if it could can by no means obtain the name of persecution    deposing the ministers  this i think will hardly come under the name of persecution nor take up much of my time  what little i shall say will be perfectly new to what has been said before viz if this debate be entered upon it will seem to me to depend upon the original constitution of the church of scotland from the reformation and so it will only remain to inquire whether episcopacy in scotland was not an usurpation and a persecution upon the rightful establishment and the deposing it only a restoring the presbyterian church to its proper undoubted possession and this being a point remote to my present debate i wave it here not but that i shall readily enter upon that question too as occasion may present or when ever those complaining gentlemen please to require it  besides i think it is not so much the deposing the ministers or eecting presbytery in scotland which is the present case in debate or which they complain of in the word persecution as the manner of doing it and the usage of the episcopal lergy subsequent to it  and that brings me directly to matter of fact   in pursuing which i shall not so much descend to the particular stories affirmed in print the falsehood of most of which are evidently detected by doctor rule as aforesaid and in speaking to which i must be obliged to blacken a party of men whose infirmities and ill conduct i do not covet to expose to the world unless otherwise forced to it   nor would it be to the purpose here to trouble the reader with proving of negatives and detecting the particular lsities of the allations which in print have been put upon the world and which will meet with their complete answer in the method i have now chosen and must require farther documents or vouchers to confirm them than the authorities which yet have been produced  my method therefore shall be to give an impartial account of the general proceedings of the church of scotland in the matter of establishing the presbyterian discipline and deposing episcopacy together with their behavior to the episcopal clergy through the whole course of the present establishment and tho the whole can be but an abstract or abridgment i mean as to cases yet i make no doubt it  fully and to all impartial observers of things entirely vindicate the church of scotland from all the aspersions of her enemies and prove that the circumstances considered her sufferings before the revolution and the behavior of the episcopal dissenters since being put all into the account the consequence will show the church of scotland the most moderate the farthest from persecution and the most forbearing of any established church in the world  it could not be expected but that upon the revolution the prelatic tyranny would fall with the regal and were it worth examining into it would be easy to prove there was an inevitable necessity it should do so they being so effectually supported one by another that they could not but stand and fall together  that the conjunct tyranny of both church and state had treated the presbyterians with such an impolitic fury as must imply they had not the last apprehension of being ever pulled down again by them would be very evident if i should enter here upon a particular of all that treatment of all the sufferings and oppressions that people underwent the exact history of which tho it be very much wanted in the world yet i cannot think of entering upon it here unless forced to it in the just defense of what is but hinted at in these papers   indeed the remote ideas i had of these things were sufficient to have given me a notion that they had been hrdly used but i confess my self amazed and surprised when at my enquiring into particulars i find all the excesses of rapine violence blood cruelty torture and barbarity that any age can show for several hundred years past in the world till at last it came to downright massacre and the soldiers had power given them and frankly executed it to drag innocent people in time of full peace out of their houses and murder them at their discretion terrible instances of which are to be given in several parts of the kingdom  if any man was to read the dismal stories of that time and making the case his own reflect upon what he should have done in like case when the revolution put those very people into the power of such whose blood they had dipped their hands in let him censure the enraged people if he can in all their rabbles they only drove their curats away and perhaps plundered some of them and was it not rather to be expected when gotten together in a tumultuary way they should have torn them to pieces and sacrificed them lege talione to the ghosts of their murdered relations  however therefore i avoid entering into the history of the persecutions and butcheries exercised by the people we are speaking of i cannot help saying here that they are in their general view a most direct testimony of the moderation of the presbyterians in scotland that when established they contented themselves with a bare deposing the thing without bringing to justice the persons among whom many of the clergy would have been found principals nay an even in some places actors in a most unusual and unaccountable manner  but to come to particulars i mean as to church conduct let us go back to the revolution  the bishops being deposed and the presbyterian government of the church being restored and established in scotland one of the first things which the assembly did was to consider of the planting ministers in the church and in order to this it was debated    who were the people to be put out and    who to be put in  as to the last it is no part of the subject here nor at  to the purpose but as to the first the ministers to be put ou were of two sorts    scandalous ignorant and immoral persons    unqualified persons  as to the scandalous and immoral i hope no body will call it persecution that the church of scotland thought it her duty to have them removed and that her assemblies diligently applied themselves to the doing it and yet even in the doing this most necessary piece of justice to the church the lenity the space given for reformation the passing by a great many that in strict justice might have been deposed these are sufficient testimonies that it was not a spirit of persecution cruelty or severity which acted the assemblies or which acted the commissioners deputed by them to inspect the churches at that time but a necessary justice a debt due to the churches safety and to the work of reformation and which they could with no tolerable reason either in duty or polity have omitted  if in the deposing of ministers who appeared scandalous or ignorant the party think fit to complain of injustice and oppression partiality and persecution and think fit to desire me to exhibit to the world a list of the names and circumstances of the several ministers deposed and the charges against them together with the form how proved and how in most places confessed i am content and shall on their first notice let the world see who and how many ministers have been deposed by the church and for what and the article of persecution shall with all my heart turn upon the merits of it but if they would take my advice it should be to let this be one of the last things they do lest it give the world too plain a demonstration of the absolute necessity the church was under to reform the ministry and tell a little too plainly what a sort of clergy they had to deal with  the deposing scandalous ignorant or immoral persons therefore i believe will not be called persecution  the whole question then must depend upon the second head viz deposing ministers for not qualifying themselves according to law and though this is a direct act of the state and is the same in england now practiced by the very same high churchmen that make this complaint and i could be very merry with our highflying jacobit clergy who have qualified themselves in england and yet retain their antirevolutionprinciples  yet i wave that advantage and i am content to call it so far as the church was the immediate instrument i say i am content to call it the act and deed of the church because giving them all the latitude in their own way of arguing however unfair their confutation will be with the greater force and the more fatal to them  the government was no sooner established by the revolution and the kirk restored to her judicatorial authority but her several courts as session presbytery synod and assembly took their courses and began to act  by the first act of parliament for settling these matters past june      0 entitled act ratifying the confession of faith and settling presbyterian church government it is ordained that the general assembly the ministers and elders should have power to try and purge out all insufficient scandalous and erroneos ministers by due course of ecclesiastic process and censures but this act no where empowered them to censure any who were not insufficient scandalous or erroneous tho they would not take the oaths to the government  so that by this law the church could not be capable of persecution  it may be objected here that to be episcopal might be adjudged erroneous by this judicatory and so come under the church censure by authority of this act  to this it is replied  first in fact no man was ever since the revolution deposed by the church merely for being episcopal nor was any process ever commenced against any man on that foundation  and here by the way if this be true as i can challenge the world to contradict it i would humbly recommend it to those gentlemen who are now in england raising charities and obtaining contributions pretending it is for the relief of the poor distressed episcopal clergy in scotland who are suffering persecution to tell the world what it is they are persecuted for   the gentlemen who bestow their charity would do  require some documents or certificates of them to  the particulars and especially one exceeding busy  for those charities and who styles himself a persecuted episcopal minister whose name may in time be made more public would do well to tell them whether he was deprived which he calls persecution for his conscience or his vice for his religion or for his morals for episcopacy or or relapse fornication  but secondly to put this out of question it was particularly declared by the first general assembly after the revolution viz in the sixth session in the year    0 that this assembly will depose no incubents simply for their judgment anent the government of the church nor urge reordination upon them vid index of the unprinted acts of the assembly sess      0  in the same assembly in their instructions given to their commission which was to sit during their recess we have these words  that they be very cautious of receiving informations against the late conformists and that they proceed in the matter of censure very deliberately so as none may have just cause to complain of their rigidity and that they shall not proceed to censure but upon relevant libels and sufficient probation act   th sess   th assembly    0  again lest the presbyteries should be rash or severe the commission is empowered as follows that if they shall be informed of any precipitant procedure of the presbyteries in such processes to restrain them vid the same act as above  if then they were thus moderate even in scandalous things and declared against proceeding in cases merely episcopal where shall we find the article of persecution  it is true that in the year      an act of parliament was made to deprive all such ministers as would not both swear to the government and acknowledge the church government also and the confession of faith  but the occasion of this act is visible to all that know the affais of that time  that it was past to satisfy the minds of the people who were exceedingly disturbed at the churches having been insulted in the assembly      by a general formula procured by the episcopal clergy together with their appeal to the king on a refusal and the assembly being abruptly dissolved or dismissed sine die which put the nation into a very great fermentation  yet upon this act i may challenge the episcopal clergy to show me one minister that ever was deposed for not acknowledging the church if at the same time he offered to acknowledge the government and take the oaths and they have been often challenged on this head  and to confirm this lenity of practice by a law that famous act of parliament was made in the year      wherein taking the oaths to the government is made the only and fully sufficient qualification and all ministers that would so qualify themselves are continued as may be seen at large by the act entitled act concerning the church anno       this very act of parliament if i were to go no further effectually clears the church of scotland from the charge of persecution since it is plain there was no religious tenet in dispute but a civil question of owning or not owning the government  it was by this act of parliament taken quite out of the power of the church to depose any man merely for being episcopal in principle or for refusing to own the presbyterian church nay the episcopal clergy who by virtue of this act remain in their livings many of them to this day refuse to acknowledge the church to submit to any of her judicatories or to join either in discipline or worship and yet in all their affronts of the established church they continue in their paroches preaching and using all their formalities however contrary to the inclinations and desires of the people who in some places are fain to set up meeting houses in their paroches and be at the charge of entertaining a presbyterian minister as a dissenter to preach to them because they cannot bear the fopperies and opposition of their paroch minister  i would fain have those people that cry out of the persecution of the episcopal clergy go to some of these paroches and see this uncouth jest where the persecuting established church is fain to submit to a meeting house and the persecuted episcopal clergyman insults them from the parish church and keeps both the pulpit and the stipend in spite of them all  here is the established church turned dissenter and the dissenter made the incumbent the persecutor become the persecuted and per contra the persecuted made the persecutor but of this more presently  the churches power to persecute being thus limited by act of parliament it remains to examine in what manner she has exercised that power she had for in this article must ly the matter of this charge or they must have more than a spirit of divination that can find it out  in order to this i must enquire what this power they had was and that is a very short question  their power it is plain was only against such ministers who were scandalous etc as before or would not take the oaths to the government nor pray for king william and queen mary  whether they were or were not absolutely bound up to censure all such as would not thus qualify themselves is a question i shall speak to hereafter  it follows to examine how the church has executed this power and whether lenity or severity has been her temper in the case and to state this as clearly as possible i must make the gentlemen one fair proposal  before i entered upon this work i have not only searched into all the public records of this matter which i could have access to but have made as strict enquiry as possibly i could of the most impartial and unbiased persons for any particular case wherein any excursion might have been beyond this power or wherein the charge of persecution might ly  and having done this with the utmost impartiality and not being able to find any thing and having not the honor to be acquaited with any of the deposed clergy who might have furnished me with some of the particulars i cannot but earnestly entreat some of these reverend gentlemen who have suffered under these severe persecutions to tell the world what they are and wherein the church of scotland has either exceeded her limited power or indeed fully exerted it in any case so as to deserve the black charge of persecution assuring them that if i could by all my search and inquiry tho now upon the spot have found out but one instance in which the church had thus persecuted them or any of them i would never have wrote one line in her defense  perhaps it may be alleged here that imposing oaths upon the ministers who thinking themselves bound by former oath to their late king could not in conscience comply with them is persecution especially when it is considered that this imposing the said oaths was enforced on pain of deprivation and the scruples of these oaths in many who could otherwise have complied being merely conscientious to deprive them on that account is persecution in the abstract being persecution purely for conscience sake  in answering this which is the most material thing can be said i must make several remarks  i really gentlemen speaking to the complainers in the south those of the clergy in scotland who are persecuted at all are only persecuted on this account and therein two things will follow    that all the dissenting clergy in scotland are jacobites and suffer only for refusing to take the oaths to the government    that really the  jacobite clergy in the north of britain are much honester men than their brethren in the south since those universally have suffered deprivation and loss of their livings for their principle but in the south hundreds retaining in their equivocating way their loyalty in principle to their abdicated king have loaded themselves with oaths abjurations and every thing the government has thought fit to lay upon them and yet on all occasions act against that very government they swear to  publicly pray for king william and queen mary and now for queen anne  and privately for king james both father and son drink queen anns health and king james the viiiths alternately or occasionally as suites their company these are a sort of hypocrites equally detested by both parties and equally dangerous to both but of this by the way  ii if the putting these gentlemen out of their livings be a persecution then the church and government in england have been as guilty of persecution as the church and government in scotland since all the clergy in one as well as in the other were deposed and turned out who would not take the oaths and the high churchmen who have joined themselves to the church of england and consequently made themselves parties to that kind of persecution ought by no means to call it so in scotland unless they are content to share the scandal  iii the dissenters in england even under all the advantages of tolleration are as much persecuted as the episcopal clergy in scotland since not one of their ministers can preach the quakers excepted without taking the same oaths and not only so but signing the confession of faith of the established church a few small provisos for their particular principles only excepted  lastly all this persecution if it can be called by that name is the act and deed of the state it is a debt to the public peace it is the necessary consequence of the revolution and of the abolishing episcopacy things wholly national antecedent to the church settlement and not at all the act or concern of the church of scotland nor can it be brought as part of a charge against them  i come now to examine how the church has extended and exerted the real power she has and how far she has proceeded in the very execution of the law and if i do prove here that she has been so far from enforcing these laws or putting forth her power in extremities or severities that she has rather neglected her own safety suffered her self to be imperfectly settled her power contemned her ministers insulted her acts of assembly slighted and her discipline disregarded and this only because she was loath to push things to extremities loath to make examples loath to use severities and willing as much as could consist with government and safety to spare bear with and deal gently with those who in their power showed her no favor and even under this treatment show her no manner of respect  if i say i prove this i think i shall effectually clear her of the slander so industriously spread abroad and so positively asserted of her being of persecuting principles and if i do not prove this i do nothing  i confess this will drive me to the necessity of exposing some of the names of these gentlemen who by this connivance and lenity of the church peaceably enjoy tho i cannot say they gratefully acknowledge it those benefices and livings which they had by their other circumstance forfeited to the laws but the necessary defense of truth obliging me to it those gentlemen must blame their friends who have made this unhappy necessity not me who i assure them have no personal grudge either at them or at the connivance granted them and only wish they would in a more peaceable and respectful manner enjoy it  the list of names contains two ranks or sorts of people and either of them are testimonies of the public moderation one of the government and one of the church in particular and both of them will serve to make the complaint of persecution and severities look very odly  the lists are twofold and not to interrupt the thread of discourse i have placed one of them by way of appendix at the end of this book i have forborne abundance of reflections and just remarks on the ircumstances and particular conduct of the gentlemen named there not that i am ignorant of the particulars and shall at any time gratify them with necessary comments upon them if they desire it  but to let them see that even in this account i forbear to expose them farther than the necessary defense of the case before me calls for and i am very sorry they have done any thing to bring this upon them  by the first list which i have not printed but in the public registers any one may see it it will appear that there are now preaching and possessing their respective parish churches above threescore ministers who were profestly and openly episcopal but on their submitting to and acknowledging the presbyterian establishment were received to ministerial communion and many of them are now worthy members of the present church by which one thing will be unanswerably proved  viz that not one episcopal minister in the whole kingdom of scotland has been deposed for his principle that is not for his being episcopal or for his nonconformity to the established presbyterian church but merely for jacobitism for his refusing to own the government and acknowledge the queen since would he have taken the oaths and prayed for the sovereign it was not in the power of the general ssembly which is the representative of the church to depose or persecute them at all  i know this will be a surprising thing to abundance of honest people in england who hitherto have had other notions and i cannot but desire them to consider    how impossible it is to be true that the church of scotland should persecute the episcopal clergy for their nonconformity when by act of parliament it was not in their power to molest or depose any minister however episcopal in his rinciple or ractice if he would but take the oaths to the government and pray for the king or queen and when it was in their power they reponed all those that would come in    this clears the ivil government also from being any way cruel severe or persecuting to the episcopal clergy since all they required was only conformity to the civil magistrate and complying with the laws of the land  and in this case it would be worth notice also how different the terms of this conformity were in this government from the like terms of conformity in the times of episcopal government  in this the penalty of refusing was only deprivation of their benefices in the lergy and in the laity nothing at all in those days banishment imprisonment and death at the mercy of every soldier was the lot not of the clergy only but of every person and many have been murdered in cold blood without mercy for refusing not only to swear to the king but only for refusing to say god save the king  i know the poor people are branded here with weakness and obstinacy  but two things seem to be a present answer to that    these were but a few and those of the meanest and weakest of the people    the weaker the people the more cruel and barbarous the severity of those times that should put them to death for such trifles taking them by the handle of their mistaken nicety    it is evident it was only taking advantage of the zeal of a people which run beyond the bounds of reason  since if they had not had that handle they would have sought some other and it was plain that where they found the people complying with those demands they scapd not the better but they always found pretenses to murder them    the poor people are not so much to be blamed since they understood god save the king was to pray god to prosper the king in the persecution of their brethren  it is farther confirmed that the civil government has not persecuted or been cruel or severe to these gentlemen since not only they continued all the ministers that would give but the security of their oaths for their peaceable behavior a thing no government in the world would dispense with but since that the treatment of those that have been deposed has been such so gentle so tender and so forbearing as i believe all circumstances considered no nation in the world can parallel of which and their behavior to the government under that lenity i may speak by it self  and i cannot but recommend the gentlemen who are complainers here to her majestys answer to the deposed clergy who addressed in the beginning of her reign for their liberty viz to behave themselves peaceably and subject themselves to the government which however some of them were willing to construe as a declaration of liberty and to use it in a different way from her majestys intention they might have found more reason had they judged impartially to have taken for a reproof of their unpeaceable behavior and ungrateful temper to the government which had so gently treated them  again i observe as this effectually clears the government of scotland from the charge of persecution so the second list will with much more reason and no doubt to the astonishment of a great part of the english nation who shall read it abundantly clear up the reputation of the church of scotland from the horrid slander of persecution being an account of     episcopal ministers must of whom have neither complied with the church nor with the government have neither submitted to the presbyterian establishment in discipline or church government nor qualified themselves as by act of parliament is required that own neither civil government nor ecclesiastic that neither pray for the queen nor swear to the queen nor acknowledge either queen or church and yet by the mere forbearance of the church are now peaceably enjoying their benefices stipends and appurtenances preach publicly to the people and live in the open profession of the most opposite principles to the establishment  would any man that knew all this have the face to say this is a persecuting church would any church in the world that had a legal and national establishment suffer in defyance of her authority and in contempt of her establishment what this church suffers and what in mere backwardnes to persecution she bears with  perhaps it may be asked here what is it she bears with and i know great noise is made that the episcopal people here are not so different as in england from the presbyterians having no service book habits or ceremonies and therefore the things they bear with are but trifles and the moderation the less to be insisted on  but this is not so easy to make good as to say for it is not the mere articles of ceremony and habits that make the weiht of the difference in england any more than here and if the difference is but a trifle the argument is stronger against those who for trifles divide from the established church than against the established church who expect their conformity  but it is evident let the differences in religion be what they will the difference here lies chiefly in civil matters all their qualifications depending upon swearing to the government so that it is not so much presbytery and episcopacy which is the dispute as it is liberty and tyrrany king william and the revolution or king james and arbitrary power queen anne and the protestant succession or an abdicated race and french tyranny  and yet be sides this these unqualified ministers with whom the church thus behaves and with whose insolency she bears in so many articles  differ in many things which no established church in the world that i have ever read of would allow or connive at  and to descend a little to particulars it may be observed that they i mean generally speaking in all or most part of the following particulars are constantly omitting    they pray not for the queen etc   they refuse to sign the confession of faith   they submit not to church censures or acknowledge church judicatories   they refuse to lecture or expound before sermon which all other ministers are obliged to by an act of assembly every morning   they keep no session but the presbytery are obliged to appoint others to do it to preserve justice and order in the church   they ordain no elders   they examine not their communicants before the sacrament as all other ministers do and are obliged to do i do not say every one of them are guilty of all these omissions  but all are guilty of some of them some of all of them and others of more than these  and to this may be added that they are universally declared jacobites and professed enemies to the protestant succession  would any man now imagine that this hot furious persecuting church of scotland under whom such cruel sufferings and barbarous things are complained of should bear with ministers and continue them in their livings ay and some of them very good livings too merely in tenderness and backwardness to the thing called severity is this persecution blush gentlemen of the episcopal clergy for these people who have thus officiously exposed you and if you have any honesty and gratitude any sense of kindness upon you do justice to those who in spite of all your public owning your own principles and disowning theirs forborne to obey even their known constitution and have declined pushing things to extremity upon you in hopes your discretion would one time or other bring you to own their government or at least acknowledge their civility charity and compassion to you  i might here give a list of ministers who having been deposed or suspended by respective presbyteries or by commissioners appointed to inspect have yet by the tenderness of the church in the commission of the assembly been reponed and placed in their livings again only upon feigned submissions promises of conformity to discipline lecturing before sermon and the like and yet as soon as replacd have renounced those submissions in practice returned to their former omissions left off lecturing reassumed their little formalities and professed themselves openly episcopal and yet the church has taken no advantage against them  i might as i hinted before give a list of ministers whose open omission of discipline lecturing and all manner of church order together with their slackness meanness and formalities in their performances are so perfectly disagreeable to their people that they are obliged to get presbyterian ministers to preach in meeting houses like dissenters among them and yet the church bears with all this rather than persecute them  but i omit these things till i am farther necessitated to expose them but they that question the fact may inquire about mr patrick lion at kinghorn and mr john anderson late at dysert etc and at several other places where they may be fully satisfied of most of the particulars  i come now to the treatment those really called dissenters those who are actually deposed meet with from the church and this will almost force me to enter a little into a long and black account of the treatment the church meets with from them in which i shall however be very tender being unwilling to expose any bodies frailties more than mere necessity forces me to  i doubt not but if i should say that these dissenting episcopal ministers who are thus deposed do now and then take the liberty very privately to preach it would with some wonder and more difficulty be believed in england where the general opinion is so strangely have people been imposed upon that they are entirely suppressed that they dare not meet or exercise any religious worship that they are daily insulted by mobs and pursud by the session and presbyteries merely for serving god according to their consciences  but how will these people behave themselves how will ye be amazed to think in what manner you have been imposed upon and how easily you have suffered your selves to be abused when i shall assure you that not one word of all this is true when i shall tell you that the episcopal party in scotland enjoy at this time and have done for several years all the liberty which the dissenters in england do now enjoy and that with conditions vastly differing  i st they have their full liberty by the mere lenity and forbearance of the government which in england could never be obtained but in little intervals but by act of parliament    they have the same liberty tho they not only refuse to take the oaths but refuse to sign the doctrinal articles of the confession of faith tho even the church of england owns them to be all orthodox a thing the dissenters in england are not permitted in no not by the act of tolleration    they enjoy this liberty notwithstanding they openly and in their public assemblies not only omit praying for the queen but some of them actually and distinctly pray for their james the viii and for his restoration which is not only praying for a popish prince but praying god to depose or cut off her present majesty and affront so horridly impious and so offensive to all her majestys subjects that one would wonder the most moderate principle in the world could bear with it  and what will you say now gentlemen of the high church in england when i shall tell you there are now fourteen or sixteen of these meeting houses in the city of edinburgh just in the face of the general assembly of the church and in the eyes of the government and that in any town or place in the kingdom where they have hearers they have the same  that in some of these they have newly set up the common prayer book a thing in the height of episcopacy they never attempted and which even the episcopal party in general were never reconciled to  and that in not one of these meetings that ever i heard of the queen is prayed for by name but in some directly they pray for the king which must mean their james the viii or worse and in others they pray in ambiguous words such as the queen or the royal family and if i am not misinformed in some for king james the eighth in so many words  it is true that in these open insults both of government and church they have in their turn met with some few oppositions from the people who have been provoked at such indignities done to their sovereign and to the government in the face of the sun and these little rabbles they would call persecution  and yet even in these cases the government has carefully suppressed the tumult and voluntarly made reparation to private families for the damnages they have pretended to have sustained and that often beyond the real spoil though at the same time their own imprudent and provoking carriage has been the principal occasion of these damnages and this is evident in the city of glasgow in particular the only time they can talk of where the rabble assaulting a jacobite conventicle or episcopal meeting for there is very little difference between them at any time and less there than on most occasions the city paid the owner of the house several hundred pounds sterling for the supposed damnage he received which in all appearance so far exceeded his loss that it is no breach of charity to believe he would be pleased to have his house rabbled once a week at the same price  nor would i have any highflying church of england man insist upon this sort of ersecution i mean the common people rabbling the meetings of the jacobite dissenters since even in this kind also the dissenters in england have suffered persecution from them and lest i should send them for the particulars to ludlow in wales pensans in cornwall and several other places where the meeting houses have been either pulled down when built or the persons obliged to convert the building and the ground to other uses  behold now gentlemen in the south the cruelties and severities the persecutions and furious deasings of the presbyterian church in scotland and where is the sufferings of the episcopal clergy now where are the martyrs of that number what are the sufferings of which one of our pamphleteers says they exceed the dragoonings in france  but i am told there is a remaining objection yet behind viz that even these dissenting ministers that have been put out for not taking the oaths are persecuted and prosecuted for the private exercise of their function as ministers and for that have been severely treated  i am sorry to be driven to the necessity of telling such unhappy truths which i wish were concealed i mean of such practices as will not reflect upon the parties we speak of only but upon the whole protestant body of christians in the world and therefore i entreat the gentlemen not to oblige me to publish the particulars in vindication of the church who would be unaccountably negligent and even their enemies themselves would reproach them with it if such things as are not fit to be named among christians should have been suffered to be practiced by ministers of the gospel and they that had a power and right of judicatory should have been silent in it for fear of the scandal of persecution  and should i here enter only into an enquiry about the incestuous marriages the frequent marrying men to other mens wives and women to other womens husbands or in short a general joining together persons as man and wife without either publication in the church which is the general law of the nation or sufficient information of circumstances which in common prudence and defense of their own reputation they might be supposed to do  if these things i say and the mischiefs that have followed should be brought on the stage to justify the legal prosecutions the church has made on that account it would make sad work in the characters of the persons the gentlemen therefore must not pretend to call it persecution the omission of which would have been an inlet to all manner of adulteries a ienc to the most scandalous vices and a general gate of destruction to families  excepting therefore such scandalous practices which the church of scotland could by no means avoid pursuing and detecting how often have these gentlemen been challenged to produce one instance of any minister who has been persecuted or prosecuted merely for preaching in a meeting or fr any part of his ministerial office which he has executed however contrary to law if not circumstanced also with somethig scandalous and intolerable  their lawful marriages are not at all controverted and if due publication be made according to law that incests and adulteries may be prevented they have not been prohibited to marry they baptize and that without the parent subjecting himself to necessary examination and yet the church bears with it and scruples none of their baptisms nor rebaptizes any  they marry contrary both to the civil and ecclesiastic constitution without publication of bannes protestants to papists and papists to protestants in the most clandestine manner and some have been detected of those practices and perhaps may call it persecution but i suppose they would be ath to have their cases brought upon the stage to enquire into the circumstances in order to the churches vindication antidating testimonials given to persons they have married to cover adulteries and fornications of the persous uilty thereby intending to keep them from church censures as by testifications acknowledged by themselves when called before the several presbyteries which testimoials i have ready to produce at their service  also declaring in their testimonials given to persons mared by them they were free from scandal whilst mean time they were under censure for trelapse fornication and that in the metropolitan city of scotland  by these things they have robbed some of the noblest of the nation of their daughters and made strange confusions in families innumerable instances of which are ready to be roduced at their demand  shall we next enquire into matters of discipline and what sad truths might we tell here  how when persons of scandalous lives fornicators who refuse to submit to the ensures of the law or other persons who for open vices are refused admittance to the saraments come to them they receive them and too frequently without scruples or examinations thus they daily break all manner of order and discipline in the church invade the udicial authority of the session weaken the hands of discipline in the checking and reproving immoralities a stand in the way of the general reformation and yet  none of these things are they persecuted or molested  where then is the persecution they talk of  now they are attempting a new project viz to ca themselves members of the church of england and for fecting this they are setting up the book of common prar in their meetings that the church of england may  obliged to own them and concern themselves to obtain  them a tolleration and since this brings me necessar to speak of tolleration particularly as it respects scotland shall give my opinion freely by way of recommendation to both kirk and dissenters  i to the episcopal dissenters i would sincere advise them never to ask a tolleration for if ev it should be granted them two things would happ which would be their inevitable destruction    it is certain this tolleration would be clog with the same obligation to law and establishmen as tolleration of dissenters in england now is it cnot be imagined any government would tolerate the who would not own that government and oblige themselves to submit to it i cannot suppose your friends  have the face to ask for it on any other terms the toleration in england had never been obtained with it the church of england whose principle is loyaty and subjection to authority cannot ask it for  upon any other conditions it is impossible they can  it they would fly in the face of their own practi and be obliged to restore all the nonjurant clergy their church whom they have deposed on the ve same account  if then the church of england should interceed so far  your behalf or by their interest in the parliament of brita obtain a bill to be brought in for tollerating all the disseters in the north called scotland and but this one cla should be added provided they submit to take the oaths to  government what will you do gentlemen    if you refuse you are quite undone all the wo church of england and every body will be against y tha you should desire tolleration from a government you will not submit to and all your cries of persecution will be laughed at since twill be plain it is not religion but revolution you contend about so you will no more be called dissenters but nonjurors and be universally sorted with your brethren the jacolites who are spued out by the government and cast out by the church of england as neither sit to be concernd with the one or received into the other    well but what if you comply why then you are undone too for first you will break and divide among your selves some will go one way and some another and as you are weak enough already you will then lose all the figure you make in the world and no body will trouble themselves about you for all the nest jacobites will desert you  besides in this you will act the unaccountablest part that ever any people did and will be fitter to go to a hospital than a meeting house for why should you take the oaths to preach in a meeting house since had you taken the oaths you had never been put out of the churches and for the same compliance may be supposed to get in again this would be doing and undoing and make you absolutely ridiculous  if i may therefore offer my opinion gentlemen my humble advice is that if you will be dissenters stand just where you are and be satisfied for a legal tolleration will be your ruin  i would offer one thing more if you can accept of advice and that is that you would regulate your conduct so as dissenters and act so like christians and ministers that your friends in the church of england may not be ashamed of you or ashamed to interceed for you  that you would no more be the refuge of the vicious the skreen of the adulterer the protectors of immoral and profane persons if you would be thought religious dissenters let us see something of religion among you something of discipline and order that the sacred ordinances of the christian church may not be abused and exposed by you  and that the established church may be encouraged to be easy with you and may not be obliged in her own defense and for the support of common conversation to prosecute you for unsufferable irregularities and you be daily complaining of those proceedings under the sham name of ersecution  i know not whether you will please to accept of this advice or no perhaps be it never so good you will reject it for the sake of its disagreeable author but be that as you please i am sure the caution is for your advantage use it as you think fit  if i was to turn the discourse to the church of scotland it should be  have no more concern about this matter gentlemen be not afraid of the mischiefs of tolleration if the episcopal clergy or any body for them complain if they desire a tolleration tell them with all your hearts on the same terms the dissenters in england have it they shall have it when they please and since the tolleration of dissenters in england is made the great argument for tolleration here they cannot have the face to desire better conditions than those dissenters are contented with  and fear not the consequences either they will accept it thus or they will not  if they will accept it from that moment you may date the destruction of their party and the abolishing the very name of dissenting in scotland as before  if they will not accept it you are for ever clear either of the reproach of having denied it to them or of the slander so much noise has been made of i mean persecution  but i cannot omit one note here and that turns the argument to a third party viz the civil magistrate and here i shall leave it only by way of interrogation and let who will answer the question i shall wait to see it debated and may perhaps then say more to it  are you sure the tolleration desired is consistent with the treaty of union  that it does not interfere with the postulata of the union and the conjunction of both kingdoms and particularly are you sure that it makes no invasion upon the act of security upon which the church of scotland is now established and which act is made an essential indissolvible branch of the treaty  and as this merits very well to be inquired into on both sides so give me leave to say if it does no power now constituted in britain can grant it  the words of the act for scuring the presbytrian church government and which are particularly applicatory to this afe are as follows and i wish they were thoroughly considered   therefore her majesty with advice and consent  the said estates of parliament does hereby establish and con the said true protestant religion and the worship discipline and government of this church to contiue without any alteration to the people of this land in all succeeding generations  if this be an inviolable unalterable law and that as i most certain even the parliament of britain cannot invade it we have nothing to do here but to desire these gentlemen to instruct us how to answer this question  whether if either by act of parliament royal prerogative or any other way except y the grant and gift of the church of scotland her self the episcopal party should obtain a tolleration of worship the government of the church of scotland continues without any alteration  i do not make an exception for the gift and consent of the church here as if that could qualify such a law  for even the grant and consent of the church could not now make it lawful the church cannot now give away her own rights they are a debt to posterity and she is bound equally with the government in all succeeding generations by the obligations of the union  but i grant the church may by their moderation charity and tenderness suffer and permit the episcopal dissenters to exercise their separate way of worship without exerting their power of government to their disturbance and this i hope they will continue to do and this leads me naturally to two things by way of caution to the gentlemen on the other side    this lenity and moderation is already practiced to you and the church does bear with you even to excess if that word be suitable to moderation and it cannot be grateful in you to push your complaints to such extremities and to force the friends of the church to defend themselves and her by stating the case fairly in the sight of the world since in those defenses some things must necessarily appear to your disadvantage    it cannot but move you to behave so as to merit the continuance of that moderation for if it be only in the power of the church to make you easy as i believe will appear at last you may despise it as much as you please but your only prudent way is to deserve it by a modest peaceable and christian behavior and when you have tried all other ways perhaps you may be the better convinced of the seasonableness of such advice and this i leave to time to open your eyes in  a list of

list mentioned in page   d of this tract many of whom to this day behave themselves to the established church much wore than the professed jacobites and nonjurant dissenters insulting the church judicatories and bidding defiance to their authority  behaving themselves with all manner of rudeness and indecency  intruding into churches without the call of the people or any legal proceeding and keeping possession against the direct authority of the church in defiance of the respective presbyteries and contrary to the laws of the land  these indeed are things which deserve a farther discovery to the world and may in time have it done to their satisfaction but mean time the matter of fact is sufficient to the present case and the inquiry into particulars may remain to another occasion   conclusion i cannot conclude this affair without nothing something to the several parties    to the episcopal dissenters i do not say nor suggest that there are none of them who are religious conscientious dissenters and dissent merely on account of conscience tho i believe such are very few  but to such i say the church is and i would be sorry they were not as tender as possible they do not exclude them from even ministerial communion if they please to accept it nor do they exclude the lay dissenters from any church privileges or impose any terms of communion upon them    to the deposed clergy i would put them in mind to examine whether the clergy of the present church have not behaved to them with humanity and charity in their private capacities as well as in their public whether they have not raised large contributions among them of mere tenderness to their circumstances and given them considerable sums for their relief whether they have not endeavored to recover the funds formerly raised called the centesima being a provision for the widows and orphans of the clergy and ordered it to be set apart for the widows and orphans of the episcopal clergy only and whether they do not continue daily to relieve the dissenting episcopal clergy by collections and giving themselves largely to their supply    to those who may be forward to object that i seem to invade the churches intrinsic power in saying she had her power to act in an established method from an act of parliament p to these i say if they please to compare it with other places of this book they will find no room for that thought nor am i concerned to enter here into that debate i take the act in the sense the church accepted it viz a civil sanction to their power which if it did not add to their real power might however add to the public regard paid to that power    to these who object that i here acknowledge the church has not done her duty and that if she had not persecuted she ought to have done it i leave them to consider again a declaration of the church of england lately made at the head of the occasional bill viz that persecution for conscience is inconsistent with and contrary to the principles of the christian religion  lastly as to the list abovementioned i do not positively say none of the persons there named have never taken the oaths tho i am told they have not no not one but that they are all openly and declaredly episcopal i believe no man will debate with me  i however make these cautionary hints because i know i am to expect all the cavil angry men can raise at this book which nevertheless i hope tho in my absence it may have no defender will stand upon its own foundation of truth in fact and i am sure has been wrote with all possible caution as to personal wrong   finis
