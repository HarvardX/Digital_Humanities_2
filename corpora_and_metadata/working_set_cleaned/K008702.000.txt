a treatise on the teeth  wherein the true causes of the several disorders to which they are liable are considered and the precautions necessary to their preservation particularly pointed out  together with observations on the practice of scaling the teeth  on the use of dentrific powders in general  and on the diseases of children in the time of toothing  by a tolver surgeon  london printed for lockyer davis at lord bacons head near salisburycourt fleet street       a treatise on the teeth the teeth formation which are the hardest and smoothest bones of the body are formed within the cavities of the jaws above the gums they are not covered by any membrane but within their sockets are invested with the common covering of all other bones viz the periosteum a fine transparent skin observable in scraping any bone after the meat is taken clean off  the number of teeth in a grown person are generally thirtysix more or less according to age constitution etc as they are not all formed at once so neither do they all appear at the same time the last but one of the great teeth in each jaw it is remarkable seldom appears till about the age of twentyone and the last sometimes not till that of forty  each tooth is composed of an internal bony substance and an external vitrious cortex of a solid hard consistence and of the color of ivory the uses of this glossy substance are to prevent the teeth being worn by the friction they undergo in mastication or chewing and to preserve their bony substance from the air  the different shape and series of the teeth are sufficiently obvious the four front teeth in each jaw which are thin and broad are called incissores or cutters from their cutting or dividing the aliment the canini or dogteeth which are two in each jaw are so called from their resemblance to the tusks of a dog those of the upper jaw are by some called the eyeteeth from the communication of nerves betwixt them and the eyes they are thick and round terminating in a sharp point and like the incissores have but one root but are remarkably strong and of a greater length than any of the rest their proper use being to pierce and hold the aliment steady when we bite it as the front teeth are very apt to be forced outward by the things we hold or break with them  the large or double teeth are by anatomists called molares or grinders from their use in grinding and making small our aliment before it is swallowed they are ten in each jaw their extremities are broad and uneven and because the pressure upon them is perpendicular they are provided with two or three and sometimes four roots separated a little from one another and inclining somewhat outward that in chewing our aliment the pressure may be less upon the jaws than if they run directly downwards and with only a single root  the first teeth according to hippocrates are engendered in time of pregnancy this urbain hemard confesses he never could discover he says indeed that having opened the jaws of some children three or four days old and others immediately at their birth he has found the incissores the canini and some of the molares on each side the jaw in part ossified and in part mucilaginous of a middling size and surrounded with their little alveoli  however this may be it is certain they do not appear until some time after the formation of the other bones notwithstanding the matter of which they are formed is at the same time in the womb and therefore galen de usu partium lib ii chap   writes that he who would understand the works of nature and observe her economy in the composition of the human body ought not implicitly to rely on what he finds in books but rather what he sees with his eyes  the teeth are formed within the cavities of the jaws which are lined with a thin membrane supplied with several vessels conveying a thick viscous transparent liquor which as it increases hardens into the form of teeth  this transparent humor appears first in form of a mucus afterward a thin cortical lamella and some ossious strata are perceived with a large cavity in the middle then gradually both the vitrious and bony parts increase by the hardening of the mucus and opposition of new matter  the ossious strata are no other than a separation of this fluid matter made by the same membrane which covers the whole cavity of the jaw and this division forms two lays one below the other the uppermost of which forms the teeth which come out first but about the seventh year they are thrust out by the teeth made at the undermost lay which then begin to sprout if these latter be lost they seldom if ever grow again some are indeed observed to shed their teeth twice which must be owing to their having three lays of this matter  the teeth receive nerves and vessels at the orifices of their roots it is these nerves which are afflicted in the toothach and which are frequently shown to the common people by the ignorant among toothdrawers for worms which they pretend would have eaten the whole tooth in a short time etc part of these nerves being always torn away with the tooth drawn it requires great care to keep the mouth warm until the gum becomes closed and the nerve defended from the air  this orifice commonly closes about the age of thirtyfive which is the reason why old people are not so subject to the toothache as young  the first teeth perceived are the incissores of the upper jaw then those of the lower these being the thinnest and sharpest after them appear the canini and last of all the molares  the general opinion is that the teeth are connected to thin alveoli or sockets by that kind of suture called gomphosis that is like a nail drove into a piece of wood but this is proved to be false by the following experiment if the jaws be macerated in water for some time all the teeth will drop out which they would not do if they were of the same size of their alveoli from hence it appears that it is by a ligament or by the articulation called synchondrosis  that the teeth are joined to their sockets by some means like this is evident for when a tooth has been drawn and replaced immediately it has taken root and been as firm as ever which could not have happened had not the cavity been lined with a membrane which contained it  after all that can be said concerning the formation of the teeth nothing will so much illustrate the tooth in embrio as that called the sweettooth in a calf by which the reader may form an idea not only of the color and substance of the mucus or juice usually sucked out but of the lamella or shellwork itself  the use of the teeth the teeth are so necessary to man that i conceive the greatest difficulty of his subsisting in the younger part of his life without them certain it is that the strongest constitution would not be able to digest or separate a quantity of chyle sufficient for the nourishment of the body for any considerable time were the aliment to be swallowed whole and unprepared for it is well known how much the chewing our aliment contributes to the easy and expeditious digestion of it and consequently to our health there are indeed many old people and others who for want of teeth are confined to a liquid diet such as broths jellies milk etc for the sake of an easy digestion to those in old age i think such a diet not only proper but very necessary for nature by the decay of strength the loss of teeth and the gradual diminution of our senses seems to have appointed this time as a return to our primary innocence that we may make our exit in some measure conformable with our birth and at this time the weakness of the body generally renders it incapable of performing the natural functions and consequently of digesting such meats as before it had been accustomed to  upon a transient reflection we might imagine it injudicious of nature to leave age thus helpless and unable to support itself but upon a more careful survey we shall find in this as well as in all her works that her economy is absolutely just and that every minute variation of form etc is important whenever we think otherwise we ought always to suspect our capacities of being too gross to comprehend the sublimity of her wisdom  the loss of teeth to an old man is in fact but trifling for the human body is so providentially disposed that as the natural powers begin to lessen i their force and action the less is required in the constitution to maintain that force and action and that a less quantity of chyle will better nourish and support health in old age is a truth every anatomist is able to assert for it is frequently seen in the dissections of the older subjects that many of the small vessels and sometimes part of the larger also have been collapsed and grown up so as to reject the fluid that used to circulate through them and this is one reason why old people are most subject to paralytic disorders  if the number of vessels be diminished as in this case they certainly are then is there the less required to fill them and the body is more easily supported than before and from hence it is that we can so well dispense with the loss of teeth when old but when this loss happens earlier in life i think it may justly be deemed very great since it is capable of depriving us of our health our beauty our voice nor does the inconveniency stop here it proves of detriment even to society  if such extensive effects appear strange let the husbandman so necessary to society be viewed in this state and we shall soon be convinced that the want of teeth is of greater moment than is commonly imagined it would oblige him to live on a liquid diet by no means proper in his laborious employ for we are not the least capable to support the continual action of the body and which in his business is almost violent without proper food i mean such as will remain some time in the stomach and yield its nourishment gradually to the lacteal vessels which receive and carry it to the blood  this is always performed by such food either animal or vegetable and if the diet of the labourer consisted only of those juices exclusive of the substances though these latter afford no part of nourishment yet the body would waste the fibers would become lax the intestines would lose their tone and a general languor would seize the whole body and if not relieved by a change of diet a diarrhea dropsy etc would be the certain introduction to death  the consequence of a liquid diet is no where more obvious than in the old sedentary man in whom by an inactive life the viscera are rendered weak and the vigor of the digesting powers in a great measure lost for want of use he is indeed better able to support life than the working man as he is void of the fatigue but with what great difficulty it is effected may be seen in his pale languid countenance his emaciated body and the defect of vigor in his motion  i cannot help reflecting in this place on the general error of men fond of study whose contemplative geniuses inclining them to a life in other respects full of indolence and neglect they suppose it agreeable to their way of life to eat their aliment liquid and prepared for an expeditious passage in the primae viae in this method they seem to imitate birds and other animals which in the room of teeth nature has supplied with two stomachs where in the first the corn is only swelled and softened by the liquor of its glands but broken and disolved in the second which is composed of very strong muscles this economy is wonderful in the animal but by no means applicable to the rational creature although the pot and other implements used in cookery where the aliment receives some degrees of digestion may bear some analogy to the first stomach in the animal yet the operation is different it is by the succus gastricus a liquor separated by the glands of the stomach that the corn is made soft and fitted to the action of the second stomach where it is received together with the juices of the first but in boiling the most nutrimental parts are lost the more volatile and spiritous evaporate while the gross fatty parts are blended with the water  therefore whoever takes down the substance loads the stomach to very little purpose and whoever drinks the broth will relax his stomach and rob it of the vigor required to perform its office but nothing will so much convince us of the impropriety of such a regimen as a knowledge of digestion and the manner of its being performed which for the sake of such readers as are unacquainted with these subjects we will take a cursory view of in its first stages  the principal agents employed in this action are the teeth the saliva the succus gastricus and the liquors we drink the aliment being broke by the teeth and mixed with the saliva in the mouth descends into the stomach where it imbibes the juices of the glands and the liquors drank whose chief property is to soften the aliments as they are fluids which easily enter the pores of moist bodies and swelling them break their most intimate cohesions and this is augmented by the impetus which the heat of the stomach gives to the particles of the fluids and likewise by rarefying the air contained in the pores of our food which bursts its parts asunder  the aliments thus prepared their parts soon separate from one another and disolve into a fluid with the liquor of the stomach by the continual motion of its sides whose absolute power is demonstrated by pitcairn to be equal to the pressure of    0   poundweight to which if we add the absolute force of the diaphragm and muscles of the abdomen which likewise conduce to digestion the sum will amount to   0    poundweight  from whence this force or for what purpose has nature who yet has never been detected in an error employed all this mechanism if useless there can be no occasion to spare it the trouble of its office and the only excuse men find for so doing is because it is already weakened by some cause and incapable of acting but to such i would observe that it is not by these means to be brought to its natural tone and the studious man whose life is generally inactive will find it more to his advantage and agreeable to the constitution of his nerves on whose sensation he depends for his ideas to live more upon food containing the natural juices of which kind especially are all roasted meats  i could not conveniently treat on this subject without mentioning digestion since the teeth are the first and necessary organs of it wherever we observe these instruments wanting in animals etc we shall always find them furnished with two stomachs and where they have teeth besides they are only used as weapons of defense which we see in the viper and some kinds of fish who swallow their prey whole  from hence we may conclude that the teeth besides their importance for the preservation of our health are likewise necessary for the agreement of the voice the pronunciation and articulation of our words and the ornament of the face  precautions for preserving the teeth though the production of the teeth is entirely the work of nature the preservation of them depends greatly upon ourselves  men are naturally attentive to their health but by a neglect of this kind they are too often rendered incapable of attaining it for as i have before shown the health depending on the digestion of the aliments which ought first to be pounded as it were and broke for the easier admission of the juices of the stomach and this being the office of the teeth it intimately concerns us to keep them in such order as will enable them to perform it  the means to preserve them consists then principally in the choice of a good regimen and avoiding the use of such things as are hurtful to their external parts  the first you see will not only preserve the teeth but at the same time the health also as it consists in the choice of such aliment as will yield a good nourishment but the generality of people are so prone to intemperance and eat with so little attention or rather so precipitately that too much cannot be said of its ill effects nothing is capable of producing greater disorders than an imperfect mastication for if the aliment be not well broken by the teeth it is certain the dissolution in the stomach will be long laborious and imperfect and the sweet balsamic blood will be changed into a thick acrid and viscous state and this alteration cannot fail of producing a bad effect in the teeth not only as it circulates through them but by the vapors which arise from the stomach and breath and lodge upon them as they pass through the mouth  the too great use of vegetables as also the flesh of pork salted meats saltfish cheese etc must be prejudicial as they all produce a bad chyle  all kinds of sweetmeats and sugars contribute very much to the destruction of the teeth because their gluey juice is insinuated into the gums and sticks to the teeth besides sugars are of an acid penetrant and corrosive nature and by a chemical analysis we see that the effects will be sooner or later pernicious it is also remarkable that those people who make great use of this poison are more subject to the toothache and lose their teeth sooner than others  those who love sugar and use it frequently are seldom remarkable for handsome teeth and very rarely good ones this is particularly exemplified in holland the inhabitants whereof especially the women are great teadrinkers and in their manner somewhat particular for instead of sweetning each dish with loafsugar as in england they hold a piece of sugar candy in their mouths which frequently serves six or eight dishes before it is disolved which inevitably produces those effects to which they are so subject viz the loss and ruin of their teeth for it is rare to find a dutch woman of thirty years of age with a good set of teeth for this reason after eating sugar or any thing that contains much sugar in its composition it will be necessary to rince the mouth with warm water to dissolve and wash away those parts which would stick to the gums and teeth  it would be absurd from hence to conclude it absolutely necessary to deprive ourselves of these things but to regulate their use and not to make a habit of that which experience shows to be prejudicial most certainly is worth our consideration  of no less importance is moderation in drinking since our health is equally dependant on sobriety the many constitutions we see ruined by excess of this kind is a stronger argument to deter us than any thing that can be further said on this head  it is as necessary likewise to avoid chewing or breaking any hard bodies as nuts cherrystones etc biting off the ends of thread or silk lifting up great weights picking them with instruments of gold silver or any other metal by which they may be either loosened or lost and other such idle and pernicious practices  excessive smoking tobacco is also very injurious especially if care be not taken to cover the end of the pipe with wax which will by degrees wear off their vitrious or glossy substance and subject them to the danger of becoming rotten and perfectly useless it besides gives them a black and filthy appearance and causes an unnatural heat in the mouth which by the immediate admission of cold air may arrest a humor in the gums or neighboring glands and be the foundation of great pain and trouble  i would not have the reader imagine me ignorant of the qualities of tobacco i am sufficiently sensible of its service in preserving the teeth by evacuating the superfluous humors but like any other specific it may if improperly made use of answer a very different effect i would therefore by all means advise washing the mouth with warm water and not exposing it too soon after smoking to the impressions of a cold air etc  the effects which have been observed to follow smoking are the very same when we eat our victuals too hot and immediately or in a little time after eat something cold many people drink in the same instant a liquor almost boiling hot and some other as cold as ice without recollecting that the diversity of heat and cold is able to arrest and fix the humors which nourish the teeth which stagnating will ferment and break the membrane that covers the roots of the teeth and render them carious  this effect is produced by the dilatation of the parts and the rarefaction of the liquids that pass through the vessels occasioned by heat as cold on the contrary will contract and shut up the parts abate the motion of circulation and render the juices contained in he vessels thick and incapable of passing  the great preservation of our teeth in short chiefly depends on our regimen of living the constitution and the teeth have so equal a dependence on each other that the destruction of the latter proves the ruin of the former almost as certain as that a bad blood can never supply the teeth with good nourishment  general causes of the disorders of the teeth the causes that produce the diseases of the teeth are two in general the one internal the other external the internal cause is owing to the quantity or quality of the lymph which by its corrosive parts is capable of destroying the most compact parts of the human body such as are the teeth by breaking the external substance or glossy covering of the bones of which they are composed  the lymph we find of this character in the scurvy in the kings evil and in the pox  when the nutritious juice is too abundant or distributed in too great quantity into the teeth that it stagnates between their alveoli and their roots its effects are very dangerous like as when the blood is inflamed it may form phlegmonic abscesses in the cavity of the teeth or in the neighboring parts it may also occasion the most exquisite pains incurable but by the loss of the tooth  the regimen of living too much sleep too much watching a too sedentary life or a too laborious one contribute not a little to the preservation or to the ruin of the teeth  the good quality of the milk which the child receives from its nurse is of great importance to the formation of the teeth in the time of too thing as it serves to prevent or diminish the many accidents that happen to children when the teeth are disposed to pierce the membrane of the gum that covers their extremities and opposes their issue  all violent passions are capable of altering digestion of increasing or thickning the mass of blood of causing obstructions and of stopping the secretions and excretions which mould operate daily for the preservation of our health the passions i say may when they alter the mass of blood to a certain degree be ranged with the internal causes that produce the diseases of the teeth  all persons in a pituitous or plethorick habit of body in whom the lymph is very abundant are generally subject to suffer not only pain in the teeth but even their loss  the generality of women with child are likewise subject to this complaint the menstrual discharge being stopped the mass of blood must rest charged with a superfluity it is therefore from the quantity that is deposited on the teeth or on the gums that women suffer this uneasiness sooner when with child than at other times and we see that they are often afflicted for the same reason when their monthly economy is over  the jadice occasions so much disorder in the blood that the teeth sometimes perish by an abscess on those parts  the external causes are not less in number nor are they less dangerous in their effects the thick vapors that arise from the stomach and lungs adhere to the mouth much in the same manner that soot adheres to the sides of the chimney forming a tenacious viscous substance that covers the teeth like paste this tenacious matter is very hurtful to the teeth when certain ltle portions of our aliment adhere to the teeth or stick betwixt their interstices or the gums it is capable of producing the same effect especially if we neglect rincing our mouths after  the injuries of the weather are the causes of rheums and catarrhes from which the teeth the alveoli and the gums are too often very great sufferers  the too great use of dentrifick powders serves chiefly to destruction as they use or wear off the part of the most importance to their preservation viz their enamel or vitrious substance  but the neglect in not keeping them clean is the most general cause of all the disorders that happen to the teeth  mercury is a great enemy to the teeth not only by itself but by the bad effects that it may produce in the body by the corrosive qualities that most of the preparations of mercury are charged with or by the alliance that it contracts with different principles in our bodies when it stays too long or when it is not properly evacuated  it is very evident that mercury by its ill effects swells the gums and renders them sore this it does also to the membranes that cover the roots of the teeth either internally or externally it desects if i may be allowed the expression the very roots and throws them out of their sockets or otherwise it destroys them by the caries that it occasions these melancholy effects we see but too often especially where mercury has been employed by persons little versed in its use the most experienced practitioners in the venereal disease use it with the utmost circumspection and with great industry guard against its poison the gilders and those who cover lookingglasses plumbers and such as work in mines etc experience the bad and fatal impressions that mercury makes upon them and particularly upon their teeth  it is by the effects produced from these causes that the teeth are attended with such diversity of diseases almost always accompanied with pain more or less violent  authors have reckoned the number of diseases of the teeth to amount to upwards of an hundred but i find only nineteen necessary to comprehend all that may be useful to know and these may be divided into three classes in the first are those produced by external causes in the second are contained the disorders of the alveoli and gums and in the third are the diseases accidental or symptomatic  of the tartar or turf the first disease from external causes worth our notice is the tartar or turf concerning which authors speak of many different sorts as the yellow the gray the black and the petrified and distinguish them also by their degrees of consistence but as this last is owing only to the duration and the difference of color not material i shall speak only of the most common sort which is of a dark yellow tending rather to a brown color  the tartar is a matter accumulated on the surface of the teeth near the gums which in process of time will form a strong crust of a considerable bigness common to those who are negligent in keeping their teeth clean this foreign matter as it increases in quantity inevitably consumes the gums and by that means occasions a rottenness of the teeth  for the better understanding the nature of this tartar with the causes that produce it and the manner of its insensible formation the two following principles may be of service  first the foundation of this matter and its increase may bear some analogy to the stones formed in the kidneys bladder etc which owe their origin very often to a retention of some matter capable of attraction and cohesion the small portions of our aliment that adhere to the upper part of the teeth or betwixt their interstices being softened by the saliva become of a gluey consistence which soon grows dry by the assistance of more air passing in inspiration and expiration  secondly when the saliva becomes viscous from a deprivation of the lymph and is loaded with saline particles it is very probable that it may be lodged upon the body of the teeth and by degrees form the mass we are speaking off that this matter may be so caused i am the more ready to believe from the observation le journal de saeavans de lannle      of a strong concretion being found upon the roots of the tongue formed by a viscous lymph resembling the saliva in thirst it is difficult to assign any other cause than that the saliva may become tartarous and form this substance  the first lay or bed of tartar being once formed it is easy to conceive it augmented by the addition of fresh matter and to increase to an extraordinary size  from the nature of this disease we may readily infer that the cure or means to prevent it will consist in keeping such a regimen as will preserve the purity of the blood in its natural state and by being careful to wash the mouth often which is absolutely necessary to prevent a stinking breath occasioned as well by this neglect as the disorder here mentioned we may maintain the use and beauty of our teeth for many years  the jaundice of the teeth is mentioned as another disease but i think with impropriety it being nothing more than a tarnished substance or viscosity sticking to the teeth like dust or the humidity that covers the surface of a lookingglass when it is not kept clean and to me it seems to be nothing more than a bed or lay of matter forming the tartar  sensibility and agacement the sensibility and agacement of the teeth are disorders produced from external causes  the writers on this subject have been of opposite opinions some maintaining the teeth to be insensible bodies others on the contrary making them extremely capable of sensation it is true that simply as so many bones we may consider them as insensible but as covered and lined with membranes and furnished with vessels and nerves we cannot deny them the quality of sensation any more than other parts of the body  by the sensibility of the teeth is to be understood that fixed and permanent pain that we generally express by saying we have the toothache  by the agacement of the teeth is meant that acute pain we express by saying they are set on edge caused by certain sounds such as the touching of stuffs the slipping of a knife or fork upon a chinaplate or the filing a piece of iron etc etc  the pains of the teeth are of different kinds but the most general are those called pungent or pricking coming by intervals the other distensive or continual such as accompany a caries in which the air by drying or crisping the fibers nerves and coats of the little vessels render them bony and contract their diameters too small to receive any fluid through them by which means the efforts of the humors to distend their orifices cause that pain we call distensive  if on the contrary the little vessels should be ruptured the liquor extravasated would soon change its nature and fermenting would irritate the membranes and produce the pain called pungent  the agacement we find to be a different kind of sensation owing according to the general opinion to an acid juice insinuated betwixt the fibers of the membranes that covers the roots of the teeth and when the teeth are compressed against this membrane that disposition occasions the action of the juices against the fibers of the membrane  i believe that the juices of certain fruits such as cherries gooseberries apples etc may be insinuated betwixt the interstices of the fibers that compose the membranes and distending them intercept the course of the liquors in some vessels and by stretching the nerves produce a sensation more or less troublesome to bear but it is very different from that seated in the body of the tooth  what makes me consider that the agacement is fixed only to the body or surface of the teeth is if they are wiped with a piece of warm linen it will immediately diminish their uneasiness and in opposition to the opinion of an acid being the cause the following experiment will serve to convince if the herb sorrel be chewed between the teeth the agacement will suddenly cease if this disease be occasioned by an acid is it not strange that it should admit of this remedy sorrel which is itself an acid must rather increase than abate the disorder it is possible that some parts of the juice may be subtle enough to penetrate the fibers that terminate it but how sorrel acts in remedying this evil i confess i am not able to conceive we may observe that the air taken in respiration when the mouth is half open will produce the same effect and i cannot believe that air in passing presses so forcibly as to make that compression against the membranes at the roots of the teeth which they assign to be the cause it is more natural to suppose that the subtle particles of the air entering the pores of the enamel and the resistance made to the grosser parts may occasion a tremor in the tooth and a sensation not unlike the agacement  the caries or rottenness is a disease produced likewise from external causes rottenness   the teeth are more subject to this disease than all the other bones in the body both by their structure and situation  this disease is occasioned by a humor insinuated between the boney fibers of the teeth which generally meets with obstructions in the most substantial part of the tooth and by the particular impulse that every particle communicates to the cells of the tooth by degrees breaks off little parcels and in time makes that dark cavity in the tooth which we call hollow  the teeth are more subject to rottenness than the other bones because their periosteum is more pressed which renders them subject to obstructions etc the molares are more subject to this disease than the incissores or canini and the incissores and canini of the upper jaw more than those of the lower jaw because by their situation they are more exposed to heat and cold in eating or drinking in inspiration and expiration  it often happens that after a tooth is attacked with a caries the opposite tooth on the other side of the same jaw is affected also nor does it appear that this effect depends only upon hazard for it is remarkable that in the opposite tooth the caries will not only much resemble the other but sometimes be exactly uniform to it  the vulgar as well as certain authors are of opinion that all pains of the teeth are caused by a worm that gnaws and eats the membranes and nerves of the teeth this notion is founded upon pretended experiments on these infects which as they report by smoking hembane will fall from the teeth etc and some of the doctors of montpellier have been very prolix in their accounts of the generation of these worms besides the discoveries with their glasses but whoever will be at the pains to make some trials with the microscope may prove the absurdity of this notion  the time in which the caries ravages most of the teeth is between the age of    and  0 years  i have omitted the many divisions that may be seen in some books upon this subject both on account of their perplexity and nonuse for the caries of what kind or cause soever produces its effects more or less considerable according to the parts of the tooth they attack and the operations practiced on these occasions are more or less difficult according to the situation of the tooth or according as the caries is more or less penetrating in the body or the roots of the teeth  whenever the caries is situated without the gums either on the sides or extremity of the tooth the cure will consist in separating the rotten part from the sound by exfoliation with the file the rugine cautery etc and by filling the cavity with wax which must be often renewed it will defend the boney and nervous parts from the air or the impression of any other bodies likewise hinder any bits of our aliment from lodging in the cavity which are so apt to putrify and cause a stinking breath  although the teeth fractures in their natural situation are harder and more compact than the other bones in the body and more remarkably so in the human specie than brutes we find them by experience extremely subject to break especially when the least defect happens in them  their fractures are simple compound or fissure  the simple happens often by falls and blows particularly by the attempts to draw them before they are loose the compound is when their roots are strongly attached to their alveoli and a piece of the jaw comes away with part of the tooth a fissure is a fracture lengthways without any seeming alteration in the form of the tooth  when once the parts of the other bones are divided they never can be again united for the vessels distributed in them are not so disposed as to furnish a juice sufficient or that is capable of a glutination because their proper substance is too compact to give them passage or their motion the air and bodies that they touch are obstacles that oppose the reunion of the divided parts  but though the reunion of the fracture be impracticable the scales or splinters that remain may be extracted or their angles and sharp points smoothed and polished  all the luxations the bones suffer in their articulations luxations are either complete or incomplete when a tooth is loosened it is a luxation incomplete  if after having been naturally well situated they lean either in or out of the mouth of one side or the other they are so many luxations  when a tooth turns in the alveoli so that the lateral parts of the tooth incline either outward or inwards it is a luxation complete  when a tooth seems to be longer and exceed the others that the neck and part of the roots appear above the edge of the gums occasioned by some matter contained in the alveoli it is a semiluxation  the large teeth are most frequently luxated inwards the incissores on the contrary generally luxate outward although both these dislocations are bad and incommode the equality of mastication yet the luxation inwards is the worst because it fatigues and hurts the tongue which uneasiness is more than the inconvenience that is caused by the teeth against the lips or cheeks when they fall outward the least inconvenient luxation is when the tooth is only turned in the cavity of the alveoli  when the teeth are luxated in such a manner as to exceed the others by their extremities which we call a luxation or dislocation of the bottom to the top of the lower jaw or of the top to the bottom of the upper jaw the mastication is very difficult  in all these cases the remedy is to return them each in their proper places by which means they will often become quite fast to guard against the causes of luxations and so fortify the gums  diseases within the alveoli and gums the diseases that happen to the parts of the teeth contained within the alveoli and gums are    caries of the neck and roots of the teeth    inflammation of the membranes that line the internal cavities of the roots of the teeth their periosteum etc occasioned by cold    abscesses in the cavities of the teeth and gums the consequence of an inflammation    atrophy or dryness of the alveoli and membranes of the gums which is sufficient to make the teeth fall out without any caries and even without pain  the accidental or symptomatic diseases of the teeth are    caries of the alveoli caused by the teeth    exostosis of the alveoli occasioned by the teeth also    inflammation of the periosteum lining the cavities of the alveoli    fracture of the alveoli caused by the extraction of the teeth etc    hemorrhage sometimes violent occasioned by the extraction of the teeth also sometimes this hemorrhage proceeds from the gums being tore in the operation of drawing    abscesses in the gums cheeks and palate caused by the teeth    fistulas occasioned by long continuance of those abscesses    miscarriages have been the consequence of violent pains in the teeth and    nausea vomiting diarrheas and fevers and to infants even death itself  on the methods of cleaning the teeth with observations on scaling the common methods for preserving the color of the teeth serve rather to blacken and destroy them and i would caution the public against the use of all remedies sold with this design the opiates and many medicines of different titles to my certain knowledge are composed of brick china rottenstone or other ingredients of this nature powdered or levigated very fine and colored according to the fancy of the inventors it is very natural to conceive that these powders must act upon the teeth much in the same manner as a file or the dusts used in polishing metals by which means the enameled substance will be wore away and the long part of the tooth left bare and defenseless to all insults  the white salt scuttlefish bone salt of tartar salt of lead burntallum and other ingredients of the same species the world has been long abused with  juice of sorrel juice of lemons spirit of alum spirit and salt of vitriol have been employed on this occasion and though with the greatest circumspection have always in the end given them a yellow color never to be repaired nor is this the only bad effect produced by these liquors for by a frequent application they corrode and eat little holes in the enamel of the teeth notwithstanding it is in the use of these remedies that consist all the secrets of our quacks and if we examine the teeth of any of their confidents that seem to have reaped the greatest advantage from them with a microscope or even with the naked eye the ravage they have made will easily show us a sure foundation for a caries  the methods of cleaning the teeth are various most people use small brushes or bits of cloth or linen without any suspicion of their impropriety but they are much too rough and by frequent indiscreet use often ruin the gums and teeth for this reason i would abolish their use and advise a piece of sponge dipped in warm water in which should be dissolved a piece of soap to be used preferable to all other methods whatever soap is known to be of a penetrating attenuating and detergent nature and therefore not only most proper for cleaning the teeth but also very serviceable in most disorders of the gums in short it may be used with the utmost propriety the only objection to be made is the offense it may give on account of its taste but custom will render it familiar and sufficiently recompense die trouble of using it  i would recommend the morning as the most convenient time for cleaning the teeth but before using of the sponge it will be necessary to scrape off the gluey substance which adheres to their surface with a quill and after cleaning them with the sponge and soap the mouth may be rinced with hungary water spirit of lavender etc diluted with warm water  the scurvy of the gums is dependent on the bad state of the constitution the relieving of which last will infallibly cure the other when the teeth become loose from whatever cause a teaspoonful of the tincture of myrrh mixed with a teacupfull of water to wash the mouth with twice or thrice a day will be the most efficacious remedy  it is become a great fashion with the english ladies and with too many of my own sex to have their teeth sealed and this practice shocking as it is seems to be pursued with an uncommon attention  the design of this operation is to beautify the color of the teeth by removing the tartar or turf which adheres to their surface and is done with iron instruments made for that purpose but whoever will consider attentively the nature of the teeth and of this petrified substance which i have already described will readily conceive the impropriety of this practice it is very probable that by endeavoring to detach this matter some of the enameled part may be taken away with it and this not only depends on hazard but is the certain consequence of frequent use indeed these instruments themselves by often rubbing upon the vitrious substance must risque its ruin both as they are of a nature too hard to approach the teeth and as their mettalic particles will insinuate themselves into the pores of the enamel and never fail to produce great michief  if it should be said that this matter may be removed by a dextrous hand one familiar in the operation without any such dangers a brief repetition of the nature of the disease will i hope prove a sufficient answer  the tartar is generally accumulated on that part of the teeth which joins with the gums and covers more or less according as it increases in quantity that part we call the neck of the tooth which it separates from the gum this is the true state of the disease  now suppose the operator ever so dextrous he must in consequence of taking away this matter expose the neck of the tooth bare and liable to all injuries of the air the aliment or whatever comes near it in which are contained many causes of a caries this matter when left to itself seldom fails of dropping off insensibly and if it is the color only which induces us to try the remedy twould be much better to be content with this inconvenience than subject ourselves to its ill effects but by following the methods i have advised there will be no necessity for exposing ourselves to this operation  a certain merchant in the city though otherwise sufficiently covetous bestowed a considerable purse upon one of our foreign operators who had in good truth changed the color of his teeth from a black to a very beautiful white but behold the consequence the merchant found himself under a necessity of bespeakihg a new set for they all actually fell out one after the other i saw him within three months after the operation when he had only two remaining in his head this is an instance not without its precedent  thus it is that our curious ladies and others by endeavoring by these unatural means to make their teeth exceedingwhite will at length bring on a caries and render them black and frightful as well as useless i am astonished to see so many pretending an aversion to foreigners and yet suffer them as we say of sharpers etc to draw the furthest teeth in their heads and i am still more sorry to see such numbers of the finest women become the dupes of such foreign miscreants  diseases of children in the time of toothing the teeth hardly make their appearance in the mouth before they require some succor from surgery the caries is the first disease that works their ruin and is their greatest enemy during life but even before their appearance the diseases they cause we know by experience are considerable enough to take away life  the first appearance of teeth happens commonly about seven months after our birth and is attended with diverse accidents the symptoms preceding their appearance is an itching of the gums followed by a ptyalismus or salivation of the infant easily discovered by the great quantity of saliva running from the mouth after this follows the swelling of the gums accompanied with great pain  if the child has strength to resist he will be attacked with the apthae or little ulcers unequal with a white point these ulcers are often engendered by the most acrid and serous parts of the blood formed most easily on the surface of the membrane in the mouth being the most soft and tender sometimes the parotid glands swell and become considerable abscesses  when the teeth especially the canini are upon the point of piercing the gums the itching is then turned into great pain with swelling of the cheeks and eyes catarrhs fever diarrhea nausea vomiting insomnitude convulsions lethargy and too often the tragical scene ends in death  the thirst occasioned by the fever excites them to suck more than their little stomachs are able to bear and from hence follows that indigestion and corruption vomiting and diarrhea to which they are so subject  all the symptoms happening to children of the first age are produced by the compression the teeth make in dividing the gums and it is remarkable that these disorders sometimes happen to children of a more advanced age though very seldom  the incisores are more sharp and pierce the gums with less pain than the canini the molares as they are large and flat upon their extremities are the occasion of more difficulty and pain but as they make their appearance later than the others the child has generally acquired greater strength to resist their efforts  the diseases i have mentioned are indeed more or less considerable as the child is more or less vigorous hippocrates tells us that those who cut their teeth in the winter are less liable to the danger of the fever than in a warmer season that when they have a diarrhea they are less subject to convulsions that the healthiestlooking children and who sleep sound are in danger of being surprised with convulsions of which death is not always the consequence  from these prognostics we may judge of the effects resulting from a good or bad constitution of the child etc but i would advise mothers on these occasions to apply to a man of skill in the profession and be extremely cautions of engaging in an affair wherein the least error may prove fatal  finis in the press and speedily will be published  receipts in physic and surgery  being the entire practice of an eminent and learned physician lately deceased  containing a complete body of prescriptions answering to every disease  now first published from the authors original manuscripts  to which are added by the editor  occasional remarks directions and cautions suited to the different stages of distempers in order to render this work particularly useful in families
