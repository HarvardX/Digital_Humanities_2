characteristicks volume i a letter concerning enthusiasm sensus communis an essay on the freedom of wit and humour soliloquy or advice to an author  printed in the year mdccxxxii xx xxi  preface if the author of these united tracts had been any friend to prefaces he woud probably have made his entrance after that manner in one or other of the five treatises formerly publishd apart but as to all prefatory or dedicatory discourse he has told us his mind sufficiently in that treatise which he calls soliloquy being satisfyd however that there are many shaftesbury  0  iv  persons who esteem these introductory pieces as very essential in the constitution of a work he has thought fit in behalf of his honest printer to substitute these lines under the title of a preface and to declare that according to his best judgment and authority these presents ought to pass and be receivd construd and taken as satisfactory in full for all preliminary composition dedication direct or indirect application for favour to the publick or to any private patron or party whatsoever nothing to the contrary appearing to him from the side of truth or reason witness his hand this fifth day of december    0 aacanaae cmdclxxj xxii   treatise i viz a letter concerning enthusiasm to my lord sommers what is to prevent one from telling the truth as he laughs hor sat   printed first in the year mdccviii      a letter c my lord sept   0  sect   section i now you are returnd to      and before the season comes which must engage you in the weightier matters of state if you care to be entertaind awhile with a sort of idle thoughts such as pretend only to amusement and have no relation to business or affairs you may cast your eye slightly on what you have before you and if there be any thing inviting you may read it over at your leisure shaftesbury  0    it has been an establishd custom for poets at the entrance of their work to address themselves to some muse and this practice of the antients has gaind so much repute that even in our days we find it almost constantly imitated i cannot but fansy however that this imitation which passes so currently with other judgments must at some time or other have stuck a little with your lordship who is usd to examine things by a better standard than that of fashion or the common taste you must certainly have observd   our poets under a remarkable constraint when obligd to assume this character and you have wonderd perhaps why that air of enthusiasm which fits so gracefully with an antient shoud be so spiritless and aukard in a modern but as to this doubt your lordship woud have soon resolvd yourself and it coud only serve to bring across you a reflection you have often made on many occasions besides that truth is the most powerful thing in the world since even fiction itself must be governd by it and can only please by its resemblance the appearance of reality is necessary to make any passion agreeably represented and to be able to move others we must first be movd ourselves or at least seem to be so upon some probable grounds now what possibility shaftesbury  0     is there that a modern who is known never to have worshipd apollo or ownd any such deity as the muses shoud persuade us to enter into his pretended devotion and move us by his feignd zeal in a religion out of date but as for the antients tis known they derivd both their religion and polity from the muses art how natural therefore must it have appeard in any but especially a poet of those times to address himself in raptures of devotion to those acknowledgd patronesses of wit and science here the poet might with probability feign an extasy tho he really felt none and supposing it to have been mere affectation it woud look however like something natural and coud not fail of pleasing but perhaps my lord there was a further mystery in the case men your lordship knows are wonderfully happy in a faculty of deceiving themselves whenever they set heartily about it and a very small foundation of any passion will serve us not only to act it well but even to work ourselves into it beyond our own reach thus by a little affectation in lovematters and with the help of a romance or novel a boy of fifteen or a grave man of fifty may be sure to grow a very natural coxcomb and feel the belle passion in good earnest a man of tolerable goodnature who happens to be a shaftesbury  0     little piqud may by improving his resentment become   a very fury for revenge even a good christian who woud needs be overgood and thinks he can never believe enough may by a small inclination well improvd extend his faith so largely as to comprehend in it not only all scriptural and traditional miracles but a solid system of oldwives storys were it needful i coud put your lordship in mind of an eminent learned and truly christian prelate you once knew who coud have given you a full account of his belief in fairys and this methinks may serve to make appear how far an antient poets faith might possibly have been raisd together with his imagination but we christians who have such ample faith ourselves will allow nothing to poor heathens they must be infidels in every sense we will not allow em to believe so much as their own religion which we cry is too absurd to have been credited by any besides the mere vulgar but if a reverend christian prelate may be so great a volunteer in faith as beyond the ordinary prescription of the catholick church to believe in fairys why may not a heathen poet in the ordinary way of his religion be allowd to believe in muses for these your lordship knows were so many divine persons in the heathen creed shaftesbury  0     and were essential in their system of theology the goddesses had their temples and worship the same as the other deitys and to disbelieve the holy nine or their apollo was the same as to deny jove himself and must have been esteemd equally profane and atheistical by the generality of sober men now what a mighty advantage must it have been to an antient poet to be thus orthodox and by the help of his education and a goodwill into the bargain to work himself up to the belief of a divine presence and heavenly inspiration it was never surely the business of poets in those days to call revelation in question when it evidently made so well for their art on the contrary they coud not fail to animate their faith as much as possible when by a single act of it well inforcd they coud raise themselves into such angelical company how much the imagination of such a presence must exalt a genius we may observe merely from the influence which an ordinary   presence has over men our modern wits are more or less raisd by the opinion they have of their company and the idea they form to themselves of the persons to whom they make their addresses a common actor of the stage will inform us how much a full audience of the better sort exalts him above the common shaftesbury  0     pitch and you my lord who are the noblest actor and of the noblest part assignd to any mortal on this earthly stage when you are acting for liberty and mankind does not the publick presence that of your friends and the wellwishers to your cause add something to your thought and genius or is that sublime of reason and that power of eloquence which you discover in publick no more than what you are equally master of in private and can command at any time alone or with indifferent company or in any easy or cool hour this indeed were more godlike but ordinary humanity i think reaches not so high for my own part my lord i have really so much need of some considerable presence or company to raise my thoughts on any occasion that when alone i must endeavour by strength of fancy to supply this want and in default of a muse must inquire out some great man of a more than ordinary genius whose imagind presence may inspire me with more than what i feel at ordinary hours and thus my lord have i chosen to address myself to your lordship tho without subscribing my name allowing you as a stranger the full liberty of reading no more than what you may have a fansy for but reserving to myself the privilege of imagining you shaftesbury  0     read all with particular notice as a friend and one whom i may justifiably treat with the intimacy and freedom which follows sect   section ii if the knowing well how to expose any infirmity or vice were a sufficient security for the virtue which is contrary how excellent an age might we be presumd to live in never was there in our   nation a time known when folly and extravagance of every kind were more sharply inspected or more wittily ridiculd and one might hope at least from this good symptom that our age was in no declining state since whatever our distempers are we stand so well affected to our remedys to bear the being told of faults is in private persons the best token of amendment tis seldom that a publick is thus disposd for where jealousy of state or the ill lives of the great people or any other cause is powerful enough to restrain the freedom of censure in any part it in effect destroys the benefit of it in the whole there can be no impartial and free censure of manners where any peculiar custom or national opinion is set apart and not only exempted from criticism but even flatterd with the highest art tis only in a free nation such as ours that imposture has no privilege and shaftesbury  0   0  that neither the credit of a court the power of a nobility nor the awefulness of a church can give her protection or hinder her from being arraignd in every shape and appearance tis true this liberty may seem to run too far we may perhaps be said to make ill use of it—so every one will say when he himself is touchd and his opinion freely examind but who shall be judg of what may be freely examind and what may not where liberty may be usd and where it may not what remedy shall we prescribe to this in general can there be a better than from that liberty itself which is complaind of if men are vicious petulant or abusive the magistrate may correct them but if they reason ill tis reason still must teach em to do better justness of thought and style refinement in manners good breeding and politeness of every kind can come only from the trial and experience of what is best let but the search go freely on and the right measure of every thing will soon be found whatever humour has got the start if it be unnatural it cannot hold and the ridicule if ill placd at first will certainly fall at last where it deserves i have often wonderd to see men of sense so mightily alarmd at the approach of any thing like ridicule on certain sub shaftesbury  0     jects as if they mistrusted their own judgment for what ridicule can   lie against reason or how can any one of the least justness of thought endure a ridicule wrong placd nothing is more ridiculous than this itself the vulgar indeed may swallow any sordid jest any mere drollery or buffoonery but it must be a finer and truer wit which takes with the men of sense and breeding how comes it to pass then that we appear such cowards in reasoning and are so afraid to stand the test of ridicule—o say we the subjects are too grave—perhaps so but let us see first whether they are really grave or no for in the manner we may conceive em they may peradventure be very grave and weighty in our imagination but very ridiculous and impertinent in their own nature gravity is of the very essence of imposture it does not only make us mistake other things but is apt perpetually almost to mistake itself for even in common behaviour how hard is it for the grave character to keep long out of the limits of the formal one we can never be too grave if we can be assurd we are really what we suppose and we can never too much honour or revere any thing for grave if we are assurd the thing is grave as we apprehend it the main point is to know always true gravity from the false and this can only be by carrying the rule shaftesbury  0      constantly with us and freely applying it not only to the things about us but to ourselves for if unhappily we lose the measure in ourselves we shall soon lose it in every thing besides now what rule or measure is there in the world except in the considering of the real temper of things to find which are truly serious and which ridiculous and how can this be done unless by applying the ridicule to see whether it will bear but if we fear to apply this rule in any thing what security can we have against the imposture of formality in all things we have allowd ourselves to be formalists in one point and the same formality may rule us as it pleases in all other tis not in every disposition that we are capacitated to judg of things we must beforehand judg of our own temper and accordingly of other things which fall under our judgment but we must   never more pretend to judg of things or of our own temper in judging them when we have given up our preliminary right of judgment and under a presumption of gravity have allowd ourselves to be most ridiculous and to admire profoundly the most ridiculous things in nature at least for ought we know for having resolvd never to try we can never be sure shaftesbury  0     a jest often decides weighty matters better and more forcibly than can asperity this my lord i may safely aver is so true in itself and so well known for truth by the cunning formalists of the age that they can better bear to have their impostures raild at with all the bitterness and vehemence imaginable than to have them touchd ever so gently in this other way they know very well that as modes and fashions so opinions tho ever so ridiculous are kept up by solemnity and that those formal notions which grew up probably in an ill mood and have been conceivd in sober sadness are never to be removd but in a sober kind of chearfulness and by a more easy and pleasant way of thought there is a melancholy which accompanys all enthusiasm be it love or religion for there are enthusiasms in both nothing can put a stop to the growing mischief of either till the melancholy be removd and the mind at liberty to hear what can be said against the ridiculousness of an extreme in either way it was heretofore the wisdom of some wise nations to let people be fools as much as they pleasd and never to punish shaftesbury  0      seriously what deservd only to be laughd at and was after all best curd by that innocent remedy there are certain humours in mankind which of necessity must have vent the human mind and body are both of em naturally subject to commotions and as there are strange ferments in the blood which in many bodys  0 occasion an extraordinary discharge so in reason too there are heterogeneous particles which must be thrown off by fermentation shoud physicians endeavour absolutely to allay those ferments of the body and strike in the humours which discover themselves in such eruptions they might instead of making a cure bid fair perhaps to raise a plague and turn a springague or an autumnsurfeit into an epidemical malignant fever they are certainly as ill physicians in the bodypolitick who woud needs be tampering with these mental eruptions and under the specious pretence of healing this itch of superstition and saving souls from the contagion of enthusiasm shoud set all nature in an uproar and turn a few innocent carbuncles into an inflammation and mortal gangrene we read in history that pan when he accompanyd bacchus in an expedition to the indies found means to strike a shaftesbury  0      terror thro a host of enemys by the help of a small company whose clamors he managd to good advantage among the echoing rocks and caverns of a woody vale the hoarse bellowing of the caves joind to the hideous aspect of such dark and desart places raisd such a horror in the enemy that in this state their imagination helpd em to hear voices and doubtless to see forms too which were more than human whilst the uncertainty of what they feard made their fear yet greater and spread it faster by implicit looks than any narration coud convey it and this was what in aftertimes men calld a panick the story indeed gives a good hint of the nature of this passion which can hardly be without some mixture of enthusiasm and horrors of a superstitious kind one may with good reason call every passion panick which is raisd in a †multitude and conveyd by aspect or as it were by contact or sympathy thus popular fury may be calld panick when the rage of the people as we have sometimes known has put them beyond themselves especially where †religion has had to    do and in this state their very looks are infectious the fury flies from face to face and the disease is no sooner seen than caught they who in a better situa shaftesbury  0     tion of mind have beheld a multitude under the power of this passion have ownd that they saw in the countenances of men something more ghastly and terrible than at other times is expressd on the most passionate occasion such force has society in ill as well as in good passions and so much stronger any affection is for being social and communicative thus my lord there are many panicks in mankind besides merely that of fear and thus is religion also panick when enthusiasm of any kind gets up as oft on melancholy occasions it will for vapours naturally rise and in bad times especially when the spirits of men are low as either in publick calamitys or during the unwholesomeness of air or diet or when convulsions happen in nature storms earthquakes or other amazing prodigys at this season the panick must needs run high and the magistrate of necessity give way to it for to apply a serious remedy and bring the sword or fasces as a cure must make the case more melancholy and increase the very cause of the distemper to forbid mens natural fears and to endeavour the overpowering them by other fears must needs be a most unnatural me shaftesbury  0     thod the magistrate if he be any artist shoud have a gentler hand and instead of causticks incisions and amputations shoud be using the softest balms and with a kind sympathy entering into the concern of the people and taking as it were their passion upon him shoud when he has soothd and satisfyd it endeavour by chearful ways to divert and heal it this was antient policy and hence as a notable †author of our nation expresses it tis necessary a people shoud have a publick leading in religion for to deny the magistrate a worship or take away a national church is as mere enthusiasm as the notion which sets up persecution for why shoud there not be publick    walks as well as private gardens why not publick librarys as well as private education and hometutors but to prescribe bounds to fancy and speculation to regulate mens apprehensions and religious beliefs or fears to suppress by violence the natural passion of enthusiasm or to endeavour to ascertain it or reduce it to one species or bring it under any one modification is in truth no better sense nor deserves a better character than what the comedian declares of the like project in the affair of love— shaftesbury  0      you will manage it no better than if you undertook to be rationally insane not only the visionarys and enthusiasts of all kinds were tolerated your lordship knows by the antients but on the other side philosophy had as free a course and was permitted as a ballance against superstition and whilst some sects such as the pythagorean and latter platonick joind in with the superstition and enthusiasm of the times the epicurean the academick and others were allowd to use all the force of wit and raillery against it and thus matters were happily balancd reason had fair play learning and science flourishd wonderful was the harmony and temper which arose from all these contrarietys thus superstition and enthusiasm were mildly treated and being let alone they never ragd to that degree as to occasion bloodshed wars persecutions and devastations in the world but a new sort of policy which extends itself to another world and considers the future lives and happiness of men rather than the present has made us leap the bounds of natural humanity and out of a supernatural charity has taught us the way of plaguing one another most devoutly it has raisd an †antipathy which no temporal interest coud ever do and entaild shaftesbury  0      upon us a mutual hatred to all eternity and now    uniformity in opinion a hopeful project is lookd on as the only expedient against this evil the saving of souls is now the heroick passion of exalted spirits and is become in a manner the chief care of the magistrate and the very end of government itself if magistracy shoud vouchsafe to interpose thus much in other sciences i am afraid we shoud have as bad logick as bad mathematicks and in every kind as bad philosophy as we often have divinity in countrys where a precise orthodoxy is settled by law tis a hard matter for a government to settle wit if it does but keep us sober and honest tis likely we shall have as much ability in our spiritual as in our temporal affairs and if we can but be trusted we shall have wit enough to save ourselves when no prejudice lies in the way but if honesty and wit be insufficient for this saving work tis in vain for the magistrate to meddle with it since if he be ever so virtuous or wise he may be as soon mistaken as another man i am sure the only way to save mens sense or preserve wit at all in the world is to give liberty to wit now wit can never have its liberty where the freedom of raillery is taken away for against serious extravagances and splene shaftesbury  0   0 tick humours there is no other remedy than this we have indeed full power over all other modifications of spleen we may treat other enthusiasms as we please we may ridicule love or gallantry or knighterrantry to the utmost and we find that in these latter days of wit the humour of this kind which was once so prevalent is pretty well declind the crusades the rescuing of holy lands and such devout gallantrys are in less request than formerly but if something of this militant religion something of this soulrescuing spirit and sainterrantry prevails still we need not wonder when we consider in how solemn a manner we treat this distemper and how preposterously we go about to cure enthusiasm i can hardly forbear fansying that if we had a sort of inquisition or formal court of judicature with grave officers and judges erected to restrain poetical licence and in general to suppress that fancy and humour of versification but in particular that most    extravagant passion of love as it is set out by poets in its heathenish dress of venuss and cupids if the poets as ringleaders and teachers of this heresy were under grievous penaltys forbid to enchant the shaftesbury  0      people by their vein of rhyming and if the people on the other side were under proportionable penaltys forbid to hearken to any such charm or lend their attention to any lovetale so much as in a play a novel or a ballad we might perhaps see a new arcadia arising out of this heavy persecution old people and young would be seizd with a versifying spirit we shoud have fieldconventicles of lovers and poets forests woud be filld with romantick shepherds and shepherdesses and rocks resound with echoes of hymns and praises offerd to the powers of love we might indeed have a fair chance by this management to bring back the whole train of heathen gods and set our cold northern island burning with as many altars to venus and apollo as were formerly in cyprus delos or any of those warmer grecian climates sect   section iii but my lord you may perhaps wonder that having been drawn into such a serious subject as religion i shoud forget my self so far as to give way to raillery and humour i must own my lord tis not merely thro chance that this has happend to say truth i hardly care so much as to think on this subject much shaftesbury  0      less to write on it without endeavouring to put my self in as good humour as is possible people indeed who can endure no middle temper but are all air and humour know little of the doubts and scruples of religion and are safe from any immediate influence of devout melancholy or enthusiasm which requires more deliberation and thoughtful practice to fix itself in a temper and grow habitual but be the habit what it will to be deliverd of it at so sad a cost as inconsiderateness or madness is what i woud never wish to be my lot i had rather stand all adventures with religion    than endeavour to get rid of the thoughts of it by diversion all i contend for is to think of it in a right humour and that this goes more than halfway towards thinking rightly of it is what i shall endeavour to demonstrate good humour is not only the best security against enthusiasm but the best foundation of piety and true religion for if right thoughts and worthy apprehensions of the supreme being are fundamental to all true worship and adoration tis more than probable that we shall never miscarry in this respect except thro ill humour only nothing beside ill humour either natural or forcd can bring a man to think seriously that the shaftesbury  0      world is governd by any devilish or malicious power i very much question whether any thing besides ill humour can be the cause of atheism for there are so many arguments to persuade a man in humour that in the main all things are kindly and well disposd that one woud think it impossible for him to be so far out of conceit with affairs as to imagine they all ran at adventures and that the world as venerable and wise a face as it carryd had neither sense nor meaning in it this however i am persuaded of that nothing beside ill humour can give us dreadful or ill thoughts of a supreme manager nothing can persuade us of sullenness or sourness in such a being beside the actual forefeeling of somewhat of this kind within ourselves and if we are afraid of bringing good humour into religion or thinking with freedom and pleasantness on such a subject as god tis because we conceive the subject so like ourselves and can hardly have a notion of majesty and greatness without stateliness and moroseness accompanying it this however is the just reverse of that character which we own to be most divinely good when we see it as we sometimes do in men of highest power among us if they pass for truly good we dare treat them freely and are sure they will shaftesbury  0      not be displeasd with this liberty they are doubly gainers by this goodness of theirs for the more they are searchd into and familiarly examind the more their worth appears and the discoverer charmd with his success esteems and loves more than ever when he has provd this    additional bounty in his superior and reflects on that candor and generosity he has experiencd your lordship knows more perhaps of this mystery than anyone how else shoud you have been so belovd in power and out of power so adherd to and still more belovd thank heaven there are even in our own age some such examples in former ages there have been many such we have known mighty princes and even emperors of the world who coud bear unconcernedly not only the free censure of their actions but the most spiteful reproaches and calumnys even to their faces some perhaps may wish there had never been such examples found in heathens but more especially that the occasion had never been given by christians twas more the misfortune indeed of mankind in general than of christians in particular that some of the earlier roman emperors were such monsters of tyranny and began a persecution not on religious men merely but on all who were shaftesbury  0      suspected of worth or virtue what coud have been a higher honour or advantage to christianity than to be persecuted by a nero but better princes who came after were persuaded to remit these severe courses tis true the magistrate might possibly have been surprizd with the newness of a notion which he might pretend perhaps did not only destroy the sacredness of his power but treated him and all men as profane impious and damnd who enterd not into certain particular modes of worship of which there had been formerly so many thousand instituted all of em compatible and sociable till that time however such was the wisdom of some succeeding ministrys that the edge of persecution was much abated and even that prince who was esteemd the greatest enemy of the christian sect and who himself had been educated in it was a great restrainer of persecution and woud allow of nothing further than a resumption of churchlands and publick schools without any attempt on the goods or persons even of those who branded the statereligion and made a merit of affronting the publick worship    tis well we have the authority of a sacred author in our religion to assure us shaftesbury  0      that the spirit of love and humanity is above that of martyrs otherwise one might be a little scandalizd perhaps at the history of many of our primitive confessors and martyrs even according to our own accounts there is hardly now in the world so good a christian if this be indeed the mark of a good one who if he happend to live at constantinople or elsewhere under the protection of the turks would think it fitting or decent to give any disturbance to their mosqueworship and as good protestants my lord as you and i are we shoud consider him as little better than a rank enthusiast who out of hatred to the romish idolatry shoud in time of high mass where mass perhaps was by law establishd interrupt the priest with clamors or fall foul on his images and relicks there are some it seems of our good brethren the french protestants lately come among us who are mightily taken with this primitive way they have set afoot the spirit of martyrdom to a wonder in their own country and they long to be trying it here if we will give em leave and afford em the occasion that is to say if we will only do em the favour to hang or imprison em if we shaftesbury  0      will only be so obliging as to break their bones for em after their countryfashion blow up their zeal and stir afresh the coals of persecution but no such grace can they hitherto obtain of us so hardhearted we are that notwithstanding their own mob are willing to bestow kind blows upon em and fairly stone em now and then in the open street tho the priests of their own nation woud gladly give em their desird discipline and are earnest to light their probationary fires for em we english men who are masters in our own country will not suffer the enthusiasts to be thus usd nor can we be supposd to act thus in envy to their phenixsect which it seems has risen out of the flames and woud willingly grow to be a new church by the same manner of propagation as the oldone whose seed was truly said to be from the blood of the martyrs    but how barbarous still and more than heathenishly cruel are we tolerating english men for not contented to deny these prophesying enthusiasts the honour of a persecution we have deliverd em over to the cruellest contempt in the world i am told for certain that they are at this very time the subject of a shaftesbury  0      choice droll or puppetshow at bartlemyfair there doubtless their strange voices and involuntary agitations are admirably well acted by the motion of wires and inspiration of pipes for the bodys of the prophets in their state of prophecy being not in their own power but as they say themselves mere passive organs actuated by an exterior force have nothing natural or resembling real life in any of their sounds or motions so that how aukardly soever a puppetshow may imitate other actions it must needs represent this passion to the life and whilst bartlemyfair is in possession of this privilege i dare stand security to our national church that no sect of enthusiasts no new venders of prophecy or miracles shall ever get the start or put her to the trouble of trying her strength with em in any case happy it was for us that when popery had got possession smithfield was usd in a more tragical way many of our first reformers tis feard were little better than enthusiasts and god knows whether a warmth of this kind did not considerably help us in throwing off that spiritual tyranny so that had not the priests as is usual preferd the love of blood to all other passions they might in a merrier way perhaps have evaded the greatest shaftesbury  0      force of our reforming spirit i never heard that the antient heathens were so well advisd in their ill purpose of suppressing the christian religion in its first rise as to make use at any time of this bartlemyfair method but this i am persuaded of that had the truth of the gospel been any way surmountable they woud have bid much fairer for the silencing it if they had chosen to bring our primitive founders upon the stage in a pleasanter way than that of bearskins and pitchbarrels    the jews were naturally a very cloudy people and woud endure little raillery in any thing much less in what belongd to any religious doctrines or opinions religion was lookd upon with a sullen eye and hanging was the only remedy they coud prescribe for any thing which lookd like setting up a new revelation the sovereign argument was crucify crucify but with all their malice and inveteracy to our saviour and his apostles after him had they but taken the fancy to act such puppetshows in his contempt as at this hour the papists are acting in his honour i am apt to think shaftesbury  0   0  they might possibly have done our religion more harm than by all their other ways of severity i believe our great and learned apostle found †less advantage from the easy treatment of his athenian antagonists than from the surly and curst spirit of the most persecuting jewish citys he made less improvement of the candor and civility of his roman judges than of the zeal of the synagogue and vehemence of his national priests tho when i consider this apostle as appearing either before the witty athenians or before a roman court of judicature in the presence of their great men and ladys and see how handsomly he accommodates himself to the apprehensions and temper of those politer people i do not find that he declines the way of wit or good humour but without suspicion of his cause is willing generously to commit it to this proof and try it against the sharpness of any ridicule which might be offerd but tho the jews were never pleasd to try their wit or malice this way against shaftesbury  0      our saviour or his apostles the irreligious part of the heathens had tryd it long before against the best doctrines and best characters of men which had ever arisen amongst em nor  0 did this prove in the end an injury but on the contrary the highest advantage to those very characters and doctrines which having stood the proof were found so solid and just the divinest man who had ever appeard in the heathen world was in the height of witty times and by the wittiest of all poets most abominably ridiculd in a whole comedy writ and acted on purpose but so far was this from sinking his reputation or suppressing his philosophy that they each increasd the more for it and he apparently grew to be more the envy of other teachers he was not only contented to be ridiculd but that he might help the poet as much as possible he presented himself openly in the theater that his real figure which was no advantageous one might be compard with that which the witty poet had brought as his representative on the stage such was his good humour nor coud there be in the world a greater testimony of the invincible goodness of the man or a greater demonstration that there was no imposture either in his character or opinions for that imposture shoud dare sustain the encounter of a grave enemy is shaftesbury  0      no wonder a solemn attack she knows is not of such danger to her there is nothing she abhors or dreads like pleasantness and good humour sect   section iv in short my lord the melancholy way of treating religion is that which according to my apprehension renders it so tragical and is the occasion of its acting in reality such dismal tragedys in the world and my notion is that provided we treat religion with good manners we can never use too much good humour or examine it with too much freedom and familiarity for if it be genuine and sincere it will not only stand the proof but thrive and gain advantage from hence if it be spurious or mixd with any imposture it will be detected and exposd the melancholy way in which we have been taught religion makes us unapt to think of it in good humour tis in adversity    chiefly or in ill health under affliction or disturbance of mind or discomposure of temper that we have recourse to it tho in reality we are never so unfit to think of it as at such a heavy and dark hour we can never be fit to contemplate any thing above us when shaftesbury  0      we are in no condition to look into ourselves and calmly examine the temper of our own mind and passions for then it is we see wrath and fury and revenge and terrors in the deity when we are full of disturbances and fears within and have by sufferance and anxiety lost so much of the natural calm and easiness of our temper we must not only be in ordinary good humour but in the best of humours and in the sweetest kindest disposition of our lives to understand well what true goodness is and what those attributes imply which we ascribe with such applause and honour to the deity we shall then be able to see best whether those forms of justice those degrees of punishment that temper of resentment and those measures of offence and indignation which we vulgarly suppose in god are sutable to those original ideas of goodness which the same divine being or nature under him has implanted in us and which we must necessarily presuppose in order to give him praise or honour in any kind this my lord is the security against all superstition to remember that there is nothing in god but what is godlike and that he is either not at all or truly and perfectly good but when we are afraid to use our reason shaftesbury  0      freely even on that very question whether he really be or not we then actually presume him bad and flatly contradict that pretended character of goodness and greatness whilst we discover this mistrust of his temper and fear his anger and resentment in the case of this freedom of inquiry we have a notable instance of this freedom in one of our sacred authors as patient as job is said to be it cannot be denied that he makes bold enough with god and takes his providence roundly to task his friends indeed plead hard with him and use all arguments right or wrong to patch up objections and set the affairs of providence upon an equal foot they make a merit of saying    all the good they can of god at the very stretch of their reason and sometimes quite beyond it but this in jobs opinion is flattering god accepting of gods person and even mocking him and no wonder for what merit can there be in believing god or his providence upon frivolous and weak grounds what virtue in assuming an opinion contrary to the appearance of things and resolving to hear nothing which may be said against it excellent character of the god of truth that he shoud be offended at us for having refusd shaftesbury  0      to put the lye upon our understandings as much as in us lay and be satisfyd with us for having believd at a venture and against our reason what might have been the greatest falshood in the world for any thing we coud bring as a proof or evidence to the contrary it is impossible that any besides an illnaturd man can wish against the being of a god for this is wishing against the publick and even against ones private good too if rightly understood but if a man has not any such illwill to stifle his belief he must have surely an unhappy opinion of god and believe him not so good by far as he knows himself to be if he imagines that an impartial use of his reason in any matter of speculation whatsoever can make him run any risk hereafter and that a mean denial of his reason and an affectation of belief in any point too hard for his understanding can intitle him to any favour in another world this is being sycophants in religion mere parasites of devotion tis using god as the crafty †beggars use those they address to when they are ignorant of their quality the novices amongst em may innocently come out perhaps with a good sir or a good forsooth but with the old stagers no matter whom they meet in a coach tis shaftesbury  0      always good your honour or good your lordship or your ladyship for if there shoud be really a lord in the case we shoud be undone say they for want of giving the title but if the party shoud be no lord there woud be no offence it woud not be ill taken    and thus it is in religion we are highly concernd how to beg right and think all depends upon hitting the title and making a good guess tis the most beggarly refuge imaginable which is so mightily cryd up and stands as a great maxim with many able men that they shoud strive to have faith and believe to the utmost because if after all there be nothing in the matter there will be no harm in being thus deceivd but if there be any thing it will be fatal for them not to have believd to the full but they are so far mistaken that whilst they have this thought tis certain they can never believe either to their satisfaction and happiness in this world or with any advantage of recommendation to another for besides that our reason which knows the cheat will never rest thorowly satisfyd on such a bottom but turn us often adrift and toss us in a sea of doubt and perplexity we cannot but actually grow worse in our religion and entertain a worse opinion still of a supreme shaftesbury  0      deity whilst our belief is founded on so injurious a thought of him to love the publick to study universal good and to promote the interest of the whole world as far as lies within our power is surely the height of goodness and makes that temper which we call divine in this temper my lord for surely you shoud know it well tis natural for us to wish that others shoud partake with us by being convincd of the sincerity of our example tis natural for us to wish our merit shoud be known particularly if it be our fortune to have servd a nation as a good minister or as some prince or father of a country to have renderd happy a considerable part of mankind under our care but if it happend that of this number there shoud be some so ignorantly bred and of so remote a province as to have lain out of the hearing of our name and actions or hearing of em shoud be so puzzld with odd and contrary storys told up and down concerning us that they knew not what to think whether there were really in the world any such person as ourself shoud we not in good truth be ridiculous to take offence at this and shoud we not pass for extravagantly morose and illhumourd if instead of treating the matter in raillery we shoud think in earnest shaftesbury  0      of revenging ourselves on the offending    partys who out of their rustick ignorance ill judgment or incredulity had detracted from our renown how shall we say then does it really deserve praise to be thus concernd about it is the doing good for glorys sake so divine a thing or is it not diviner to do good even where it may be thought inglorious even to the ingrateful and to those who are wholly insensible of the good they receive how comes it then that what is so divine in us shoud lose its character in the divine being and that according as the deity is represented to us he shoud more resemble the weak womanish and impotent part of our nature than the generous manly and divine sect   section v one woud think my lord it were in reality no hard thing to know our own weaknesses at first sight and distinguish the features of human frailty with which we are so well acquainted one woud think it were easy to understand that provocation and offence anger revenge jealousy in point of honour or power love of fame glory and the like belong only to limited be shaftesbury  0     ings and are necessarily excluded a being which is perfect and universal but if we have never settled with ourselves any notion of what is morally excellent or if we cannot trust to that reason which tells us that nothing beside what is so can have place in the deity we can neither trust to any thing which others relate of him or which he himself reveals to us we must be satisfyd beforehand that he is good and cannot deceive us without this there can be no real religious faith or confidence now if there be really something previous to revelation some antecedent demonstration of reason to assure us that god is and withal that he is so good as not to deceive us the same reason if we will trust to it will demonstrate to us that god is so good as to exceed the very best of us in    goodness and after this manner we can have no dread or suspicion to render us uneasy for it is malice only and not goodness which can make us afraid there is an odd way of reasoning but in certain distempers of mind very sovereign to those who can apply it and it is this there can be no malice but where interests are opposd a universal being can have no interest opposite and therefore can have no malice if there be a general mind shaftesbury  0   0  it can have no particular interest but the general good or good of the whole and its own private good must of necessity be one and the same it can intend nothing besides nor aim at any thing beyond nor be provokd to any thing contrary so that we have only to consider whether there be really such a thing as a mind which has relation to the whole or not for if unhappily there be no mind we may comfort our selves however that nature has no malice if there be really a mind we may rest satisfyd that it is the bestnaturd one in the world the last case one woud imagine shoud be the most comfortable and the notion of a common parent less frightful than that of forlorn nature and a fatherless world tho as religion stands amongst us there are many good people who woud have less fear in being thus exposd and woud be easier perhaps in their minds if they were assurd they had only mere chance to trust to for no body trembles to think there shoud be no god but rather that there shoud be one this however woud be otherwise if deity were thought as kindly of as humanity and we coud be persuaded to believe that if there really was a god the highest goodness must of necessity belong to him without any of shaftesbury  0      those defects of passion those meannesses and imperfections which we acknowledg such in ourselves which as good men we endeavour all we can to be superior to and which we find we every day conquer as we grow better    methinks my lord it woud be well for us if before we ascended into the higher regions of divinity we woud vouchsafe to descend a little into ourselves and bestow some poor thoughts upon plain honest morals when we had once lookd into ourselves and distinguishd well the nature of our own affections we shoud probably be fitter judges of the divineness of a character and discern better what affections were sutable or unsutable to a perfect being we might then understand how to love and praise when we had acquird some consistent notion of what was laudable or lovely otherwise we might chance to do god little honour when we intended him the most for tis hard to imagine what honour can arise to the deity shaftesbury  0      from the praises of creatures who are unable to discern what is praiseworthy or excellent in their own kind if a musician were cryd up to the skies by a certain set of people who had no ear in musick he woud surely be put to the blush and coud hardly with a good countenance accept the benevolence of his auditors till they had acquird a more competent apprehension of him and coud by their own senses find out something really good in his performance till this were brought about there woud be little glory in the case and the musician tho ever so vain woud have little reason to be contented they who affect praise the most had rather not be taken notice of than be impertinently applauded i know not how it comes about that he who is ever said to do good the most disinterestedly shoud be thought desirous of being praisd so lavishly and be supposd to set so high a rate upon so cheap and low a thing as ignorant commendation and forcd applause tis not the same with goodness as with other qualitys which we may understand very well and yet not possess we may have an excellent ear in musick shaftesbury  0      without being able to perform in any kind we may judg well of poetry without being poets or possessing the least of a poetick vein but we can have no tolerable notion    of goodness without being tolerably good so that if the praise of a divine being be so great a part of his worship we shoud methinks learn goodness were it for nothing else than that we might learn in some tolerable manner how to praise for the praise of goodness from an unsound hollow heart must certainly make the greatest dissonance in the world sect   section vi other reasons my lord there are why this plain homespun philosophy of looking into ourselves may do us wondrous service in rectifying our errors in religion for there is a sort of enthusiasm of second hand and when men find no original commotions in themselves no prepossessing panick which bewitches em they are apt still by the testimony of others to be imposd on and led credulously into the belief of many false miracles and this habit may make em variable and of a very inconstant faith easy to be carryd away with every wind of doctrine and addicted to every upstart sect or superstition but the knowledg of our passions in their very shaftesbury  0      seeds the measuring well the growth and progress of enthusiasm and the judging rightly of its natural force and what command it has over our very senses may teach us to oppose more successfully those delusions which come armd with the specious pretext of moral certainty and matter of fact the new prophesying sect i made mention of above pretend it seems among many other miracles to have had a most signal one acted premeditately and with warning before many hundreds of people who actually give testimony to the truth of it but i woud only ask whether there were present among those hundreds any one person who having never been of their sect or addicted to their way will give the same testimony with them i must not    be contented to ask whether such a one had been wholly free of that particular enthusiasm but whether before that time he was esteemd of so sound a judgment and clear a head as to be wholly free of melancholy and in all likelihood incapable of all enthusiasm besides for otherwise the panick may have been caught the evidence of the senses lost as in a dream and the imagination so inflamd as in a moment to shaftesbury  0      have burnt up every particle of judgment and reason the combustible matters lie prepard within and ready to take fire at a spark but chiefly in a multitude seizd with the same spirit no wonder if the blaze rises so of a sudden when innumerable eyes glow with the passion and heaving breasts are labouring with inspiration when not the aspect only but the very breath and exhalations of men are infectious and the inspiring disease imparts itself by insensible transpiration i am not a divine good enough to resolve what spirit that was which provd so catching among the antient prophets that even the profane †saul was taken by it but i learn from holy scripture that there was the †evil as well as the good spirit of prophecy and i find by present experience as well as by all historys sacred and profane that the operation of this spirit is every where the same as to the bodily organs a gentleman who has writ lately in defence of revivd prophecy and has since fallen himself into the prophetick extasys tells us that the antient prophets had the spirit of god upon them under extasy with divers strange gestures shaftesbury  0      of body denominating them madmen or enthusiasts as appears evidently says he in the instances of balaam saul david ezekiel daniel c and he proceeds to justify this by the practice of the apostolick times and by the regulation which the ‡apostle himself applies to these seemingly irregular gifts so frequent and ordinary as our author    pretends in the primitive church on the first rise and spreading of christianity but i leave it to him to make the resemblance as well as he can between his own and the apostolick way i only know that the symptoms he describes and which himself poor gentleman labours under are as heathenish as he can possibly pretend them to be christian and when i saw him lately under an agitation as they call it uttering prophecy in a pompous latin style of which out of his extasy it seems he is wholly incapable it brought into my mind the latin poets description of the sibyl whose agonys were so perfectly like these immediately her face changes her colour flies her hair falls in disorder her breast heaves and her heart swells with mad passion greater her stature seems shaftesbury  0      and her voice not mortal for she is breathed upon by the god now imminent and again presently after the prophetess rages monstrously in the cave seeking to cast from her breast the mighty god so much the more he compels the rabid mouth ruling the wild heart and moulds her by his force  which is the very style of our experiencd author for the inspird says he undergo a probation wherein the spirit by frequent agitations forms the organs ordinarily for a month or two before utterance  0 the roman historian speaking of a most horrible enthusiasm which broke out in rome long before his days describes this spirit of prophecy men vaticinate as if out of their minds with fanatical convulsions of the body  the detestable things which are further related of these enthusiasts i woud not willingly transcribe but the senates mild decree in so execrable a case i cant omit copying being satisfyd that tho your lordship has read it before now you can read it again and again with admiration as to the future the senate enacted that if any one should believe that such a cult was shaftesbury  0      religiously necessary to him and that he could not without irreligion and impiety forego it he should inform the praetor of the city who should consult the senate if with not less than a hundred present the senate should give permission the rites might be performed but there should not be more than five assisting at the sacrifice nor should there be any common fund nor any master of the rites nor any priest  so necessary it is to give way to this distemper of enthusiasm that even that philosopher who bent the whole force of his philosophy against superstition appears to have left room for visionary fancy and to have indirectly tolerated enthusiasm for it is hard to imagine that one who had so little religious faith as epicurus shoud have so vulgar a credulity as to believe those accounts of armys and castles in the air and such visionary phaenomena yet he allows them and then thinks to solve em by his effluvia and aerial lookingglasses and i know not what other    stuff which his latin poet however sets off beautifully as he does all many simulacra of things thin manifold in number and form wander about in all manner of ways which when in the air they meet easily conjoin shaftesbury  0      like cobwebs or goldleaf    thus we see centaurs and limbs of scylla and shapes of dogs like cerberus and the phantasms of those passed away whose bones the earth enfolds since everywhere float simulacra of every kind partly those spontaneously shaped by the air within itself partly those thrown off by various things  twas a sign this philosopher believd there was a good stock of visionary spirit originally in human nature he was so satisfyd that men were inclind to see visions that rather than they shoud go without he chose to make em to their hand notwithstanding he denyd the principles of religion to be natural he was forcd tacitly to allow there was a wondrous disposition in mankind towards supernatural objects and that if these ideas were vain they were yet in a manner innate or such as men were really born to and coud hardly by any means avoid from which concession a divine methinks might raise a good argument against him for the truth as well as the usefulness of religion but so it is shaftesbury  0   0  whether the matter of apparition be true or false the symptoms    are the same and the passion of equal force in the person who is visionstruck the lymphatici of the latins were the nympholepti of the greeks they were persons said to have seen some species of divinity as either some rural deity or nymph which threw them into such transports as overcame their reason the extasys expressd themselves outwardly in quakings tremblings tossings of the head and limbs agitations and as livy calls them fanatical throws or convulsions extemporary prayer prophecy singing and the like all nations have their lymphaticks of some kind or another and all churches heathen as well as christian have had their complaints against fanaticism one woud think the antients imagind this disease had some relation to that which they calld hydrophoby whether the antient lymphaticks had any way like that of biting to communicate the rage of their distemper i cant so positively determine but certain fanaticks there have been since the time of the antients who have had a most prosperous faculty of communicating the appetite of the teeth for since first the snappish spirit got up in religion all sects have been at it as the saying is tooth and nail shaftesbury  0      and are never better pleasd than in worrying one another without mercy so far indeed the innocent kind of fanaticism extends itself that when the party is struck by the apparition there follows always an itch of imparting it and kindling the same fire in other breasts for thus poets are fanaticks too and thus horace either is or feigns himself lymphatick and shews what an effect the vision of the nymphs and bacchus had on him bacchus have i seen in faroff stony places teaching his songs aftercomers believe me and the nymphs conning them       evae my heart trembles with the stillfelt fear and wildly maddens lymphatur in a breast filled with bacchus the accepted reading is laetatur exults  lymphatur—————as heinsius reads no poet as i venturd to say at first to your lordship can do any thing great in his own way without the imagination or supposition of a divine presence which may raise him to some degree of this passion we are speaking of even the cold shaftesbury  0      lucretius †makes use of inspiration when he writes against it and is forcd to raise an apparition of nature in a divine form to animate and conduct him in his very work of degrading nature and despoiling her of all her seeming wisdom and divinity ‡ nutrient venus who under the gliding signs of heaven fillest with life the shipbearing sea and the fruitful lands    since thou alone rulest the nature of things nor without thee ariseth aught to the holy frontiers of light nor groweth anything joyous or meet for love thee would i have for helper in framing the song i seek to build for this our son of the memmian line    sect   section vii the only thing my lord i woud infer from all this is that enthusiasm is wonderfully powerful and extensive that it is a matter of nice judgment and the hardest thing in the world to know fully and distinctly since even atheism is not exempt from it for as some have well remarkd there have been enthusiastical atheists nor can divine in shaftesbury  0     spiration by its outward marks be easily distinguishd from it for inspiration is a real feeling of the divine presence and enthusiasm a false one but the passion they raise is much alike for when the mind is taken up in vision and fixes its view either on any real object or mere specter of divinity when it sees or thinks it sees any thing prodigious and more than human its horror delight confusion fear admiration or whatever passion belongs to it or is uppermost on this occasion will have something vast immane and as painters say beyond life and this is what gave occasion to the name of fanaticism as it was usd by the antients in its original sense for an apparition transporting the mind something there will be of extravagance and fury when the ideas or images receivd are too big for the narrow human vessel to contain so that inspiration may be justly calld divine enthusiasm for the word itself signifies divine presence and was made use of by the philosopher whom the earliest christian fathers calld divine to express whatever was sublime in human passions†    this shaftesbury  0      was the spirit he allotted to heroes statesmen poets orators musicians and even philosophers themselves nor can we of our own accord forbear ascribing to a noble enthusiasm whatever is greatly performd by any of these so that almost all of us know something of this principle but to know it as we shoud do and discern it in its several kinds both in ourselves and others this is the great work and by this means alone we can hope to avoid delusion for to judg the spirits whether they are of god we must antecedently judg our own spirit whether it be of reason and sound sense whether it be fit to judg at all by being sedate cool and impartial free of every biassing passion every giddy vapor or melancholy fume this is the first knowledg and previous judgment to understand ourselves and know what spirit we are of afterwards we may judg the spirit in others consider what their personal merit is and shaftesbury  0     prove the validity of their testimony by the solidity of their brain by this means we may prepare ourselves with some antidote against enthusiasm and this is what i have dard affirm is best performd by keeping to good humour for otherwise the remedy itself may turn to the disease and now my lord having after all in some measure justifyd enthusiasm and ownd the word if i appear extravagant in addressing to you after the manner i have done you must allow me to plead an impulse you must suppose me as with truth you may most passionately yours and with that kindness which is natural    to you on other occasions you must tolerate your enthusiastick friend who excepting only in the case of this overforward zeal must ever appear with the highest respect my lord your lordships c    treatise ii viz sensus communis an essay on the freedom of wit and humour in a letter to a friend  on the one side a wolf attacks on the other a dog hor sat   lib   printed first in the year mdccix        an essay c part i sect   section i i have been considering my friend what your fancy was to express such a surprize as you did the other day when i happend to speak to you in commendation of raillery was it possible you shoud suppose me so grave a man as to dislike all conversation of shaftesbury  0   0  this kind or were you afraid i shoud not stand the trial if you put me to it by making the experiment in my own case i must confess you had reason enough for your caution if you coud imagine me at the bottom so true a zealot as not to bear the least raillery on my own opinions tis the case i know with many whatever they think grave or solemn they suppose must  0 never be treated out of a grave and solemn way tho what another thinks so they can be contented to treat otherwise and are forward to try the edge of ridicule against any opinions besides their own the question is whether this be fair or no and whether it be not just and reasonable to make as free with our own opinions as with those of other people for to be sparing in this case may be lookd upon as a piece of selfishness we may be chargd perhaps with wilful ignorance and blind idolatry for having taken opinions upon trust and consecrated in ourselves certain idolnotions which we will never suffer to be unveild or seen in open light they may perhaps be monsters and not divinitys or sacred truths which are kept thus choicely in some dark corner of our minds the specters may impose on us whilst we re shaftesbury  0     fuse to turn em every way and view their shapes and complexions in every light for that which can be shewn only in a certain light is questionable truth tis supposd may bear all lights and one of those principal lights or natural mediums by which things are to be viewd in order to a thorow recognition is ridicule itself or that manner of proof by which we discern whatever is liable to just raillery in any subject so much at least is allowd by all who at any time appeal to this criterion the gravest gentlemen even in the gravest subjects are supposd to acknowledg this and can have no right tis thought to deny others the freedom of this appeal whilst they are free to censure like other men and in their gravest arguments make no scruple to ask is it not ridiculous of this affair therefore i design you shoud know fully what my sentiments are and by this means you will be able to judg of me whether i was sincere the other day in the defence of raillery and can continue still to plead for those ingenious friends of ours who are often censurd for their humour of this kind and for the freedom they take in such an airy way of conversation and writing shaftesbury  0        sect   section ii in good earnest when one considers what use is sometimes made of this species of wit and to what an excess it has risen of late in some characters of the age one may be startled a little and in doubt what to think of the practice or whither this rallying humour will at length carry us it has passd from the men of pleasure to the men of business politicians have been infected with it and the grave affairs of state have been treated with an air of irony and banter the ablest negotiators have been known the notablest buffoons the most celebrated authors the greatest masters of burlesque there is indeed a kind of defensive raillery if i may so call it which i am willing enough to allow in affairs of whatever kind when the spirit of curiosity woud force a discovery of more truth than can conveniently be told for we can never do more injury to truth than by discovering too much of it on some occasions tis the same with understandings as with eyes to such a certain size and make just so much light is necessary and no more whatever is beyond brings darkness and confusion shaftesbury  0     tis real humanity and kindness to hide strong truths from tender eyes and to do this by a pleasant amusement is easier and civiller than by a harsh denial or remarkable reserve but to go about industriously to confound men in a mysterious manner and to make advantage or draw pleasure from that perplexity they are thrown into by such uncertain talk is as unhandsom in a way of raillery as when done with the greatest seriousness or in the most solemn way of deceit it may be necessary as well now as heretofore for wise men to speak in parables and with a double meaning that the enemy may be amusd and they only who have ears to hear may hear but tis certainly a mean impotent and dull sort of wit which amuses all alike and leaves the most sensible man and even a friend equally in doubt and at a loss to understand what ones real mind is upon any subject this is that gross sort of raillery which is so offensive in good    company and indeed there is as much difference between one sort and another as between fairdealing and hypocrisy or between the genteelest wit and the most scurrilous buffoonery but by freedom of conversation this illiberal kind of wit will lose shaftesbury  0      its credit for wit is its own remedy liberty and commerce bring it to its true standard the only danger is the laying an embargo the same thing happens here as in the case of trade impositions and restrictions reduce it to a low ebb nothing is so advantageous to it as a freeport we have seen in our own time the decline and ruin of a false sort of wit which so much delighted our ancestors that their poems and plays as well as sermons were full of it all humour had something of the quibble the very language of the court was punning but tis now banishd the town and all good company there are only some few footsteps of it in the country and it seems at last confind to the nurserys of youth as the chief entertainment of pedants and their pupils and thus in other respects wit will mend upon our hands and humour will refine itself if we take care not to tamper with it and bring it under constraint by severe usage and rigorous prescriptions all politeness is owing to liberty we polish one another and rub off our corners and rough sides by a sort of amicable collision to restrain this is inevitably to bring a rust upon mens understandings tis a destroying of civility good breeding and shaftesbury  0      even charity itself under pretence of maintaining it sect   section iii to describe true raillery woud be as hard a matter and perhaps as little to the purpose as to define good breeding none can understand the speculation besides those who have the practice yet everyone thinks himself wellbred and the formallest pedant imagines he can railly with a good grace and humour i have known some of those grave gentlemen undertake to correct an    author for defending the use of raillery who at the same time have upon every turn made use of that weapon tho they were naturally so very aukard at it and this i believe may be observd in the case of many zealots who have taken upon em to answer our modern freewriters the tragical gentlemen with the grim aspect and mein of true inquisitors have but an ill grace when they vouchsafe to quit their austerity and be jocose and pleasant with an adversary whom they woud chuse to treat in a very different manner for to do em justice had they their wills i doubt not but their conduct and mein woud be pretty much of apiece they woud in all probability soon quit their farce and make a thorow tragedy but shaftesbury  0      at present there is nothing so ridiculous as this janusface of writers who with one countenance force a smile and with another show nothing beside rage and fury having enterd the lists and agreed to the fair laws of combat by wit and argument they have no sooner provd their weapon than you hear em crying aloud for help and delivering over to the secular arm there cant be a more preposterous sight than an executioner and a merryandrew acting their part upon the same stage yet i am persuaded anyone will find this to be the real picture of certain modern zealots in their controversial writings they are no more masters of gravity than they are of good humour the first always runs into harsh severity and the latter into an aukard buffoonery and thus between anger and pleasure zeal and drollery their writing has much such a grace as the play of humoursom children who at the same instant are both peevish and wanton and can laugh and cry almost in one and the same breath how agreeable such writings are like to prove and of what effect towards the winning over or convincing those who are supposd to be in error i need not go about to explain nor can i wonder on shaftesbury  0      this account to hear those publick lamentations of zealots that whilst the books of their adversarys are so current their answers to em can hardly make their way into the world or be taken the least notice of pedantry and bigotry are millstones    able to sink the best book which carries the least part of their dead weight the temper of the pedagogue sutes not with the age and the world however it may be taught will not be tutord if a philosopher speaks men hear him willingly while he keeps to his philosophy so is a christian heard while he keeps to his professd charity and meekness in a gentleman we allow of pleasantry and raillery as being managd always with good breeding and never gross or clownish but if a mere scholastick intrenching upon all these characters and writing as it were by starts and rebounds from one of these to another appears upon the whole as little able to keep the temper of christianity as to use the reason of a philosopher or the raillery of a man of breeding what wonder is it if the monstrous product of such a jumbled brain be ridiculous to the world if you think my friend that by this description i have done wrong to these zealotwriters in religious contro shaftesbury  0     versy read only a few pages in any one of em even where the contest is not abroad but within their own pale and then pronounce sect   section iv but now that i have said thus much concerning authors and writings you shall hear my thoughts as you have desird upon the subject of conversation and particularly a late one of a free kind which you remember i was present at with some friends of yours whom you fansyd i shoud in great gravity have condemnd twas i must own a very diverting one and perhaps not the less so for ending as abruptly as it did and in such a sort of confusion as almost brought to nothing whatever had been advancd in the discourse before some particulars of this conversation may not perhaps be so proper to commit to paper tis enough that i put you in mind of the conversation in general a great many fine schemes tis true were destroyd many grave reasonings overturnd    but this being done without offence to the partys concernd and with improvement to the good humour of the company it set the appetite the keener to such conversations shaftesbury  0      and i am persuaded that had reason herself been to judg of her own interest she woud have thought she receivd more advantage in the main from that easy and familiar way than from the usual stiff adherence to a particular opinion but perhaps you may still be in the same humour of not believing me in earnest you may continue to tell me i affect to be paradoxical in commending a conversation as advantageous to reason which ended in such a total uncertainty of what reason had seemingly so well establishd to this i answer that according to the notion i have of reason neither the written treatises of the learned nor the set discourses of the eloquent are able of themselves to teach the use of it tis the habit alone of reasoning which can make a reasoner and men can never be better invited to the habit than when they find pleasure in it a freedom of raillery a liberty in decent language to question every thing and an allowance of unravelling or refuting any argument without offence to the arguer are the only terms which can render such speculative conversations any way agreeable for to say truth they have been renderd burdensom to mankind by the strictness shaftesbury  0   0  of the laws prescribd to em and by the prevailing pedantry and bigotry of those who reign in em and assume to themselves to be dictators in these provinces  must i always be listener only is as natural a case of complaint in divinity in morals and in philosophy as it was of old the satirists in poetry vicissitude is a mighty law of discourse and mightily longd for by mankind in matter of reason more is done in a minute or two by way of question and reply than by a continud discourse of whole hours orations are fit only to move the passions and the power of declamation is to terrify exalt ravish    or delight rather than satisfy or instruct a free conference is a close fight the other way in comparison to it is merely a brandishing or beating the air to be obstructed therefore and manacled in conferences and to be confind to hear orations on certain subjects must needs give us a distaste and render the subjects so managd as disagreeable as the managers men had rather reason upon trifles so they may reason freely and without the imposition of authority than on the usefullest and best subjects in the world where they are held under a restraint and fear shaftesbury  0     nor is it a wonder that men are generally such faint reasoners and care so little to argue strictly on any trivial subject in company when they dare so little exert their reason in greater matters and are forcd to argue lamely where they have need of the greatest activity and strength the same thing therefore happens here as in strong and healthy bodys which are debard their natural exercise and confind in a narrow space they are forcd to use odd gestures and contortions they have a sort of action and move still tho with the worst grace imaginable for the animal spirits in such sound and active limbs cannot lie dead or without employment and thus the natural free spirits of ingenious men if imprisond and contrould will find out other ways of motion to relieve themselves in their constraint and whether it be in burlesque mimickry or buffoonery they will be glad at any rate to vent themselves and be revengd on their constrainers if men are forbid to speak their minds seriously on certain subjects they will do it ironically if they are forbid to speak at all upon such subjects or if they find it really dangerous to do so they will then redouble their disguise involve them shaftesbury  0     selves in mysteriousness and talk so as hardly to be understood or at least not plainly interpreted by those who are disposd to do em a mischief and thus raillery is brought more in fashion and runs into an extreme tis the persecuting spirit has raisd the bantering one and want of liberty may account for want of a true politeness and for the corruption or wrong use of pleasantry and humour if in this respect we strain the just measure of what we call    urbanity and are apt sometimes to take a buffooning rustick air we may thank the ridiculous solemnity and sour humour of our pedagogues or rather they may thank themselves if they in particular meet with the heaviest of this kind of treatment for it will naturally fall heaviest where the constraint has been the severest the greater the weight is the bitterer will be the satir the higher the slavery the more exquisite the buffoonery that this is really so may appear by looking on those countrys where the spiritual tyranny is highest for the greatest of buffoons are the italians and in their writings in their freer sort of conversations on their theatres and in their streets buffoonery and burlesque shaftesbury  0      are in the highest vogue tis the only manner in which the poor crampd wretches can discharge a free thought we must yield to em the superiority in this sort of wit for what wonder is it if we who have more of liberty have less dexterity in that egregious way of raillery and ridicule sect   section v tis for this reason i verily believe that the antients discover so little of this spirit and that there is hardly such a thing found as mere burlesque in any authors of the politer ages the manner indeed in which they treated the very gravest subjects was somewhat different from that of our days their treatises were generally in a free and familiar style they chose to give us the representation of real discourse and converse by treating their subjects in the way of dialogue and free debate the scene was commonly laid at table or in the publick walks or meetingplaces and the usual wit and humour of their real discourses appeard in those of their own composing and this was fair for without wit and humour reason can hardly have its proof or be distinguishd the magisterial voice shaftesbury  0      and high strain of the pedagogue commands    reverence and awe tis of admirable use to keep understandings at a distance and out of reach the other manner on the contrary gives the fairest hold and suffers an antagonist to use his full strength hand to hand upon even ground tis not to be imagind what advantage the reader has when he can thus cope with his author who is willing to come on a fair stage with him and exchange the tragick buskin for an easier and more natural gate and habit grimace and tone are mighty helps to imposture and many a formal piece of sophistry holds proof under a severe brow which woud not pass under an easy one twas the saying of an antient sage that humour was the only test of gravity and gravity of humour for a subject which woud not bear raillery was suspicious and a jest which woud not bear a serious examination was certainly false wit but some gentlemen there are so full of the spirit of bigotry and false zeal that when they hear principles examind sciences and arts inquird into and mat shaftesbury  0     ters of importance treated with this frankness of humour they imagine presently that all professions must fall to the ground all establishments come to ruin and nothing orderly or decent be left standing in the world they fear or pretend to fear that religion itself will be endangerd by this free way and are therefore as much alarmd at this liberty in private conversation and under prudent management as if it were grossly usd in publick company or before the solemnest assembly but the case as i apprehend it is far different for you are to remember my friend that i am writing to you in defence only of the liberty of the club and of that sort of freedom which is taken amongst gentlemen and friends who know one another perfectly well and that tis natural for me to defend liberty with this restriction you may infer from the very notion i have of liberty itself    tis surely a violation of the freedom of publick assemblys for any one to take the chair who is neither calld nor invited to it to start questions or manage debates which offend the publick ear is to be wanting in that respect which is due to common society such subjects shoud either not be treated at all in publick or in such a manner as to occasion no scandal or disturbance the publick is not on any shaftesbury  0      account to be laughd at to its face or so reprehended for its follys as to make it think itself contemnd and what is contrary to good breeding is in this respect as contrary to liberty it belongs to men of slavish principles to affect a superiority over the vulgar and to despise the multitude the lovers of mankind respect and honour conventions and societys of men and in mixd company and places where men are met promiscuously on account of diversion or affairs tis an imposition and hardship to force em to hear what they dislike and to treat of matters in a dialect which many who are present have perhaps been never usd to tis a breach of the harmony of publick conversation to take things in such a key as is above the common reach puts others to silence and robs them of their privilege of turn but as to private society and what passes in select companys where friends meet knowingly and with that very design of exercising their wit and looking freely into all subjects i see no pretence for any one to be offended at the way of raillery and humour which is the very life of such conversations the only thing which makes good company and frees it from the formality of business and the tutorage and dogmaticalness of the schools shaftesbury  0     sect   section vi to return therefore to our argument if the best of our modern conversations are apt to run chiefly upon trifles if rational discourses especially those of a deeper speculation have lost their credit and are in disgrace because of their formality there is reason for more allowance in the way of humour and gaiety an easier method of treating these subjects will make em more  0 agreeable and familiar to dispute about em will be the same as about other matters they need not spoil good company or take from the ease or pleasure of a polite conversation and the oftner these conversations are renewd the better will be their effect we shall grow better reasoners by reasoning pleasantly and at our ease taking up or laying down these subjects as we fansy so that upon the whole i must own to you i cannot be scandalizd at the raillery you took notice of nor at the effect it had upon our company the humour was agreeable and the pleasant confusion which the conversation ended in is at this time as pleasant to me upon reflection when i consider that instead of being discouragd from resuming the debate we were so much the readier to meet again at any time and dispute upon shaftesbury  0      the same subjects even with more ease and satisfaction than before we had been a long while entertaind you know upon the subject of morality and religion and amidst the different opinions started and maintaind by several of the partys with great life and ingenuity one or other woud every now and then take the liberty to appeal to common sense everyone allowd the appeal and was willing to stand the trial noone but was assurd common sense woud justify him but when issue was joind and the cause examind at the bar there coud be no judgment given the partys however were not less forward in renewing their appeal on the very next occasion which presented noone woud offer to call the authority of the court in question till a gentleman whose good understanding was never yet brought in doubt desird the company very gravely that they woud tell him what common sense was if by the word sense we were to understand opinion and judgment and by the word common the generality or any considerable part of mankind twoud be hard he said to discover where the subject of common sense coud lie for that which was accor shaftesbury  0     ding to the sense of one part of mankind was against the sense of another and if the majority were to determine common sense it woud change as often as men changd that which was according    to common sense to day woud be the contrary to morrow or soon after but notwithstanding the different judgments of mankind in most subjects there were some however in which twas supposd they all agreed and had the same thoughts in common—the question was askd still where for whatever was of any moment twas supposd might be reducd under the head of religion policy or morals of the differences in religion there was no occasion to speak the case was so fully known to all and so feelingly understood by christians in particular among themselves they had made sound experiment upon one another each party in their turn no endeavours had been wanting on the side of any particular sect whichever chancd to have the power faild not of putting all means in execution to make their private sense the publick one but all in vain common sense was as hard still to determine as catholick or orthodox shaftesbury  0   0  what with one was inconceivable mystery to another was of easy comprehension what to one was absurdity to another was demonstration as for policy what sense or whose coud be calld common was equally a question if plain british or dutch sense were right turkish and french sense must certainly be very wrong and as mere nonsense as passiveobedience seemd we found it to be the common sense of a great party amongst ourselves a greater party in europe and perhaps the greatest part of all the world besides as for morals the difference if possible was still wider for without considering the opinions and customs of the many barbarous and illiterate nations we saw that even the few who had attaind to riper letters and to philosophy coud never as yet agree on one and the same system or acknowledg the same moral principles and some even of our most admird modern philosophers had fairly told us that virtue and vice had after all no other law or measure than mere fashion and vogue shaftesbury  0     it might have appeard perhaps unfair in our friends had they treated only the graver subjects in this manner and sufferd the    lighter to escape for in the gayer part of life our follys are as solemn as in the most serious the fault is we carry the laugh but halfway the false earnest is ridiculd but the false jest passes secure and becomes as errant deceit as the other our diversions our plays our amusements become solemn we dream of happinesses and possessions and enjoyments in which we have no understanding no certainty and yet we pursue these as the best known and most certain things in the world there is nothing so foolish and deluding as a partial scepticism for whilst the doubt is cast only on one side the certainty grows so much stronger on the other whilst only one face of folly appears ridiculous the other grows more solemn and deceiving but twas not thus with our friends they seemd better criticks and more ingenious and fair in their way of questioning receivd opinions and exposing the ridicule of things and if you will allow me to carry on their humour i will venture to make the experiment throout and try what certain knowledg or shaftesbury  0      assurance of things may be recoverd in that very way by which all certainty you thought was lost and an endless scepticism introducd part ii sect   section i if a native of ethiopia were on a sudden transported into europe and placed either at paris or venice at a time of carnival when the general face of mankind was disguisd and almost every creature wore a mask tis probable he woud for some time be at a stand before he discoverd the cheat not imagining that a whole people coud be so fantastical as upon agreement at an appointed time to transform themselves by a variety of habits and    make it a solemn practice to impose on one another by this universal confusion of characters and persons tho he might at first perhaps have lookd on this with a serious eye it woud be hardly possible for him to hold his countenance when he had per shaftesbury  0     ceivd what was carrying on the europeans on their side might laugh perhaps at this simplicity but our ethiopian woud certainly laugh with better reason tis easy to see which of the two woud be ridiculous for he who laughs and is himself ridiculous bears a double share of ridicule however shoud it so happen that in the transport of ridicule our ethiopian having his head still running upon masks and knowing nothing of the fair complexion and common dress of the europeans shoud upon the sight of a natural face and habit laugh just as heartily as before woud not he in his turn become ridiculous by carrying the jest too far when by a silly presumption he took nature for mere art and mistook perhaps a man of sobriety and sense for one of those ridiculous mummers there was a time when men were accountable only for their actions and behaviour their opinions were left to themselves they had liberty to differ in these as in their faces every one took the air and look which was natural to him but in process of time it was thought decent to mend mens countenances and render their intellectual complexions uniform and of a sort thus the magistrate became a dresser and in his turn was shaftesbury  0      dressd too as he deservd when he had given up his power to a new order of tiremen but tho in this extraordinary conjuncture twas agreed that there was only one certain and true dress one single peculiar air to which it was necessary all people shoud conform yet the misery was that neither the magistrate nor the tiremen themselves coud resolve which of the various modes was the exact trueone imagine now what the effect of this must needs be when men became persecuted thus on every side about their air and feature and were put to their shifts how to adjust and compose their mein according to the right mode when a thousand models a thousand patterns of dress were current and alterd every now and    then upon occasion according to fashion and the humour of the times judg whether mens countenances were not like to grow constraind and the natural visage of mankind by this habit distorted convulsd and renderd hardly knowable but as unnatural or artificial as the general face of things may have been renderd by this unhappy care of dress and overtenderness for the safety of complexions we must not therefore imagine that all faces are alike besmeard or plaisterd all is not fucus or mere varnish nor is the face of truth less fair shaftesbury  0      and beautiful for all the counterfeit vizards which have been put upon her we must remember the carnival and what the occasion has been of this wild concourse and medley who were the institutors of it and to what purpose men were thus set awork and amusd we may laugh sufficiently at the original cheat and if pity will suffer us may make ourselves diversion enough with the folly and madness of those who are thus caught and practisd on by these impostures but we must remember withal our ethiopian and beware lest by taking plain nature for a vizard we become more ridiculous than the people whom we ridicule now if a jest or ridicule thus straind be capable of leading the judgment so far astray tis probable that an excess of fear or horror may work the same effect had it been your fortune my friend to have livd in asia at the time when the magi by an egregious imposture got possession of the empire no doubt you woud have had a detestation of the act and perhaps the very persons of the men might have grown so odious to you that after all the cheats and abuses they had committed you might have seen em dispatchd with as relentless an eye as our later european ancestors saw the shaftesbury  0      destruction of a like politick body of conjurers the knights templars who were almost become an overmatch for the civil sovereign your indignation perhaps might have carryd you to propose the razing all monuments and memorials of these magicians you might have    resolvd not to leave so much as their houses standing but if it had happend that these magicians in the time of their dominion had made any collection of books or compild any themselves in which they had treated of philosophy or morals or any other science or part of learning woud you have carryd your resentment so far as to have extirpated these also and condemnd every opinion or doctrine they had espousd for no other reason than merely because they had espousd it hardly a scythian a tartar or a goth woud act or reason so absurdly much less woud you my friend have carryd on this magophony or priestmassacre with such a barbarous zeal for in good earnest to destroy a philosophy in hatred to a man implies as errant a tartarnotion as to destroy or murder a man in order to plunder him of his wit and get the inheritance of his understanding i must confess indeed that had all the institutions statutes and regulations of this antient hierarchy resembled the shaftesbury  0      fundamental one of the order itself they might with a great deal of justice have been suppressd for one cant without some abhorrence read that law of theirs † for a magus must be born of a mother and her son but the conjurers as well rather suppose having considerd that they ought in their principle to appear as fair as possible to the world the better to conceal their practice found it highly for their interest to espouse some excellent moral rules and establish the very best maxims of this kind they thought it for their advantage perhaps on their first setting out to recommend the greatest purity of religion the greatest integrity of life and manners they may perhaps too in general have preachd up charity and goodwill they may have set to view the fairest face of human    nature and together with their bylaws and political institutions have interwove the honestest morals and best doctrine in the world how therefore shoud we have behavd ourselves in this affair how shoud we shaftesbury  0      have carryd ourselves towards this order of men at the time of the discovery of their cheat and ruin of their empire shoud we have falln to work instantly with their systems struck at their opinions and doctrines without distinction and erected a contrary philosophy in their teeth shoud we have flown at every religious and moral principle denyd every natural and social affection and renderd men as much wolves as was possible to one another whilst we describd em such and endeavourd to make them see themselves by far more monstrous and corrupt than with the worst intentions it was ever possible for the worst of em to become—this youll say doubtless woud have been a very preposterous part and coud never have been acted by other than mean spirits such as had been held in awe and overfrighted †by the magi and yet an ‡able and witty philosopher of our nation was we know of late shaftesbury  0      years so possessd with a horror of this kind that both with respect to politicks and morals he directly acted in this spirit of massacre the fright he took upon the sight of the then governing powers who unjustly assumd the authority of the people gave him such an abhorrence of all popular government and of the very notion of liberty itself that to extinguish it for ever he recommends the very extinguishing of letters and exhorts    princes not to spare so much as an antient roman or greek historian—is not this in truth somewhat gothick and has not our philosopher in appearance something of the savage that he shoud use philosophy and learning as the scythians are said to have usd anacharsis and others for having visited the wise of greece and learnt the manners of a polite people his quarrel with religion was the same as with liberty the same times gave him the same terror in this other kind he had nothing before his eyes beside the ravage of enthusiasm and the artifice of those who raisd and conducted that spirit and the good sociable man as savage and unsociable as he woud make himself and all mankind appear by his philosophy exposd himself during his life and took the utmost pains shaftesbury  0   0  that after his death we might be deliverd from the occasion of these terrors he did his utmost to shew us that both in religion and morals we were imposd on by our governors that there was nothing which by nature inclind us either way nothing which naturally drew us to the love of what was without or beyond ourselves tho the love of such great truths and sovereign maxims as he imagind these to be made him the most laborious of all men in composing systems of this kind for our use and forcd him notwithstanding his natural fear to run continually the highest risk of being a martyr for our deliverance give me leave therefore my friend on this occasion to prevent your seriousness and assure you that there is no such mighty danger as we are apt to imagine from these fierce prosecutors of superstition who are so jealous of every religious or moral principle whatever savages they may appear in philosophy they are in their common capacity as civil persons as one can wish their free communicating of their principles may witness for them tis the height of sociableness to be thus friendly and communicative shaftesbury  0     if the principles indeed were conceald from us and made a mystery they might become considerable things are often made    so by being kept as secrets of a sect or party and nothing helps this more than the antipathy and shyness of a contrary party if we fall presently into horrors and consternation upon the hearing maxims which are thought poisonous we are in no disposition to use that familiar and easy part of reason which is the best antidote the only poison to reason is passion for false reasoning is soon redressd where passion is removd but if the very hearing certain propositions of philosophy be sufficient to move our passion tis plain the poison has already gaind on us and we are effectually prevented in the use of our reasoning faculty were it not for the prejudices of this kind what shoud hinder us from diverting ourselves with the fancy of one of these modern reformers we have been speaking of what shoud we say to one of these antizealots who in the zeal of such a cool philosophy shoud assure us faithfully that we were the most mistaken men in the world to imagine there was any such thing as natural faith or justice for that it shaftesbury  0      was only force and power which constituted right that there was no such thing in reality as virtue no principle of order in things above or below no secret charm or force of nature by which everyone was made to operate willingly or unwillingly towards publick good and punishd and tormented if he did otherwise—is not this the very charm itself is not the gentleman at this instant under the power of it—sir the philosophy you have condescended to reveal to us is most extraordinary we are beholden to you for your instruction but pray whence is this zeal in our behalf what are we to you are you our father or if you were why this concern for us is there then such a thing as natural affection if not why all this pains why all this danger on our account why not keep this secret to yourself of what advantage is it to you to deliver us from the cheat the more are taken in it the better tis directly against your interest to undeceive us and let us know that only private interest governs you and that nothing nobler or of a larger kind shoud govern us whom you converse with leave us to ourselves and to that notable art by which we are hap shaftesbury  0     pily tamd and renderd thus mild    and sheepish tis not fit we shoud know that by nature we are all wolves is it possible that one who has really discoverd himself such shoud take pains to communicate such a discovery sect   section ii in reality my friend a severe brow may well be spard on this occasion when we are put thus upon the defense of common honesty by such fair honest gentlemen who are in practice so different from what they woud appear in speculation knaves i know there are in notion and principle as well as in practice who think all honesty as well as religion a mere cheat and by a very consistent reasoning have resolvd deliberately to do whatever by power or art they are able for their private advantage but such as these never open themselves in friendship to others they have no such passion for truth or love for mankind they have no quarrel with religion or morals but know what use to make of both upon occasion if they ever discover their principles tis only at unawares they are sure to preach honesty and go to church shaftesbury  0     on the other side the gentlemen for whom i am apologizing cannot however be calld hypocrites they speak as ill of themselves as they possibly can if they have hard thoughts of human nature tis a proof still of their humanity that they give such warning to the world if they represent men by nature treacherous and wild tis out of care for mankind lest by being too tame and trusting they shoud easily be caught impostors naturally speak the best of human nature that they may the easier abuse it these gentlemen on the contrary speak the worst and had rather they themselves shoud be censurd with the rest than that a few shoud by imposture prevail over the many for tis opinion of goodness which creates easiness of trust and by trust we are betrayd to power our very reason being thus captivated  0 by those in whom we come insensibly to have an implicit faith but supposing one another to be by nature such very savages we shall take care to come less in one anothers power and apprehending power to be insatiably coveted by all we shall the better fence against the evil not by giving all into one hand as the champion of this shaftesbury  0      cause woud have us but on the contrary by a right division and balance of power and by the restraint of good laws and limitations which may secure the publick liberty shoud you therefore ask me whether i really thought these gentlemen were fully persuaded of the principles they so often advance in company i shoud tell you that tho i woud not absolutely arraign the gentlemens sincerity yet there was something of mystery in the case more than was imagind the reason perhaps why men of wit delight so much to espouse these paradoxical systems is not in truth that they are so fully satisfyd with em but in a view the better to oppose some other systems which by their fair appearance have helpd they think to bring mankind under subjection they imagine that by this general scepticism which they woud introduce they shall better deal with the dogmatical spirit which prevails in some particular subjects and when they have accustomd men to bear contradiction in the main and hear the nature of things disputed at large it may be safer they conclude to argue separately upon certain nice points in which they are not altogether so well satisfyd so that from hence perhaps you may still better apprehend why in conversation shaftesbury  0      the spirit of raillery prevails so much and notions are taken up for no reason besides their being odd and out of the way sect   section iii but let who will condemn the humour thus describd for my part i am in no such apprehension from this sceptical kind of wit men indeed may in a serious way be so wrought on and confounded by different modes of opinion different systems    and schemes imposd by authority that they may wholly lose all notion or comprehension of truth i can easily apprehend what effect awe has over mens understandings i can very well suppose men may be frighted out of their wits but i have no apprehension they shoud be laughd out of em i can hardly imagine that in a pleasant way they shoud ever be talkd out of their love for society or reasond out of humanity and common sense a mannerly wit can hurt no cause or interest for which i am in the least concernd and philosophical speculations politely managd can never surely render mankind more unsociable or uncivilizd this is not the quarter from whence i can possibly expect an inroad of savageness and barbarity and by the best of my observation i have learnt that virtue is shaftesbury  0      never such a sufferer by being contested as by being betrayd my fear is not so much from its witty antagonists who give it exercise and put it on its defense as from its tender nurses who are apt to overlay it and kill it with excess of care and cherishing i have known a building which by the officiousness of the workmen has been so shord and screwd up on the side where they pretended it had a leaning that it has at last been turnd the contrary way and overthrown there has something perhaps of this kind happend in morals men have not been contented to shew the natural advantages of honesty and virtue they have rather lessend these the better as they thought to advance another foundation they have made virtue so mercenary a thing and have talkd so much of its rewards that one can hardly tell what there is in it after all which can be worth rewarding for to be bribd only or terrifyd into an honest practice bespeaks little of real honesty or worth we may make tis true whatever bargain we think fit and may bestow in favour what overplus we please but there can be no excellence or wisdom in voluntarily rewarding what is neither estimable nor deserving and if virtue be not really shaftesbury  0      estimable in itself i can see nothing estimable in following it for the sake of a bargain if the love of doing good be not of itself a good and right    inclination i know not how there can possibly be such a thing as goodness or virtue if the inclination be right tis a perverting of it to apply it solely to the reward and make us conceive such wonders of the grace and favour which is to attend virtue when there is so little shewn of the intrinsick worth or value of the thing itself i coud be almost tempted to think that the true reason why some of the most heroick virtues have so little notice taken of em in our holy religion is because there woud have been no room left for disinterestedness had they been intitled to a share of that infinite reward which providence has by revelation assignd to other dutys private friendship and shaftesbury  0      zeal for the publick and our    country are virtues purely voluntary in a christian they are no essential parts of his charity he is not so tyd to the affairs of this life nor is he obligd to enter into such engagements with this lower world as are of no help to him in acquiring a better his conversation is in heaven nor has he occasion for such supernumerary cares shaftesbury  0   00  or embarassments here on earth as may obstruct his way thither or retard him in the careful task of working out his own salvation if nevertheless any portion of reward be reservd hereafter for the generous part of a patriot or that of a thorow friend this is still behind the curtain and happily conceald from us that we may be the more deserving of it when it comes shaftesbury  0   0  it appears indeed under the jewish dispensation that each of these virtues had their illustrious examples and were in some manner recommended to us as honourable and worthy our imitation even saul himself as ill a prince as he is represented appears both living and dying to have been respected and praisd for the love he bore his native country and the love which was so remarkable between his son and his successor gives us a noble view of a disinterested friendship at least on one side but the heroick virtue of these persons had only the common reward of praise    attributed to it and coud not claim a future recompence under a religion which taught no future state nor exhibited any rewards or punishments besides such as were temporal and had respect to the written law and thus the jews as well as heathens were left to their philosophy to be instructed in the sublime part of virtue and inducd by reason to that which was never injoind em by command no premium or penalty being inforcd in these cases the disinterested part subsisted the virtue was a free choice and the magnanimity of the act was left intire he who woud be generous had the means he who woud frankly serve his friend or coun shaftesbury  0   0  try at the expence even of his life might do it on fair terms †dulce et decorum est was his sole reason twas inviting and becoming twas good and honest and that this is still a good reason and according to common sense i will endeavour to satisfy you for i shoud think myself very ridiculous to be angry with anyone for thinking me dishonest if i coud give no account of my honesty nor shew upon what principle i differd from ‡a knave shaftesbury  0   0  part iii sect   section i the roman satirist may be thought more than ordinarily satirical when speaking of the nobility and court he is so far from allowing them to be the standard of politeness and good sense that he makes em in a manner the reverse    rare is common sense in men of that rank some of the †most ingenious commentators however interpret this very differently from what is generally apprehended shaftesbury  0   0   they    make this common sense of the poet by a greek derivation to signify sense of publick weal and of the common interest love of the community or society natural affection humanity obligingness or that sort of civility which rises from a just sense of the common rights of mankind and the natural equality there is among those of the same species and indeed if we consider the thing nicely it must seem somewhat hard in the poet to have denyd wit or ability to a shaftesbury  0   0   court such as that of rome even under a tiberius or a nero but for humanity or sense of publick good and the common interest of mankind twas no such deep satir to question whether this was    properly the spirit of a court twas difficult to apprehend what community subsisted among courtiers or what publick between an absolute prince and his slavesubjects and for real society there coud shaftesbury  0   0   be none between such as had no other sense than that of private good our poet therefore seems not so immoderate in his censure if we consider it is the heart rather than the head he takes to task when reflecting on a courteducation he thinks it unapt to raise any affection towards a country and looks upon young princes and lords as the young masters of the world who being indulgd in all their passions and traind up in all manner of licentiousness have that thorow contempt and disregard of mankind which mankind in a manner deserves where arbitrary power is permitted and a tyranny adord  so much for the young man whom fame gives out as proud and puffedup and full of his relationship to nero a publick spirit can come only from a social feeling or sense of partnership with human kind now there are none so far from being partners in this sense or sharers in this common affection as they who scarcely know an equal nor consider themselves as subject to any law of fellowship or community and thus morality and good government go together there shaftesbury  0   0   is no real love of virtue without the knowledg of publick good and where absolute power is there is no publick they who live under a tyranny and have learnt to admire its power as sacred and divine are debauchd as much in their religion as in their morals publick good according to their apprehension is as little the measure or rule of government in the universe as in the state they have scarce a notion of what is good or just other than as mere will and power have determind omnipotence    they think woud hardly be itself were it not at liberty to dispense with the laws of equity and change at pleasure the standard of moral rectitude but notwithstanding the prejudices and corruptions of this kind tis plain there is something still of a publick principle even where it is most perverted and depressd the worst of magistracys the mere despotick kind can shew sufficient instances of zeal and affection towards it where no other government is known it seldom fails of having that allegiance and duty paid it which is owing to a better form the eastern countrys and many barbarous nations have been and still are examples of this kind the personal love they bear their prince however severe shaftesbury  0   0   towards them may shew how natural an affection there is towards government and order among mankind if men have really no publick parent no magistrate in common to cherish and protect em they will still imagine they have such a one and like newborn creatures who have never seen their dam will fansy one for themselves and apply as by nature prompted to some like form for favour and protection in the room of a true fosterfather and chief they will take after a false one and in the room of a legal government and just prince obey even a tyrant and endure a whole lineage and succession of such as for us britons thank heaven we have a better sense of government deliverd to us from our ancestors we have the notion of a publick and a constitution how a legislative and how an executive is modeld we understand weight and measure in this kind and can reason justly on the balance of power and property the maxims we draw from hence are as evident as those in mathematicks our increasing knowledg shews us every day more and more what common sense is in politicks and this must of necessity lead us to understand a like sense in morals which is the foundation shaftesbury  0   0  tis ridiculous to say there is any obligation on man to act    sociably or honestly in a formd government and not in that which is commonly calld the state of nature for to speak in the fashionable language of our modern philosophy society being founded on a compact the surrender made of every mans private unlimited right into the hands of the majority or such as the majority shoud appoint was of free choice and by a promise now the promise itself was made in the state of nature and that which coud make a promise obligatory in the state of nature must make all other acts of humanity as much our real duty and natural part thus faith justice honesty and virtue must have been as early as the state of nature or they coud never have been at all the civil union or confederacy coud never make right or wrong if they subsisted not before he who was free to any villany before his contract will and ought to make as free with his contract when he thinks fit the natural knave has the same reason to be a civil one and may dispense with his politick capacity as oft as he sees occasion tis only his word stands in his way—a man is obligd to keep his word why because he has given his shaftesbury  0    0  word to keep it—is not this a notable account of the original of moral justice and the rise of civil government and allegiance sect   section ii but to pass by these cavils of a philosophy which speaks so much of nature with so little meaning we may with justice surely place it as a principle that if any thing be natural in any creature or any kind tis that which is preservative of the kind itself and conducing to its welfare and support if in original and pure nature it be wrong to break a promise or be treacherous tis as truly wrong to be in any respect inhuman or any way wanting in our natural part towards human kind if eating and drinking be natural herding is so too if any appetite or sense be natural  0 the sense of fellowship is the same if there be any thing of nature in that affection which is between the sexes the affection is certainly as natural towards the consequent offspring and so again between the offspring themselves as kindred and companions bred under the same discipline and oeconomy and thus a clan or tribe is gradually formd a publick is recognizd and besides the pleasure found in social entertainment language and dis shaftesbury  0      course there is so apparent a necessity for continuing this good correspondency and union that to have no sense or feeling of this kind no love of country community or any thing in common woud be the same as to be insensible even of the plainest means of selfpreservation and most necessary condition of selfenjoyment how the wit of man shoud so puzzle this cause as to make civil government and society appear a kind of invention and creature of art i know not for my own part methinks this herding principle and associating inclination is seen so natural and strong in most men that one might readily affirm twas even from the violence of this passion that so much disorder arose in the general society of mankind universal good or the interest of the world in general is a kind of remote philosophical object that greater community falls not easily under the eye nor is a national interest or that of a whole people or body politick so readily apprehended in less partys men may be intimately conversant and acquainted with one another they can there better taste society and enjoy the common good and interest of a more contracted publick they view the whole compass and extent shaftesbury  0       of their community and see and know particularly whom they serve and to what end they associate and conspire all men have naturally their share of this combining principle and they who are of the sprightliest and most active facultys have so large a share of it that unless it be happily directed by right reason it can never find exercise for itself in so remote a sphere as that of the body politick at large for here perhaps the thousandth part of those whose interests are concernd    are scarce so much as known by sight no visible band is formd no strict alliance but the conjunction is made with different persons orders and ranks of men not sensibly but in idea according to that general view or notion of a state or commonwealth thus the social aim is disturbd for want of certain scope the close sympathy and conspiring virtue is apt to lose itself for want of direction in so wide a field nor is the passion anywhere so strongly felt or vigorously exerted as in actual conspiracy or war in which the highest geniuss are often known the forwardest to employ themselves for the most generous spirits are the most combining they delight most to move in concert and feel if i may so say in the strongest manner the force of the confederating charm shaftesbury  0      tis strange to imagine that war which of all things appears the most savage shoud be the passion of the most heroick spirits but tis in war that the knot of fellowship is closest drawn tis in war that mutual succour is most given mutual danger run and common affection most exerted and employd for heroism and philanthropy are almost one and the same yet by a small misguidance of the affection a lover of mankind becomes a ravager a hero and deliverer becomes an oppressor and destroyer hence other divisions amongst men hence in the way of peace and civil government that love of party and subdivision by cabal for sedition is a kind of cantonizing already begun within the state to cantonize is natural when the society grows vast and bulky and powerful states have found other advantages in sending colonys abroad than merely that of having elbowroom at home or extending their dominion into distant countrys vast empires are in many respects unnatural but particularly in this that be they ever so well constituted the affairs of many must in such governments turn upon a very few and the relation be less sensible and in a manner lost between the magistrate and people in a body so un shaftesbury  0      wieldy in its limbs and whose members lie so remote from one another and distant from the head tis in such bodys as these that strong factions are aptest to    engender the associating spirits for want of exercise form new movements and seek a narrower sphere of activity when they want action in a greater thus we have wheels within wheels and in some national constitutions notwithstanding the absurdity in politicks we have one empire within another nothing is so delightful as to incorporate distinctions of many kinds are invented religious societys are formd orders are erected and their interests espousd and servd with the utmost zeal and passion founders and patrons of this sort are never wanting wonders are performd in this wrong social spirit by those members of separate societys and the associating genius of man is never better provd than in those very societys which are formd in opposition to the general one of mankind and to the real interest of the state in short the very spirit of faction for the greatest part seems to be no other than the abuse or irregularity of that social love and common affection which is natural to mankind for the opposite shaftesbury  0       of sociableness is selfishness and of all characters the thorowselfish one is the least forward in taking party the men of this sort are in this respect true men of moderation they are secure of their temper and possess themselves too well to be in danger of entering warmly into any cause or engaging deeply with any side or faction sect   section iii you have heard it my friend as a common saying that interest governs the world but i believe whoever looks narrowly into the affairs of it will find that passion humour caprice zeal faction and a thousand other springs which are counter to selfinterest have as considerable a part in the movements of this machine there are more wheels and counterpoises in this engine than are easily imagind tis of too complex a kind to fall under one simple view or be explaind thus briefly in a word or two the studiers of this mechanism must have a very partial eye    to overlook all other motions besides those of the lowest and narrowest compass tis hard that in the plan or description of this clockwork no wheel or balance shoud be allowd on the side of the better and more enlargd affections that nothing shoud be understood to be shaftesbury  0       done in kindness or generosity nothing in pure goodnature or friendship or thro any social or natural affection of any kind when perhaps the main springs of this machine will be found to be either these very natural affections themselves or a compound kind derivd from them and retaining more than one half of their nature but here my friend you must not expect that i shoud draw you up a formal scheme of the passions or pretend to shew you their genealogy and relation how they are interwoven with one another or interfere with our happiness and interest twoud be out of the genius and compass of such a letter as this to frame a just plan or model by which you might with an accurate view observe what proportion the friendly and natural affections seem to bear in this order of architecture modern projectors i know woud willingly rid their hands of these natural materials and woud fain build after a more uniform way they woud newframe the human heart and have a mighty fancy to reduce all its motions balances and weights to that one principle and foundation of a cool and deliberate selfishness men it seems are un shaftesbury  0      willing to think they can be so outwitted and imposd on by nature as to be made to serve her purposes rather than their own they are ashamd to be drawn thus out of themselves and forcd from what they esteem their true interest there has been in all times a sort of narrowminded philosophers who have thought to set this difference to rights by conquering nature in themselves a primitive father and founder among these saw well this power of †nature and understood it so far that he earnestly exhorted his followers neither to beget children    nor serve their country there was no dealing with nature it seems while these alluring objects stood in the way relations friends countrymen laws politick constitutions the beauty of order and government and the interest of society and mankind were objects which he well saw woud naturally raise a stronger affection than any which was grounded upon the narrow bottom of mere self his advice therefore not to marry nor engage at all in the publick was wise and sutable to his design there was no way to be truly a disciple of this philosophy but to leave family friends country and society to cleave to it—and in shaftesbury  0       good earnest who woud not if it were happiness to do so—the philosopher however was kind in telling us his thought twas a token of his fatherly love of mankind  thou father art es is the revised reading discoverer of things thou givest us fatherly precepts but the revivers of this philosophy in latter days appear to be of a lower genius they seem to have understood less of this force of nature and thought to alter the thing by shifting a name they woud so explain all the social passions and natural affections as to denominate em of †the selfish kind thus civility hospitality humanity towards strangers or people in distress is only a more deliberate selfishness an honest heart is only a more cunning one and honesty and goodnature a more deliberate or betterregulated selflove the love of kindred children and posterity is purely love of self and of ones own immediate blood as if by this reckoning all mankind were not included all being of one blood and joind by intermarriages and alliances as they have been transplanted in colonys and mixd one with another and shaftesbury  0       thus love of ones country and love of mankind must also be selflove magnanimity and courage no doubt are modifications of    this universal selflove for courage says our modern philosopher is constant anger and all men says †a witty poet woud be cowards if they durst that the poet and the philosopher both were cowards may be yielded perhaps without dispute they may have spoken the best of their knowledg but for true courage it has so little to do with anger that there lies always the strongest suspicion against it where this passion is highest the true courage is the cool and calm the bravest of men have the least of a brutal bullying insolence and in the very time of danger are found the most serene pleasant and free rage we know can make a coward forget himself and fight but what is done in fury or anger can never be placd to the account of courage were it otherwise womankind might claim to be the stoutest sex for their hatred and anger have ever been allowd the strongest and most lasting shaftesbury  0    0 other authors there have been of a yet inferior kind a sort of ‡distributers and petty retailers of this wit who have run changes and divisions without end upon this article of selflove you have the very same thought spun out a hundred ways and drawn into mottos and devises to set forth this riddle that act as disinterestedly or generously as you please self still is at the bottom and nothing else now if these gentlemen who delight so much in the play of words but are cautious how they grapple closely with definitions woud tell us only what selfinterest was and determine happiness and good there woud be an end of this    enigmatical wit for in this we shoud all agree that happiness was to be pursud and in fact was always sought after but whether found in following nature and giving way to common affection or in suppressing it and turning every passion towards private advan shaftesbury  0      tage a narrow selfend or the preservation of mere life this woud be the matter in debate between us the question woud not be who lovd himself or who not but who lovd and servd himself the rightest and after the truest manner tis the height of wisdom no doubt to be rightly selfish and to value life as far as life is good belongs as much to courage as to discretion but a wretched life is no wise mans wish to be without honesty is in effect to be without natural affection or sociableness of any kind and a life without natural affection friendship or sociableness woud be found a wretched one were it to be tryd tis as these feelings and affections are intrinsecally valuable and worthy that selfinterest is to be rated and esteemd a man is by nothing so much himself as by his temper and the character of his passions and affections if he loses what is manly and worthy in these he is as much lost to himself as when he loses his memory and understanding the least step into villany or baseness changes the character and value of a life he who woud preserve life at any rate must abuse himself more than anyone can abuse him and if life be not a dear thing indeed he who has refusd to live a villain and has shaftesbury  0       preferd death to a base action has been a gainer by the bargain sect   section iv tis well for you my friend that in your education you have had little to do with the philosophy or philosophers of our days a good poet and an honest historian may afford learning    enough for a gentleman and such a one whilst he reads these authors as his diversion will have a truer relish of their sense and understand em better than a pedant with all his labours and the assistance of his volumes of commentators i am sensible that of old twas the custom to send the youth of highest quality to philosophers to be formd twas in their schools in their company and by their precepts and example that the illustrious pupils were inurd to hardship and exercisd in the severest courses of temperance and selfdenial by such an early discipline they were fitted for the command of others to maintain their countrys honour in war rule wisely in the state and fight against luxury and corruption in times of prosperity and peace if any of shaftesbury  0       these arts are comprehended in universitylearning tis well but as some universitys in the world are now modeld they seem not so very effectual to these purposes nor so fortunate in preparing for a right practice of the world or a just knowledg of men and things had you been thorowpacd in the ethicks or politicks of the schools i shoud never have thought of writing a word to you upon common sense or the love of mankind i shoud not have cited the poets dulce  decorum nor if i had made a character for you as he for his noble friend shoud i have crownd it with his †he fears not to die for his dear friends and fatherland our philosophy nowadays runs after the manner of that able sophister who said ‡skin for skin all that a man has will he give for his life tis orthodox divinity as well as sound philosophy with some men to rate life by the number and exquisiteness of the pleasing sensations these they constantly set in opposition to dry virtue and honesty and upon this foot they think it proper to call all men fools who woud hazard a life or part with any of these pleasing sensations shaftesbury  0       except on the condition of being repaid    in the same coin and with good interest into the bargain thus it seems we are to learn virtue by usury and inhance the value of life and of the pleasures of sense in order to be wise and to live well but you my friend are stubborn in this point and instead of being brought to think mournfully of death or to repine at the loss of what you may sometimes hazard by your honesty you can laugh at such maxims as these and divert yourself with the improvd selfishness and philosophical cowardice of these fashionable moralists you will not be taught to value life at their rate or degrade honesty as they do who make it only a name you are persuaded there is something more in the thing than fashion or applause that worth and merit are substantial and no way variable by fancy or will and that honour is as much itself when acting by itself and unseen as when seen and applauded by all the world shoud one who had the countenance of a gentleman ask me why i woud avoid being nasty when nobody was present in the first place i shoud be fully satisfyd that he himself was a very nasty gentleman who coud ask this question and that it woud be shaftesbury  0       a hard matter for me to make him ever conceive what true cleanliness was however i might notwithstanding this be contented to give him a slight answer and say twas because i had a nose shoud he trouble me further and ask again what if i had a cold or what if naturally i had no such nice smell i might answer perhaps that i card as little to see myself nasty as that others shoud see me in that condition but what if it were in the dark why even then tho i had neither nose nor eyes my sense of the matter woud still be the same my nature woud rise at the thought of what was sordid or if it did not i shoud have a wretched nature indeed and hate myself for a beast honour myself i never coud whilst i had no better a sense of what in reality i owd myself and what became me as a human creature much in the same manner have i heard it askd why shoud a man be honest in the dark what a man must be to ask this    question i wont say but for those who have no better a reason for being honest than the fear of a gibbet or a jail i shoud not i confess much covet their company or acquaintance and if any guardian of mine who had kept shaftesbury  0       his trust and given me back my estate when i came of age had been discoverd to have acted thus thro fear only of what might happen to him i shoud for my own part undoubtedly continue civil and respectful to him but for my opinion of his worth it woud be such as the pythian god had of his votary who devoutly feard him and therefore restord to a friend what had been deposited in his hands  so he paid it back from fear not from principle yet still he proved the oracle true and fit to be gods voice for he and his house perished root and branch i know very well that many services to the publick are done merely for the sake of a gratuity and that informers in particular are to be taken care of and sometimes made pensioners of state but i must beg pardon for the particular thoughts i may have of these gentlemens merit and shall never bestow my esteem on any other than the voluntary discoverers of villany and hearty prosecutors of their countrys interest and in this respect i know nothing greater or nobler than the undertaking and managing some impor shaftesbury  0      tant accusation by which some high criminal of state or some formd body of conspirators against the publick may be arraignd and brought to punishment thro the honest zeal and publick affection of a private man i know too that the mere vulgar of mankind often stand in need of such a rectifying object as the gallows before their eyes yet i have no belief that any man of a liberal education or common honesty ever needed to have recourse to this idea in his  0 mind the better to restrain him from playing the knave and if a saint had no other virtue than what was raisd in him by the same objects of reward and punishment in a more distant state i know not whose love or esteem he might gain besides but for my own part i shoud never think him worthy of mine if my slave tells me i have not stolen nor run away i answer you have your reward you are not flogged i have not killed a man the crows do not devour you on the cross i am good and honest my sabine bailiff shakes his head and denies it shaftesbury  0        part iv sect   section i by this time my friend you may possibly i hope be satisfyd that as i am in earnest in defending raillery so i can be sober too in the use of it tis in reality a serious study to learn to temper and regulate that humour which nature has given us as a more lenitive remedy against vice and a kind of specifick against superstition and melancholy delusion there is a great difference between seeking how to raise a laugh from every thing and seeking in every thing what justly may be laughd at for nothing is ridiculous except what is deformd nor is any thing proof against raillery except what is handsom and just and therefore tis the hardest thing in the world to deny fair honesty the use of this weapon which can never bear an edge against herself and bears against every thing contrary shaftesbury  0         if the very italian buffoons were to give us the rule in these cases we shoud learn by them that in their lowest and most scurrilous way of wit there was nothing so successfully to be playd upon as the passions of cowardice and avarice one may defy the world to turn real bravery or generosity into ridicule a glutton or mere sensualist is as ridiculous as the other two characters nor can an unaffected temperance be made the subject of contempt to any besides the grossest and most contemptible of mankind now these three ingredients make up a virtuous character as the contrary three a vicious one how therefore can we possibly make a jest of honesty—to laugh both ways is nonsensical and if the ridicule lie against sottishness avarice and cowardice you see the consequence a man must be soundly ridiculous who with all the wit imaginable woud go about to ridicule wisdom or laugh at honesty or good manners a man of thorow goodbreeding whatever else he be is incapable of doing a rude or brutal action he never deliberates in this case or considers of the matter by prudential rules of selfinterest and advantage he acts from his nature in a manner necessarily and with shaftesbury  0    0 out reflection and if he did not it were impossible for him to answer his character or be found that truly wellbred man on every occasion tis the same with the honest man he cant deliberate in the case of a plain villany a plum is no temptation to him he likes and loves himself too well to change hearts with one of those corrupt miscreants who amongst em gave that name to a round sum of mony gaind by rapine and plunder of the commonwealth he who woud enjoy a freedom of mind and be truly possessor of himself must be above the thought of stooping to what is villanous or base he on the other side who has a heart to stoop must necessarily quit the thought of manliness resolution friendship merit and a character with himself and others but to affect these enjoyments and advantages together with the privileges of a licentious principle to pretend to enjoy society and a free mind in company with a knavish heart    is as ridiculous as the way of children who eat their cake and afterwards cry for it when men begin to deliberate about dishonesty and finding it go less against their stomach ask slily why they shoud stick at a good piece of knavery for a good sum they shoud be told as children that they cant eat their cake and have it shaftesbury  0      when men indeed are become accomplishd knaves they are past crying for their cake they know themselves and are known by mankind tis not these who are so much envyd or admird the moderate kind are the more taking with us yet had we sense we should consider tis in reality the thorow profligate knave the very compleat unnatural villain alone who can any way bid for happiness with the honest man true interest is wholly on one side or the other all between is inconsistency irresolution remorse vexation and an aguefit from hot to cold from one passion to another quite contrary a perpetual discord of life and an alternate disquiet and selfdislike the only rest or repose must be thro one determind considerate resolution which when once taken must be courageously kept and the passions and affections brought under obedience to it the temper steeld and hardend to the mind the disposition to the judgment both must agree else all must be disturbance and confusion so that to think with ones self in good earnest why may not shaftesbury  0       one do this little villany or commit this one treachery and but for once is the most ridiculous imagination in the world and contrary to common sense for a common honest man whilst left to himself and undisturbd by philosophy and subtle reasonings about his interest gives no    other answer to the thought of villany than that he cant possibly find in his heart to set about it or conquer the natural aversion he has to it and this is natural and just the truth is as notions stand now in the world with respect to morals honesty is like to gain little by philosophy or deep speculations of any kind in the main tis best to stick to common sense and go no further mens first thoughts in this matter are generally better than their second their natural notions better than those refind by study or consultation with casuists according to common speech as well as common sense honesty is the best policy but according to refind sense the only welladvisd persons as to this world are errant knaves and they alone are thought to serve themselves who serve their passions and indulge their loosest appetites and desires—such it seems are the wise and such the wisdom of this world shaftesbury  0      an ordinary man talking of a vile action in a way of common sense says naturally and heartily he woud not be guilty of such a thing for the whole world but speculative men find great modifications in the case many ways of evasion many remedys many alleviations a good gift rightly applyd a right method of suing out a pardon good almshouses and charitable foundations erected for right worshippers and a good zeal shewn for the right belief may sufficiently atone for one wrong practice especially when it is such as raises a man to a considerable power as they say of doing good and serving the true cause many a good estate many a high station has been gaind upon such a bottom as this some crowns too may have been purchasd on these terms and some great emperors if i mistake not there have been of old who were much assisted by these or the like principles and in return were not ingrateful to the cause and party which had assisted em the forgers of such morals have been amply endowd and the world has paid roundly for its philosophy since the original plain principles of humanity and the simple    honest shaftesbury  0       precepts of peace and mutual love have by a sort of spiritual chymists been so sublimated as to become the highest corrosives and passing thro their limbecks have yielded the strongest spirit of mutual hatred and malignant persecution sect   section ii but our humours my friend incline us not to melancholy reflections let the solemn reprovers of vice proceed in the manner most sutable to their genius and character i am ready to congratulate with em on the success of their labours in that authoritative way which is allowd em i know not in the mean while why others may not be allowd to ridicule folly and recommend wisdom and virtue if possibly they can in a way of pleasantry and mirth i know not why poets or such as write chiefly for the entertainment of themselves and others may not be allowd this privilege and if it be the complaint of our standing reformers that they are not heard so well by the gentlemen of fashion if they exclaim against those airy wits who fly to ridicule as a protection and make successful sallys from that quarter why shoud it be denyd one who is only a volunteer in this cause to engage the adversary on his own terms and expose shaftesbury  0       himself willingly to such attacks on the single condition of being allowd fair play in the same kind by gentlemen of fashion i understand those to whom a natural good genius or the force of good education has given a sense of what is naturally graceful and becoming some by mere nature others by art and practice are masters of an ear in musick an eye in painting a fancy in the ordinary things of ornament and grace a judgment in proportions of all kinds and a general good taste in most of those subjects which make the amusement and delight of the ingenious people of the world let such gentlemen as these be as extravagant as they please or as irregular in their morals they must at the same time discover their inconsistency    live at variance with themselves and in contradiction to that principle on which they ground their highest pleasure and entertainment of all other beautys which virtuosos pursue poets celebrate musicians sing and architects or artists of whatever kind describe or form the most delightful the most engaging and pathetick is that which is drawn from real life and from the passions nothing affects the heart like that which is purely from itself and of its own nature such as the beauty of sentiments shaftesbury  0       the grace of actions the turn of characters and the proportions and features of a human mind this lesson of philosophy even a romance a poem or a play may teach us whilst the fabulous author leads us with such pleasure thro the labyrinth of the affections and interests us whether we will or no in the passions of his heroes and heroines like a mage he tortures enrages soothes fills us with false terrors let poets or the men of harmony deny if they can this force of nature or withstand this moral magick they for their parts carry a double portion of this charm about em for in the first place the very passion which inspires em is itself the love of numbers decency and proportion and this too not in a narrow sense or after a selfish way for who of them composes for himself but in a friendly social view for the pleasure and good of others even down to posterity and future ages and in the next place tis evident in these performers that their chief theme and subject that which raises their genius the most and by which they so effectually move others is purely manners and the moral part for this is the shaftesbury  0       effect and this the beauty of their art in vocal measures of syllables and sounds to express the harmony    and numbers of an inward kind and represent the beautys of a human soul by proper foils and contrarietys which serve as graces in this limning and render this musick of the passions more powerful and enchanting the admirers of beauty in the fair sex woud laugh perhaps to hear of a moral part in their amours yet what a stir is made about a heart what curious search of sentiments and tender thoughts what praises of a humour a sense a jenesçaiquoi of wit and all those graces of a mind which these virtuosolovers delight to celebrate let them settle this matter among themselves and regulate as they think fit the proportions which these different beautys hold one to another they must allow still there is a beauty of the mind and such as is essential in the case why else is the very air of foolishness enough to cloy a lover at first sight why does an idiotlook and manner destroy the effect of all those outward charms and rob the fairone of her power tho regularly armd in all the exactness of features and complexion we may imagine what we please of a substantial solid part of beauty but were the shaftesbury  0       subject to be well criticizd we shoud find perhaps that what we most admird even in the turn of outward features was only a mysterious expression and a kind of shadow of something inward in the temper and that when we were struck with a majestick air a sprightly look an amazon bold grace or a contrary soft and gentle one twas chiefly the fancy of these characters or qualitys which wrought on us our imagination being busyd in forming beauteous shapes and images of this rational kind which entertaind the mind and held it in admiration whilst other passions of a lower species were employd another way the preliminary addresses the declarations the explanations confidences clearings the dependence on something mutual something felt by way of return the spes animi credula mutui all these become necessary ingredients in the affair of love and are authentically establishd by the men of elegance and art in this way of passion nor can the men of cooler passions and more deliberate pursuits withstand the force of beauty in other subjects everyone is    a virtuoso of a higher or lower degree everyone pursues a grace and courts a venus of one kind or another the venustum the honestum the shaftesbury  0       decorum of things will force its way they who refuse to give it scope in the nobler subjects of a rational and moral kind will find its prevalency elsewhere in an †inferior order of things they who overlook the main springs of action and despise the thought of numbers and proportion in a life at large will in the mean particulars of it be no less taken up and engagd as either in the study of common arts or in the care and culture of mere mechanick beautys the models of houses buildings and their accompanying ornaments the plans of gardens and their compartments the ordering of walks plantations avenues and a thousand other symmetrys will succeed in the room of that happier and higher symmetry and order of a mind the ‡species of fair noble handsom will discover itself on a thousand occasions and in a thousand subjects the specter still will haunt us in some shape or other and when driven from our cool thoughts and frighted from the closet will meet us even at court and fill our heads with dreams of grandure titles honours and a false magnificence and beauty to which we are ready to sacrifice our highest pleasure and ease and for the sake of which we become the merest drudges and most abject slaves shaftesbury  0    0 the men of pleasure who seem the greatest contemners of this philosophical beauty are forcd often to confess her charms they can as heartily as others commend honesty and are as much struck with the beauty of a generous part they admire the thing itself tho not the means and if possible they woud so order it as to make probity and luxury agree but the rules of harmony will not permit it the dissonancys are too strong however the attempts of this kind are not unpleasant to observe for tho some of the voluptuous are found sordid pleaders for baseness and corruption    of every sort yet others more generous endeavour to keep measures with honesty and understanding pleasure better are for bringing it under some rule they condemn this manner they praise the other so far was right but further wrong such a case was allowable but such a one not to be admitted they introduce a justice and an order in their pleasures they woud bring reason to be of their party account in some manner for their lives and form themselves to some kind of consonancy and agreement or shoud they find this impracticable on certain terms they woud chuse to sacrifice their own pleasures to those which arise from a generous behaviour a regu shaftesbury  0      larity of conduct and a consistency of life and manners to learn the measures and rules of the true life other occasions will put us upon this thought but chiefly a strong view of merit in a generous character opposd to some detestably vile one hence it is that among poets the satirists seldom fail in doing justice to virtue nor are any of the nobler poets false to this cause even modern wits whose turn is all towards gallantry and pleasure when barefacd villany stands in their way and brings the contrary species in view can sing in passionate strains the praises of plain honesty when we are highly friends with the world successful with the fair and prosperous in the possession of other beautys we may perchance as is usual despise this sober mistress but when we see in the issue what riot and excess naturally produce in the world when we find that by luxurys means and for the service of vile interests knaves are advancd above us and the †vilest of men preferd before the honestest we then behold virtue in a new light and by the assistance of shaftesbury  0       such a foil can discern the beauty of honesty and the reality of those charms which before we understood not to be either natural or powerful    sect   section iii and thus after all the most natural beauty in the world is honesty and moral truth for all beauty is truth true features make the beauty of a face and true proportions the beauty of architecture as true measures that of harmony and musick in poetry which is all fable truth still is the perfection and whoever is scholar enough to read the antient philosopher or his modern copists upon the nature of a dramatick and epick poem will easily understand †this account of truth a painter if he has any genius understands the truth and unity of design and knows he is even then unnatural when he follows nature too close and strictly copys life for his art allows him not to bring all nature into his shaftesbury  0       piece but a part only however his piece if it be beautiful and carrys truth must be a whole by itself compleat independent and withal as great and comprehensive as he can make it so that particulars on this occasion must yield to the general design and all things be subservient to that which is principal in order to form a certain easiness of sight a simple clear and ‡united view which woud be broken and disturbd by the expression of any thing peculiar or distinct shaftesbury  0       0 now the variety of nature is such as to distinguish every thing she forms by a peculiar original character which if strictly observd will make the subject appear unlike to any thing extant in the world besides but this effect the good poet and painter seek industriously to prevent they hate minuteness and are afraid of singularity which woud make their images or characters appear capricious and fantastical the mere facepainter indeed has little in common with the poet but like the mere historian shaftesbury  0       copys what he sees and minutely traces every feature and odd mark tis otherwise with the men of invention and design tis from the many objects of nature and not from a particularone that those geniuss form the idea of their work thus the best artists are said to have been indefatigable in studying the best statues as esteeming them a better rule than the perfectest human bodys coud    afford and thus some considerable wits have recommended the best poems as preferable to the best of historys and better teaching the truth of characters and nature of mankind nor can this criticism be thought highstraind tho few confine themselves to these rules few are insensible of em whatever quarter we may give to our vicious poets or other composers of irregular and shortlivd works we know very well that the standing pieces of good artists must be formd after a more uniform way every just work of theirs comes under those natural rules of proportion and truth the creature of their brain must be like one of natures formation it must have a body and parts shaftesbury  0       proportionable or the very vulgar will not fail to criticize the work when it has neither †head nor tail for so common sense according to just philosophy judges of those works which want the justness of a whole and shew their author however curious and exact in particulars to be in the main a very bungler ‡unhappy in the sum total of his work because he will be unable to explain the whole such is poetical and such if i may so call it graphical or plastick truth narrative or historical truth must needs be highly estimable especially when we consider how mankind who are become so deeply interested in the subject have sufferd by the want of clearness in it tis itself a part of moral truth to be a judg in one requires a judgment in the other the morals the character and genius of an author must be thorowly considerd and the historian or relater of things important to mankind must whoever    he be approve himself many ways to us both in respect of his judgment candor and disinterestedness eer we are bound to take any thing on his authority and as for critical truth or the judgment and shaftesbury  0       determination of what commentators translators paraphrasts grammarians and others have on this occasion deliverd to us in the midst of such variety of style such different readings such interpolations and corruptions in the originals such mistakes of copists transcribers editors and a hundred such accidents to which antient books are subject it becomes upon the whole a matter of nice speculation considering withal that the reader tho an able linguist must be supported by so many other helps from chronology natural philosophy geography and other sciences and thus many previous truths are to be examind and understood in order to judg rightly of historical truth and of the past actions and circumstances of mankind as deliverd to us by antient authors of different nations ages times and different in their characters and interests some moral and philosophical truths there are withal so evident in themselves that twoud be easier to imagine half mankind to have run mad and joind precisely in one and the same species of folly than to admit any thing as truth which shoud be advancd against such natural knowledg fundamental reason and common sense shaftesbury  0      this i have mentiond the rather because some modern zealots appear to have no better knowledg of truth nor better manner of judging it than by counting noses by this rule if they can poll an indifferent number out of a mob if they can produce a set of lancashire noddles remote provincial headpieces or visionary assemblers to attest a story of a witch upon a broomstick and a flight in the air they triumph in the solid proof of their new prodigy and cry great is truth and it will prevail  religion no doubt is much indebted to these men of prodigy    who in such a discerning age woud set her on the foot of popular tradition and venture her on the same bottom with parishtales and gossiping storys of imps goblins and demoniacal pranks invented to fright children or make practice for common exorcists and cunningmen for by that name you know country people are usd to call those dealers in mystery who are thought to conjure in an honest way and foil the devil at his own weapon and now my friend i can perceive tis time to put an end to these reflections left by endeavouring to expound shaftesbury  0       things any further i shoud be drawn from my way of humour to harangue profoundly on these subjects but shoud you find i had moralizd in any tolerable manner according to common sense and without canting i coud be satisfyd with my performance such as it is without fearing what disturbance i might possibly give to some formal censors of the age whose discourses and writings are of another strain i have taken the liberty you see to laugh upon some occasions and if i have either laughd wrong or been impertinently serious i can be content to be laughd at in my turn if contrariwise i am raild at i can laugh still as before and with fresh advantage to my cause for tho in reality there coud be nothing less a laughing matter than the provokd rage illwill and fury of certain zealous gentlemen were they armd as lately they have been known yet as the magistrate has since taken care to pare their talons there is nothing very terrible in their encounter on the contrary there is something comical in the case it brings to ones mind the fancy of those grotesque figures and dragonfaces which are seen often in the frontispiece and on the cornerstones of old buildings they seem placd there as the defenders and supporters of the edifice but with all their grimace are as harmless to shaftesbury  0    0  people without as they are useless to the building within great efforts of anger to little purpose serve for pleasantry and farce exceeding fierceness with perfect inability and impotence makes the highest ridicule i am dear friend affectionately yours c       treatise iii viz soliloquy or advice to an author  and you need not have looked beyond yourself pers sat   printed first in the year mdccx        advice c part i sect   section i i have often thought how illnaturd a maxim it was which on many occasions i have heard from people of good understanding that as to what related to private conduct noone was ever the better for advice but upon farther examination i have resolvd with myself that the maxim might be admitted without any violent prejudice to mankind for in the manner advice shaftesbury   0      was generally given there was no reason i thought to wonder it shoud be so ill receivd something there was which strangely inverted the case and made the giver to be the only gainer for by what i coud observe in many occurrences of our lives that which we calld giving advice was properly taking an occasion to    shew our own wisdom at anothers expence on the other side to be instructed or to receive advice on the terms usually prescribd to us was little better than tamely to afford another the occasion of raising himself a character from our defects in reality however able or willing a man may be to advise tis no easy matter to make advice a free gift for to make a gift free indeed there must be nothing in it which takes from another to add to ourself in all other respects to give and to dispense is generosity and goodwill but to bestow wisdom is to gain a mastery which cant so easily be allowd us men willingly learn whatever else is taught em they can bear a master in mathematicks in musick or in any other science but not in understanding and good sense tis the hardest thing imaginable for an author not to appear assuming in this respect for all authors at large are shaftesbury   0      in a manner professd masters of understanding to the age and for this reason in early days poets were lookd upon as authentick sages for dictating rules of life and teaching manners and good sense how they may have lost their pretension i cant say tis their peculiar happiness and advantage not to be obligd to lay their claim openly and if whilst they profess only to please they secretly advise and give instruction they may now perhaps as well as formerly be esteemd with justice the best and most honourable among authors mean while if dictating and prescribing be of so dangerous a nature in other authors what must his case be who dictates to authors themselves to this i answer that my pretension is not so much to give advice as to consider of the way and manner of advising my science if it be any is no better than that of a languagemaster or a logician for i have taken it strongly into my head that there is a certain knack or legerdemain in argument by which we may safely proceed to the dangerous part of advising and make sure of the good fortune to have our advice accepted if it be any thing worth shaftesbury   0     my proposal is to consider of this affair as a case of surgery    tis practice we all allow which makes a hand but who on this occasion will be practisd on who will willingly be the first to try our hand and afford us the requisite experience here lies the difficulty for supposing we had hospitals for this sort of surgery and there were always in readiness certain meek patients who woud bear any incisions and be probd or tented at our pleasure the advantage no doubt woud be considerable in this way of practice some insight must needs be obtaind in time a hand too might be acquird but in all likelihood a very roughone which woud by no means serve the purpose of this latter surgery for here a tenderness of hand is principally requisite no surgeon will be calld who has not feeling and compassion and where to find a subject in which the operator is likely to preserve the highest tenderness and yet act with the greatest resolution and boldness is certainly a matter of no slight consideration i am sensible there is in all considerable projects at first appearance a certain air of chimerical fancy and conceit which is apt to render the projectors shaftesbury   0      somewhat liable to ridicule i woud therefore prepare my reader against this prejudice by assuring him that in the operation proposd there is nothing which can justly excite his laughter or if there be the laugh perhaps may turn against him by his own consent and with his own concurrence which is a specimen of that very art or science we are about to illustrate accordingly if it be objected against the abovementiond practice and art of surgery that we can nowhere find such a meek patient with whom we can in reality make bold and for whom nevertheless we are sure to preserve the greatest tenderness and regard i assert the contrary and say for instance that we have each of us our selves to practise on mere quibble youll say for who can thus multiply himself into two persons and be his own subject who can properly laugh at himself or find in his heart to be either merry or severe on such an occasion go to the poets and they will present you with many instances nothing is more common with them than this sort of soliloquy a person  00 of profound parts or perhaps of ordinary capacity happens on some occasion to commit a fault he is concernd shaftesbury   0      for it he comes alone upon the stage looks about him to see if any body be near then takes himself to task without sparing himself in the least you woud wonder to hear how close he pushes matters and how thorowly he carrys on the business of selfdissection by virtue of this soliloquy he becomes two distinct persons he is pupil and preceptor he teaches and he learns and in good earnest had i nothing else to plead in behalf of the morals of our modern dramatick poets i shoud defend em still against their accusers for the sake of this very practice which they have taken care to keep up in its full force for whether the practice be natural or no in respect of common custom and usage i take upon me to assert that it is an honest and laudable practice and that if already it be not natural to us we ought however to make it so by study and application are we to go therefore to the stage for edification must we learn our catechism from the poets and like the players speak aloud what we debate any time with ourselves alone not absolutely so perhaps tho where the harm woud be of spending some discourse and bestowing a little breath and clear voice purely upon ourselves i cant see we might peradventure be less noisy shaftesbury   0      and more profitable in company if at convenient times we dischargd some of our articulate sound and spoke to ourselves vivâ voce when alone for company is an extreme provocative to fancy and like a hot bed in gardening is apt to make our imaginations sprout too fast but by this anticipating remedy of soliloquy we may effectually provide against the inconvenience we have an account in history of a certain nation who seem to have been extremely apprehensive of the effects of this frothiness or ventosity in speech and were accordingly resolvd to provide thorowly against the evil they carryd this remedy of ours so far that it was not only their custom but their religion and law to speak laugh use action gesticulate and do all in the same manner when by themselves as when they were in company if  0  you had stoln upon em unawares at any time when they had been alone you might have found em in high dispute arguing with themselves reproving counselling haranguing themselves and in the most florid manner accosting their own persons in all likelihood they had been once a people remarkably fluent in expression much pesterd with orators and preachers and shaftesbury   0   0  mightily subject to that disease which has been since calld the leprosy of eloquence till some sage legislator arose amongst em who when he coud not oppose the torrent of words and stop the flux of speech by any immediate application found means to give a vent to the loquacious humour and broke the force of the distemper by eluding it our present manners i must own are not so well calculated for this method of soliloquy as to suffer it to become a national practice tis but a small portion of this regimen which i woud willingly borrow and apply to private use especially in the case of authors i am sensible how fatal it might prove to many honourable persons shoud they acquire such a habit as this or offer to practice such an art within reach of any mortal ear for tis well known we are not many of us like that roman who wishd for windows to his breast that all might be as conspicuous there as in his house which for that very reason he had built as open as was possible i woud therefore advise our probationer upon his first exercise to retire into some thick wood or rather take the point of some high hill where besides the advantage of looking about him for security he woud find the air perhaps more rarefyd and sutable shaftesbury   0      to the perspiration requird especially in the case of a poetical genius the whole band of authors loves a wood and shuns a city tis remarkable in all great wits that they have ownd this practice of ours and generally describd themselves as a people liable to sufficient ridicule for their great loquacity by themselves and  0  their profound taciturnity in company not only the poet and philosopher but the orator himself was wont to have recourse to our method and the prince of this latter tribe may be provd to have been a great frequenter of the woods and riverbanks where he consumd abundance of his breath sufferd his fancy to evaporate and reducd the vehemence both of his spirit and voice if other authors find nothing which invites em to these recesses tis because their genius is not of force enough or tho it be their character they may imagine will hardly bear em out for to be surprizd in the odd actions gestures or tones which are proper to such asceticks i must own woud be an ill adventure for a man of the world but with poets and philosophers tis a known case shaftesbury   0     the man is either raving or composing composing and raving must necessarily we see bear a resemblance and for those composers who deal in systems and airy speculations they have vulgarly passd for a sort of prosepoets their secret practice and habit has been as frequently noted †they chew over mumbles with themselves and rabid silences both these sorts are happily indulgd in this method of evacuation they are thought to act naturally and in their proper way when they assume these odd manners but of other authors tis expected they shoud be better bred they are obligd to preserve a more conversible habit which is no small misfortune to em for if their meditation and resvery be obstructed by the fear of a nonconforming mein in conversation they may happen to be so much the worse authors for being finer gentlemen their fervency of imagination may possibly be as strong as either the philosophers or the poets but being denyd an equal benefit of discharge  0  and withheld from the wholesom manner of relief in private shaftesbury   0      tis no wonder if they appear with so much froth and scum in publick tis observable that the writers of memoirs and essays are chiefly subject to this frothy distemper nor can it be doubted that this is the true reason why these gentlemen entertain the world so lavishly with what relates to themselves for having had no opportunity of privately conversing with themselves or exercising their own genius so as to make acquaintance with it or prove its strength they immediately fall to work in a wrong place and exhibit on the stage of the world that practice which they shoud have kept to themselves if they designd that either they or the world shoud be the better for their moralitys who indeed can endure to hear an empirick talk of his own constitution how he governs and manages it what diet agrees best with it and what his practice is with himself the proverb no doubt is very just physician cure thyself yet methinks one shoud have but an ill time to be present at these bodily operations nor is the reader in truth any better entertaind when he is obligd to assist at the experimental discussions of his practising author who all the while is in reality doing no better than taking his physick in publick shaftesbury   0     for this reason i hold it very indecent for any one to publish his meditations occasional reflections solitary thoughts or other such exercises as come under the notion of this selfdiscoursing practice and the modestest title i can conceive for such works woud be that of a certain author who calld them his cruditys tis the unhappiness of those wits who conceive suddenly but without being able to go out their full time that after many miscarriages and abortions they can bring nothing wellshapen or perfect into the world they are not however the less fond of their offspring which in a manner they beget in publick for so publickspirited they are that they can never afford themselves the least time to think in private for their own particular benefit and use for this reason tho they are often retird they are never by themselves the world is ever of the party they have their authorcharacter in  0  view and are always considering how this or that thought woud serve to compleat some set of contemplations or furnish out the commonplacebook from whence these treasurd riches are to flow in plenty on the necessitous world but if our candidates for authorship happen to be of the sanctifyd kind tis shaftesbury   0      not be imagind how much farther still their charity is apt to extend so exceeding great is their indulgence and tenderness for mankind that they are unwilling the least sample of their devout exercise shoud be lost tho there are already so many formularys and rituals appointed for this species of soliloquy they can allow nothing to lie conceald which passes in this religious commerce and way of dialogue between them and their soul these may be termd a sort of pseudoasceticks who can have no real converse either with themselves or with heaven whilst they look thus asquint upon the world and carry titles and editions along with em in their meditations and altho the books of this sort by a common idiom are calld good books the authors for certain are a sorry race for religious cruditys are undoubtedly the worst of any a saintauthor of all men least values politeness he scorns to confine that spirit in which he writes to rules of criticism and profane learning nor is he inclind in any respect to play the critick on himself or regulate his style or language by the standard of good company and people of the better sort he is above the consideration of that shaftesbury   0      which in a narrow sense we call manners nor is he apt to examine any other faults than those which he calls sins tho a sinner against goodbreeding and the laws of decency will no more be esteemd a good author than will a sinner against grammar good argument or good sense and if moderation and temper are not of the party with a writer let his cause be ever so good i doubt whether he will be able to recommend it with great advantage to the world on this account i woud principally recommend our exercise of selfconverse to all such persons as are addicted to write after the  0  manner of holy advisers especially if they lie under an indispensible necessity of being talkers or haranguers in the same kind for to discharge frequently and vehemently in publick is a great hindrance to the way of private exercise which consists chiefly in controul but where instead of controul debate or argument the chief exercise of the wit consists in uncontroulable harangues and reasonings which must neither be questiond nor contradicted there is great danger lest the party thro this habit shoud suffer much by cruditys indigestions choler bile and particularly by a certain tumour or flatulency which renders him of all men the least able to ap shaftesbury   0     ply the wholesom regimen of selfpractice tis no wonder if such quaint practitioners grow to an enormous size of absurdity whilst they continue in the reverse of that practice by which alone we correct the redundancy of humours and chasten the exuberance of conceit and fancy a remarkable instance of the want of this sovereign remedy may be drawn from our common great talkers who engross the greatest part of the conversations of the world and are the forwardest to speak in publick assemblys many of these have a sprightly genius attended with a mighty heat and ebullition of fancy but tis a certain observation in our science that they who are great talkers in company have never been any talkers by themselves nor usd to these private discussions of our home regimen for which reason their froth abounds nor can they discharge any thing without some mixture of it but when they carry their attempts beyond ordinary discourse and woud rise to the capacity of authors the case grows worse with em their page can carry none of the advantages of their person they can noway bring into paper those airs they give themselves in discourse the turns of voice and action with which they help out many a lame thought and incoherent sentence must here be laid shaftesbury   0      aside and the speech taken to pieces compard together and examind from head to foot so that unless the party has been usd to play the critick thorowly upon himself he will hardly be found proof against the criticisms of others his thoughts can never appear very correct  0  unless they have been usd to sound correction by themselves and been well formd and disciplind before they are brought into the field tis the hardest thing in the world to be a good thinker without being a strong selfexaminer and thorowpacd dialogist in this solitary way sect   section ii but to bring our case a little closer still to morals i might perhaps very justifiably take occasion here to enter into a spacious field of learning to shew the antiquity of that opinion that we have each of us a daemon genius angel or guardianspirit to whom we were strictly joind and committed from our earliest dawn of reason or moment of our birth this opinion were it literally true might be highly serviceable no doubt towards the establishment of our system and doctrine for it woud infallibly be provd a kind of sacrilege or impiety to slight the company of so divine a guest and in a manner banish him shaftesbury   0      our breast by refusing to enter with him into those secret conferences by which alone he coud be enabled to become our adviser and guide but i shoud esteem it unfair to proceed upon such an hypothesis as this when the very utmost the wise antients ever meant by this daemoncompanion i conceive to have been no more than enigmatically to declare that we had each of us a patient in ourself that we were properly our own subjects of practice and that we then became due practitioners when by virtue of an intimate recess we coud discover a certain duplicity of soul and divide ourselves into two partys one of these as they supposd woud immediately approve himself a venerable sage and with an air of authority erect himself our counsellor and governor whilst the other party who had nothing in him besides what was base and servile woud be contented to follow and obey according therefore as this recess was deep and intimate and the dual number practically formd in us we were supposd to  0  advance in morals and true wisdom this they thought was the only way of composing matters in our breast and establishing that subordinacy which alone coud make us agree with ourselves and be of apiece within they esteemd shaftesbury   0   0  this a more religious work than any prayers or other duty in the temple and this they advisd us to carry thither as the best offering which coud be made duty to god and man well blended in the mind purity in the shrine of the heart this was among the antients that celebrated delphick inscription recognize yourself which was as much as to say divide yourself or be two for if the division were rightly made all within woud of course they thought be rightly understood and prudently managd such confidence they had in this homedialect of soliloquy for it was accounted the peculiar of philosophers and wise men to be able to hold themselves in talk and it was their boast on this account that they were never less alone than when by themselves a knave they thought coud never be by himself not that his conscience was always sure of giving him disturbance but he had not they supposd so much interest with himself as to exert this generous faculty and raise himself a companion who being fairly admitted into partnership woud quickly mend his partner and set his affairs on a right foot shaftesbury   0     one woud think there was nothing easier for us than to know our own minds and understand what our main scope was what we plainly drove at and what we proposd to ourselves as our end in every occurrence of our lives but our thoughts have generally such an obscure implicit language that tis the hardest thing in the world to make em speak out distinctly for this reason the right method is to give em voice and accent and this in our default is what the moralists or philosophers endeavour to do to our  0  hand when as is usual they hold us out a kind of vocal lookingglass draw sound out of our breast and instruct us to personate ourselves in the plainest manner the prayer which a man utters within and secretly when he has prayed aloud for sound mind and credit is for the speedy death of a rich uncle a certain air of pleasantry and humour which prevails nowadays in the fashionable world gives a son the assurance to tell a father he has livd too long and a husband the privilege of talking of his second wife before his first but let the airy gentleman who makes thus bold with others retire awhile out shaftesbury   0      of company and he scarce dares tell himself his wishes much less can he endure to carry on his thought as he necessarily must if he enters once thorowly into himself and proceeds by interrogatorys to form the homeacquaintance and familiarity requird for thus after some struggle we may suppose him to accost himself tell me now my honest heart am i really honest and of some worth or do i only make a fair show and am intrinsecally no better than a rascal as good a friend a countryman or a relation as i appear outwardly to the world or as i woud willingly perhaps think myself to be shoud i not in reality be glad they were hangd any of them or broke their necks who happend to stand between me and the least portion of an estate why not since tis my interest shoud i not be glad therefore to help this matter forwards and promote my interest if it lay fairly in my power no doubt provided i were sure not to be punishd for it and what reason has the greatest rogue in nature for not doing thus the same reason and no other am i not then at the bottom the same as he the same an arrant villain tho perhaps more a coward and not so perfect in my shaftesbury   0      kind if interest therefore points me out this  0  road whither would humanity and compassion lead me quite contrary why therefore do i cherish such weaknesses why do i sympathize with others why please myself in the conceit of worth and honour a character a memory an issue or a name what else are these but scruples in my way wherefore do i thus bely my own interest and by keeping myself half knave approve myself a thorow fool this is a language we can by no means endure to hold with ourselves whatever raillery we may use with others we may defend villany or cry up folly before the world but to appear fools madmen or varlets to ourselves and prove it to our own faces that we are really such is insupportable for so true a reverence has everyone for himself when he comes clearly to appear before his close companion that he had rather profess the vilest things of himself in open company than hear his character privately from his own mouth so that we may readily from hence conclude that the chief interest of ambition avarice corruption and every sly insinuating vice is to prevent this interview and familiarity of discourse which is consequent upon shaftesbury   0      close retirement and inward recess tis the grand artifice of villany and leudness as well as of superstition and bigotry to put us upon terms of greater distance and formality with ourselves and evade our proving method of soliloquy and for this reason how specious soever may be the instruction and doctrine of formalists their very manner itself is a sufficient blind or remora in the way of honesty and good sense i am sensible that shoud my reader be peradventure a lover after the more profound and solemn way of love he woud be apt to conclude that he was no stranger to our proposd method of practice being conscious to himself of having often made vigorous excursions into those solitary regions abovementiond where soliloquy is upheld with most advantage he may chance to remember how he has many times addressd the woods and rocks in audible articulate sounds and seemingly expostulated with himself in such a manner as if he had really formd the requisite distinction and had the power to entertain himself in due form but   0 it is very apparent that tho all were true we have here supposd it can no way reach the case before us for a passionate lover whatever solitude he may affect can never be truly by him shaftesbury   0     self his case is like the authors who has begun his courtship to the publick and is embarkd in an intrigue which sufficiently amuses and takes him out of himself whatever he meditates alone is interrupted still by the imagind presence of the mistress he pursues not a thought not an expression not a sigh which is purely for himself all is appropriated and all devoutly tenderd to the object of his passion insomuch that there is nothing ever so trivial or accidental of this kind which he is not desirous shoud be witnessd by the party whose grace and favour he sollicits tis the same reason which keeps the imaginary saint or mystick from being capable of this entertainment instead of looking narrowly into his own nature and mind that he may be no longer a mystery to himself he is taken up with the contemplation of other mysterious natures which he can never explain or comprehend he has the specters of his zeal before his eyes and is as familiar with his modes essences personages and exhibitions of deity as the conjurer with his different forms species and orders of genii or daemons so that we make no doubt to assert that not so much as a recluse religionist a votary or hermit was ever truly by himself and thus shaftesbury   0      since neither lover author mystick or conjurer who are the only claimants can truly or justly be entitled to a share in this selfentertainment it remains that the only person intitled is the man of sense the sage or philosopher however since of all other characters we are generally the most inclind to favour that of a lover it may not we hope be impertinent on this occasion to recite the story of an amour a virtuous young prince of a heroick soul capable of love and friendship made war upon a tyrant who was in every respect his reverse twas the happiness of our prince to be as great a conqueror by his clemency and bounty as by his arms and military virtue already he had won over to his party several potentates     and princes who before had been subject to the tyrant among those who adherd still to the enemy there was a prince who having all the advantage of person and merit had lately been made happy in the possession and mutual love of the most beautiful princess in the world it happend that the occasions of the war calld the newmarryd prince to a distance from his belovd princess he left her secure as he thought in a strong castle far within shaftesbury   0      the country but in his absence the place was taken by surprize and the princess brought a captive to the quarters of our heroick prince there was in the camp a young nobleman favourite of the prince one who had been educated with him and was still treated by him with perfect familiarity him he immediately sent for and with strict injunctions committed the captive princess to his charge resolving she shoud be treated with that respect which was due to her high rank and merit twas the same young lord who had discoverd her disguisd among the prisoners and learnt her story the particulars of which he now related to the prince he spoke in extasy on this occasion telling the prince how beautiful she appeard even in the midst of sorrow and tho disguisd under the meanest habit yet how distinguishable by her air and manner from every other beauty of her sex but what appeard strange to our young nobleman was that the prince during this whole relation discoverd not the least intention of seeing the lady or satisfying that curiosity which seemd so natural on such an occasion he pressd him but without success not see her sir said he won shaftesbury   0     dring when she is so handsom beyond what you have ever seen for that very reason replyd the prince i woud the rather decline the interview for shoud i upon the bare report of her beauty be so charmd as to make the first visit at this urgent time of business i may upon sight with better reason be inducd perhaps to visit her when i am more at leisure and so again and again till at last i may have no leisure left for my affairs woud you sir persuade me then said the young nobleman     smiling that a fair face can have such power as to force the will itself and constrain a man in any respect to act contrary to what he thinks becoming him are we to hearken to the poets in what they tell us of that incendiary love and his irresistible flames a real flame we see burns all alike but that imaginary one of beauty hurts only those who are consenting it affects no otherwise than as we ourselves are pleasd to allow it in many cases we absolutely command it as where relation and consanguinity are in the nearest degree authority and law we see can master it but shaftesbury   0      twoud be vain as well as unjust for any law to intermeddle or prescribe were not the case voluntary and our will entirely free how comes it then replyd the prince that if we are thus masters of our choice and free at first to admire and love where we approve we cannot afterwards as well cease to love whenever we see cause this latter liberty you will hardly defend for i doubt not you have heard of many who tho they were usd to set the highest value upon liberty before they lovd yet afterwards were necessitated to serve in the most abject manner finding themselves constraind and bound by a stronger chain than any of iron or adamant such wretches replyd the youth i have often heard complain who if you will believe em are wretched indeed without means or power to help themselves you may hear em in the same manner complain grievously of life itself but tho there are doors enow to go out of life they find it convenient to keep still where they are they are the very same pretenders who thro this plea of irresistible necessity make bold with what is anothers shaftesbury   0   0  and attempt unlawful beds but the law i perceive makes bold with them in its turn as with other invaders of property neither is it your custom sir to pardon such offences so that beauty itself you must allow is innocent and harmless and can compel noone to do any thing amiss the debauchd compel themselves and unjustly charge their guilt on love they who are honest and just can admire and love whatever is beautiful without offering at anything beyond what is allowd how then is it possible sir that one     of your virtue shoud be in pain on any such account or fear such a temptation you see sir i am sound and whole after having beheld the princess i have conversd with her i have admird her in the highest degree yet am myself still and in my duty and shall be ever in the same manner at your command tis well replyd the prince keep yourself so be ever the same man and look to your charge carefully as becomes you for it may so happen in the present posture of the war that this fair captive may stand us in good stead shaftesbury   0     with this the young nobleman departed to execute his commission and immediately took such care of the captive princess and her houshold that she seemd as perfectly obeyd and had every thing which belongd to her in as great splendor now as in her principality and in the height of fortune he found her in every respect deserving and saw in her a generosity of soul which was beyond her other charms his study to oblige her and soften her distress made her in return desirous to express a gratitude which he easily perceivd she shewd on every occasion a real concern for his interest and when he happend to fall ill she took such tender care of him herself and by her servants that he seemd to owe his recovery to her friendship from these beginnings insensibly and by natural degrees as may easily be conceivd the youth fell desperately in love at first he offerd not to make the least mention of his passion to the princess for he scarce dard tell it to himself but afterwards he grew bolder she receivd his declaration with an unaffected trouble and concern spoke to him as a friend to dissuade him as much as possible from such an extravagant attempt but when he talkd to her of force she immediately shaftesbury   0      sent away one of her faithful domesticks to the prince to implore his protection the prince receivd the message with the appearance of more than ordinary concern sent instantly for one of his first ministers and bid him go with that domestick to the young nobleman and let him understand that force was not to be offerd to such a lady persuasion he might use if he thought fit     the minister who was no friend to the young nobleman faild not to aggravate the message inveighd publickly against him on this occasion and to his face reproachd him as a traitor and dishonourer of his prince and nation with all else which coud be said against him as guilty of the highest sacrilege perfidiousness and breach of trust so that in reality the youth lookd upon his case as desperate fell into the deepest melancholy and prepard himself for that fate which he thought he well deservd in this condition the prince sent to speak with him alone and when he saw him in the utmost confusion i find said he my friend i am now become dreadful to you indeed since you can neither see me without shame nor imagine me to be without resentment but away with all those thoughts from shaftesbury   0      this time forwards i know how much you have sufferd on this occasion i know the power of love and am no otherwise safe myself than by keeping out of the way of beauty twas i who was in fault twas i who unhappily matchd you with that unequal adversary and gave you that impracticable task and hard adventure which noone yet was ever strong enough to accomplish in this sir replyd the youth as in all else you express that goodness which is so natural to you you have compassion and can allow for human frailty but the rest of mankind will never cease to upbraid me nor shall i ever be forgiven were i able ever to forgive myself i am reproachd by my nearest friends i must be odious to all mankind wherever i am known the least punishment i can think due to me is banishment for ever from your presence think not of such a thing for ever said the prince but trust me if you retire only for a while i shall so order it that you shall soon return again with the applause even of those who are now your enemys when they find what a considerable service you shaftesbury   0      shall have renderd both to them and me such a hint was sufficient to revive the spirits of our despairing youth he was transported to think that his misfortune coud be turnd any way to the advantage of his prince he enterd with joy     into the scheme the prince had laid for him and appeard eager to depart and execute what was appointed him can you then said the prince resolve to quit the charming princess o sir replyd the youth well am i now satisfyd that i have in reality within me two distinct separate souls this lesson of philosophy i have learnt from that villanous sophister love for tis impossible to believe that having one and the same soul it shoud be actually both good and bad passionate for virtue and vice desirous of contrarys no there must of necessity be two and when the good prevails tis then we act handsomly when the ill then basely and villanously such was my case for lately the ill soul was wholly master but now the good prevails by your assistance and i am plainly a new creature with quite another apprehension another reason another will shaftesbury   0     thus it may appear how far a lover by his own natural strength may reach the chief principle of philosophy and understand our doctrine of two persons in one individual self not that our courtier we suppose was able of himself to form this distinction justly and according to art for coud he have effected this he woud have been able to cure himself without the assistance of his prince however he was wise enough to see in the issue that his independency and freedom were mere glosses and resolution a nose of wax for let will be ever so free humour and fancy we see govern it and these as free as we suppose em are often changd we know not how without asking our consent or giving us any account if opinion be that which governs and makes the change tis itself as liable to be governd and varyd in its turn and by what i can observe of the world fancy and opinion stand pretty much upon the same bottom so that if there be no certain inspector or auditor establishd within us to take account of these opinions and fancys in due form and minutely to animadvert upon their several growths and habits we are as little like to continue a day in the same will as a tree during a summer in the     same shape shaftesbury   0      without the gardners assistance and the vigorous application of the sheers and pruningknife as cruel a court as the inquisition appears there must it seems be full as formidable a one erected in ourselves if we woud pretend to that uniformity of opinion which is necessary to hold us to one will and preserve us in the same mind from one day to another philosophy at this rate will be thought perhaps little better than persecution and a supreme judg in matters of inclination and appetite must needs go exceedingly against the heart every pretty fancy is disturbd by it every pleasure interrupted by it the course of good humour will hardly allow it and the pleasantry of wit almost absolutely rejects it it appears besides like a kind of pedantry to be thus magisterial with ourselves thus strict over our imaginations and with all the airs of a real pedagogue to be sollicitously taken up in the sour care and tutorage of so many boyish fancys unlucky appetites and desires which are perpetually playing truant and need correction we hope however that by our method of practice and the help of the grand arcanum which we have professd to reveal this regimen or discipline of the shaftesbury   0      fancys may not in the end prove so severe or mortifying as is imagind we hope also that our patient for such we naturally suppose our reader will consider duly with himself that what he endures in this operation is for no inconsiderable end since tis to gain him a will and insure him a certain resolution by which he shall know where to find himself be sure of his own meaning and design and as to all his desires opinions and inclinations be warranted one and the same person to day as yesterday and to morrow as to day this perhaps will be thought a miracle by one who well considers the nature of mankind and the growth variation and inflection of appetite and humour for appetite which is elder brother to reason being the lad of stronger growth is sure on every contest to take the advantage of drawing all to his own side and will so highly boasted is at best merely a top or football between these youngsters who prove very unfortunately matchd     till the youngest instead of now and then a kick or lash bestowd to little purpose forsakes the ball or top itself and begins to lay about his elder brother tis then that the scene changes for the elder like an arrant coward upon this treatment presently grows civil and affords the younger as fair play afterwards as he can desire shaftesbury   0     and here it is that our sovereign remedy and gymnastick method of soliloquy takes its rise when by a certain powerful figure of inward rhetorick the mind apostrophizes its own fancys raises em in their proper shapes and personages and addresses em familiarly without the least ceremony or respect by this means it will soon happen that two formd partys will erect themselves within for the imaginations or fancys being thus roundly treated are forcd to declare themselves and take party those on the side of the elder brother appetite are strangely subtle and insinuating they have always the faculty to speak by nods and winks by this practice they conceal half their meaning and like modern politicians pass for deeply wise and adorn themselves with the finest pretext and most specious glosses imaginable till being confronted with their fellows of a plainer language and expression they are forcd to quit their mysterious manner and discover themselves mere sophisters and impostors who have not the least to do with the party of reason and good sense accordingly we might now proceed to exhibit distinctly and in due method the form and manner of this probation or exercise as it regards all men shaftesbury   0      in general but the case of authors in particular being as we apprehend the most urgent we shall apply our rule in the first place to these gentlemen whom it so highly imports to know themselves and understand the natural strength and powers as well as the weaknesses of a human mind for without this understanding the historians judgment will be very defective the politicians views very narrow and chimerical and the poets brain however stockd with fiction will be but poorly furnishd as in the sequel we shall make appear he who deals in characters must of necessity know his own or he will know nothing     and he who woud give the world a profitable entertainment of this sort shoud be sure to profit first by himself for in this sense wisdom as well as charity may be honestly said to begin at home there is no way of estimating manners or apprizing the different humours fancys passions and apprehensions of others without first taking an inventory of the same kind of goods within ourselves and surveying our domestick fund a little of this homepractice will serve to make great discoverys live at home and learn how slenderly furnished your apartments are  shaftesbury   0   0 sect   section iii whoever has been an observer of action and grace in human bodys must of necessity have discoverd the great difference in this respect between such persons as have been taught by nature only and such as by reflection and the assistance of art have learnt to form those motions which on experience are found the easiest and most natural of the former kind are either those good rusticks who have been bred remote from the formd societys of men or those plain artizans and people of lower rank who living in citys and places of resort have been necessitated however to follow mean imployments and wanted the opportunity and means to form themselves after the better models there are some persons indeed so happily formd by nature herself that with the greatest simplicity or rudeness of education they have still something of a natural grace and comeliness in their action and there are others of a better education who by a wrong aim and injudicious affectation of grace are of all people the farthest removd from it tis undeniable however that the     perfection of grace and comeliness in action and behaviour can be found only among the people of a liberal education and even shaftesbury   0      among the graceful of this kind those still are found the gracefullest who early in their youth have learnt their exercises and formd their motions under the best masters now such as these masters and their lessons are to a fine gentleman such are philosophers and philosophy to an author the case is the same in the fashionable and in the literate world in the former of these tis remarkd that by the help of good company and the force of example merely a decent carriage is acquird with such apt motions and such a freedom of limbs as on all ordinary occasions may enable the party to demean himself like a gentleman but when upon further occasion trial is made in an extraordinary way when exercises of the genteeler kind are to be performd in publick twill easily appear who of the pretenders have been formd by rudiments and had masters in private and who on the other side have contented themselves with bare imitation and learnt their part casually and by rote the parallel is easily made on the side of writers they have at least as much need of learning the several motions counterpoises and balances of the mind and passions as the other students those of the body and limbs shaftesbury   0     sound knowledge is the first requisite for writing well the books of socrates school will yield you the matter   0 the galant no doubt may pen a letter to his mistress as the courtier may a compliment to the minister or the minister to the favourite above him without going such vast depths into learning or philosophy but for these privilegd gentlemen tho they set fashions and prescribe rules in other cases they are no controulers in the commonwealth of letters nor are they presumd to write to the age or for remote posterity their works are not of a nature to intitle em to hold the rank of authors or be shaftesbury   0      styld writers by way of excellence in the kind shoud their ambition lead em into such a field they woud be obligd to come otherwise equipd they who enter the publick lists must come duly traind and exercisd like well appointed cavaliers expert in arms and well instructed in the use of their weapon and management of their steed for to be well accouterd and well mounted is not sufficient the horse alone can never make the horseman nor limbs the wrestler or the dancer no more can a genius alone make a poet or good parts a writer in any considerable kind the skill and grace of writing is founded as our wise poet tells us in knowledg and good sense and not barely in that knowledg which is to be     learnt from common authors or the general conversation of the world but from those particular rules of art which philosophy alone exhibits the philosophical writings to which our poet in his art of poetry refers were in themselves a kind of poetry like the mimes or personated pieces of early times before philosophy was in vogue and when as yet dramatical imitation was scarce formd or at least in many parts not brought to due perfection they were shaftesbury   0      pieces which besides their force of style and hidden numbers carryd a sort of action and imitation the same as the epick and dramatick kinds they were either real dialogues or recitals of such personated discourses where the persons themselves had their characters preservd throout their manners humours and distinct turns of temper and understanding maintaind according to the most exact poetical truth twas not enough that these pieces treated fundamentally of morals and in consequence pointed out real characters and manners they exhibited em alive and set the countenances and complexions of men plainly in view and by this means they not only taught us to know others but what was principal and of highest virtue in em they taught us to know ourselves the philosophical hero of these poems whose name they carryd both in their body and front and whose genius and manner they were made to represent was in himself a perfect character yet in some respects so veild and in a cloud that to the unattentive surveyor he seemd often to be very different from what he really was and this chiefly by reason of a certain exquisite and refind raillery which belongd to his manner and by virtue of which he coud treat the highest shaftesbury   0      subjects and those of the commonest capacity both together and render em explanatory of each other so that in this genius of writing there appeard both the heroick and the simple the tragick and the comick vein however it was so orderd that notwithstanding the oddness     or mysteriousness of the principal character the underparts or second characters shewd human nature more distinctly and to the life we might here therefore as in a lookingglass discover ourselves and see our minutest features nicely delineated and suted to our own apprehension and cognizance noone who was ever so little awhile an inspector coud fail of becoming acquainted with his own heart and what was of singular note in these magical glasses it woud happen that by constant and long inspection the partys accustomd to the practice woud acquire a peculiar speculative habit so as virtually to carry about with em a sort of pocketmirrour always ready and in use in this there were two faces which woud naturally present themselves to our view one of them like the commanding genius the leader and chief abovementiond the other like that rude undisciplind and headstrong creature whom we ourselves in our natural capacity most exactly resembled whatever we were employd in whatever we set about if once we had shaftesbury   0      acquird the habit of this mirrour we shoud by virtue of the double reflection distinguish ourselves into two different partys and in this dramatick method the work of selfinspection woud proceed with admirable success tis no wonder that the primitive poets were esteemd such sages in their times since it appears they were such wellpractisd dialogists and accustomd to this improving method before ever philosophy had adopted it their mimes or characterizd discourses were as much relishd as their most regular poems and were the occasion perhaps that so many of these latter were formd in such perfection for poetry itself was defind an imitation chiefly of men and manners and was that in an exalted and noble degree which in a low one we call mimickry tis in this that the great mimographer the father and prince of poets excels so highly his     characters being wrought to a likeness beyond what any succeeding masters were ever able to describe nor are his works which are so full of action any other than an artful series or chain of dialogues which turn upon one remarka shaftesbury   0     ble catastrophe or event he describes no qualitys or virtues censures no manners makes no encomiums nor gives characters himself but brings his actors still in view tis they who shew themselves tis they who speak in such a manner as distinguishes em in all things from all others and makes em ever like themselves their different compositions and allays so justly made and equally carryd on thro every particle of the action give more instruction than all the comments or glosses in the world the poet instead of giving himself those dictating and masterly airs of wisdom makes hardly any figure at all and is scarce discoverable in his poem this is being truly a master he paints so as to need no inscription over his figures to tell us what they are or what he intends by em a few words let fall on any slight occasion from any of the partys he introduces are sufficient to denote their manners and distinct character from a finger or a toe he can represent to our thoughts the frame and fashion of a whole body he wants no other help of art to personate his heroes and make em living there was no more left for tragedy to do after him than to erect a stage and draw his dialogues and characters into scenes turning in the same manner upon one principal action or event with that regard to place and shaftesbury   0      time which was sutable to a real spectacle even comedy itself was adjudgd to this great master it being derivd from those parodys or mockhumours of which he had given the †specimen in a conceald sort of raillery intermixd with the sublime—a dangerous stroke of art and which requird a masterly hand like that of the philosophical hero whose character was represented in the dialoguewritings abovementiond     from hence possibly we may form a notion of that resemblance which on so many occasions was heretofore remarkd between the prince of poets and the divine philosopher who was said to rival him and who together with his contemporarys of the same school writ wholly in that manner of dialogue abovedescribd from hence too we may comprehend perhaps why the study of dialogue was heretofore thought so advantageous to writers and why this manner of writing was judgd so difficult which at first sight it must be ownd appears the easiest of any i have formerly wonderd indeed why a manner which was familiarly usd in shaftesbury   0      treatises upon most subjects with so much success among the antients shoud be so insipid and of little esteem with us moderns but i afterwards perceivd that besides the difficulty of the manner itself and that mirrourfaculty which we have observd it to carry in respect of ourselves it proves also of necessity a kind of mirrour or lookingglass to the age if so it shoud of consequence youll say be the more agreeable and entertaining true if the real view of ourselves be not perhaps displeasing to us but why more displeasing to us than to the antients because perhaps they coud with just reason bear to see their natural countenances represented and why not we the same what shoud discourage us for are we not as handsom at least in our own eyes perhaps not as we shall see when we have considerd a little further what the force is of this mirrourwriting and how it differs from that more complaisant modish way in which an author instead of presenting us with other natural characters sets off his own with the utmost art and purchases his readers favour by all imaginable compliances and condescensions an author who writes in his own person has the advantage of being shaftesbury   0  00  who or what he pleases he is no certain man nor has any certain or genuine character but sutes himself on every occasion to the fancy of his reader whom as the fashion is nowadays he constantly caresses and cajoles all turns upon their two persons     and as in an amour or commerce of loveletters so here the author has the privilege of talking eternally of himself dressing and sprucing himself up whilst he is making diligent court and working upon the humour of the party to whom he addresses this is the coquetry of a modern author whose epistles dedicatory prefaces and addresses to the reader are so many affected graces designd to draw the attention from the subject towards himself and make it be generally observd not so much what he says as what he appears or is and what figure he already makes or hopes to make in the fashionable world these are the airs which a neighbouring nation give themselves more particularly in what they call their memoirs their very essays on politicks their philosophical and critical works their comments upon antient and modern authors all their treatises are memoirs the whole writing of this age is become indeed a sort of memoirwriting tho in the real memoirs of the antients even when they shaftesbury   0  0   writ at any time concerning themselves there was neither the i nor thou throout the whole work so that all this pretty amour and intercourse of caresses between the author and reader was thus intirely taken away much more is this the case in dialogue for here the author is annihilated and the reader being no way applyd to stands for nobody the selfinteresting partys both vanish at once the scene presents itself as by chance and undesignd you are not only left to judg coolly and with indifference of the sense deliverd but of the character genius elocution and manner of the persons who deliver it these two are mere strangers in whose favour you are no way engagd nor is it enough that the persons introducd speak pertinent and good sense at every turn it must be seen from what bottom they speak from what principle what stock or fund of knowledg they draw and what kind or species of understanding they possess for the understanding here must have its mark its characteristick note by which it may be distinguishd it must be such and such an understanding as when we say for instance such or such a face since nature has characterizd tempers and     minds as peculiarly as faces and for an artist who draws shaftesbury   0  0   naturally tis not enough to shew us merely faces which may be calld mens every face must be a certain mans now as a painter who draws battels or other actions of christians turks indians or any distinct and peculiar people must of necessity draw the several figures of his piece in their proper and real proportions gestures habits arms or at least with as fair resemblance as possible so in the same manner that writer whoever he be among us moderns who shall venture to bring his fellowmoderns into dialogue must introduce em in their proper manners genius behaviour and humour and this is the mirrour or lookingglass above describd for instance a dialogue we will suppose is framd after the manner of our antient authors in it a poor philosopher of a mean figure accosts one of the powerfullest wittiest handsomest and richest noblemen of the time as he is walking leisurely towards the temple you are going then says he calling him by his plain name to pay your devotions yonder at the temple i am so but with an air methinks as if some thought perplexd you what is there in the case which shoud perplex one the thought perhaps shaftesbury   0  0   of your petitions and the consideration what vows you had best offer to the deity is that so difficult can any one be so foolish as to ask of heaven what is not for his good not if he understands what his good is who can mistake it if he has common sense and knows the difference between prosperity and adversity tis prosperity therefore you woud pray for undoubtedly for instance that absolute sovereign who commands all things by virtue of his immense treasures and governs by his sole will and pleasure him you think prosperous and his state happy whilst i am copying this for tis no more indeed than a borrowd sketch from one of those originals beforementiond i see a thousand ridicules arising from the manner the circumstances and action itself compard with modern breeding and civility—let us therefore mend the matter if possible and introduce the     same philosopher addressing himself in a more obsequious manner to his grace his excellency or his honour without failing in the least tittle of the ceremonial or let us put the case more favourably still for our man of letters let us suppose him to be incognito without the least appearance of a character which in our age is so little shaftesbury   0  0   recommending let his garb and action be of the more modish sort in order to introduce him better and gain him audience and with these advantages and precautions imagine still in what manner he must accost this pageant of state if at any time he finds him at leisure walking in the fields alone and without his equipage consider how many bows and simpering faces how many preludes excuses compliments—now put compliments put ceremony into a dialogue and see what will be the effect this is the plain dilemma against that antient manner of writing which we can neither well imitate nor translate whatever pleasure or profit we may find in reading those originals for what shall we do in such a circumstance what if the fancy takes us and we resolve to try the experiment in modern subjects see the consequence—if we avoid ceremony we are unnatural if we use it and appear as we naturally are as we salute and meet and treat one another we hate the sight—whats this but hating our own faces is it the painters fault shoud he paint falsly or affectedly mix modern with antient join shapes preposterously and betray his art if not what medium is there what remains for him but to throw away the pencil shaftesbury   0  0  —no more designing after the life no more mirrourwriting or personal representation of any kind whatever thus dialogue is at an end the antients coud see their own faces but we cant and why this why but because we have less beauty for so our lookingglass can inform us—ugly instrument and for this reason to be hated—our commerce and manner of conversation which we think the politest imaginable is such it seems as we ourselves cant endure to see represented to the life tis here as in our real portraitures particularly those     at full length where the poor pencilman is put to a thousand shifts whilst he strives to dress us in affected habits such as we never wore because shoud he paint us in those we really wear they woud of necessity make the piece to be so much more ridiculous as it was more natural and resembling thus much for antiquity and those rules of art those philosophical seacards by which the adventurous geniuss of the times were wont to steer their courses and govern their impetuous muse these were the chartae of our roman masterpoet and these the pieces of art the shaftesbury   0  0   mirrours the exemplars he bids us place before our eyes thumb your greek patterns by night and by day and thus poetry and the writers art as in many respects it resembles the statuarys and the painters so in this more particularly that it has its original draughts and models for study and practice not for ostentation to be shown abroad or copyd for publick view these are the antient busts the trunks of statues the pieces of anatomy the masterly rough drawings which are kept within as the secret learning the mystery and fundamental knowledg of the art there is this essential difference however between the artists of each kind that they who design merely after bodys and form the graces of this sort can never with all their accuracy or correctness of design be able to reform themselves or grow a jot more shapely in their persons but for those artists who copy from another life who study the graces and perfections of minds and are real masters of those rules which constitute this latter science tis impossible they shoud fail of being themselves improvd and amended in their better part shaftesbury   0  0  i must confess there is hardly any where to be found a more insipid race of mortals than those whom we moderns are contented     to call poets for having attaind the chiming faculty of a language with an injudicious random use of wit and fancy but for the man who truly and in a just sense deserves the name of poet and who as a real master or architect in the kind can describe both men and manners and give to an action its just body and proportions he will be found if i mistake not a very different creature such a poet is indeed a second maker a just prometheus under jove like that sovereign artist or universal plastick nature he forms a whole coherent and proportiond in itself with due subjection and subordinacy of constituent parts he notes the boundarys of the passions and knows their exact tones and measures by which he justly represents them marks the sublime of sentiments and action and distinguishes the beautiful from the deformd the amiable from the odious the moral artist who can thus imitate the creator and is thus knowing in the inward form and structure of his fellowcreature will hardly i presume be found unknowing in himself or at a loss in those numbers which make the harmony of a mind for knavery is shaftesbury   0  0   mere dissonance and disproportion and tho villains may have strong tones and natural capacitys of action tis impossible that true   0 judgment and ingenuity shoud reside where harmony and honesty have no being shaftesbury   0  0  but having enterd thus seriously into the concerns of authors and shewn their chief foundation and strength their preparatory discipline and qualifying method of selfexamination tis fit ere we disclose this mystery any further we shoud consider the advantages or disadvantages our authors may possibly meet with from abroad and how far their genius may be depressd or raisd by any external causes arising from the humour or judgment of the world whatever it be which influences in this respect must proceed either from the grandees and men in power the criticks and men of art or the people themselves the common audience and mere vulgar we shall begin therefore with the grandees and pretended masters of the world taking the liberty in favour of authors to bestow some advice also on these high persons if possibly they are disposd to receive it in such a familiar way as this shaftesbury   0   0 part ii sect   section i as usual as it is with mankind to act absolutely by will and pleasure without regard to counsel or the rigid method of rule and precept it must be acknowledgd nevertheless that the good and laudable custom of asking advice is still upheld and kept in     fashion as a matter of fair repute and honourable appearance insomuch that even monarchs and absolute princes themselves disdain not we see to make profession of the practice tis i presume on this account that the royal persons are pleasd on publick occasions to make use of the noted style of we and us not that they are supposd to have any converse with themselves as being endowd with the privilege of becoming plural and enlarging their capacity in the manner above describd single and absolute persons in government shaftesbury   0      im sensible can hardly be considerd as any other than single and absolute in morals they have no inmatecontrouler to cavil with em or dispute their pleasure nor have they from any practice abroad been able at any time to learn the way of being free and familiar with themselves at home inclination and will in such as these admit as little restraint or check in private meditation as in publick company the world which serves as a tutor to persons of an inferior rank is submissive to these royal pupils who from their earliest days are usd to see even their instructors bend before em and hear every thing applauded which they themselves perform for fear therefore lest their humour merely or the caprice of some favourite shoud be presumd to influence em when they come to years of princely discretion and are advancd to the helm of government it has been esteemd a necessary decency to summon certain advisers by profession to assist as attendants to the single person and be joind with him in his written edicts proclamations letterspatent and other instruments of regal power for this use privycounsellors have been erected who being persons of considerable figure and wise aspect cannot be supposd to stand as statues or mere shaftesbury   0      cyphers in the government and leave the royal acts erroneously and falsly describd to us in the plural number when at the bottom a single will or fancy was the sole spring and motive foreign princes indeed have most of em that unhappy prerogative of acting unadvisedly and wilfully in their national affairs but tis known to be far otherwise with the legal and just princes of our     island they are surrounded with the best of counsellors the laws they administer civil affairs by legal officers who have the direction of their publick will and conscience and they annually receive advice and aid in the most effectual manner from their good people to this wise genius of our constitution we may be justly said to owe our wisest and best princes whose high birth or royal education coud not alone be supposd to have given em that happy turn since by experience we find that those very princes from whose conduct the world abroad as well as we at home have reapd the greatest advantages were such as had the most controverted titles and in their youth had stood in the remoter prospects of regal power and livd the nearest to a private life shaftesbury   0     other princes we have had who tho difficult perhaps in receiving counsel have been eminent in the practice of applying it to others they have listed themselves advisers in form and by publishing their admonitory works have added to the number of those whom in this treatise we have presumd to criticize but our criticism being withal an apology for authors and a defense of the literate tribe it cannot be thought amiss in us to join the royal with the plebeian penmen in this common cause twoud be a hard case indeed shoud the princes of our nation refuse to countenance the industrious race of authors since their royal ancestors and predecessors have had such honour derivd to em from this profession tis to this they owe that bright jewel of their crown purchasd by a warlike prince who having assumd the author and essayd his strength in the polemick writings of the schooldivines thought it an honour on this account to retain the title of defender of the faith another prince of a more pacifick nature and fluent thought submitting arms and martial discipline to the gown and confiding in his princely sci shaftesbury   0     ence and profound learning made his style and speech the nerve and sinew of his government he gave us his works full of wise exhortation and advice to his royal son as well as of instruction to his good people who coud not without admiration observe their authorsovereign thus studious     and contemplative in their behalf twas then one might have seen our nation growing young and docile with that simplicity of heart which qualifyd em to profit like a scholarpeople under their royal preceptor for with abundant eloquence he graciously gave lessons to his parliament tutord his ministers and edifyd the greatest churchmen and divines themselves by whose suffrage he obtaind the highest appellations which coud be merited by the acutest wit and truest understanding from hence the british nations were taught to own in common a solomon for their joint sovereign the founder of their late compleated union nor can it be doubted that the pious treatise of selfdiscourse ascribd to the succeeding monarch contributed in a great measure to his glorious and neverfading titles of saint and martyr however it be i woud not willingly take upon me to recommend this authorcharacter to our future princes what shaftesbury   0     ever crowns or laurels their renownd predecessors may have gatherd in this field of honour i shoud think that for the future the speculative province might more properly be committed to private heads twoud be a sufficient encouragement to the learned world and a sure earnest of the increase and flourishing of letters in our nation if its sovereigns woud be contented to be the patrons of wit and vouchsafe to look graciously on the ingenious pupils of art or were it the custom of their primeministers to have any such regard it woud of itself be sufficient to change the face of affairs a small degree of favour woud insure the fortunes of a distressd and ruinous tribe whose forlorn condition has helpd to draw disgrace upon arts and sciences and kept them far off from that politeness and beauty in which they woud soon appear if the aspiring genius of our nation were forwarded by the least care or culture there shoud not one woud think be any need of courtship or persuasion to engage our grandees in the patronage of arts and letters for in our nation upon the foot things stand and as they are likely to continue tis not difficult to foresee that improvements will be made in every art and science the muses shaftesbury   0      will have     their turn and with or without their maecenass will grow in credit and esteem as they arrive to greater perfection and excel in every kind there will arise such spirits as woud have credited their courtpatrons had they found any so wise as to have fought em out betimes and contributed to their rising greatness tis scarce a quarter of an age since such a happy balance of power was settled between our prince and people as has firmly securd our hitherto precarious libertys and removd from us the fear of civil commotions wars and violence either on account of religion and worship the property of the subject or the contending titles of the crown but as the greatest advantages of this world are not to be bought at easy prices we are still at this moment expending both our blood and treasure to secure to ourselves this inestimable purchase of our free government and national constitution and as happy as we are in this establishment at home we are still held in a perpetual alarm by the aspect of affairs abroad and by the terror of that power which ere mankind had well recoverd the misery of those barbarous ages consequent to the roman yoke has again threatend the world with a universal monarchy and shaftesbury   0      a new abyss of ignorance and superstition the british muses in this dinn of arms may well lie abject and obscure especially being as yet in their mere infantstate they have hitherto scarce arrivd to anything of shapeliness or person they lisp as in their cradles and their stammering tongues which nothing besides their youth and rawness can excuse have hitherto spoken in wretched pun and quibble our dramatick shakespear our fletcher johnson and our epick milton preserve this style and even a latter race scarce free of this infirmity and aiming at a false sublime with crouded simile and mixd metaphor the hobbyhorse and rattle of the muses entertain our raw fancy and unpractisd ear which has not as yet had leisure to form itself and become truly musical     but those reverend bards rude as they were according to their time and age have provided us however with the richest ore to their eternal honour they have withal been the first of europeans who since the gothick model of poetry attempted to throw off the horrid discord of jingling rhyme they have asserted shaftesbury   0      antient poetick liberty and have happily broken the ice for those who are to follow em and who treading in their footsteps may at leisure polish our language lead our ear to finer pleasure and find out the true rhythmus and harmonious numbers which alone can satisfy a just judgment and muselike apprehension tis evident our natural genius shines above that airy neighbouring nation of whom however it must be confessd that with truer pains and industry they have sought politeness and studyd to give the muses their due body and proportion as well as the natural ornaments of correctness chastity and grace of style from the plain model of the antients they have raisd a noble satirist in the epick kind their attempts have been less successful in the dramatick they have been so happy as to raise their stage to as great perfection as the genius of their nation will permit but the high spirit of tragedy can ill subsist where the spirit of liberty is wanting the genius of this poetry consists in the lively representation of the disorders and misery of the great to the end that the people and those of a lower condition may be taught the better to content themselves with privacy enjoy their safer state and prize the equality shaftesbury   0      and justice of their guardian laws if this be found agreeable to the just tragick model which the antients have deliverd to us twill easily be conceivd how little such a model is proportiond to the capacity or taste of those who in a long series of degrees from the lowest peasant to the high slave of royal blood are taught to idolize the next in power above em and think nothing so adorable as that unlimited greatness and tyrannick power which is raisd at their own expence and exercisd over themselves     tis easy on the other hand to apprehend the advantages of our britain in this particular and what effect its establishd liberty will produce in every thing which relates to art when peace returns to us on these happy conditions twas the fate of rome to have scarce an intermediate age or single period of time between the rise of arts and fall of liberty no sooner had that nation begun to lose the roughness and barbarity of their manners and learn of greece to form their heroes their orators and poets on a right model than by their unjust attempt upon the liberty of the world they justly lost their own with their liberty they lost not only their force of eloquence but even their style and language itself the poets who afterwards arose among them shaftesbury   0   0  were mere unnatural and forcd plants their two most accomplishd who came last and closd the scene were plainly such as had seen the days of liberty and felt the sad effects of its departure nor had these been ever brought in play otherwise than thro the friendship of the famd maecenas who turnd a prince naturally cruel and barbarous to the love and courtship of the muses these tutoresses formd in their royal pupil a new nature they taught him how to charm mankind they were more to him than his arms or military virtue and more than fortune herself assisted him in his greatness and made his usurpd dominion so inchanting to the world that it coud see without regret its chains of bondage firmly riveted the corrupting sweets of such a poisonous government were not indeed longlivd the bitter soon succeeded and in the issue the world was forcd to bear with patience those natural and genuine tyrants who succeeded to this specious machine of arbitrary and universal power and now that i am falln unawares into such profound reflections on the periods of government and the flourishing and decay of liberty and letters i cant shaftesbury   0      be contented to consider merely of the inchantment which wrought so powerfully upon mankind when first this universal monarchy was establishd i must wonder     still more when i consider how after the extinction of this caesarean and claudian family and a short interval of princes raisd and destroyd with much disorder and publick ruin the romans shoud regain their perishing dominion and retrieve their sinking state by an afterrace of wise and able princes successively adopted and taken from a private state to rule the empire of the world they were men who not only possessd the military virtues and supported that sort of discipline in the highest degree but as they sought the interest of the world they did what was in their power to restore liberty and raise again the perishing arts and decayd virtue of mankind but the season was now past the fatal form of government was become too natural and the world which had bent under it and was become slavish and dependent had neither power nor will to help itself the only deliverance it coud expect was from the merciless hands of the barbarians and a total dissolution of that enormous empire and despotick power which the best hands coud not preserve from being destructive to human nature for even barbarity and go shaftesbury   0     thicism were already enterd into arts ere the savages had made any impression on the empire all the advantage which a fortuitous and almost miraculous succession of good princes coud procure their highly favourd arts and sciences was no more than to preserve during their own time those perishing remains which had for awhile with difficulty subsisted after the decline of liberty not a statue not a medal not a tolerable piece of architecture coud shew itself afterwards philosophy wit and learning in which some of those good princes had themselves been so renownd fell with them and ignorance and darkness overspread the world and fitted it for the chaos and ruin which ensud we are now in an age when liberty is once again in its ascendent and we are ourselves the happy nation who not only enjoy it at home but by our greatness and power give life and vigour to     it abroad and are the head and chief of the european league founded on this common cause nor can it i presume be justly feard that we shoud lose this noble ardour or faint under the glorious toil tho like antient greece we shoud for succeeding ages be contending shaftesbury   0      with a foreign power and endeavouring to reduce the exorbitancy of a grand monarch tis with us at present as with the roman people in those early days when they wanted only repose from arms to apply themselves to the improvement of arts and studys we shoud in this case need no ambitious monarch to be allurd by hope of fame or secret views of power to give pensions abroad as well as at home and purchase flattery from every profession and science we shoud find a better fund within ourselves and might without such assistance be able to excel by our own virtue and emulation well it woud be indeed and much to the honour of our nobles and princes woud they freely help in this affair and by a judicious application of their bounty facilitate this happy birth of which i have venturd to speak in a prophetick style twoud be of no small advantage to em during their life and woud more than all their other labours procure em an immortal memory for they must remember that their fame is in the hands of penmen and that the greatest actions shaftesbury   0      lose their force and perish in the custody of unable and mean writers let a nation remain ever so rude or barbarous it must have its poets rhapsoders historiographers antiquarys of some kind or other whose business it will be to recount its remarkable transactions and record the atchievements of its civil and military heroes and tho the military kind may happen to be the furthest     removd from any acquaintance with letters or the muses they are yet in reality the most interested in the cause and party of these remembrancers the greatest share of fame and admiration falls naturally on the armd worthys the great in council are second in the muses favour but if worthy poetick geniuss are not found nor able penmen raisd to rehearse the lives and celebrate the high actions of great men they must be traducd by such recorders as chance presents we have few modern heroes who like xenophon or caesar can write their own commentarys and the raw memoirwritings and unformd pieces of modern statesmen full of their interested and private views will in another age be of little service to support their memory or name since already the world begins to sicken with the kind tis the learnd the able and disinterested historian who shaftesbury   0      takes place at last and when the signal poet or herald of fame is once heard the inferior trumpets sink in silence and oblivion but supposing it were possible for the hero or statesman to be absolutely unconcernd for his memory or what came after him yet for the present merely and during his own time it must be of importance to him to stand fair with the men of letters and ingenuity and to have the character and repute of being favourable to their art be the illustrious person ever so high or awful in his station he must have descriptions made of him in verse and prose under feignd or real appellations if he be omitted in sound ode or lofty epick he must be sung at least in doggrel and plain ballad the people will needs have his effigies tho they see his person ever so rarely and if he refuses to sit to the good painter there are others who to oblige the publick will take the design in hand we shall take up with what presents and rather than be without the illustrious physiognomy of our great man shall be contented to see him portraiturd by the artist who serves to illustrate prodigys in fairs and adorn heroick signposts the ill paint of this kind cannot its true disgrace his excellency whose privilege it is in common shaftesbury   0      with the royal issue to be raisd to this degree of honour and to invite the passenger or traveller by his signal representative   0 tis supposd in this case that there are better pictures current of the hero and that such as these are no true or favourable representations but in another sort of limning there is great danger lest the hand shoud disgrace the subject vile encomiums and wretched panegyricks are the worst of satirs and when sordid and low geniuss make their court successfully in one way the generous and able are aptest to revenge it in another all things considerd as to the interest of our potentates and grandees they appear to have only this choice left em either wholly if possible to suppress letters or give a helping hand towards their support wherever the authorpractice and liberty of the pen has in the least prevaild the governors of the state must be either considerable gainers or sufferers by its means so that twoud become them either by a right turkish policy to strike directly at the profession and overthrow the very art and mystery itself or with alacrity to support and encourage it in the right manner by a generous and impartial regard to shaftesbury   0      merit to act narrowly or by halves or with indifference and coolness or fantastically and by humour merely will scarce be found to turn to their account they must do justice that justice may be done them in return twill be in vain for our alexanders to give orders that none besides a lysippus shoud make their statue nor any besides an apelles shoud draw their picture insolent intruders will do themselves the honour to practice on the features of these heroes and a vile chaerilus after all shall with their own consent perhaps supply the room of a deserving and noble artist in a government where the people are sharers in power but no distributers or dispensers of rewards they expect it of their princes and great men that they shoud supply the generous part and bestow honour and advantages on those from whom the nation itself may receive honour and advantage tis expected that they who are high and eminent in the state shoud not only provide for its necessary safety and subsistence but omit nothing which may contribute to its dignity and honour the arts     and sciences must not be left patronless the publick itself will join with the good wits and judges in the resentment of such a neg shaftesbury   0     lect tis no small advantage even in an absolute government for a ministry to have wit on their side and engage the men of merit in this kind to be their wellwishers and friends and in those states where ambitious leaders often contend for the supreme authority tis a considerable advantage to the ill cause of such pretenders when they can obtain a name and interest with the men of letters the good emperor trajan tho himself no mighty scholar had his due as well as an augustus and was as highly celebrated for his munificence and just encouragement of every art and virtue and caesar who coud write so well himself and maintaind his cause by wit as well as arms knew experimentally what it was to have even a catullus his enemy and tho lashd so often in his lampoons continud to forgive and court him the traitor knew the importance of this mildness may none who have the same designs understand so well the advantages of such a conduct i woud have requird only this one defect in caesars generosity to have been secure of his never rising to greatness or enslaving his native country let him have shewn a ruggedness and austerity towards free geniuss or a neglect or contempt towards men of wit let him have trusted to his arms and declard against arts and shaftesbury   0      letters and he woud have provd a second marius or a catiline of meaner fame and character tis i know the imagination of some who are calld great men that in regard of their high stations they may be esteemd to pay a sufficient tribute to letters and discharge themselves as to their own part in particular if they chuse indifferently any subject for their bounty and are pleasd to confer their favour either on some one pretender to art or promiscuously to such of the tribe of writers whose chief ability has lain in making their court well and obtaining to be introducd to their acquaintance this they think sufficient to instal them patrons of wit and masters of the literate order but this method will of any other the least serve their     interest or design the ill placing of rewards is a double injury to merit and in every cause or interest passes for worse than mere indifference or neutrality there can be no excuse for making an ill choice merit in every kind is easily discoverd when sought the publick itself fails not to give sufficient indication and points out those geniuss who want only countenance and encouragement to become considerable an ingenious man never starves unknown and great men must wink hard or twoud shaftesbury   0   0  be impossible for em to miss such advantageous opportunitys of shewing their generosity and acquiring the universal esteem acknowledgments and good wishes of the ingenious and learned part of mankind sect   section ii what judgment therefore we are to form concerning the influence of our grandees in matters of art and letters will easily be gatherd from the reflections already made it may appear from the very freedom we have taken in censuring these men of power what little reason authors have to plead em as their excuse for any failure in the improvement of their art and talent for in a free country such as ours there is not any order or rank of men more free than that of writers who if they have real ability and merit can fully right themselves when injurd and are ready furnishd with means sufficient to make themselves considerd by the men in highest power nor shoud i suspect the genius of our writers or charge em with meanness and insufficiency on the account of this lowspiritedness which they discover were it not for another sort of fear by shaftesbury   0      which they more plainly betray themselves and seem conscious of their own defect the criticks it seems are formidable to em the criticks are the dreadful specters the giants the enchanters who traverse and disturb em in their works these are the persecutors for whose sake they are ready to hide their heads     begging rescue and protection of all good people and flying in particular to the great by whose favour they hope to be defended from this merciless examining race for what can be more cruel than to be forcd to submit to the rigorous laws of wit and write under such severe judges as are deaf to all courtship and can be wrought upon by no insinuation or flattery to pass by faults and pardon any transgression of art to judg indeed of the circumstances of a modern author by the pattern of his prefaces dedications and introductions one woud think that at the moment when a piece of his was in hand some conjuration was forming against him some diabolical powers drawing together to blast his work and cross his generous design he therefore rouzes his indignation hardens his forehead and with many fu shaftesbury   0     rious defiances and avantsatans enters on his business not with the least regard to what may justly be objected to him in a way of criticism but with an absolute contempt of the manner and art itself avaunt ye uninitiated crowd  was in its time no doubt a generous defiance the avant was natural and proper in its place especially where religion and virtue were the poets theme but with our moderns the case is generally the very reverse and accordingly the defiance or avant shoud run much after this manner as for you vulgar souls mere naturals who know no art were never admitted into the temple of wisdom nor ever visited the sanctuarys of wit or learning gather yourselves together from all parts and hearken to the song or tale i am about to utter but for you men of science and understanding who have ears and judgment and can weigh sense scan syllables and measure sounds you who by a certain art distinguish false thought from true correctness from rudeness and bombast and chaos from order and the sublime away hence or stand aloof whilst i practise upon the easiness of those mean capacitys and apprehensions who     make the most numerous audience shaftesbury   0      and are the only competent judges of my labours tis strange to see how differently the vanity of mankind runs in different times and seasons tis at present the boast of almost every enterprizer in the muses art that by his genius alone and a natural rapidity of style and thought he is able to carry all before him that he plays with his business does things in passing at a venture and in the quickest period of time in the days of attick elegance as works were then truly of another form and turn so workmen were of another humour and had their vanity of a quite contrary kind they became rather affected in endeavouring to discover the pains they had taken to be correct they were glad to insinuate how laboriously and with what expence of time they had brought the smallest work of theirs as perhaps a single ode or satir an oration or panegyrick to its perfection when they had so polishd their piece and renderd it so natural and easy that it seemd only a lucky flight a hit of thought or flowing vein of humour they were then chiefly concernd lest it shoud in reality pass for such and their artifice remain undiscoverd they were willing it shoud be known how serious their play was and how elaborate shaftesbury   0      their freedom and facility that they might say as the agreeable and polite poet glancing on himself he will seem in sport yet really be toiling    and †so that any man may hope the same success toil greatly and work in vain at the same task—so great is the might of the sequence and connection in writing     such accuracy of workmanship requires a criticks eye tis lost upon a vulgar judgment nothing grieves a real artist more than that indifference of the publick which suffers work to pass uncriticizd nothing on the other side rejoices him more than the nice view and inspection of the accurate examiner and judg of work tis the mean genius the slovenly performer who knowing nothing of true workmanship endeavours by the best outward gloss and dazling shew to turn the eye from a direct and steddy survey of his piece what is there which an expert musician more earnestly desires than to perform his part in the presence of those who are knowing in his art tis to the ear shaftesbury   0      alone he applies himself the critical the nice ear let his hearers be of what character they please be they naturally austere morose or rigid no matter so they are criticks able to censure remark and sound every accord and symphony what is there mortifies the good painter more than when amidst his admiring spectators there is not one present who has been usd to compare the hands of different masters or has an eye to distinguish the advantages or defects of every style thro all the inferior orders of mechanicks the rule is found to hold the same in every science every art the real masters or proficients rejoice in nothing more than in the thorow search and examination of their performances by all the rules of art and nicest criticism why therefore in the muses name is it not the same with our pretenders to the writing art our poets and proseauthors in every kind why in this profession are we found such critickhaters and indulgd in this unlearned aversion unless it be taken for granted that as wit and learning stand at present in our nation we are still upon the foot of empiricks and mountebanks from these considerations i take upon me absolutely to condemn the fashionable and prevailing custom of inveighing shaftesbury   0      against criticks as the common enemys the pests and incendiarys of the commonwealth of wit and letters i assert on the contrary that they are the props and pillars of this building and that without     the encouragement and propagation of such a race we shoud remain as gothick architects as ever in the weaker and more imperfect societys of mankind such as those composd of federate tribes or mixd colonys scarce settled in their new seats it might pass for sufficient goodfortune if the people provd only so far masters of language as to be able to understand one another in order to confer about their wants and provide for their common necessitys their exposd and indigent state coud not be presumd to afford em either that full leisure or easy disposition which was requisite to raise em to any curiosity of speculation they who were neither safe from violence nor secure of plenty were unlikely to engage in unnecessary arts nor coud it be expected they shoud turn their attention towards the numbers of their language and the harmonious sounds which they accidentally emitted but when in process of time the affairs shaftesbury   0      of the society were settled on an easy and secure foundation when debates and discourses on these subjects of common interest and publick good were grown familiar and the speeches of prime men and leaders were considerd and compard together there woud naturally be observd not only a more agreeable measure of sound but a happier and more easy rangement of thoughts in one speaker than in another it may be easily perceivd from hence that the goddess persuasion must have been in a manner the mother of poetry rhetorick musick and the other kindred arts for tis apparent that where chief men and leaders had the strongest interest to persuade they usd the highest endeavours to please so that in such a state or polity as has been describd not only the best order of thought and turn of fancy but the most soft and inviting numbers must have been employd to charm the publick ear and to incline the heart by the agreeableness of expression almost all the antient masters of this sort were said to have been     musicians and tradition which soon grew fabulous coud not better represent the first founders or establishers of these larger societys than as real songsters who by the power of their shaftesbury   0      voice and lyre coud charm the wildest beasts and draw the rude forests and rocks into the form of fairest citys nor can it be doubted that the same artists who so industriously applyd themselves to study the numbers of speech must have made proportionable improvements in the study of mere sounds and natural harmony which of itself must have considerably contributed towards the softning the rude manners and harsh temper of their new people if therefore it so happend in these free communitys made by consent and voluntary association that after awhile the power of one or of a few grew prevalent over the rest if force took place and the affairs of the society were administerd without their concurrence by the influence of awe and terror it followd that these pathetick sciences and arts of speech were little cultivated since they were of little use but where persuasion was the chief means of guiding the society where the people were to be convincd before they acted there elocution became considerable there orators and bards were heard and the chief geniuss and sages of the nation betook themselves to the study of those arts by which the people were renderd more treatable in a way of reason and understanding and more subject to be led by shaftesbury   0      men of science and erudition the more these artists courted the publick the more they instructed it in such constitutions as these twas the interest of the wise and able that the community shoud be judges of ability and wisdom the high esteem of ingenuity was what advancd the ingenious to the greatest honours and they who rose by science and politeness in the higher arts coud not fail to promote that taste and relish to which they owd their personal distinction and preeminence hence it is that those arts have been deliverd to us in such perfection by free nations who from the nature of their government as from a proper soil producd the generous plants whilst the mightiest bodys and vastest empires governd by force and     a despotick power coud after ages of peace and leisure produce no other than what was deformd and barbarous of the kind when the persuasive arts were grown thus into repute and the power of moving the affections become the study and emulation of the forward wits and aspiring geniuss of the times it woud necessarily happen that many geniuss of equal size and strength tho less covetous of publick applause of power or of influence over mankind woud content them shaftesbury   0   0 selves with the contemplation merely of these enchanting arts these they woud the better enjoy the more they refind their taste and cultivated their ear for to all musick there must be an ear proportionable there must be an art of hearing found ere the performing arts can have their due effect or any thing exquisite in the kind be felt or comprehended the just performers therefore in each art woud naturally be the most desirous of improving and refining the publick ear which they coud no way so well effect as by the help of those latter geniuss who were in a manner their interpreters to the people and who by their example taught the publick to discover what was just and excellent in each performance hence was the origin of criticks who as arts and sciences advancd woud necessarily come withal into repute and being heard with satisfaction in their turn were at length tempted to become authors and appear in publick these were honourd with the name of sophists a character which in early times was highly respected nor did the gravest philosophers who were censors of manners and criticks of a higher degree disdain to exert their criticism in the inferior arts especially in those relating to speech shaftesbury   0      and the power of argument and persuasion when such a race as this was once risen twas no longer possible to impose on mankind by what was specious and pretending the publick woud be paid in no false wit or jingling eloquence where the learned criticks were so well receivd and philosophers themselves disdaind not to be of the number there coud not fail to arise criticks of an inferior order who woud subdivide the several provinces of this empire etymologists philologists grammarians     rhetoricians and others of considerable note and eminent in their degree woud every where appear and vindicate the truth and justice of their art by revealing the hidden beautys which lay in the works of just performers and by exposing the weak sides false ornaments and affected graces of mere pretenders nothing of what we call sophistry in argument or bombast in style nothing of the effeminate kind or of the false tender the pointed witticism the disjointed thought the crouded simile or the mixd metaphor coud pass even on the common ear whilst the notarys the expositors and prompters abovementiond were every where at hand and ready to explode the unnatural manner shaftesbury   0     tis easy to imagine that amidst the several styles and manners of discourse or writing the easiest attaind and earliest practisd was the miraculous the pompous or what we generally call the sublime astonishment is of all other passions the easiest raisd in raw and unexperiencd mankind children in their earliest infancy are entertaind in this manner and the known way of pleasing such as these is to make em wonder and lead the way for em in this passion by a feignd surprize at the miraculous objects we set before em the best musick of barbarians is hideous and astonishing sounds and the fine sights of indians are enormous figures various odd and glaring colours and whatever of that sort is amazingly beheld with a kind of horror and consternation in poetry and studyd prose the astonishing part or what commonly passes for sublime is formd by the variety of figures the multiplicity of metaphors shaftesbury   0      and by quitting as much as possible   0 the natural and easy way of expression for that which is most unlike to humanity or ordinary use this the prince of criticks assures us to have been the manner of the earliest poets before the age of homer or till such time as this fatherpoet came into repute who deposd that spurious race and gave rise to a legitimate and genuine kind he retaind only what was decent of the figurative or metaphorick style introducd the natural and simple and turnd his thoughts towards the real beauty of composition the unity of design the truth of characters and the just imitation of nature in each particular shaftesbury   0     the manner of this fatherpoet was afterwards variously imitated and divided into several shares especially when it came to be copyd in dramatick tragedy came first and took what was most solemn and sublime in this part the poets succeeded sooner than in comedy or the facetious kind as was natural indeed to     suppose since this was in reality the easiest manner of the two and capable of being brought the soonest to perfection for so the same prince of criticks sufficiently informs us and tis highly worth remarking what this mighty genius and judg of art declares concerning tragedy that whatever idea might be formd of the utmost perfection of this kind of poem it coud in practice rise no higher than it had been already carryd in his time †having at length says he attaind its ends and being apparently shaftesbury   0          consummate in itself but for comedy it seems twas still in hand it had been already in some manner reducd but as he plainly insinuates it lay yet unfinishd notwithstanding the witty labours of an aristophanes and the other comick poets of the first manner who had flourishd a whole age before this critick as perfect as were those wits in style and language and as fertile in all the varietys and turns of humour yet the truth of characters the beauty of order and the simple imitation of nature were in a manner wholly unknown to em or thro petulancy or debauch of shaftesbury   0      humour were it seems neglected and set aside a menander had not as yet appeard who arose soon after to accomplish the prophecy of our grand master of art and consummate philologist comedy had at this time done little more than what the antient †parodys had done before it twas of admirable use to explode the false sublime of early poets and such as in its own age were on every occasion ready to relapse into that vicious manner the good tragedians themselves coud hardly escape its lashes the pompous orators were its neverfailing subjects every thing which might be imposing by a false gravity or solemnity was forcd to endure the trial of this touchstone manners and characters as well as speech and writings were dis shaftesbury   0     cussd with the greatest freedom nothing coud be better fitted than this genius of     wit to unmask the face of things and remove those larvae naturally formd from the tragick manner and pompous style which had preceded aeschylus taught how to use highflown language and to strut in the buskin after them aeschylus and thespis came the old comedy twas not by chance that this succession happend in greece after the manner describd but rather thro necessity and from the reason and †nature of things for in healthy bodys nature dictates remedys of her own and pro shaftesbury   0     vides for the cure of what has happend amiss in the growth and progress of a constitution the affairs of this free people being in the increase and their ability and judgment every day improving as letters and arts advancd they woud of course find in themselves a strength of nature which by the help of good ferments and a wholesom opposition of humours woud correct in one way whatever was     excessive or peccant as physicians say in another thus the florid and oversanguine humour of the high style was allayd by something of a contrary nature the comick genius was applyd as a kind of caustick to those exuberances and funguss of the swoln dialect and magnificent manner of speech but after awhile even this remedy itself was found to turn into a disease as medicines we know grow corrosive when the fouler matters on which they wrought are sufficiently purgd and the obstructions removd freedom slipped into license and a violence which called for legal restraint† tis a great error to suppose as some have done that the restraining this licen shaftesbury   0     tious manner of wit by law was a violation of the liberty of the athenian state or an effect merely of the power of foreigners whom it little concernd after what manner those citizens treated one another in their comedys or what sort of wit or humour they made choice of for their ordinary diversions if upon a change of government as during the usurpation of the thirty or when that nation was humbled at any time either by a philip an alexander or an antipater they had been forcd against their wills to enact such laws as these tis certain they woud have soon repeald em when those terrors were removd as they soon were and the people restord to their former libertys for notwithstanding what this nation sufferd outwardly by several shocks receivd from foreign states notwithstanding the dominion and power they lost abroad they preservd the same government at home and how passionately interested they were in what concernd their diversions and publick spectacles how     jealous and full of emulation in what related to their poetry wit musick and other arts in which they exceld all other nations is well known to persons who have any comprehension of antient manners or been the least conversant in history shaftesbury   0   0 nothing therefore coud have been the cause of these publick decrees and of this gradual reform in the commonwealth of wit beside the real reform of taste and humour in the commonwealth or government itself instead of any abridgment twas in reality an increase of liberty an enlargement of the security of property and an advancement of private ease and personal safety to provide against what was injurious to the good name and reputation of every citizen as this intelligence in life and manners grew greater in that experiencd people so the relish of wit and humour woud naturally in proportion be more refind thus greece in general grew more and more polite and as it advancd in this respect was more averse to the obscene buffooning manner the athenians still went before the rest and led the way in elegance of every kind for even their first comedy was a refinement upon some irregular attempts which had been made in that dramatick way and the grand critick shews us that in his own time the phallica or scurrilous and obscene farce prevaild still and had the counte shaftesbury   0     nance of the magistrate in some citys of greece who were behind the rest in this reform of taste and manners but what is yet a more undeniable evidence of this natural and gradual refinement of styles and manners among the antients particularly in what concernd their stage is that this very case of prohibition and restraint happend among the romans themselves where no effects of foreign power or of a home tyranny can     be pretended their fescennin and atellan way of wit was in early days prohibited and laws made against it for the publicks sake and in regard to the welfare of the community such licentiousness having been found in reality contrary to the just liberty of the people men were vexed when bitten by its bloody teeth the unbitten too were anxious for the common weal and even a law and penalty were enacted against libelling any one in verse in defense of what i have here advancd i coud besides the authority of shaftesbury   0      grave †historians and chronologists produce the testimony of one of the wisest and most serious of antient authors whose single authority woud be acknowledgd to have equal force with that of many concurring writers he shews us that this ‡firstformd     comedy and scheme of ludicrous wit was introducd upon the neck of the sublime the familiar airy muse was privilegd as a sort of counterpedagogue against the pomp and formality of the more solemn writers and what is highly remarkable our author shaftesbury   0      shews us that in philosophy itself there happend almost at the very same time a like succession of wit and humour when in opposition to the sublime philosopher and afterwards to his grave disciple and successor in the academy there arose a comick philosophy in the person of another master and other disciples who personally as well as in their writings were set in direct opposition to the former not as differing in †opinions or maxims but in their style and manner in the turn of humour and method of instruction tis pleasant enough to consider how exact the resemblance was between the lineage of philosophy and that of poetry as derivd from their two chief founders or patriarchs in whose loins the     several races lay as it were inclosd for as the grand poetick sire was by the consent of all antiquity allowd to have furnishd subject both to the tragick the comick and every other kind of genuine poetry shaftesbury   0      so the philosophical patriarch in the same manner containing within himself the several geniuss of philosophy gave rise to all those several manners in which that science was deliverd his disciple of noble birth and lofty genius who aspird to †poetry and rhetorick took the sublime part and shone above his other condisciples he of mean birth and poorest circumstances whose constitution as well as condition inclind him most to the way we call satirick took the reproving part which in his betterhumourd and more agreeable successor turnd into the comick kind and went upon the model of that ‡antient comedy which was then prevalent but another noble disciple whose     genius was towards action and who provd afterwards the shaftesbury   0      greatest hero of his time took the genteeler part and softer manner he joind what was deepest and most solid in philosophy with what was easiest and most refind in breeding and in the character and manner of a gentleman nothing coud be remoter than his genius was from the scholastick the rhetorical or mere poetick kind he was as distant on one hand from the sonorous high and pompous strain as on the other hand from the ludicrous mimical or satirick this was that natural and simple genius of antiquity comprehended by so few and so little relishd by the vulgar this was that philosophical menander of earlier time whose works one may wonder to see preservd from the same fate since in the darker ages thro which they passd they might probably be alike neglected on the account of their like simplicity of style and composition there is besides the several manners of writing above describd another of considerable authority and weight which had its rise chiefly from the critical art itself and from the more accurate inspection into the works of preceding masters the grand critick of whom we have shaftesbury   0      already spoken was a chief and leader in this order of penmen for tho the sophists of elder time had treated many subjects methodically and in form yet this writer was the first who gaind repute in the methodick kind as the talent of this great man was more towards polite learning and the arts than towards the deep and solid parts of philosophy it happend that in his school there was more care taken of other sciences than of ethicks dialect or logick which provinces were chiefly cultivated by the successors of the academy and porch it has been observd of this methodick or scholastick manner that it naturally befitted an author who tho endowd with a comprehensive and strong genius was not in himself of a refind temper blessd by the graces or favourd by any muse one who was   0 not of a fruitful imagination but rather dry and rigid yet withal acute and piercing accurate and distinct for the chief nerve and sinew of this style consists in the clear division and partition of the subjects tho there is nothing exalting in the manner tis naturally powerful and commanding and more than any other subdues the mind and strengthens its determinations tis from this genius that firm conclusions and steddy maxims are best formd which if solidly built and shaftesbury   0      on sure ground are the shortest and best guides towards wisdom and ability in every kind but if defective or unsound in the least part must of necessity lead us to the grossest absurditys and stiffest pedantry and conceit now tho every other style and genuine manner of composition has its order and method as well as this which in a peculiar sense we call the methodick yet it is this manner alone which professes method dissects itself in parts and makes its own anatomy the sublime can no way condescend thus or bear to be suspended in its impetuous course the comick or derisory manner is further still from making shew of method tis then if ever that it presumes to give itself this wise air when its design is to expose the thing itself and ridicule the formality and sophistry so often shelterd beneath it the simple manner which being the strictest imitation of nature shoud of right be the completest in the distribution of its parts and symmetry of its whole is yet so far from making any ostentation of method that it conceals the artifice as much as possible endeavouring only to express the effect of art under the appearance of the greatest ease and negligence and even when it assumes the censuring or reproving part shaftesbury   0      it does it in the most conceald and gentle way the authors indeed of our age are as little capable of receiving as of giving advice in such a way as this so little is the general palat formd as yet to a taste of real simplicity as for the sublime tho it be often the subject of criticism it can never be the manner or afford the means the way of form and method the didactive or preceptive manner as it has been usually practisd amongst us and as our ears have been long accustomd has so little     force towards the winning our attention that it is apter to tire us than the metre of an old ballad we no sooner hear the theme propounded the subject divided and subdivided with first of the first and so forth as order requires than instantly we begin a strife with nature who otherwise might surprize us in the soft fetters of sleep to the great disgrace of the orator and scandal of the audience the only manner left in which criticism can have its just force amongst us is the antient comick of which kind were the first roman miscellanys or satirick pieces a sort of original writing of their own refind afterwards by the best genius and politest poet of that nation who notwithstanding owns the manner shaftesbury   0      to have been taken from the greek comedy abovementiond and if our homewits woud refine upon this pattern they might perhaps meet with considerable success in effect we may observe that in our own nation the most successful criticism or method of refutation is that which borders most on the manner of the earliest greek comedy the highlyrated burlesque poem written on the subject of our religious controversys in the last age is a sufficient token of this kind and that justlyadmird piece of †comick wit given us some time after by an author of the highest quality has furnishd our best wits in all their controversys even in religion and politicks as well as in the affairs of wit and learning with the most effectual and entertaining method of exposing folly pedantry false reason and ill writing and without some such tolerated manner of criticism as this how grosly we might have been imposd on and shoud continue to be for the future by many pieces of dogmatical rhetorick and pedantick wit may easily be apprehended by those who know any thing of the state of letters in our na shaftesbury   0   0 tion or are in the least fitted to judg of the manner of the common poets or formal authors of the times in what form or manner soever criticism may appear amongst     us or criticks chuse to exert their talent it can become none besides the grosly superstitious or ignorant to be alarmd at this spirit for if it be ill managd and with little wit it will be destroyd by something wittier in the kind if it be witty itself it must of necessity advance wit and thus from the consideration of antient as well as modern time it appears that the cause and interest of criticks is the same with that of wit learning and good sense sect   section iii thus we have surveyd the state of authors as they are influencd from without either by the frowns or favour of the great or by the applause or censure of the criticks it remains only to consider how the people or world in general stand affected towards our modern penmen and what occasion these adventurers may have of complaint or shaftesbury   0      boast from their encounter with the publick there is nothing more certain than that a real genius and thorow artist in whatever kind can never without the greatest unwillingness and shame be inducd to act below his character and for mere interest be prevaild with to prostitute his art or science by performing contrary to its known rules whoever has heard any thing of the lives of famous statuarys architects or painters will call to mind many instances of this nature or whoever has made any acquaintance with the better sort of mechanicks such as are real lovers of their art and masters in it must have observd their natural fidelity in this respect be they ever so idle dissolute or debauchd how regardless soever of other rules they abhor any transgression in their art and woud chuse to lose customers and starve rather than by a base compliance with the world to act contrary to what they call the justness and truth of work sir says a poor fellow of this kind to his rich customer     you are mistaken in coming to me for such a piece of workmanship let who will make it for you as you fansy i know it to be wrong whatever i have made hither shaftesbury   0     to has been true work and neither for your sake or any bodys else shall i put my hand to any other this is virtue real virtue and love of truth independent of opinion and above the world this disposition transferd to the whole of life perfects a character and makes that probity and worth which the learned are often at such a loss to explain for is there not a workmanship and a truth in actions or is the workmanship of this kind less becoming or less worthy our notice that we shoud not in this case be as surly at least as the honest artizan who has no other philosophy than what nature and his trade have taught him when one considers this zeal and honesty of inferiour artists one woud wonder to see those who pretend to skill and science in a higher kind have so little regard to truth and the perfection of their art one woud expect it of our writers that if they had real ability they shoud draw the world to them and not meanly sute themselves to the world in its weak state we may justly indeed make allowances for the simplicity of those early geniuss of our nation who after so many barbarous ages when letters lay yet in their ruins made bold excursions into a shaftesbury   0      vacant field to seize the posts of honour and attain the stations which were yet unpossessd by the wits of their own country but since the age is now so far advancd learning establishd the rules of writing stated and the truth of art so well apprehended and every where confessd and ownd tis strange to see our writers as unshapen still and monstrous in their works as heretofore there can be nothing more ridiculous than to hear our poets in their prefaces talk of art and structure whilst in their pieces they perform as ill as ever and with as little regard to those professd rules of art as the honest bards their predecessors who had never heard of any such rules or at least had never ownd their justice or validity had the early poets of greece thus complimented their     nation by complying with its first relish and appetite they had not done their countrymen such service nor themselves such honour as we find they did by conforming to truth and nature the generous spirits who first essayd the way had not always the world on their side but soon drew after em the best judgments and soon afterwards the world itself they forcd their way into it and by weight of merit turnd its judgment on their shaftesbury   0      side they formd their audience polishd the age refind the publick ear and framd it right that in return they might be rightly and lastingly applauded nor were they disappointed in their hope the applause soon came and was lasting for it was found they have justice done them at this day they have survivd their nation and live tho in a dead language the more the age is enlightend the more they shine their fame must necessarily last as long as letters and posterity will ever own their merit our modern authors on the contrary are turnd and modeld as themselves confess by the publick relish and current humour of the times they regulate themselves by the irregular fancy of the world and frankly own they are preposterous and absurd in order to accommodate themselves to the genius of the age in our days the audience makes the poet and the bookseller the author with what profit to the publick or what prospect of lasting fame and honour to the writer let any one who has judgment imagine but tho our writers charge their faults thus freely on the publick it will i doubt appear from many instances that this practice is mere imposture shaftesbury   0      since those absurditys which they are aptest to commit are far from being delightful or entertaining we are glad to take up with what our language can afford us and by a sort of emulation with other nations are forcd to cry up such writers of our own as may best serve us for comparison but when we are out of this spirit it must be ownd we are not apt to discover any great fondness or admiration of our authors nor have we any whom by mutual consent we make to be our standard we go to plays or to other shows and frequent the theater as the     booth we read epicks and dramaticks as we do satirs and lampoons for we must of necessity know what wit as well as what scandal is stirring read we must let writers be ever so indifferent and this perhaps may be some occasion of the laziness and negligence of our authors who observing this need which our curiosity brings on us and making an exact calculation in the way of trade to know justly the quality and quantity of the publick demand feed us thus from hand to mouth resolving not to overstock the market or be at the pains of more correctness or wit than is absolutely necessary to carry on the traffick shaftesbury   0     our satir therefore is scurrilous buffooning and without morals or instruction which is the majesty and life of this kind of writing our encomium or panegyrick is as fulsom and displeasing by its prostitute and abandond manner of praise the worthy persons who are the subjects of it may well be esteemd sufferers by the manner and the publick whether it will or no is forcd to make untoward reflections when led to it by such satirizing panegyrists for in reality the nerve and sinew of modern panegyrick lies in a dull kind of satir which the author its true intends shoud turn to the advantage of his subject but which if i mistake not will appear to have a very contrary effect the usual method which our authors take when they woud commend either a brotherauthor a wit a hero a philosopher or a statesman is to look abroad to find within the narrow compass of their learning some eminent names of persons who answerd to these characters in a former time these they are sure to lash as they imagine with some sharp stroke of satir and when they have strippd these reverend personages of all their share of merit they think to clothe shaftesbury   0      their hero with the spoils such is the sterility of these encomiasts they know not how to praise but by detraction if a fairone is to be celebrated helen must in comparison be deformd venus herself degraded that a modern may be honourd some antient must be sacrificd if a poet is to be extold down with a homer or a pindar if an orator or philosopher     down with demosthenes tully plato if a general of our army down with any hero whatever of time past the romans knew no discipline the grecians never learnt the art of war were there an art of writing to be formd upon the modern practice this method we have describd might perhaps be styld the rule of dispatch or the herculean law by which encomiasts with no other weapon than their single club may silence all other fame and place their hero in the vacant throne of honour i woud willingly however advise these celebrators to be a little more moderate in the use of this clubmethod not that i pretend to ask quarter for the antients but for the sake merely of those moderns whom our panegyrists undertake to praise i woud wish em to be a little cautious of comparing characters there is no need to call up a publi shaftesbury   0     cola or a scipio an aristides or a cato to serve as foils these were patriots and good generals in their time and did their country honest service no offence to any who at present do the same the fabriciuss the aemiliuss the cincinnatuss poor men may be sufferd to rest quietly or if their ghosts shoud by this unlucky kind of inchantment be raisd in mockery and contempt they may perhaps prove troublesom in earnest and cast such reflections on our panegyrists and their modern patrons as may be noway for the advantage of either the welldeserving antients will have always a strong party among the wise and learned of every age and the memory of foreign worthys as well as those of our own nation will with gratitude be cherishd by the nobler spirits of mankind the interest of the dead is not so disregarded but that in case of violence offerd em thro partiality to the living there are hands ready prepard to make sufficient reprisals twas in times when flattery grew much in fashion that the title of panegyrick was appropriated to such pieces as containd only a profuse and unlimited praise of some single person the antient panegyricks were no other than mere shaftesbury   0     ly such writings as authors of every kind recited at the solemn assemblys of the people they were the exercises of the wits and men of letters who as     well as the men of bodily dexterity bore their part at the olympick and other national and panegyrick games the british nation tho they have nothing of this kind ordaind or establishd by their laws are yet by nature wonderfully inclind to the same panegyrick exercises at their fairs and during the time of publick festivals they perform their rude olympicks and shew an activity and address beyond any other modern people whatever their trials of skill its true are wholly of the body not of the brain nor is it to be wonderd at if being left to themselves and no way assisted by the laws or magistrate their bodily exercises retain something of the barbarian character or at least shew their man shaftesbury   0   0 ners to hold more of †rome than greece the     gladiatorian and other sanguinary sports which we allow our people discover sufficiently our national taste and the baitings and slaughter of so many sorts of creatures tame as well as wild for diversion merely may witness the extraordinary inclination we have for amphitheatrical spectacles i know not whether it be from this killing disposition remarkd in us that our satirists prove such very slaughtermen and even our panegyrick authors or encomiasts delight so much in the dispatching method above describd but shaftesbury   0      sure i am that our dramatick poets stand violently affected this way and delight to make havock and destruction of every kind tis alledgd indeed by our stagepoets in excuse for vile ribaldry and other gross irregularitys both in the fable and language of their pieces that their success which depends chiefly on the ladys is never so fortunate as when this havock is made on virtue and good sense and their pieces are exhibited publickly in this monstrous form i know not how they can answer it to the fair sex to speak as they pretend experimentally and with such nice distinction of their audience how far this excuse may serve em in relation to common amours and loveadventures i will not take upon me to pronounce but i must own i have often wonderd to see our fighting plays become so much the entertainment of that tender sex they who have no help from learning to observe the wider periods or revolutions of human kind the alterations which happen in manners and the flux and reflux of politeness wit and art are apt at every turn to make the present shaftesbury   0      age their standard and imagine nothing barbarous or savage but what is contrary to the manners of their own time the same pretended judges had they flourishd in our britain at the time when caesar made his first descent woud have condemnd as a whimsical critick the man who shoud have made bold to censure our deficiency of clothing and laugh at the blue cheeks and partycolourd skins which were     then in fashion with our ancestors such must of necessity be the judgment of those who are only criticks by fashion but to a just naturalist or humanist who knows the creature man and judges of his growth and improvement in society it appears evidently that we british men were as barbarous and uncivilizd in respect of the romans under a caesar as the romans themselves were in respect of the grecians when they invaded that nation under a mummius the noble wits of a courteducation who can go no farther back into antiquity than their pedegree will carry em are able however to call to mind the different state of manners in some few reigns past when chivalry was in such repute the ladys were then spectators not only of feignd combats and martial exercises but of real duels and bloody feats of arms they sat as umpires and judges of the shaftesbury   0      doughty frays these were the saintprotectrices to whom the champions chiefly paid their vows and to whom they recommended themselves by these galante quarrels and elegant decisions of right and justice nor is this spirit so entirely lost amongst us but that even at this hour the fair sex inspire us still with the fancy of like gallantrys they are the chief subject of many such civil turmoils and remain still the secret influencing constellation by which we are engagd to give and ask that satisfaction which is peculiar to the fine gentlemen of the age for thus a certain galante of our court expressd the case very naturally when being askd by his friends why one of his establishd character for courage and good sense woud answer the challenge of a coxcomb he confessd that for his own sex he coud safely trust their judgment but how shoud he appear at night before the maids of honour such is the different genius of nations and of the same nation in different times and seasons for so among the antients some have been known tender of the sex to such a degree as not shaftesbury   0      to suffer   0 em to expose their modesty by the view of masculine games or theatrical representations of any kind whatever others on the contrary have introducd them into their amphitheaters and made em sharers in the cruellest spectacles but let our authors or poets complain ever so much of the genius of our people tis evident we are not altogether so barbarous or gothick as they pretend we are naturally no ill soil and have musical parts which might be cultivated with great advantage if these gentlemen woud use the art of masters in their composition they have power to work upon our better inclinations and shaftesbury   0      may know by certain tokens that their audience is disposd to receive     nobler subjects and taste a better manner than that which thro indulgence to themselves more than to the world they are generally pleasd to make their choice besides some laudable attempts which have been made with tolerable success of late years towards a just manner of writing both in the heroick and familiar style we have older proofs of a right disposition in our people towards the moral and instructive way our old dramatick poet may witness for our good ear and manly relish notwithstanding his natural rudeness his unpolishd style his antiquated phrase and wit his want of method and coherence and his deficiency in almost all the graces and ornaments of this kind of writings yet by the justness of his moral the aptness of many of his descriptions and the plain and natural turn of several of his characters he pleases his audience and often gains their ear without a single bribe from luxury or vice that †piece of his which appears to have most affected english hearts and has perhaps been oftnest acted of any which have come upon our stage is almost one continud moral shaftesbury   0      a series of deep reflections drawn from one mouth upon the subject of one single accident and calamity naturally fitted to move horror and compassion it may be properly said of this play if i mistake not that it has only one character or principal part it contains no adoration or flattery of the sex no ranting at the gods no blustring heroism nor any thing of that curious mixture of the fierce and tender which makes the hinge of modern tragedy and nicely varies it between the points of love and honour upon the whole since in the two great poetick stations the epick and dramatick we may observe the moral genius so naturally prevalent since our ‡most approvd heroick poem has neither the softness of language nor the fashionable turn of wit but merely solid thought strong reasoning noble passion and a continud     thred of moral doctrine piety and virtue to recommend it we may justly infer that it is not so much the publick ear as the ill hand and vitious manner of our poets which need redress and thus at last we are returnd to our old article of advice that main preliminary of selfstudy and inward con shaftesbury   0     verse which we have found so much wanting in the authors of our time they shoud add the wisdom of the heart to the task and exercise of the brain in order to bring proportion and beauty into their works that their composition and vein of writing may be natural and free they shoud settle matters in the first place with themselves and having gaind a mastery here they may easily with the help of their genius and a right use of art command their audience and establish a good taste tis on themselves that all depends we have considerd their other subjects of excuse we have acquitted the great men their presumptive patrons whom we have left to their own discretion we have provd the criticks not only an inoffensive but highly useful race and for the audience we have found it not so bad as might perhaps at first be apprehended it remains that we pass sentence on our authors after having precluded em their last refuge nor do we condemn em on their want of wit or fancy but of judgment and correctness which can only be attaind by thorow diligence study and impartial censure of themselves tis shaftesbury   0      manners which is wanting tis a due sentiment of morals which alone can make us knowing in order and proportion and give us the just tone and measure of human passion so much the poet must necessarily borrow of the philosopher as to be master of the common topicks of morality he must at least be speciously honest and in all appearance a friend to virtue throout his poem the good and wise will abate him nothing in     this kind and the people tho corrupt are in the main best satisfyd with this conduct sometimes a play if it is embellished with sentiments and welldrawn as to its characters though it has no grace no weight of language no art delights the people more and keeps their attention better than verses with little in them and wellrounded trifles  shaftesbury   0     part iii sect   section i tis esteemd the highest compliment which can be paid a writer on the occasion of some new work he has made publick to tell him that he has undoubtedly surpassd himself and indeed when one observes how well this compliment is receivd one woud imagine it to contain some wonderful hyperbole of praise for according to the strain of modern politeness tis not an ordinary violation of truth which can afford a tribute sufficient to answer any common degree of merit now tis well known that the gentlemen whose merit lies towards authorship are unwilling to make the least abatement on the foot of this ceremonial one woud wonder therefore to find em so entirely satisfyd with a form of praise which in plain sense amounts to no more than a bare affirmative that they have in some manner differd from themselves and are shaftesbury   0   0  become somewhat worse or better than their common rate for if the vilest writer grows viler than ordinary or     exceeds his natural pitch on either side he is justly said to exceed or go beyond himself we find in the same manner that there is no expression more generally usd in a way of compliment to great men and princes than that plain one which is so often verifyd and may be safely pronouncd for truth on most occasions that they have acted like themselves and sutably to their own genius and character the compliment it must be ownd sounds well no one suspects it for what person is there who in his imagination joins not something worthy and deserving with his true and native self as oft as he is referd to it and made to consider who he is such is the natural affection of all mankind towards moral beauty and perfection that they never fail in making this presumption in behalf of themselves that by nature they have something estimable and worthy in respect of others of their kind and that their genuine true and natural self is as it ought to be of real value in society and justly honourable for the sake of its merit and good qualitys they conclude therefore they have the height of praise allotted em shaftesbury   0      when they are assurd by anyone that they have done nothing below themselves or that in some particular action they have exceeded the ordinary tenor of their character thus is everyone convincd of the reality of a better self and of the cult or homage which is due to it the misfortune is we are seldom taught to comprehend this self by placing it in a distinct view from its representative or counterfeit in our holy religion which for the greatest part is adapted to the very meanest capacitys tis not to be expected that a speculation of this kind shoud be openly advancd tis enough that we have hints given us of a nobler self than that which is commonly supposd the basis and foundation of our actions selfinterest is there taken as it is vulgarly conceivd tho on the other side there are in the most sacred characters examples given us of the highest contempt of all such interested views of a willingness to suffer without recompence     for the sake of others and of a desire to part even with life and being itself on account of what is generous and worthy but in the same manner as the celestial shaftesbury   0      phaenomena are in the sacred volumes generally treated according to common imagination and the then current system of astronomy and natural science so the moral appearances are in many places preservd without alteration according to vulgar prejudice and the general conception of interest and selfgood our real and genuine self is sometimes supposd that ambitious one which is fond of power and glory sometimes that childish one which is taken with vain shew and is to be invited to obedience by promise of finer habitations precious stones and metals shining garments crowns and other such dazling beautys by which another earth or material city is represented it must be ownd that even at that time when a greater and purer light disclosd itself in the chosen nation their natural gloominess appeard still by the great difficulty they had to know themselves or learn their real interest after such long tutorage and instruction from above the simplicity of that people must certainly have been very great when the best doctrine coud not go down without a treat and the best disciples had shaftesbury   0      their heads so running upon their loaves that they were apt to construe every divine saying in a †bellysense and thought nothing more selfconstituent than that inferior receptacle their taste in morals coud not fail of being sutable to this extraordinary estimation of themselves no wonder if the better and nobler self was left as a mystery to a people who of all human kind were the most grosly selfish crooked and perverse so that it must necessarily be confessd in honour of their divine legislators patriots and instructors that they exceeded all others in goodness and generosity since they coud so truly love their nation and brethren such as they were and coud have so generous and disinterested regards     for those who were in themselves so sordidly interested and undeserving but whatever may be the proper effect or operation of religion tis the known province of philosophy to teach us ourselves keep us the selfsame persons and so regulate our governing fancys passions and humours as to make us comprehensible to our selves and knowable by other features than those of a bare countenance for tis not certainly by virtue of our face merely that we shaftesbury   0      are ourselves tis not we who change when our complexion or shape changes but there is that which being wholly metamorphosd and converted we are thereby in reality transformd and lost shoud an intimate friend of ours who had endurd many sicknesses and run many ill adventures while he traveld thro the remotest parts of the east and hottest countrys of the south return to us so alterd in his whole outward figure that till we had for a time conversd with him we coud not know him again to be the same person the matter woud not seem so very strange nor woud our concern on this account be very great but shoud a like face and figure of a friend return to us with thoughts and humours of a strange and foreign turn with passions affections and opinions wholly different from any thing we had formerly known we shoud say in earnest and with the greatest amazement and concern that this was another creature and not the friend whom we once knew familiarly nor shoud we in reality attempt any renewal of acquaintance or correspondence with such a person tho perhaps he might preserve in his memory the faint marks or tokens of former transactions which had passd between us shaftesbury   0     when a revolution of this kind tho not so total happens at any time in a character when the passion or humour of a known person changes remarkably from what it once was tis to philosophy we then appeal tis either the want or weakness of this principle which is chargd on the delinquent and on this bottom it is that we often challenge ourselves when we find such variation     in our manners and observe that it is not always the same self nor the same interest we have in view but often a direct contraryone which we serve still with the same passion and ardour when from a noted liberality we change perhaps to as remarkable a parsimony when from indolence and love of rest we plunge into business or from a busy and severe character abhorrent from the tender converse of the fair sex we turn on a sudden to a contrary passion and become amorous or uxorious we acknowledg the weakness and charging our defect on the general want of philosophy we say sighing that indeed we none of us truly know ourselves and thus we recognize the authority and proper object of philosophy so far at least that tho we pretend not to be compleat philosophers we confess that as we have more or less of this intelligence or comprehension of shaftesbury   0      ourselves we are accordingly more or less truly men and either more or less to be depended on in friendship society and the commerce of life the fruits of this science are indeed the fairest imaginable and upon due trial are found to be as well relishd and of as good savour with mankind but when invited to the speculation we turn our eyes on that which we suppose the tree tis no wonder if we slight the gardenership and think the manner of culture a very contemptible mystery grapes tis said are not gatherd from thorns nor figs from thistles now if in the literate world there be any choking weed any thing purely thorn or thistle tis in all likelihood that very kind of plant which stands for philosophy in some famous schools there can be nothing more ridiculous than to expect that manners or understanding shoud sprout from such a stock it pretends indeed some relation to manners as being definitive of the natures essences and propertys of spirits and some relation to reason as describing the shapes and forms of certain instruments imployd in the reasoning art but had the craftiest of men for many ages together been imployd in finding     out a method to shaftesbury   0      confound reason and degrade the understanding of mankind they coud not perhaps have succeeded better than by the establishment of such a mockscience i knew once a notable enthusiast of the itinerant kind who being upon a high spiritual adventure in a country where prophetick missions are treated as no jest was as he told me committed a close prisoner and kept for several months where he saw no manner of light in this banishment from letters and discourse the man very wittily invented an amusement much to his purpose and highly preservative both of health and humour it may be thought perhaps that of all seasons or circumstances here was one the most sutable to our oftmentiond practice of soliloquy especially since the prisoner was one of those whom in this age we usually call philosophers a successor of paracelsus and a master in the occult sciences but as to moral science or any thing relating to selfconverse he was a mere novice to work therefore he went after a different method he tund his natural pipes not after the manner of a musician to practice what was melodious and agreeable in sounds but to fashion and form all sorts of articulate voices the most distinctly that was possible this he performd by shaftesbury   0      strenuously exalting his voice and essaying it in all the several dispositions and configurations of his throat and mouth and thus bellowing roaring snarling and otherwise variously exerting his organs of sound he endeavourd to discover what letters of the alphabet coud best design each species or what new letters were to be invented to mark the undiscoverd modifications he found for instance the letter a to be a most genuine character an original and pure vowel and justly placd as principal in the front of the alphabetick order for having duly extended his under jaw to its utmost distance from the upper and by a proper insertion of his fingers provided against the contraction of either corner of his mouth he experimentally discoverd it impossible for human tongue under these circumstances to emit any other modification of sound than that which was describd by this primitive character the vowel o was formd by an orbicular     disposition of the mouth as was aptly delineated in the character itself the vowel u by a parallel protrusion of the lips the other vowels and consonants by other various collisions of the mouth and operations of the active tongue upon the passive gum or palat the result of this profound speculation and long exercise of our prisoner was a philosophical treatise which shaftesbury   0      he composd when he was set at liberty he esteemd himself the only master of voice and language on the account of this his radical science and fundamental knowledg of sounds but whoever had taken him to improve their voice or teach em an agreeable or just manner of accent or delivery woud i believe have found themselves considerably deluded tis not that i woud condemn as useless this speculative science of articulation it has its place no doubt among the other sciences and may serve to grammar as grammar serves to rhetorick and to other arts of speech and writing the solidity of mathematicks and its advantage to mankind is provd by many effects in those beneficial arts and sciences which depend on it tho astrologers horoscopers and other such are pleasd to honour themselves with the title of mathematicians as for metaphysicks and that which in the schools is taught for logick or for ethicks i shall willingly allow it to pass for philosophy when by any real effects it is provd capable to refine our spirits improve our understandings or mend our manners but if the defining material and immaterial substances and distinguishing their propertys and modes is recommended to us as the right manner of proceeding in the discovery of our own shaftesbury   0   0  natures i shall be apt to suspect such a study as the more delusive and infatuating on account of its magnificent pretension the study of triangles and circles interferes not with the study of minds nor does the student in the mean while suppose himself advancing in wisdom or the knowledg of himself or mankind all he desires is to keep his head sound as it was before and well he thinks indeed he has come off if by good fortune there be no crack made in it as for other ability or improvement in   0 the knowledg of human nature or the world he refers himself to other studys and practice such is the mathematicians modesty and good sense but for the philosopher who pretends to be wholly taken up in considering his higher facultys and examining the powers and principles of his understanding if in reality his philosophy be foreign to the matter professd if it goes beside the mark and reaches nothing we can truly call our interest or concern it must be somewhat worse than mere ignorance or idiotism the most ingenious way of becoming foolish is by a system and the surest method to prevent good sense is to set up something in the room of it the liker any thing is to wisdom if it be not plainly shaftesbury   0      the thing itself the more directly it becomes its opposite one woud expect it of these physiologists and searchers of modes and substances that being so exalted in their understandings and inrichd with science above other men they shoud be as much above em in their passions and sentiments the consciousness of being admitted into the secret recesses of nature and the inward resources of a human heart shoud one woud think create in these gentlemen a sort of magnanimity which might distinguish em from the ordinary race of mortals but if their pretended knowledg of the machine of this world and of their own frame is able to produce nothing beneficial either to the one or to the other i know not to what purpose such a philosophy can serve except only to shut the door against better knowledg and introduce impertinence and conceit with the best countenance of authority tis hardly possible for a student but more especially an author who has dealt in ideas and treated formally of the passions in a way of natural philosophy not to imagine himself more wise on this account and more knowing in his own character and the genius of mankind but that he is mistaken in his calculation shaftesbury   0      experience generally convinces us none being found more impotent in themselves of less command over their passions less free from superstition and vain fears or less safe from common imposture and delusion than the noted headpieces of this stamp     nor is this a wonder the speculation in a manner bespeaks the practice there needs no formal deduction to make this evident a small help from our familiar method of soliloquy may serve turn and we may perhaps decide this matter in a more diverting way by confronting this superspeculative philosophy with a more practical sort which relates chiefly to our acquaintance friendship and good correspondence with ourselves on this account it may not be to my readers disadvantage if forgetting him for awhile i apply chiefly to myself and as occasion offers assume that selfconversant practice which i have pretended to disclose tis hopd therefore he will not esteem it as ill breeding if i lose the usual regard to his presence and shoud i fall insensibly into one of the paroxysms describd and as in a sort of phrenzy enter into high expostulation with myself he will not surely be offended with the free language or even with the reproaches he hears from a shaftesbury   0      person who only makes bold with whom he may if a passenger shoud turn by chance into a watchmakers shop and thinking to inform himself concerning watches shoud inquire of what metal or what matter each part was composd what gave the colours or what made the sounds without examining what the real use was of such an instrument or by what movements its end was best attaind and its perfection acquird tis plain that such an examiner as this woud come short of any understanding in the real nature of the instrument shoud a philosopher after the same manner employing himself in the study of human nature discover only what effects each passion wrought upon the body what change of aspect or feature they producd and in what different manner they affected the limbs and muscles this might possibly qualify him to give advice to an anatomist or a limner but not to mankind or to himself since according to this survey he considerd not the real operation or energy of his subject nor contemplated the man as real man and as a human agent but as a watch or common machine shaftesbury   0         the passion of fear as a modern philosopher informs me determines the spirits to the muscles of the knees which are instantly ready to perform their motion by taking up the legs with incomparable celerity in order to remove the body out of harms way—excellent mechanism but whether the knocking together of the knees be any more the cowardly symptom of flight than the chattering of the teeth is the stout symptom of resistance i shall not take upon me to determine in this whole subject of inquiry i shall find nothing of the least selfconcernment and i may depend upon it that by the most refind speculation of this kind i shall neither learn to diminish my fears or raise my courage this however i may be assurd of that tis the nature of fear as well as of other passions to have its increase and decrease as it is fed by opinion and influencd by custom and practice these passions according as they have the ascendency in me and differ in proportion with one another affect my character and make me different with respect to myself and others i must shaftesbury   0      therefore of necessity find redress and improvement in this case by reflecting justly on the manner of my own motion as guided by affections which depend so much on apprehension and conceit by examining the various turns inflections declensions and inward revolutions of the passions i must undoubtedly come the better to understand a human breast and judg the better both of others and myself tis impossible to make the least advancement in such a study without acquiring some advantage from the regulation and government of those passions on which the conduct of a life depends for instance if superstition be the sort of fear which most oppresses tis not very material to inquire on this occasion to what parts or districts the blood or spirits are immediately detachd or where they are made to rendevouz for this no more imports me to understand than it depends on me to regulate or change but when the grounds of this superstitious fear are considerd     to be from opinion and the subjects of it come to be thorowly searchd and examind the passion itself must necessarily diminish as i discover more and more the imposture which belongs to it shaftesbury   0     in the same manner if vanity be from opinion and i consider how vanity is conceivd from what imaginary advantages and inconsiderable grounds if i view it in its excessive height as well as in its contrary depression tis impossible i shoud not in some measure be relievd of this distemper are you swollen up with the love of praise there are sure remedies    there are spells and charms by which you may ease this pain and throw off a great part of your complaint the same must happen in respect of anger ambition love desire and the other passions from whence i frame the different notion i have of interest for as these passions veer my interest veers my steerage varys and i make alternately now this now that to be my course and harbour the man in anger has a different happiness from the man in love and the man lately become covetous has a different notion of satisfaction from what he had before when he was liberal even the man in humour has another thought of interest and advantage than the man out of humour or in the least shaftesbury   0      disturbd the examination therefore of my humours and the †inquiry after my passions must necessarily draw along with it the search and scrutiny of my opinions and the sincere consideration of my scope and end and thus the study of human affection cannot fail of leading me towards the knowledg of human nature and of myself this is the philosophy which by nature has the preeminence above all other science or knowledg nor can this surely be of the     sort calld vain or deceitful since it is the only means by which i can discover vanity and deceit this is not of that kind which depends on genealogys or traditions and ministers questions and vain jangling it has not its name as other philosophys from the mere subtlety and nicety of the speculation but by way of excellence from its being superior to all other speculations from its presiding over all other sciences and occupations teaching the measure of each and assigning the just value of everything in life by this science religion itself is judgd spirits are searchd prophecys provd miracles distinguishd the sole measure and standard being taken shaftesbury   0      from moral rectitude and from the discernment of what is sound and just in the affections for if the †tree is known only by its fruits my first endeavour must be to distinguish the true taste of fruits refine my palat and establish a just relish in the kind so that to bid me judg authority by morals whilst the rule of morals is supposd ‡dependent on mere authority and will is the same in reality as to bid me see with my eyes shut measure without a standard and count without arithmetick and thus philosophy which judges both of herself and of every thing besides discovers her own province and chief command teaches me to distinguish between her person and her likeness and shews me her immediate and real self by that sole privilege of teaching me to know myself and what belongs to me she gives to every inferior science its just rank leaves some to measure sounds others to scan syllables others to weigh vacuums and define spaces and extensions but reserves to herself her due authority and majesty keeps her state and antient title of guide of life investigator of virtue  and the rest of those just ap shaftesbury   0     pellations which of old belongd to her when she merited to be apostrophizd     as she was by the orator thou didst find out laws thou wast the teacher of character and method    one day spent well and under thy rules is better than an eternity of error excellent mistress but easy to be mistaken whilst so many handmaids wear as illustrious apparel and some are made to outshine her far in dress and ornament in reality how specious a study how solemn an amusement is raisd from what we call philosophical speculations—the formation of ideas—their compositions comparisons agreement and disagreement—what can have a better appearance or bid fairer for genuine and true philosophy come on then let me philosophize in this manner if this be indeed the way i am to grow wise let me examine my ideas of space and substance let me look well into matter and its modes if this be looking into myself if this be to improve my understanding and enlarge my mind for of this i may soon be satisfyd let me observe therefore with diligence what passes here what connexion and consistency what agreement or disagreement i find within whether according to my present ideas shaftesbury   0  00  that which i approve this hour i am like to approve as well the next and in case it be otherwise with me how or after what manner i shall relieve myself how ascertain my ideas and keep my opinion liking and esteem of things the same if this remains unsolvd if i am still the same mystery to myself as ever to what purpose is all this reasoning and acuteness wherefore do i admire my philosopher or study to become such a one myself today things have succeeded well with me consequently my ideas are raisd tis a fine world all is glorious every thing delightful and entertaining mankind conversation company society what can be more desirable tomorrow comes disappointment     crosses disgrace and what follows o miserable mankind wretched state who woud live out of solitude who woud write or act for such a world philosopher where are thy ideas where is truth certainty evidence so much talkd of tis here surely they are to be maintaind if any where tis here i am to preserve some just distinctions and adequate ideas which if i cannot do a jot the more by what such a philosophy can teach me the philosophy is in this respect imposing and delusive for shaftesbury   0  0   whatever its other virtues are it relates not to me myself it concerns not the man nor any otherwise affects the mind than by the conceit of knowledg and the false assurance raisd from a supposd improvement again what are my ideas of the world of pleasure riches fame life what judgment am i to make of mankind and human affairs what sentiments am i to frame what opinions what maxims if none at all why do i concern myself in speculations about my ideas what is it to me for instance to know what kind of idea i can form of space divide a solid body of whatever dimension says a renownd modern philosopher and twill be impossible for the parts to move within the bounds of its superficies if there be not left in it a void space as big as the least part into which the said body is divided— thus the atomist or epicurean pleading for a vacuum the plenitudinarian on the other side brings his fluid in play and joins the idea of body and extension of this says one i have clear ideas of this says the other i can be certain shaftesbury   0  0   and what say i if in the whole matter there be no certainty at all for mathematicians are divided and mechanicks proceed as well on one hypothesis as on the other my mind i am satisfyd will proceed either way alike for it is concernd on neither side—philosopher let me hear concerning what is of some moment to me let me hear concerning life what the right notion is and what i am to stand to upon occasion that i may not when life seems retiring or has     run itself out to the very dregs cry vanity condemn the world and at the same time complain that life is short and passing for why so short indeed if not found sweet why do i complain both ways is vanity mere vanity a happiness or can misery pass away too soon this is of moment to me to examine this is worth my while if on the other side i cannot find the agreement or disagreement of my ideas in this place if i can come to nothing certain here what is all the rest to me what signifys it how i come by my ideas or how compound em which are simple and which complex if i have a right idea of life now when perhaps i think slightly of it and resolve with myself that it may easily be laid down on any honourable occasion of shaftesbury   0  0   service to my friends or country teach me how i may preserve this idea or at least how i may get safely rid of it that it may trouble me no more nor lead me into ill adventures teach me how i came by such an opinion of worth and virtue what it is which at one time raises it so high and at another time reduces it to nothing how these disturbances and fluctuations happen by what innovation what composition what intervention of other ideas if this be the subject of the philosophical art i readily apply to it and embrace the study if there be nothing of this in the case i have no occasion for this sort of learning and am no more desirous of knowing how i form or compound those ideas which are markd by words than i am of knowing how and by what motions of my tongue or palat i form those articulate sounds which i can full as well pronounce without any such science or speculation sect   section ii but here it may be convenient for me to quit myself awhile in favour of my reader lest if he prove one of the uncourteous sort he shoud raise a considerable objection in this place he may ask perhaps why a writer for selfentertainment shoud     not keep his writings shaftesbury   0  0   to himself without appearing in publick or before the world in answer to this i shall only say that for appearing in publick or before the world i do not readily conceive what our worthy objector may understand by it i can call to mind indeed among my acquaintance certain merchantadventurers in the lettertrade who in correspondence with their factorbookseller are enterd into a notable commerce with the world they have directly and in due form of preface and epistle dedicatory sollicited the publick and made interest with friends for favour and protection on this account they have venturd perhaps to join some great mans reputation with their own having obtaind his permission to address a work to him on presumption of its passing for something considerable in the eyes of mankind one may easily imagine that such patronizd and avowd authors as these woud be shreudly disappointed if the publick took no notice of their labours but for my own part tis of no concern to me what regard the publick bestows on my amusements or after what manner it comes acquainted with what i write for my private entertainment or by way of advice to such of my acquaintance as are thus desperately embarkd shaftesbury   0  0  tis requisite that my friends who peruse these advices shoud read em in better characters than those of my own handwriting and by good luck i have a very fair hand offerd which may save me the trouble of recopying and can readily furnish me with as many handsom copys as i woud desire for my own and friends service i have not indeed forbid my amanuensis the making as many as he pleases for his own benefit what i write is not worth being made a mystery and if it be worth any ones purchasing much good may do the purchaser tis a traffick i have no share in tho i accidentally furnish the subjectmatter and thus am i nowise more an author for being in print i am conscious of no additional virtue or dangerous quality from having lain at any time under the weight of that alphabetick engine calld the press i know no conjuration in it either with respect to     church or state nor can i imagine why the machine shoud appear so formidable to scholars and renownd clerks whose very mystery and foundation depends on the lettermanufacture to allow benefit of clergy and to restrain the press seems to me to have something of crosspurpose in it i can hardly think that the qua shaftesbury   0  0  lity of what is written can be alterd by the manner of writing or that there can be any harm in a quick way of copying fair and keeping copys alike why a man may not be permitted to write with iron as well as quill i cant conceive or how a writer changes his capacity by this new dress any more than by the wear of wovestockins after having worn no other manufacture than the knit so much for my reader if perchance i have any besides the friend or two abovementiond for being engagd in morals and inducd to treat so rigorous a subject as that of selfexamination i naturally call to mind the extreme delicacy and tenderness of modern appetites in respect of the philosophy of this kind what distaste possibly may have arisen from some medicinal doses of a like nature administerd to raw stomachs at a very early age i will not pretend to examine but whatever manner in philosophy happens to bear the least resemblance to that of catechism cannot im persuaded of itself prove very inviting such a smart way of questioning ourselves in our youth has made our manhood more averse to the expostulatory discipline and tho the metaphysical points of our belief are by this method with admirable shaftesbury   0  0   care and caution instilld into tender minds yet the manner of this anticipating philosophy may make the afterwork of reason and the inward exercise of the mind at a riper age proceed the more heavily and with greater reluctance it must needs be a hard case with us after having passd so learned a childhood and been instructed in our own and other higher natures essences incorporeal substances personalitys and the like to condescend at riper years to ruminate and con over this lesson a second time tis hard after having by so many pertinent   0 interrogatorys and decisive sentences declard who and what we are to come leisurely in another view to inquire concerning our real self and end the judgment we are to make of interest and the opinion we shoud have of advantage and good which is what must necessarily determine us in our conduct and prove the leading principle of our lives can we bear looking anew into these mysterys can we endure a new schooling after having once learnt our lesson from the world hardly i presume for by the lesson of this latter school and according to the sense i acquire in converse with prime men shoud i at any time shaftesbury   0  0   ask myself what governd me i shoud answer readily my interest but what is interest and how governd by opinion and fancy is every thing therefore my interest which i fansy such or may my fancy possibly be wrong it may if my fancy of interest therefore be wrong can my pursuit or aim be right hardly so can i then be supposd to hit when i know not in reality so much as how to aim my chief interest it seems therefore must be to get an aim and know certainly where my happiness and advantage lies where else can it lie than in my pleasure since my advantage and good must ever be pleasing and what is pleasing can never be other than my advantage and good excellent let fancy therefore govern and interest be what we please for if that which pleases us be our good because it pleases us anything may be our interest or good nothing can come amiss that which we fondly make our happiness at one time we may as readily unmake at another noone can learn what real good is nor can anyone upon this foot be said to understand his interest shaftesbury   0  0  here we see are strange embroils—but let us try to deal more candidly with ourselves and frankly own that †pleasure is no rule of good since when we follow pleasure merely we are disgusted and change from one sort to another condemning that at one     time which at another we earnestly approve and never judging equally of happiness whilst we follow passion and mere humour a lover for instance when struck with the idea or fancy of his enjoyment promises himself the highest felicity if he succeeds in his new amour—he succeeds in it finds not the felicity he expected but promises himself the same again in some other—the same thing happens he is disappointed as before but still has faith—wearyd with this game he quits the chace renounces the way of courtship and intrigue and detests the ceremony and difficulty of the pleasure—a new species of amours invites him here too he meets the same inquietude and inconstancy—scorning to grow sottish and plunge in the lowest sink of vice he shakes off his intemperance despises gluttony and riot and hearkens to ambition he grows a man of business and seeks authority and fame— shaftesbury   0   0 with what chain can i bind the everchanging figure of proteus lest this therefore shoud be my own case let me see whether i can controul my fancy and fix it if possible on something which may hold good—when i exercise my reason in moral subjects when i employ my affection in friendly and social actions i find i can sincerely enjoy myself if there be a pleasure therefore of this kind why not indulge it or what harm woud there be supposing it shoud grow greater by indulgence if i am lazy and indulge myself in the languid pleasure i know the harm and can foresee the drone if i am luxurious i know the harm of this also and have the plain prospect of the sot if avarice be my pleasure the end i know is being a miser but if honesty be my delight i know no other consequence from indulging such a passion than that of growing better naturd and enjoying more and more the pleasures of society on the other hand if this honest pleasure be lost     by knavish indulgence and immorality there can hardly be a satisfaction left of any kind since goodnature and social affection shaftesbury   0      are so essential even to the pleasures of a debauch if therefore the only pleasure i can freely and without reserve indulge be that of the honest and moral kind if the rational and social enjoyment be so constant in itself and so essential to happiness why shoud i not bring my other pleasures to correspond and be friends with it rather than raise myself other pleasures which are destructive of this foundation and have no manner of correspondency with one another upon this bottom let me try how i can bear the assault of fancy and maintain myself in my moral fortress against the attacks which are raisd on the side of corrupt interest and a wrong self when the idea of pleasure strikes i ask myself before i was thus struck by the idea was any thing amiss with me no therefore remove the idea and i am well but having this idea such as i now have i cannot want the thing without regret see therefore which is best either to suffer under this want till the idea be removd or by satisfying the want confirm not only this idea but all of the same stamp shaftesbury   0     in reality has not every fancy a like privilege of passing if any single one be admitted upon its own authority and what must be the issue of such an oeconomy if the whole fantastick crew be introducd and the door refusd to none what else is it than this management which leads to the most dissolute and profligate of characters what is it on the contrary which raises us to any degree of worth or steddiness besides a direct contrary practice and conduct can there be strength of mind can there be command over ones self if the ideas of pleasure the suggestions of fancy and the strong pleadings of appetite and desire are not often withstood and the imaginations soundly reprimanded and brought under subjection thus it appears that the method of examining our ideas is no     pedantick practice nor is there any thing ungalante in the manner of thus questioning the ladyfancys which present themselves as charmingly dressd as possible to sollicit their cause and obtain a judgment by favour of that worse part and corrupt self to whom they make their application it may be justly said of these that they are very powerful sollicitresses they never seem to importune us tho they are shaftesbury   0      ever in our eye and meet us whichever way we turn they understand better how to manage their appearance than by always throwing up their veil and shewing their faces openly in a broad light to run the danger of cloying our sight or exposing their features to a strict examination so far are they from such forwardness that they often stand as at a distance suffering us to make the first advance and contenting themselves with discovering a sideface or bestowing now and then a glance in a mysterious manner as if they endeavourd to conceal their persons one of the most dangerous of these enchantresses appears in a sort of dismal weed with the most mournful countenance imaginable often casting up her eyes and wringing her hands so that tis impossible not to be movd by her till her meaning be considerd and her imposture fully known the airs she borrows are from the tragick muse melpomene nor is she in her own person any way amiable or attractive far from it her art is to render herself as forbidding as possible that her sisters may by her means be the more alluring and if by her tragick aspect and melancholy looks she can persuade us that death whom she represents is such a hideous shaftesbury   0      form she conquers in behalf of the whole fantastick tribe of wanton gay and fond desires effeminacy and cowardice instantly prevail the poorest means of life grow in repute when the ends and just conditions of it are so little known and the dread of parting with it raisd to so high a degree the more eagerly we grasp at life the more impotent we are in the enjoyment of it by this avidity its very lees and dregs are swallowd the ideas of sordid pleasure are advancd worth manhood generosity and all the nobler opinions and sentiments of honest     good and virtuous pleasure disappear and fly before this queen of terrors tis a mighty delight which a sort of counterphilosophers take in seconding this phantom and playing her upon our understandings whenever they woud take occasion to confound em the vicious poets employ this specter too on their side tho after a different manner by the help of this tragick actress they gain a fairer audience for the luxurious fancys and give their eratos and other playsom muses a fuller scope in the support of riot and debauch the gloomy prospect of death becomes the incentive to pleasures of the lowest order ashes and shade the tomb and cypress are made to serve as foils to luxury the abhorrence of an insensible shaftesbury   0      state makes mere vitality and animalsensation highly cherishd give your genius play let us take our pleasures your life alone is ours you will soon be but dust a ghost a name tis no wonder if luxury profits by the deformity of this specteropinion she supports her interest by this childish bugbear and like a mother by her infant is huggd so much the closer by her votary as the fear presses him and grows importunate she invites him to live fast according to her best measure of life and well she may who woud not willingly make life pass away as quickly as was possible when the nobler pleasures of it were already lost or corrupted by a wretched fear of death the intense selfishness and meanness which accompanys this fear must reduce us to a low ebb of enjoyment and in a manner bring to nothing that main sum of satisfactory sensations by which we vulgarly rate the happiness of our private condition and fortune but see a lovely form advances to our assistance introducd by the prime muse the beauteous calliope she shews us what     real beauty is and what those shaftesbury   0      numbers are which make life perfect and bestow the chief enjoyment she sets virtue before our eyes and teaches us how to rate life from the experience of the most heroick spirits she brings her sisters clio and urania to support her from the former she borrows whatever is memorable in history and antient time to confront the tragick specter and shew the fixd contempt which the happiest and freest nations as well as single heroes and private men worthy of any note have ever expressd for that impostress from the latter she borrows what is sublimest in philosophy to explain the laws of nature the order of the universe and represent to us the justice of accompanying this amiable administration she shews us that by this just compliance we are made happiest and that the measure of a happy life is not from the fewer or more suns we behold the fewer or more breaths we draw or meals we repeat but from the having once livd well acted our part handsomly and made our exit chearfully and as became us thus we retain on virtues side the noblest party of the muses whatever is august amongst those sisters appears readily in our behalf nor are the more jocund ladys wanting in their assistance when they act in the perfection of their art and inspire some better geniuss in this kind shaftesbury   0      of poetry such

in the cause of numbers are with regret employd another way in favour of disorder instead of being made syrens to serve the purposes of vice they woud with more delight accompany their elder sisters and add their graces and attractive charms to what is most harmonious muselike and divine in human life there is this difference only between these and the more heroick dames that they can more easily be perverted and take the vicious form for what person of any genius or masterly command in the poetick art coud think of bringing the epick or tragick muse to act the pandar or be subservient to effeminacy and cowardice     tis not against death hazards or toils that tragedy and the heroick fable are pointed tis not mere life which is here exalted or has its price enhancd on the contrary its calamitys are exposd the disorders of the passions set to view fortitude recommended honour advancd the contempt of death placd as the peculiar note of every generous and happy soul and the tenacious love of life as the truest character of an abject wretch shaftesbury   0     is it so hard to die tis not to be imagind how easily we deal with the deluding apparitions and false ideas of happiness and good when this frightful specter of misery and ill is after this manner well laid and by honest magick conjurd down so as not to give the least assistance to the other tempting forms this is that occult science or sort of counternecromancy which instead of ghastliness and horror inspires only what is gentle and humane and dispels the imposing phantoms of every kind he may pass undoubtedly for no mean conjurer who can deal with spirits of this sort—but hold—let us try the experiment in due form and draw the magick circle let us observe how the inferior imps appear when the headgoblin is securely laid— see the enchantress indolence presents herself in all the pomp of ease and lazy luxury she promises the sweetest life and invites us to her pillow injoins us to expose ourselves to no adventurous attempt and forbids us any engagement which may bring us into action where then are the plea shaftesbury   0     sures which ambition promises and love affords how is the gay world enjoyd or are those to be esteemd no pleasures which are lost by dulness and inaction but indolence is the highest pleasure to live and not to feel to feel no trouble what good then life itself and is this properly to live is sleeping life is this what i shoud study to prolong—here the fantastick tribe itself seems     scandalizd a civil war begins the major part of the capricious dames range themselves on reasons side and declare against the languid syren ambition blushes at the offerd sweet conceit and vanity take superior airs even luxury herself in her polite and elegant humour reproves the apostatesister and marks her as an alien to true pleasure—away thou drousy phantom haunt me no more for i have learnd from better than thy sisterhood that life and happiness consist in action and employment but here a busy form sollicits us active industrious watchful and despising pains and labour she wears the serious countenance of virtue but with features of anxiety and disquiet what is it she mutters what looks she on with such admiration and astonishment shaftesbury   0   0 —bags coffers heaps of shining metal what for the service of luxury for her these preparations art thou then her

to do with thee thou doubly vile dependent when once i have dismissd thy patroness and despisd her threats thus i contend with fancy and opinion and search the mint and foundery of imagination for here the appetites and desires are fabricated hence they derive their privilege and currency if i can stop the mischief here and prevent false coinage i am safe idea wait awhile till i have examind thee whence thou art and to whom thou retainst art thou of ambitions train or dost thou promise only pleasure say what am i to sacrifice for thy shaftesbury   0      sake what honour what truth what manhood—what bribe is it thou bringst along with thee describe the flattering object but without flattery plain as the thing is without addition     without sparing or reserve is it wealth is it a report a title or a female come not in a troop ye fancys bring not your objects crouding to confound the sight but let me examine your worth and weight distinctly think not to raise accumulative happiness for if separately you contribute nothing in conjunction you can only amuse whilst i am thus penning a soliloquy in form i cant forbear reflecting on my work and when i view the manner of it with a familiar eye i am readier i find to make myself diversion on this occasion than to suppose i am in good earnest about a work of consequence what am i to be thus fantastical must i busy myself with phantoms fight with apparitions and chimeras for certain or the chimeras will be beforehand with me and busy themselves so as to get the better of my understanding what talk to myself like some madman in different persons and under different shaftesbury   0      characters undoubtedly or twill be soon seen who is a real madman and changes character in earnest without knowing how to help it this indeed is but too certain that as long as we enjoy a mind as long as we have appetites and sense the fancys of all kinds will be hard at work and whether we are in company or alone they must range still and be active they must have their field the question is whether they shall have it wholly to themselves or whether they shall acknowledg some controuler or manager if none tis this i fear which leads to madness tis this and nothing else which can be calld madness or loss of reason for if fancy be left judg of any thing she must be judg of all everything is right if anything be so because i fansy it the house turns round the prospect turns no but my head turns indeed i have a giddiness thats all fancy woud persuade me thus and thus but i know better tis by means therefore of a controuler and corrector of fancy that i am savd from being mad otherwise tis the house turns when i am giddy tis things which change for so i must suppose when my passion merely or temper changes but i was     out of order i dreamt who tells shaftesbury   0      me this who besides the correctrice by whose means i am in my wits and without whom i am no longer myself every man indeed who is not absolutely beside himself must of necessity hold his fancys under some kind of discipline and management the stricter this discipline is the more the man is rational and in his wits the looser it is the more fantastical he must be and the nearer to the madmans state this is a business which can never stand still i must always be winner or loser at the game either i work upon my fancys or they on me if i give quarter they wont there can be no truce no suspension of arms between us the one or the other must be superior and have the command for if the fancys are left to themselves the government must of course be theirs and then what difference between such a state and madness the question therefore is the same here as in a family or houshold when tis askd who rules or who is master learn by the voices observe who speaks aloud in a commanding tone who talks who questions or who is talkd with and who questiond for if the servants take the former part they shaftesbury   0      are the masters and the government of the house will be found such as naturally may be expected in these circumstances how stands it therefore in my own oeconomy my principal province and command how stand my fancys how deal they with me or do i take upon me rather to deal with them do i talk question arraign or am i talkd with arraignd and contented to hear without giving a reply if i vote with fancy resign my opinion to her command and judg of happiness and misery as she judges how am i myself he who in a plain imagines precipices at his feet impending rocks over his head fears bursting clouds in a clear sky cries fire deluge earthquake or thunder when all is quiet does he not rave but one whose eyes seemingly strike fire by a blow one  00 whose head is giddy from the motion of a ship after having been newly set ashore or one who from a distemper in his ear hears thundring noises can readily redress these several apprehensions and is by this means savd from madness shaftesbury   0     a distemper in my eye may make me see the strangest kind of figures and when cataracts and other impuritys are gathering in that organ flies insects and other various forms seem playing in the air before me but let my senses err ever so widely i am not on this account beside myself nor am i out of my own possession whilst there is a person left within who has power to dispute the appearances and redress the imagination i am accosted by ideas and striking apprehensions but i take nothing on their report i hear their story and return em answer as they deserve fancy and i are not all one the disagreement makes me my own when on the contrary i have no debate with her no controversy but take for happiness and misery for good and ill whatever she presents as such i must then join voices with her and cry precipice fire cerberus elyzium—   sandy desarts flowery fields   seas of milk and ships of amber a grecian prince who had the same madness as alexander and was deeply struck with the fancy of conquering shaftesbury   0      worlds was ingeniously shewn the method of expostulating with his ladygoverness when by a discreet friend and at an easy hour he was askd little by little concerning his design and the final purpose and promisd good which the flattering dame proposd to him the story is sufficiently noted all the artifice employd against the prince was a wellmanagd interrogatory of what next ladyfancy was not aware of the design upon her but let herself be wormd out by degrees at first she said the princes design was only upon a tract of land which stood out like a promontory before him and seemd to eclipse his glory a fair rich island which was close by presented itself next and as it were naturally invited conquest the opposite coast came next in view then the continent  0  on each side the larger sea and then what was easiest of all and woud follow of course the dominion both of sea and land and what next replyd the friend what shall we do when we

or our wine grow better shall we be more secure or at hearts shaftesbury   0      ease what you may possibly lose by these attempts is easy to conceive but which way you will be a gainer your own

prince grew sullen turnd the discourse abhord the profanation offerd to his sovereignempress deliverd up his thoughts to her again with deep devotion and fell to conquering with all his might the

amber tis easy to bring the heros case home to ourselves and see in the ordinary circumstances of life how love ambition and the gayer tribe of fancys as well as the gloomy and dark specters of another sort prevail over our mind tis easy to observe how they work on us when we refuse to be beforehand with em and bestow repeated lessons on the encroaching sorceresses on this it is that our offerd advice and method of so shaftesbury   0     liloquy depends and whether this be of any use towards making us either wiser or happier i am confident it must help to make us wittier and politer it must beyond any other science teach us the turns of humour and passion the variety of manners the justness of characters and truth of things which when we rightly understand we may naturally describe and on this depends chiefly the skill and art of a good writer so that if to write well be a just pretence  0  to merit tis plain that writers who are apt to set no small value on their art must confess there is something valuable in this selfexamining practice and method of inward colloquy as for the writer of these papers as modern authors are pleasd modestly to style themselves he is contented for his part to take up with this practice barely for his own proper benefit without regard to the high function or capacity of author it may be allowd him in this particular to imitate the best genius and most gentlemanlike of roman poets and tho by an excess of dulness it shoud be his misfortune to learn nothing of this poets wit he is persuaded he may learn something of his honesty and good humour shaftesbury   0     for i do not fail when my studycouch or a colonnade has received me this is more right if i do thus i shall live better so my friends will be glad to meet me    these are my silent reflections with myself†  0  sect   section iii we are now arrivd to that part of our performance where it becomes us to cast our eye back on what has already passd the observers of method generally make this the place of recapitulation other artists have substituted the practice of apology or extenuation for the anticipating manner of prefatory discourse is too well known to work any surprizing effect in the authors behalf preface being become only ano shaftesbury   0   0 ther word to signify excuse besides that the author is generally the most straitend in that preliminary part which on other accounts is too apt to grow voluminous he therefore takes the advantage of his corollary or windingup and ends pathetically by endeavouring in the softest manner to reconcile his reader to those faults which he chuses rather to excuse than to amend general practice has made this a necessary part of elegance hardly to be passd over by any writer tis the chief stratagem by which he engages in personal conference with his reader and can talk immoderately of himself with all the seeming modesty of one who is the furthest from any selfish views or conceited thoughts of his own merit there appears such a peculiar grace and ingenuity in the method of confessing laziness precipitancy carelessness or whatever other vices have been the occasion of the authors deficiency that it woud seem a pity had the work itself been brought to such perfection as to have left no room for the penitent party to enlarge on his own demerits for from the multiplicity of these he finds subject to ingratiate himself with his reader who doubtless is not a little raisd by this submission of a confessing author and is ready on these shaftesbury   0      terms to give him absolution and receive him into his good grace and humour in the galante world indeed we easily find how far a humility of this kind prevails they who hope to rise by merit are likeliest to be disappointed in their pretensions the confessing lover who ascribes all to the bounty of the fairone meets his reward the sooner for having studyd less how to deserve it for merit is generally thought presumptuous and supposd to carry with it  0  a certain assurance and ease with which a mistress is not so well contented the claim of welldeserving seems to derogate from the pure grace and favour of the benefactrice who then appears to herself most sovereign in power and likeliest to be obeyd without reserve when she bestows her bounty where there is least title or pretension thus a certain adoration of the sex which passes in our age without the least charge of profaneness or idolatry may according to vulgar imagination serve to justify these galante votarys in the imitation of the real religious and devout the method of selfabasement may perhaps be thought the properest to make ap shaftesbury   0     proaches to the sacred shrines and the intire resignation of merit in each case may be esteemd the only ground of welldeserving but what we allow to heaven or to the fair shoud not methinks be made a precedent in favour of the world whatever deference is due to that body of men whom we call readers we may be supposd to treat em with sufficient honour if with thorow diligence and pains we endeavour to render our works perfect and leave em to judg of the performance as they are able however difficult or desperate it may appear in any artist to endeavour to bring perfection into his work if he has not at least the idea of perfection to give him aim he will be found very defective and mean in his performance tho his intention be to please the world he must nevertheless be in a manner above it and fix his eye upon that consummate grace that beauty of nature and that perfection of numbers which the rest of mankind feeling only by the effect whilst ignorant of the cause term the jenesçayquoy the unintelligible or the i know not what and suppose to be a kind of charm or inchantment of which the artist himself can give no account shaftesbury   0     but here i find i am tempted to do what i have myself condemnd hardly can i forbear making some apology for my frequent  0  recourse to the rules of common artists to the masters of exercise to the academys of painters statuarys and to the rest of the virtuosotribe but in this i am so fully satisfyd i have reason on my side that let custom be ever so strong against me i had rather repair to these inferior schools to search for truth and nature than to some other places where higher arts and sciences are professd i am persuaded that to be a virtuoso so far as befits a gentleman is a higher step towards the becoming a man of virtue and good sense than the being what in this age we call a scholar  0  for even rude nature itself in its primitive sim shaftesbury   0     plicity is a better guide to judgment than improvd sophistry and pedantick learning the faciunt nae intellegendo ut nihil intellegant will be ever applyd by men of discernment and free thought to such logick such principles such forms and rudiments of knowledg as are establishd in certain schools of literature and science the case is sufficiently understood even by those who are unwilling to confess the truth of it effects betray their causes and the known turn and figure of those understandings which sprout from nurserys of this kind give a plain idea of what is judgd on this occasion tis no wonder if after so shaftesbury   0      wrong a ground of education there appears to be such need of redress and amendment from that excellent school which we call the world the mere amusements of gentlemen are found more improving than the profound researches of pedants and in the management of our youth we are forcd to have recourse to the former as an antidote against the genius peculiar to the latter if the formalists of this sort were erected into patentees with a sole commission of authorship we shoud undoubtedly see such writing in our days as woud either wholly wean us from all books in general or at least from all such as were the product of our own nation under such a subordinate and conforming government shaftesbury   0     however this may prove there can be no kind of writing which relates to men and manners where it is not necessary for the author to understand poetical and moral truth the beauty of sentiments the sublime of characters and carry in his eye the model or exemplar of that natural grace which gives to every action its attractive charm if he has naturally no eye or ear for these interior numbers tis not likely he shoud be able to judg better of that exterior proportion and symmetry of composition which constitutes a legitimate piece  0  coud we once convince ourselves of what is in itself so evident that in the very nature of things there must of necessity be the foundation of a right and wrong taste as well in respect of inward characters and features as of outward person behaviour and action we shoud be far more ashamd of ignorance and wrong judgment in the former than in the latter of these subjects even in the arts which are mere imitations of that outward grace and beauty we not only confess a taste but make it a part of refind breeding to discover amidst the shaftesbury   0      many false manners and ill styles the true and natural one which represents the real beauty and †venus of the kind tis the like moral grace and venus which discovering itself in the turns of character and the variety of human affection is copyd by the writing artist if he knows not this venus these graces nor was ever struck with the beauty the decorum of this inward kind he can neither paint advantageously after the life nor in a feignd subject where he has full scope for ‡never can he on these terms represent merit and virtue or mark deformity and blemish never can he with justice and true proportion assign the boundarys of either part or separate the distant characters the schemes must be defective and the draughts confusd where the standard is weakly establishd and the measure out of use such a designer who has so little feeling of these proportions so little consciousness of this excellence or these perfections will never be found able to describe a perfect character or what is more according to art express the effect and force of this perfection from the result of various and mixt characters of life shaftesbury   0      and thus the sense of inward numbers the knowledg and practice of the social virtues and the familiarity and favour of the moral graces are essential to the character of a deserving artist and just favourite of the muses thus are the arts and virtues mutually friends and thus the science of virtuosos  0  and that of virtue itself become in a manner one and the same one who aspires to the character of a man of breeding and politeness is careful to form his judgment of arts and sciences upon right models of perfection if he travels to rome he inquires which are the truest pieces of architecture the best remains of statues the best paintings of a raphael or a carache however antiquated rough or dismal they may appear to him at first sight he resolves to view em over and over till he has brought himself to relish em and finds their hidden graces and perfections he takes particular care to turn his eye from every thing which is gaudy luscious and of a false taste nor is he less careful to turn his ear from every sort of musick besides that which is of the best manner and truest harmony twere to be wishd we had the same regard to a right taste in life and shaftesbury   0      manners what mortal being once convincd of a difference in inward character and of a preference due to one kind above another woud not be concernd to make his own the best if civility and humanity be a taste if brutality insolence riot be in the same manner a taste who if he coud reflect woud not chuse to form himself on the amiable and agreeable rather than the odious and perverse model who woud not endeavour to force nature as well in this respect as in what relates to a taste or judgment in other arts and sciences for in each place the force on nature is usd only for its redress if a natural good taste be not already formd in us why shoud not we endeavour to form it and become natural— i like i fansy i admire how by accident or as i please no but i learn to fansy to admire to please as the subjects themselves are deserving and can bear me out otherwise i like at this hour but dislike the next i shall be weary of my pursuit and upon experience find little pleasure in the main if my choice and judgment in it be from no other rule than that single one because shaftesbury   0   0   0  i please grotesque and monstrous figures often please cruel spectacles and barbaritys are also found to please and in some tempers to please beyond all other subjects but is this pleasure right and shall i follow it if it presents not strive with it or endeavour to prevent its growth or prevalency in my temper—how stands the case in a more soft and flattering kind of pleasure—effeminacy pleases me the indian figures the japanwork the enamel strikes my eye the luscious colours and glossy paint gain upon my fancy a french or flemish style is highly likd by me at first sight and i pursue my liking but what ensues—do i not for ever forfeit my good relish how is it possible i shoud thus come to taste the beautys of an italian master or of a hand happily formd on nature and the antients tis not by wantonness and humour that i shall attain my end and arrive at the enjoyment i propose the art itself is severe the rules rigid and shaftesbury   0      if i expect   0 the knowledg shoud come to me by accident or in play i shall be grosly deluded and prove myself at best a mockvirtuoso or mere pedant of the kind here therefore we have once again exhibited our moral science in the same method and manner of soliloquy as above to this correction of humour and formation of a taste our reading if it be of the right sort must principally contribute whatever company we keep shaftesbury   0      or however polite and agreeable their characters may be with whom we converse or correspond if the authors we read are of another kind we shall find our palat strangely turnd their way we are the unhappier in this respect for being scholars if our studys be ill chosen nor can i for this reason think it proper to call a man wellread who reads many authors since he must of necessity have more ill models than good and be more stuffd with bombast ill fancy and wry shaftesbury   0      thought than filld with solid sense and just imagination     but notwithstanding this hazard of our taste from a multiplicity of reading we are not it seems the least scrupulous in our choice of subject we read whatever comes next us what was first put into our hand when we were young serves us afterwards for serious study and wise research when we are old we are many of us indeed so grave as to continue this exercise of youth thro our remaining life the exercisingauthors of this kind have been above describd in the beginning of this treatise the manner of exercise is calld meditation and is of a sort so solemn and profound that we dare not so much as thorowly examine the subject on which we are bid to meditate this is a sort of taskreading in which a taste is not permitted how little soever we take of this diet tis sufficient to give full exercise to our grave humour and allay the appetite towards further research and solid contemplation the rest is holiday diversion play and fancy we reject all rule as thinking it an injury to our diversions to have regard to truth or nature without which however no shaftesbury   0     thing can be truly agreeable or entertaining much less instructive or improving thro a certain †surfeit taken in a wrong kind of serious reading we apply ourselves with full content to the most ridiculous the more remote our pattern is from any thing moral or profitable the more freedom and satisfaction we find in it we care not how gothick or barbarous our models are what illdesignd or monstrous figures we view or what false proportions we trace or see describd in history romance or fiction and thus our eye and ear is lost our relish or taste must of necessity grow barbarous whilst barbarian customs savage manners indian wars and wonders of the terra incognita employ our leisure hours and are the chief materials to furnish out a library these are in our present days what books of chivalry were in those of our forefathers i know not what faith our valiant ancestors may have had in the storys of their giants their dragons and     st georges but for our faith indeed as well as our taste in this other way of reading i must confess i cant consider it without astonishment shaftesbury   0     it must certainly be something else than incredulity which fashions the taste and judgment of many gentlemen whom we hear censurd as atheists for attempting to philosophize after a newer manner than any known of late for my own part i have ever thought this sort of men to be in general more credulous tho after another manner than the mere vulgar besides what i have observd in conversation with the men of this character i can produce many anathematizd authors who if they want a true israelitish faith can make amends by a chinese or indian one if they are short in syria or the palestine they have their full measure in america or japan historys of incas or iroquois written by fryers and missionarys pirates and renegades seacaptains and trusty travellers pass for authentick records and are canonical with the virtuosos of this sort tho christian miracles may not so well satisfy em they dwell with the highest contentment on the prodigys of moorish and pagan countrys they have far more pleasure in hearing the monstrous accounts of monstrous men and manners than the politest and best narrations of the affairs the governments and lives of the wisest and most polishd people shaftesbury   0     tis the same taste which makes us prefer a turkish history to a grecian or a roman an ariosto to a virgil and a romance or novel to an iliad we have no regard to the character or genius of our author nor are so far curious as to observe how able he is in the judgment of facts or how ingenious in the texture of his lyes for facts unably related tho with the greatest sincerity and good faith may prove the worst sort of deceit and mere lyes judiciously composd can teach us the truth of things beyond any other manner but to amuse ourselves with such authors as     neither know how to lye nor tell truth discovers a taste which methinks one shoud not be apt to envy yet so enchanted we are with the travelling memoirs of any casual adventurer that be his character or genius what it will we have no sooner turnd over a page or two than we begin to interest ourselves highly in his affairs no sooner has he taken shipping at the mouth of the thames or sent his baggage before him to gravesend or buoy in the nore than strait our atten shaftesbury   0     tion is earnestly taken up if in order to his more distant travels he takes some part of europe in his way we can with patience hear of inns and ordinarys passageboats and ferrys foul and fair weather with all the particulars of the authors diet habit of body his personal dangers and mischances on land and sea and thus full of desire and hope we accompany him till he enters on his great scene of action and begins by the description of some enormous fish or beast from monstrous brutes he proceeds to yet more monstrous men for in this race of authors he is ever compleatest and of the first rank who is able to speak of things the most unnatural and monstrous this humour our old tragick poet seems to have discoverd he hit our taste in giving us a moorish hero full fraught with prodigy a wondrous storyteller but for the attentive part the poet chose to give it to womankind what passionate reader of travels or student in the prodigious sciences can refuse to pity that fair lady who fell in love with the miraculous moor especially considering with what sutable grace such a lover coud relate the most monstrous adventures and satisfy the wondring appetite shaftesbury   0      with the most wondrous tales wherein says the herotraveller   of antars vast and desarts idle   it was my hint to speak   and of the cannibals that each other eat   the anthropophagie and men whose heads   do grow beneath their shoulders these to hear   woud desdemona seriously incline     seriously twas a woful tale unfit one woud think to win a tender fairone its true the poet sufficiently condemns her fancy and makes her poor lady pay dearly for it in the end but why amongst his greek names he shoud have chosen one which denoted the lady superstitious i cant imagine unless as poets are sometimes prophets too he shoud figuratively under this dark type have represented to us that about a hundred years after his time the fair sex of this island shoud by other monstrous tales be so seducd as to turn their favour chiefly on the persons of the taletellers and change their natural inclination for fair candid and courteous knights into a passion for a mysterious race of black enchanters such as of old were said to creep into houses and lead captive silly women shaftesbury   0     tis certain there is a very great affinity between the passion of superstition and that of tales the love of strange narrations and the ardent appetite towards unnatural objects has a near alliance with the like appetite towards the supernatural kind such as are calld prodigious and of dire omen for so the mind forebodes on every such unusual sight or hearing fate destiny or the anger of heaven seems denoted and as it were delineated by the monstrous birth the horrid fact or dire event for this reason the very persons of such relators or taletellers with a small help of dismal habit sutable countenance and tone become sacred and tremendous in the eyes of mortals who are thus addicted from their youth the tender virgins losing their natural softness assume this tragick passion of which they are highly susceptible especially when a sutable kind of eloquence and action attends the character of the narrator a thousand desdemonas are then ready to present themselves and woud frankly resign fathers relations countrymen and country itself to follow the fortunes of a hero of the black tribe but whatever monstrous zeal or superstitious passion the poet might fore shaftesbury   0   0 tel either in the gentlemen ladys or common people of an after age tis certain that as to books the same moorish fancy in its plain and literal sense prevails strongly at this present     time monsters and monsterlands were never more in request and we may often see a philosopher or a wit run a talegathering in those idle desarts as familiarly as the silliest woman or merest boy one woud imagine that our philosophical writers who pretend to treat shaftesbury   0      of morals shoud far outdo mere poets in recommending     virtue and representing what was fair and amiable in human shaftesbury   0      actions one woud imagine that if they turnd their eye     towards remote countrys of which they affect so much to speak they shoud search for that simplicity of manners and innocence of behaviour which has been often known among mere savages ere they were corrupted by our commerce and by sad example instructed in all kinds of treachery and inhumanity twoud be of advantage to us to hear the causes of this strange corruption in ourselves and be made to consider of our deviation from nature and from that just purity of manners which might be expected especially from a people so assisted and enlightend by religion for who woud not naturally expect more justice fidelity temperance and honesty from christians than from mahometans or mere pagans but so far are our modern moralists from condemning any unnatural vices or corrupt manners whether in our own or foreign climates that they woud have vice itself appear as natural as virtue and from the worst examples woud represent to us that all actions are naturally indifferent that they have no note or character of good or ill in themselves but are distinguishd by mere fashion law or arbitrary decree wonderful philosophy raisd from the dregs of an illiterate mean shaftesbury   0      kind which was ever despisd among the great antients and rejected by all men of action or sound erudition but in these ages imperfectly copyd from the original and with much disadvantage imitated and assumd in common both by devout and indevout attempters in the moral kind shoud a writer upon musick addressing himself to the students and lovers of the art declare to em that the measure or rule of harmony was caprice or will humour or fashion tis not very likely he shoud be heard with great attention or treated with real gravity for harmony is harmony by nature let men     judg ever so ridiculously of musick so is symmetry and proportion founded still in nature let mens fancy prove ever so barbarous or their fashions ever so gothick in their architecture sculpture or whatever other designing art tis the same case where life and manners are concernd virtue has the same fixd standard the same numbers harmony and proportion will have place in morals and are discoverable in the characters and affections of mankind in which are laid the just foundations of an art and science superior to every other of human practice and comprehension shaftesbury   0     this i suppose therefore is highly necessary that a writer shoud comprehend for things are stubborn and will not be as we fansy em or as the fashion varys but as they stand in nature now whether the writer be poet philosopher or of whatever kind he is in truth no other than a copist after nature his style may be differently suted to the different times he lives in or to the different humour of his age or nation his manner his dress his colouring may vary but if his drawing be uncorrect or his design contrary to nature his piece will be found ridiculous when it comes thorowly to be examind for nature will not be mockd the prepossession against her can never be very lasting her decrees and instincts are powerful and her sentiments inbred she has a strong party abroad and as strong a one within ourselves and when any slight is put upon her she can soon turn the reproach and make large reprisals on the taste and judgment of her antagonists whatever philosopher critick or author is convincd of this prerogative of nature will easily be persuaded to apply himself to the great work of reforming his taste which he will have reason to suspect if he be not such a one as has deliberately endeavourd to frame it by the just shaftesbury   0      standard of nature whether this be his case he will easily discover by appealing to his memory for custom and fashion are powerful seducers and he must of necessity have fought hard against these to have attaind that justness of taste which is requird in one who pretends to follow nature but if no     such conflict can be calld to mind tis a certain token that the party has his taste very little different from the vulgar and on this account he shoud instantly betake himself to the wholesom practice recommended in this treatise he shoud set afoot the powerfullest facultys of his mind and assemble the best forces of his wit and judgment in order to make a formal descent on the territorys of the heart resolving to decline no combat nor hearken to any terms till he had piercd into its inmost provinces and reachd the seat of empire no treatys shoud amuse him no advantages lead him aside all other speculations shoud be suspended all other mysterys resignd till this necessary campaign was made and these inward conflicts learnt by which he woud be able to gain at least some tolerable insight into himself and knowledg of his own natural principles it may here perhaps be thought that notwithstanding the particular ad shaftesbury   0     vice we have given in relation to the forming of a taste in natural characters and manners we are still defective in our performance whilst we are silent on supernatural cases and bring not into our consideration the manners and characters deliverd us in holy writ but this objection will soon vanish when we consider that there can be no rules given by human wit to that which was never humanly conceivd but divinely dictated and inspird for this reason twoud be in vain for any poet or ingenious author to form his characters after the models of our sacred penmen and whatever certain criticks may have advancd concerning the structure of a heroick poem of this kind i will be bold to prophesy that the success will never be answerable to expectation it must be ownd that in our sacred history we have both leaders conquerors founders of nations deliverers and patriots who even in a human sense are noway behind the chief of those so much celebrated by the antients there is nothing in the story of aeneas which is not equald or exceeded by a joshua or   0 a moses but as illustrious as are the acts of these sacred chiefs twoud be shaftesbury   0      hard to copy them in just heroick twoud be hard to give to many of em that grateful air which is necessary to render em naturally pleasing to mankind according to the idea men are universally found to have of heroism and generosity notwithstanding the pious endeavours which as devout christians we may have usd in order to separate ourselves from the interests of mere heathens and infidels notwithstanding the true pains we may have taken to arm our hearts in behalf of a chosen people against their neighbouring nations of a false religion and worship there will be still found such a partiality remaining in us towards creatures of the same make and figure with ourselves as will hinder us from viewing with satisfaction the punishments inflicted by human hands on such aliens and idolaters in mere poetry and the pieces of wit and literature there is a liberty of thought and easiness of humour indulgd to us in which perhaps we are not so well able to contemplate the divine judgments and see clearly into the justice of those ways which are declared to be so far from our ways and above our highest thoughts or understandings in such a situation of mind we can hardly endure to see heathen shaftesbury   0      treated as heathen and the faithful made the executioners of the divine wrath there is a certain perverse humanity in us which inwardly resists the divine commission tho ever so plainly reveald the wit of the best poet is not sufficient to reconcile us to the campaign of a joshua or the retreat of a moses by the assistance of an egyptian loan nor will it be possible by the muses art to make that royal hero appear amiable in human eyes who found such favour in the eye of heaven such are mere human hearts that they can hardly find the least sympathy with that only one which had the character of being after the pattern of the almightys tis apparent therefore that the manners actions and characters of sacred writ are in no wise the proper subject of other authors than divines themselves they are matters incomprehensible in philosophy they are above the pitch of the mere human historian the politician or the moralist and are too sacred to be     submitted to the poets fancy when inspird by no other spirit than that of his profane mistresses the muses i shoud be unwilling to examine rigorously the performance of our great poet shaftesbury   0      who sung so piously the fall of man the war in heaven and the catastrophe of that original pair from whom the generations of mankind were propagated are matters so abstrusely reveald and with such a resemblance of mythology that they can more easily bear what figurative construction or fantastick turn the poet may think fit to give em but shoud he venture farther into the lives and characters of the patriarchs the holy matrons heroes and heroines of the chosen seed shoud he employ the sacred machine the exhibitions and interventions of divinity according to holy writ to support the action of his piece he woud soon find the weakness of his pretended orthodox muse and prove how little those divine patterns were capable of human imitation or of being raisd to any other majesty or sublime than that in which they originally appear the theology or theogony of the heathens coud admit of such different turns and figurative expressions as suted the fancy and judgment of each philosopher or poet but the purity of our faith will admit of no such variation the christian theology the birth procedure generation and personal distinction of the divinity are mysterys only to be determind by the initiated or or shaftesbury   0   0 daind to whom the state has assignd the guardianship and promulgation of the divine oracles it becomes not those who are uninspird from heaven and uncommissiond from earth to search with curiosity into the original of those holy rites and records by law establishd should we make such an attempt we should in probability find the less satisfaction the further we presumd to carry our speculations having dard once to quit the authority and direction of the law we shoud easily be subject to heterodoxy and error when we had no better warrant left us for the authority of our sacred symbols than the integrity candour and disinterestedness of their compilers and registers how     great that candour and disinterestedness may have been we have no other historys to inform us than those of their own licensing or composing but busy persons who officiously search into these records are ready even from hence to draw proofs very disadvantageous to the fame and character of this succession of men and persons moderately read in these historys are apt to judg no otherwise of the temper of antient councils than by that of later synods and modern convocations when we add to this the melancholy consideration of what disturbances have shaftesbury   0      been raisd from the disputes of this kind what effusion of blood what devastations of provinces what shock and ruin of empires have been occasiond by controversys founded on the nicest distinction of an article relating to these mysterys twill be judgd vain in any poet or polite author to think of rendring himself agreeable or entertaining whilst he makes such subjects as these to be his theme but tho the explanation of such deep mysterys and religious dutys be allotted as the peculiar province of the sacred order tis presumd nevertheless that it may be lawful for other authors to retain their antient privilege of instructing mankind in a way of pleasure and entertainment poets may be allowd their fictions and philosophers their systems twoud go hard with mankind shoud the patentees for religion be commissiond for all instruction and advice relating to manners or conversation the stage may be allowd to instruct as well as the pulpit the way of wit and humour may be serviceable as well as that of gravity and seriousness and the way of plain reason as well as that of exalted revelation the main matter is to keep these provinces distinct and settle their just boundarys and on this account it is that we have en shaftesbury   0     deavourd to represent to modern authors the necessity of making this separation justly and in due form twould be somewhat hard methinks if religion as by law establishd were not allowd the same privilege as heraldry tis     agreed on all hands that particular persons may design or paint in their private capacity after what manner they think fit but they must blazon only as the publick directs their lion or bear must be figurd as the science appoints and their supporters and crest must be such as their wise and gallant ancestors have procurd for em no matter whether the shapes of these animals hold just proportion with nature no matter tho different or contrary forms are joind in one that which is denyd to painters or poets is permitted to heralds naturalists may in their separate and distinct capacity inquire as they think fit into the real existence and natural truth of things but they must by no means dispute the authorizd forms mermaids and griffins were the wonder of our forefathers and as such deliverd down to us by the authentick traditions and delineations abovementiond we ought not so much as to criticize the features or di shaftesbury   0     mensions of a saracens face brought by our conquering ancestors from the holy wars nor pretend to call in question the figure or size of a dragon on which the history of our national champion and the establishment of a high order and dignity of the realm depends but as worshipful as are the persons of the illustrious heralds clarencieux garter and the rest of those eminent sustainers of british honour and antiquity tis to be hopd that in a more civilizd age such as at present we have the good fortune to live in they will not attempt to strain their privileges to the same height as formerly having been reducd by law or settled practice from the power they once enjoyd they will not tis presumd in defiance of the magistrate and civil power erect anew their stages and lists introduce the manner of civil combat set us to tilt and turnament and raise again those defiances and mortal frays of which their order were once the chief managers and promoters to conclude the only method which can justly qualify us for this high privilege of giving advice is in the first place to receive it ourselves with due submission where the publick has shaftesbury   0      vouchsafd to give it us by authority and if in our private capacity     we can have resolution enough to criticize ourselves and call in question our high imaginations florid desires and specious sentiments according to the manner of soliloquy above prescribd we shall by the natural course of things as we grow wiser prove less conceited and

brutus thrasea and helvidius and such there may have lately been and are still perhaps in our own age tho envy suffers not the few examples of this kind to be remarkd in publick the authors meaning is indeed so plain of itself that it needs no explanatory apology to satisfy an impartial reader as for others who object the singularity of the assertion as differing they suppose from what our reverend doctors in religion commonly maintain they may read what the learned and pious bishop taylor says in his treatise of friendship you inquire says he how far a dear and a perfect friendship is authorizd by the principles of christianity to this i answer that the word friendship in the sense we commonly mean by it is not so much as namd in the new testament and our religion takes no notice of it you think it strange but read on before you spend so much as the beginning of a passion or a wonder upon it there is mention of friendship of the world and it is said to be enmity with god but the word is no where else namd or to any other purpose in all the new testament it speaks of friends often but by friends are meant our acquaintance or our kindred the relatives of our family or our fortune or our sect c—and i think i have reason to be confident that the word friend speaking of human intercourse is no otherways usd in the gospels or epistles or acts of the apostles and afterwards christian charity says he is friendship to all the world and when friendships were the noblest things in the world charity was little like the sun drawn in at a chink or his beams drawn into the center of a burningglass but christian charity is friendship expanded like the face of the sun when it mounts above the eastern hills in reality the good bishop draws all his notions as well as examples of private friendship from the heathen world or from the times preceding christianity and after citing a greek author he immediately adds of such immortal abstracted pure friendships indeed there is no great plenty but they who are the same to their friend ἀπόπροθεν at a distance when he is in another country or in another world are fit to preserve the sacred fire for eternal sacrifices and to perpetuate the memory of those exemplary friendships of the best men which have filld the world with history and wonder for in no other sense but this can it be true that friendships are pure loves regarding to do good more than to receive it he that is a friend after death hopes not for a recompence from his friend and makes no bargain either for fame or love but is rewarded with the conscience

commentators it being remarkable withal that in this early satir of horace before his latter days and when his philosophy as yet inclind to the less rigid assertors of virtue he puts this expression

properly belongd for so the poet again sat   v    uses the word sensus speaking of those who without sense of manners or common society without the least respect or deference to others press rudely

understanding to which the κοινονοημοσύνη common sensibility seems to have relation is of a different meaning but they will consider withal how small the distinction was in that philosophy between the ὑπόληψις conjecture and the vulgar αἴσθησις perception how generally passion was by those philosophers brought under the head of opinion and when they consider besides this the very formation of the

glance as the great master of arts calls it in his poeticks ch    but particularly ch   where he shews that the τὸ καλὸν the beautiful or the sublime in these abovementiond arts is from the expression of greatness with order that is to say exhibiting the principal or main of what is designd in the very largest proportions in which it is capable of being viewd for when it is gigantick tis in a manner out of sight and can be no way comprehended in that simple and united view as on the contrary when a piece is of the miniaturekind when it runs into the detail and nice delineation of every little particular tis as it were invisible for the same reason because the summary beauty the whole itself cannot be comprehended in that one united view which is broken and lost by the necessary attraction of the eye to every small and subordinate part in a poetick system the same regard must be had to the memory as in painting to the eye the dramatick kind is confind within the convenient and proper time of a spectacle the epick is left more at large each work however must aim at vastness and be as great and of as long duration as possible but so as to be comprehended as to the main of it by one easy glance or retrospect of memory and this the philosopher calls accordingly the τὸ εὐμνημόνευτον the beautiful i cannot better translate the passage than as i have done in these explanatory lines for besides what relates to mere art the philosophical sense of the original is so majestick and the whole treatise so masterly that when i find even the latin interpreters come so short i shoud be vain to attempt any thing in our own language i woud only add a small remark of my own which may perhaps be noticd by the studiers of statuary and painting that the greatest of the antient as well as modern artists were ever inclind to follow this rule of the philosopher and when they errd in their designs or draughts it was on the side of greatness by running into the unsizable

strabo can we possibly imagine that the genius power and excellence of a real poet consists in aught else than the just imitation of life in formd discourse and numbers but how shoud he be that just imitator of life whilst he himself knows not its measures nor how to guide himself by judgment and understanding for we have not surely the same notion of the poets excellence as of the ordinary craftsmans the subject of whose art is sensless stone or timber without life dignity or beauty whilst the poets art turning principally on men and manners he has his virtue and excellence as poet

is the diction which is made up of usual words but it is mean    that is majestic and free from commonplace which uses strange words by strange i mean outoftheway words or metaphorical or extended in usage in fact all which are unusual but if a man compose in such words only his composition will be either a riddle or gibberish if he compose in metaphors a riddle if in outoftheway words gibberish too this the same mastercritick explains further in his rhetoricks lib   cap   where he refers to these passages of his poeticks ἐπεὶ δὲ οἱ ποιηταὶ λέγοντες εὐήθη διὰ τὴν λέξιν ἐδόκουν πορίσασθαι τήνδε τὴν δόξαν διὰ του̑το ποιητικὴ πρώτη ἐγένετο λέξις    καὶ νυ̑ν ἔτι οἱ πολλοὶ τω̑ν ἀπαιδεύτων τοὺς τοιούτους οἴονται διαλέγεσθαι κάλλιστα του̑το δ οὐκ ἔστιν    οὐδὲ γὰρ οἱ τὰς τραγῳδίας ποιου̑ντες

to have acquired a reputation through their style the first rhetorical style was poetic in character     and even now most uneducated men think that speakers of that sort speak best but this is not so    for not even writers of tragedy use it any longer in the same way but just as they changed from tetrameter to iambic metre because the latter is the metre most like prose so too they have abandoned such terms as are alien to the style of conversation    and even the writers of hexameters have abandoned them so it is absurd to copy men who themselves no longer follow this fashion that among the early reformers of this bombastick manner he places homer as the chief we may see easily in his poeticks as particularly in that passage cap    ἔτι τὰς διανοίας καὶ τὴν λέξιν ἔχειν καλω̑ς οι̑ς ἅπασιν ὅμηρος κέχρηται καὶ πρω̑τος καὶ ἱκανω̑ς    πρὸς δὲ τούτοις λέξει καὶ διανοίᾳ πάντας ὑπερβέβληκε further the thoughts and the diction must be well chosen in all these points homer set and well set the example    moreover he exceeds all in diction and thought  γενομένης οὐ̑ν ἀπ ἀρχη̑ς αὐτοσχεδιαστικη̑ς καὶ αὐτὴ καὶ ἡ κωμῳδια c both tragedy and comedy were at first improvisations merely de poet cap   when he has compard both this and tragedy together he recapitulates in his next chapter αἱ μὲν οὐ̑ν τη̑ς τραγῳδίας μεταβάσεις καὶ δἰ ών ἐγένοντο οὐ λελήθασιν ἡ δὲ κωμῳδία διὰ τὸ μὴ σποθδάζεσθαι ἐξ

unnoticed for only late did the archon grant a comic chorus etc cap   see vol iii p     in the notes † καὶ πολλὰς μεταβολὰς μεταβαλου̑σα ἡ τραγῳδία ἐπαύσατο ἐπεὶ ἔσχε τὴν ἑαυτη̑ς φύσιν c and tragedy ceased making many changes since it had its own nature cap   so true a prophet as well as critick was this great man for by the event it appeard that tragedy being raisd to its height by sophocles and euripides and no room left for further excellence or emulation there were no more tragick poets besides these endurd after the authors time whilst comedy went on improving still to the second and third degree tragedy finishd its course under euripides whom tho our great author criticizes with the utmost severity in his poeticks yet he plainly enough confesses to have carryd the style of tragedy to its full height and dignity for as to the reformation which that poet made in the use of the sublime and figurative speech in general see what our discerning author says in his rhetoricks where he strives to shew the impertinence and nauseousness of the florid speakers and such as understood not the use of the simple and natural manner the just masters and right managers of the poetick or high style shoud learn says he how to conceal the manner as much as possible διὸ δει̑ λανθάνειν ποιου̑ντας καὶ μὴ δοκει̑ν λέγειν πεπλασμένως ἀλλὰ πεφυκότως του̑το γὰρ πιθανόν ἐκει̑νο δὲ τοὐναντίον

the voice of theodorus as compared with that of other actors for his seemed the very voice of the character theirs foreign to it the trick is successfully performed if a man make up his diction by choosing from ordinary conversation euripedes does this and first gave the suggestion rhet lib   cap    ὥσπερ δὲ καὶ τὰ σπουδαι̑α μάλιστα ποιητὴς ὅμηρος ἠ̑ν μόνος γὰρ οὐχ ὅτι εὐ̑ ἀλλ ὅτι καὶ μιμήσεις

concise way ignotum genus it lay in a kind of chaos intermixd with other kinds and hardly distinguishable by its gravity and pomp from the humours which gave rise afterwards to comedy but in a strict historical sense as we find plato speaking in his minos tragedy was of antienter date and even of the very antientest with the athenians his words are ἡ δὲ τραγῳδία ἐστι παλαιὸν ἐνθάδε οὐχ ὡς οἴονται

distributed our ingenious and noble youths shoud obtain the full advantage of a just and liberal education by uniting the scholarpart with that of the real gentleman and man of breeding academys for exercises so useful to the publick and essential in the formation of a genteel and liberal character are unfortunately neglected letters are indeed banishd i know not where in distant cloisters and unpractisd cells as our poet has it confind to the commerce and mean fellowship of bearded boys the sprightly arts and sciences are severd from philosophy which consequently must grow dronish insipid pedantick useless and directly opposite to the real knowledg and practice of the world and mankind our youth accordingly seem to have their only chance between two widely different roads either that of pedantry and schoollearning which lies amidst the dregs and most corrupt part of antient literature or that of the fashionable illiterate world which aims merely at the character of the fine gentleman and takes up with the foppery of modern languages and foreign wit the frightful aspect of the former of these roads makes the journey appear desperate and impracticable hence that aversion so generally conceivd against a learned character wrong turnd and hideously set out under such difficultys and in such seeming labyrinths and mysterious forms as if a homer or a xenophon imperfectly learnt in raw years might not afterwards in a riper age be studyd as well in a capital city and amidst the world as at a college or countrytown or as if a plutarch a tully or a horace coud not

their debt to those great masters but for the rest who draw from another fountain as the italian authors in particular they may be reckond no better than the corrupters of true learning and erudition

had amulius a severe and serious painter    he used only to paint a few hours a day but that very seriously for he always wore full dress even on his scaffolding—pliny h n xxxv cc     0    –    one of the mortal symptoms upon which pliny pronounces the sure death of this noble art not long survivor to him was what belongd in common to all the other perishing arts after the fall of liberty i mean the luxury of the roman court and the change of taste and manners naturally consequent to such a change of government and dominion this excellent learned and polite critick represents to us the false taste springing from the court itself and from that opulence splendor and affectation of magnificence and expence proper to the place thus in the statuary and architecture then in vogue nothing coud be admird beside what was costly in the mere matter or substance of the work precious rock rich metal glittering stones and other luscious ware poisonous to art came every day more into request and were imposd as necessary materials on the best masters twas in favour of these courtbeautys and gaudy appearances that all good drawing just design and truth of work began to be despisd care was taken to procure from distant parts the most gorgeous splendid colours of the most costly growth or composition not such as had been usd by apelles and the great masters who are justly severe loyal and faithful to their art this newer colouring our critick calls the florid kind the materials were too rich to be furnishd by the painter but were bespoke or furnishd at the cost of the person who employd him quos dominus pingenti praestat the other he calls the austere kind and thus says he rerum non animi pretiis excubatur the cost and not the life and art is studyd he shews on the contrary what care apelles took to subdue the florid colours by a darkening varnish ut eadem res says he nimis floridis coloribus austeritatem occultè daret and he says just before of some of the finest pieces of apelles that they were wrought in four colours only so great and venerable was simplicity held among the antients and so certain was the ruin of all true elegance in life or art where this mistress

their own characters arrian writes that the very old wise man epictetus has accused of impiety against the gods men who in their study of philosophy the narrating capacity disdained the care of speech

hear the golden voice not less remarkable was the prophecy of the very distinguished philosopher synesius proven by a sad event which much earlier was announced by that very man when he saw that the science of these studies was being undermined in a similar way by his own contemporaries he announced this prophecy just as if it were fate opposing the sort of men who would bring to the study of the most sacred theology silliness and sophistry in the place of genuine scholarship the danger is that having fallen into an abyss of nonsense they are utterly destroyed there is a danger lest men of this sort having sunk deeply into an abyss one might say of absurdities might mislead would this prophecy had failed to be creditable but certainly the invasions of the goths and scythians indeed offered an occasion for this corruption of both the queen of sciences which come to pass later but the cause of this is more recent and is the true one the perverted system of studies both in a distorted education in the liberal disciplines and the ignorance of languages and at the same time of the whole body of better literature but certainly great men have not to this end transmitted both the precepts and examples of virtues committed to memory so that we would learn these things for the vain delight of ears or the empty boasting of useless pedantry doubtless the seeds of moral goodness and honor which although we had received them from nature but nevertheless surrounded by vices and very nearly obscured lie hidden in our minds just as if remotely buried in a deep ditch unless a better cultivation should occur so that they might stir us in our night labors to excavate them and present them in public actions for this purpose so many men scrutinize those volumes which the philosophers have made about moral training the majority of greek and latin poets stretch their hands to the same place but by different paths for how many kinds of poets there are moreover there
