memoirs of the court of france and city of paris containing the intrigues of that court and the characters of the ministers of state and other officers together with the occurrences of the town  in two parts  translated from the french  london printed for jacob tonson at graysinngate and george strahan at the golden ball in cornhil mdccii  memoirs of the court of france and of the city of paris part i it was soon after the treaty with the duke of savoy that i came to the french court the king found it convenient to conclude a peace with that prince thereby to ease himself of so expensive and troublesome a war as that had proved which he had been obliged to maintain on that side this great monarch who having once put an end to the civil wars which were raised in his kingdom while he was under age had been so successful in his undertakings that he was looked on as a prince whom providence designed to raise above all others found himself on a sudden in danger of being cast down from his greatest height of grandeur all europe being united against him and king william who is now in possession of the throne of england having been invited thither by some of that kingdom to deliver them from the apprehensions they were under that their religion laws and privileges were in danger from the measures taken by king james and his ministers engaged so many princes in his interests by his prudent conduct that in a short time he formed a very considerable league and put himself at the head of so many forces that he was in a condition to put a stop to his most christian majestys formidable power under which every thing had bowed before so that by a viissitude frequent enough in governments one descended of william of nassaw preserved the house of austria from its utter ruin the beginnings of which were owing to his illustrious predecessor yet nothing in all this war created more trouble to the king than the duke of savoys declaring against him he had often endeavored to take him off from the confederates but could not prevail the mareshal de catinat who commanded his majestys army in italy and who is as well qualified for negociations of state as for the business of war was more successful than others had been he sent the count de tesse lieutenant general of the kings armies to turin with instructions suitable to those he had himself received from court and that he might be the better heard his majesty added so many troops to his army under the mareshals command that he made it much superior to the duke of savoys he had two reasons for doing this one was that thereby he might make the duke sensible of the mischiefs he was capable of doing him and the other was that he might not be afraid of the foreign troops which he had called to his assistance who might have offered to prescribe to him if they had been equal to the united forces of france and savoy the advantageous proposals that were offered to the duke made him hearken to an accommodation by one of the articles of this treaty the princess of savoy was to be given in marriage to the duke of burgundy so soon as she was full twelve years of age until which time she was to be educated in france for as yet she wanted fifteen or sixteen months of it and the king engaged to give two dukes and peers of france to remain hostages in savoy till the marriage should be accomplished the king made choice of the dukes de froix and de choiseul to go there as the two hostages and gave each of them   000 livers to defray the expense of their journey the duchess du lude was appointed lady of honor to this princess the duchess d arpajou expected to have had the honor of this charge because she had it under the dauphiness and she was so vexed at the disappointment that in a short time she fell into an apoplexy which obliged her to go to the waters of bourbon though the season in which they are usually taken was already past but it is now believed they are good for that disease at any time of the year and therefore no regard is had to any particular season the king appointed also six dames du palais one of which was the countess de roucy who is this dutchesss daughter upon which account it was thought that the kings having neglected her self would not affect her any more but as we always prefer our own interests to that of others she was much more sensible of the affront which she thought was put upon her self than of the honor which was done to her daughter it is but of late that the duchess du lude could reasonably hope to have been so fortunate for she was not much in favor at court nor of the number of those ladies who are allowed to go to marli and the first time she went there it cost her  000 crowns to the princess d harcourt who makes money of every thing and who procured her that favor she had some difficulty to furnish the money yet she has reason to be wellpleased that she employed it that way for she has thereby had opportunities to act her part so well that she is got much into the kings favor and into the favor of those in whom he has the greatest confidence after she was named to her charge she took journey very soon for poutbeauvoisin which separates france from the dominions of savoy at which place she was to receive the princess of savoy the countess de roucy went thither also with the other five dames du palais whom the king had named the marquess de dangeau who had better fortune than the duchess d arpajou for he was named gentleman of honor to the young princess which was the very charge he had with the late dauphiness went also to meet her with the other officers of her household whom the king had named the count de tesse who was made her first master of horse as a reward of the good services he had done at the treaty would have much rather chosen to have been gentleman of honor the king had some time before granted the marquess de dangeau the great privilege of the order of st lazarus which the count de tesse thought was a sufficient reward and that nothing more was designed for him but he soon found his mistake yet he has no reason to complain of his own fortune for he is one of those whom the court has used with the greatest kindness yea i may add that he is even overburthend with its favors for in a short space of time he was made governor of ypres knight of the holy ghost colonel general of the dragoons lieutenant general of the kings armies and first gentleman of the horse to the duchess of burgundy this might seem strange but that we often see when a courtier has once got much into favor the king is so lavish in bestowing honors and preferments upon him that one would think he was to keep none in reserve for others  some days after this the princess of savoy took her journey from turin for pontbeauvoisin where her lady of honor waited for her with the kings coaches they whom the duke of savoy sent along with her to be her convoy took leave of her at that place and when she had come as far as lions the duchess du lude made her stay a while there as well to refresh her after the fatigue of her journey as to satisfy the curiosity of the people who were passionately desirous to see her after which she set forward in her journey for fountainbleau where the court was at that time the king went as far as montargis to meet her for he knew what day she was to be there the dauphin went along with his majesty as did also the duke and duchess of orleans and having lodged there that night they came to nemours next day to dinner where the duke of burgundy waited for them they were then within four leagues of fountainbleau which they easily reached before night the princess was then but a very child yet the king was so taken with her that he stayed full four hours in company with her at montargis the duke and duchess of savoy had taught her so well her lesson that she seemed to have wit and sense much above her age the court began now to consider what name or title should be given her whether they should call her duchess of burgundy or princess of savoy the king inclined to the first though she was not to be married for some considerable time his reason was that that title would give her the precedence of all the princesses of the blood without giving them any reason to complain but the duke of savoy requested the king that she might retain her own title till she was married to the duke of burgundy he thought perhaps thereby to find a precedent for him and his family henceforth to claim precedence at the french court for he knew well enough that whatever title they gave her she should always take the door of all the ladies about the court and it seems he knew that when one of his ancestors was in france in the time of henry iv and disputed for place with henry de bourbon prince of conde at the door of the kings antichamber the king took the prince by the hand and made him enter first and to mortify the duke of savoy yet farther he told him that he knew not what he meant in offering to vie with a prince who might one day be his master  however the present duke of savoy having requested the king that his daughters title might be continued till the marriage the king held a council with his ministers that he might know what was fittest to be done on that occasion they fell upon a middleway which was to call her neither duthess of burgundy nor princess of savoy but only the princess without adding any more and thus she was always called till the day of her marriage in the mean time it was ordered that she should have the precedence of all the princesses of the blood as being the presumptive wife of the duke of burgundy the king caused her to be entertained with diversions suitable to her age and monsieur l abbee de choisi finding it was become fashionable to be employed in something relating to the young princess thought that he should make his court wonderfully well by writing a narrative of every thing that had befallen her since she parted from tarin when this book came first abroad some people got into an humor of commending it highly in all companies as the finest piece that had appeared of a long time but if they had been asked what they found in it that made them boast so much of it they had been puzzled to tell what it was the more ingenuous and frank sort of people spoke quite otherwise of it and instead of calling it so fine a piece they owned plainly that it was good for nothing monsieur l abbee who sets up for an ingenious writer was extremely vexed at this but all those who are looked upon as the best judges agreeing in the same opinion his book was by common consent condemned for waste paper to be sent to the grocers shops  before i proceed farther i beg leave to make a short digression concerning this author he lost once fifty lowis d ors at game with that handsome lady madam fresnoi and having no ready money she trusted him for some time but at last sent to ask it of him he sent her instead of her money a copy of some books he had written telling her at the same time that if she longed for the money because without it she had not wherewith to divert her self at game as she had told him in her note to him she might divert her self with those books till such time as he could satisfy her with money the lady looked upon this as a new way of paying debts but it tempted her to write books as well as others that by her own compositions she might satisfy her creditors when they asked money of her  but to return to my subject the duke of savoy was not at all well pleased that his daughter had only the title of princess without having that of savoy added to it but if he could not have his ambition satisfied in this matter he tried to have it in another he caused a latin inscription to be set up importing that after he had enlarged the bounds of his dominions and recovered the keys of italy he had shut up the temple of janus it cannot be said that there was any manifest falsehood in this inscription yet it was somewhat odd that he should boast of such mighty wonders and in so strange a manner too for it was never heard before that the losing of battles and a whole province too was the way for a prince to enlarge his dominions or to reduce his enemy to reason the inscription was put above a triumphal arch which was erected at tarin to set off a firework that was raised there to testify the joy of that place for the peace and it was all he could boast of from the beginning of the war since he had lost not only his duchy but the battles of staffard and marsaille into the bargain yet the great number of enemies which france had at that time made his majesty reckon that he should be a considerable gainer though he should deliver up savoy to him and even the town and citadel of pignerol which were taken by cardinal richeleu in person if by that means he could oblige him to a peace by this treaty the duke was ut into as good circumstances as if he himself had gained those battles and conquered a great province  the duke having had the pleasure to see two dukes and peers of france at his court resolved to revenge himself and all the princes of his blood of the affront which henry iv put upon their ancestor and as that great king had carrvd it so high in his own house as to make a prince of his own blood take place of a duke of savoy so the present duke would needs carry it so high at his court as to make the prince de carignan who is of his family and elder brother to the count de soissons take place of the two french dukes when they came to pay him a visit at his house had the kings great master of horse been there to see a prince triumph over these two dukes he had thought himself sufficiently revenged of them for they were so far from yielding him the place in his own house that they disputed it with him wheresoever they met him perhaps he will not soon forget a debate he had on this score with the duke de montausier who having told him that he never thought nor was it ever heard that a younger brother of the family of st maur would vie for precedence with a prince of a sovereign house the duke de montausier answered him saucily that he would let him know that both as a younger brother of the family of st maur and as duke and peer of france he would dispute the precedence with him where ever they should meet but though perhaps this duke may have been much in the right upon the one score yet certainly he was not so upon the other for a younger brother of the family of st maur or of any other house can never be supposed equal to the son of a sovereign prince and perhaps he had not spoke after that manner but that the duke of lorrain was at that time dispossed of his dominions so that he looked upon the princes of that house but as younger brothers of a good family and it was no doubt for this very reason that much about the same time the count de crequi berniulle entered into a debate with the late count d harcourt younger brother to the duke d elbeuf for he treated him just as if he had been his equal and was so very haughty that when the mareshals of france before whom both of them were obliged to appear to give account of their quarrel made some distinction between them and ordered him to go to the princes house and there to beg pardon for what had passed his behavior to him was the same as before it is true he went to harcourt where the prince dwelt at that time but he caused drive his coach to the very door of the parlour where the mareshals of france had appointed the count d harcourt to receive him he found him there with some gentlemen of their neighborhood for they themselves were near neighbors the prince had caused chairs to be set for them and had also reserved one for the count de crequi while he himself designed to sit in an elbowchair but so soon as the count de crequi who was always of a great presence of mind perceived that by this means he intended to let him understand the difference between a prince of a sovereign house and a gentleman of a good family he skilfully warded off the blow for after he had made those compliments to the prince which the mareshals of france ordered him to do he went to the chair that was reserved for him but instead of sitting down in it he put one knee upon the seat of it and took hold of the back of it with his hands the count d harcourt who had orders prescribed him by the mareshals of france how to behave himself on that occasion as well as he and who was obliged not to sit while he was standing told him that it would be more for his convenience to sit down in the chair and that at least the gentlemen who were there present would take their seats if he had once taken his the count d crequi answered him that there was no need of ceremonies among neighbors as they were and that he might sit down if he pleased but as for himself he was well enough as he was with these words he ended his visit and without giving the prince time to make use of his elbowchair took leave of him the prince was obliged to wait on him to the door of the parlour and the distinction which he designed to have made between them turned more to his shame than to his honor and he himself said plainly to one of the gentlemen that was at his house and in whom he put confidence that in his lifetime there was never any thing so mortified him as the count de crequis behavior to him that day the mortification no doubt was great enough but he met with one incomparably greater if he was sensible of it when the prince of condee cudgelled him at luxenburg this treatment lets us see that every man is master in his own house and that there is a great difference between a prince of the blood and any other prince in france though of a sovereign house however the prince of condes great haughtiness was brought low soon after i mean when he went out of france and betook himself to the protection of the spaniards and took part with them to the manifest violation of that allegiance which he owed his own sovereign i admire that we have not a full account of all this in the history that is written of his life it is well enough known that so soon as he was at namur he found reason to repent that ever he had left his native country the author of that history methinks should have told us all the journeys he made from that town to brussels and from brussels to namur endeavoring to adjust the difference about precedence with the archduke leopold who pretended to take place of him he should have told us also all that happened in a debate of the like nature between his most serene highness and the duke of lorrain if it had been cardinal mazarins good pleasure to have made use of this juncture to persuade the prince of condee to return he could have easily prevailed for he was almost mad at the treatment he met with but that minister who thought it a piece of the best policy he could contrive to oblige him to quit france was far from wishing his return thither these and a thousand other curious things which are wholly left out deserved a place in the history of that princes life and it would have been much more becoming an historian to have published them than to have entertained us with so many trifles and false stories  it is true the author did not well know the history of that princes life and he is so ingenuous as to tell us so much in the beginning of his book but since he acknowledged that he was unable for such a performance why did he undertake it there is nothing in my opinion more inexcusable in an author than to confess his own ignorance for since he acknowledges his own failings why does he venture to write books a pretty idea indeed he gives us of his works were it not a thousand times better he should say nothing of them and may he not reasonably expect the common fate of all such authors that is to make himself contemptible as they always do when an author is so silly as to condemn himself he must not expect afterward that others will deal more gently by him than he has done by himself  but to return to my subject the prince de carignan having as i have just now said revenged his own family and that of lorrain of the affronts that had been put upon them there were many dukes and peers of france who found their own honor concerned in the treatment which the dukes of froix and choyseul had met with and therefore they consulted together at private meetings if they should complain to his majesty of these two dukes for having disgraced their character in bearing with a thing so unworthy of their rank but the wisest of them did not think fit to do it for they thought it more than probable that before they went from versailles they had instructions given them in writing how to behave themselves at turin and therefore they could not hope for redress though they should make their complaint in the mean time the more reasons the duke of savoy had to be well satisfied the more did he caress the two dukes his very being an italian makes him dissemble naturally the only thing he had to wish for to make him completely satisfied was that monsieur louvois had been still alive that he might have seen with what art and skill he could revenge himself of injuries that were done him for as it was he who had first provoked him to engage in a war against the king by the slights he had given him upon many occasions he would no doubt have been exceedingly pleased could he but have asked him what was now become of all that haughtiness and contempt with which he treated all the sovereign princes whose power was inferior to his majestys  this prince having dealt after this manner by the two hostages and having nothing else that could vex them thought it convenient to send them back to france without waiting till his daughters marriage should be accomplished the pretense he used was that he had so much confidence in his majesty that he did not desire any other security but his word he said also to the two dukes that it was only for form sake that ever he had asked hostages of the king and that he was now glad of the opportunity he had to let all europe see that he did not in the least doubt but that his majesty would faithfully perform every thing he had promised that therefore they might return into france as soon as they pleased yet they would not adventure to do this till they should receive his majestys orders  the king has also learned to dissemble not only from the lessons that cardinal mazarin taught him but also by long experience in government and in the exercise of a sovereign power which has taught him that the art of dissembling is one of the most necessary qualifications for a king he first assured the duke of savoy of his thankfulness for his generosity and then he ordered the two dukes to return to france at the same time his majesty sent an ambassador into that country it was the count de briord who belonged to the prince of condee without whose knowledge he had made an interest for that employment for which his highness was highly offended at him but dared not show his resentments for fear of a reprimand from the king  the feast of christmas was now at hand and the duchess du lude caused a little jesus to be made for a present to the young princess after the custom of italy she found it upon her toilet at her levee and the case into which it was put being of most exquisite and curious work with panes of crystal she was altogether charmed with it but upon newyears day the king made her a much more magnificent present for he gave her an apron with jewels to the value of an hundred thousand franks in it the dauphin gave her another which had cost him forty thousand franks and these two new years gifts were accompanied with a third present from the king of all the jewels that had ever belonged to his own queen and to the late dauphiness the count de thoulouse after the kings example gave so magnificent new years gifts that they seemed too great by much for a private person no doubt but what he did was by the kings allowance and that even his majesty advised him to it but whatever was in that it was to the marquis d antin who is his brother by the mothers side that he made those rich presents and the whole business was managed thus the marquess d antin being gone to dine with his brother in law the marquis de barbesieux he found under his mapkin a billet which was folded he knew not what was the import of it and the marquis de barbesieux who probably had put it there by his majestys order having forbidden him to blus  is lady should not know of it he told him also that all the company would allow him to read it and that they would refer it to his own discretion whether he would tell them what was in it or not for they would not at all vex him the marquis d antin arose from the table and went to the window to read it he found that instead of coming from a lady as he at first had imagined it was come from the count de thoulouse who took the liberty to call him a big hoggish fellow for he looked like one that had got enough of food in his time but he had no reason to complain of this freedom since as the contents of the billet made him see clearly that it proceeded from true friendship for the count told him that two years ago he had resolved to give him a pension of ten thousand livres a year and that as it was but just he should have the benefit of it from that time so now he gave him notice that he had not only settled it on him for the time coming but had also ordered his treasurer immediately to pay him  0000 livers for the two past years the marquis d antin being come back to the table told the company that they were not much mistaken if they thought that this was a billet doux that at least he himself took it for one and he was sure he was in the right of it and for that he would appeal to the judgment of those present he then told them the contents of it and so soon as they had heard them they all owned that it was incomparably better than any billet that could come even from the handsomest lady they had all the reason in the world to think so since  0000 livers a year and  0000 of ready money is well worth any mistress especially now adays when the world is so changed that whereas formerly the men sought after the ladies these do now seek after the men and almost all of them are become effronted to the highest degree and carry on their debauchery so far that many of them fuddle as if they were to gain no small honor and reputation by it and since the cordial liquors came in fashion they make use of that pretense to drink of every thing that pleases their palate not excepting even drandy it self which they drink as if it were sweet water by which we may guess how well they relish other liquors and seeing their taste is so viciated that they love even that which porters themselves detested not many years ago it is not very probable that they will be at much pains to resist those temptations that procure those pleasures which are much more natural than the other and which in the opinion of some people are not altogether so unworthy of the female sex and the truth is the ladies are generally sensible enough of this and are become so impudent in those lewd practices that one whom i know very well and who is none of the least considerable about the court knowing some time ago that her gallant was to be married besought him to call at her house as he returned from church it was the niece of this messalina whom he married and the nieces modesty is as great as the aunts impudence however her gallant not being able to refuse her desire was no sooner in her chamber but she asked another favor of him which was that he would pass that day a bed with her that at night her niece might have nothing but what she had left the bridegroom stood in great need of money and knowing that she rewarded liberally granted her request while the friends who were invited to the marriage were searching throughout all the parts of the neighborhood to know what was become of him yet this is not the only court lady of this stamp but every one of them were lashed and exposed sufficiently in some carols and lampoons that were composed and published soon after the princess came to france there we had the true and genuine history of every one of them without the least disguise it is true it is not well done to discover to the world the faults of other people yet the exposing of them thus was useful to persuade many of them to reflect upon their own conduct and to be more circumspect in time coming but the worst thing of those carols was that they were so full of gross immoralities that many who had but a small share of religion detested them the king who was never of an humor to bear with things of that nature and less now than ever that he is become devout in good earnest made a deal of noise about them and said openly before all the court that he had one good counsel to give the author of them which was that he would make his escape in time thereby to prevent the punishments which he must inevitably undergo if ever he come to be discovered if the author had followed this counsel it had been the same thing as to have accused himself and therefore whoever he was he put as good a face on it as they could do who were sensible of their own innocence there is not the least doubt but that he belongs to the court and that he is one of those who are best acquainted with it for no body else could know so well the history of every ones life as that author did though after all he was mistaken in some things however after many had been suspected and among the rest a lady of very great quality because her genius bends a little that way it came at last to be generally believed that the chevalier de bouillon was the man but because there was no certain proof of it and that all that was said was founded only on suspicion he got no harm by it the king was not satisfied that he had signified his displeasure against this author who had thus signalized himself for an impious wretch and perhaps for a liar too for it is not probable that all the nasty things that are in those carolls can be literally true but his majesty made it known also that he would not take it well if any body should sing them but as there are some things above the power of kings how great soever their authority may be so this order took not much effect every body sung them as before except that they were cautious not to do it in the hearing of those who they thought would give an account of it to his majesty for we must understand that there are abundance of spies about the court and though some of them are known as the marquis de terms and some others yet there are of them who act their parts so cunningly that there is nothing they are less suspected of than of being what they truly are  it was not only in these carolls and songs that the conduct of the ladies was publicly censured a certain person who is well known in the world for an employment of a quite other kind than what he is naturally fitted for resolved to censure them also in the same manner that he has for a long time censured all mankind as he sets up for a jester and maker of ballads he made some upon the accourements which the ladies now make use of that they may be ready for an engagement he brought them forth in slippers and quilted wastcoats ready to enter the lifts and though he named no body yet as they who censure others must not expect many thanks especially when vicious customs are laid so deep that it s next to impossible to root them out so his performances were so unacceptable that as a reward of his pains he was soon born down and oppressed with a world of censures and reproaches and that much after the same manner that he had reproached others that is by ballads and lampoons but with this difference that whereas in thse which he had composed he had been so civil as not to name any body et they dealt so rudely by him as to name him expressly and which was harder upon him that they might chastize him yet farther they sent copies of their lampoons to his three best friends the cardinal de bouillon the duke de chawnes and the marchioness de louvois whose houses he frequented daily and who could not easily be without him they were not well pleased that others should be so unjust as to calumniate him who had never calumniated any person because as they said he had not named any in the songs which he had made yet they cannot say but that since the time that from being master of requests he had dwindld into a poet of the pontneuf he has fallen foul upon several persons of quality without being so circumspect and therefore he must not expect that all the world will be so favorable to him as was the cardinal and his other friends and as there was no great injustice in finding fault with what he had done as to the ladies so many others as well as he were of opinion that they had even done best to have laid by their slppers and wastcoats the thrust he gave in being thus smartly pareed and returned upon himself the poor fellow was forced to shut himself up in his little closet without daring to peep abroad for some days but as every man returns soon to his natural temper and as the ladies too did not fail to provoke him anew not to spare them as hitherto he had done we have since had a thousand ballads of his making where he represents them prettily enough  if lewdness was so ordinary at this time among the women it was not much less so among the men but especially they were taken with a very frenzy and madness for which they could make no apology for besides the vice of excessive drinking which many of them were addicted to rather through bad custom than by natural inclination they had got into an humor of preferring the women players of the playhouse and the opera to their own wives though never so handsome and their husbands were much to blame for it if they were not modest and circumspect and thus for the leavings of a great many other people they forsook their own wives whom they might have enjoyed all alone yea and provoked them too to become common for nothing more provokes a wife to be unfaithful to her husband than when he slights her and prefers other women to her  the lords of the greatest quality were not more exempted from this vice than were others though they be more obliged than other people to give good example for the higher and greater a mans station and character is the more is his behavior exposed to the view of the public  there was one of them among the rest who fell in love with a woman of the opera which very much vexed his friends and relations but there was one thing encouraged him in his amors and served to harden him in his shameful and lewd practices and that was that many of the most topping ladies about the court went a purpose to the opera that they might see his mistress and speak highly to her advantage for those who enter once into a vicious way of living can applaud vice with as little remorse as others applaud virtue those who were concerned in this nobleman had perceived sometime before that it was necessary to observe his conduct narrowly and therefore they put a wise and sober man to attend him who might give them an account of his behavior but as youth has an aversion to people of this sort and usually considers them as pedagogues whom they cannot bear with so this young lord endeavored so soon as he could to free himself of the bonds which his friends had put upon him all the young gentlemen who made their court to him confirmed him as much as they could in his resolution and they called his observer by the name of caius garrulus which sounded not unlike his own name and they added an epithet to it which was somewhat suitable to his employment this young gallants father was extremely concerned when he knew that his son was so fond of this actress he spoke to him of it as a thing which would ruin his reputation and at length he spoke to him not only as from himself but as from the king to whom he knew that he paid very much deference and that his counsels might make the greater impression upon his sons mind he told him that they who were fond of that sort of people met often with sad misfortunes and that his rank and quality did not at all secure him against the treachery of a coquette and that if he must have a mistress he should at least look for one with whom he could live with greater safety than he could do with her notwithstanding all the deference he had for the king and the duty he owed to his father he made no other answer but that he would do all that was in his power to satisfy both of them but that he found so strong an inclination for that woman that he knew not if it was in his power to disengage himself altogether from her on a sudden he continued notwithstanding all this to visit her and having told her every word his father had spoke to him they agreed that he should not pay her a visit for some days caius garrulus advertised the young gallants friends of the visit he had paid maugre all his fathers remonstrances to the contrary upon which account his father spoke once more to him and told him that he must be very incorrigible in that he had so soon forgot what he had said to him formerly and that being of so high a birth as he was he ought at least to have delayed that visit for some days thereby to give some proof of his obedience he took him to task so seriously as that the young beau might have been persuaded to reflect as seriously upon his own behavior he could not deny but that he had paid her a visit but the answer he gave was that with all due regard to the deference he owed him he thought that he had no just ground to reprove him that civility and good manners had obliged him to go and tell her that he was peremptorily discharged to have any more correspondence with her and that having once had a kindness for her he could do no less for she might have been justly enraged against him had he cast her off without telling her why that in the mean time notwithstanding the great desire he had to give him full satisfaction in that matter yet he could not but own that at the last visit he had found her more charming than ever that it troubled him much when he reflected upon his own weakness but that all he could do in obedience to his commands was to pray to god for strength and resolution to obey them his father understood well enough the meaning of all this and conceiving no great hopes of him he left him being much out of humor at his answer it was two or three days before the son paid another visit to his mistress yet he sent letters to her every hour and gave her notice that next day his father was to give a splendid ball and that she must not fail to be there but that she should come disguised in such and such a manner that he might know her by her garb this ball was the finest that had been seen of a long time and all the court was present at it but this young lord could not as yet see his mistress there which put him out of humor at a lady who would fain have had the same interest in his affection that the actress had and flattered her self with hopes that if she was successful his father and his other friends would not find so much fault with it she began to rally him for being out of humor that she might thereby find a way to bring about her own purposes but he was not at leisure to give her an answer for he saw his mistress come into the ball that very moment she was disguised in mans dress and he went immediately and spoke to a young princess who was often engaged in the dance that with the first opportunity she would please to take out the young spark who was in such and such a dress pointing to his mistress she promised to do it and was as good as her word caius garrulus who had always an eye upon him having observed that he looked much to that side where the new masker was and that immediately after he had spoken to that princess he began to suspect what it was he had said to her yet he would let no body know his jealousy till he should be fully assured that he was in the right and observing this new masker very narrowly the more he viewed him the more was he persuaded that it was his masters mistress by this time there was one came and took out the young princess to dance and immediately after she took out this new masker which let caius garrulus clearly see that he was not mistaken for he knew so well by her dancing that it was she whom he suspected that though he had not had any other presumptions that alone was sufficient to confirm him in his suspicions this masker who was truly the young lords mistress after she had danced with the young princess was so affronted as to take out her gallants lady to dance with her caius garrulus could bear no longer with her impudence but went and told his masters father who it was that had taken out his daughter in law to dance he had a good mind at first to have caused to throw her over the window and so had the young lords mother but when they had reriected that that would make too much noise both of them resolved to try calmer methods for breaking off this correspondence they caused to inform him that she was false to him and that others conversed familiarly with her and unless he would give up converse with her it was not safe for his own lady to bed with him but though they endeavored under hand to raise all the jealousies imaginable in his mind yet he would believe nothing after these endeavors his father was afraid lest what he would have had his son to believe should prove true in good earnest and therefore he appointed a woman to attend his sons mistress and to observe her so narrowly that it should not be in her power to prove false to his son  this young lord was not the only person who was fond of the women of opera and playhouse contrary to the duty he owed both to himself and to his lady there were many others who after his example did the same thing and but too many who had done it before him  but among all those whose inconsiderateness is the most astonishing thee is not one more inexcusable than a certain duke who was old enough to have given greater proofs of his prudence besides that he had married a young princess of incomparable beauty and who deserved beyond all comparison to have been more esteemed than all the mistresses he could find among that sort of women but no consideration would prevail with him against lewdness and he was not only unfaithful to her but left her for good and all and went to keep house with his new mistress before this happened his father who was one of the greatest and richest lords about the court had carried his sons lady to his own seat in the country while her husband was in the army her mother who loved her most tenderly was loath to part with her and had much rather she had stayed with her but could not obtain it yet her daughter wrote to her soon after and besought her to employ all her interest with the king that he would please to give orders that she should return for she was not at all safe with her father in law who had spoken to her of amors notwithstanding her relation to him and that he had spoken so very earnestly that no time must be lost if she had any concern for her honor and the peace of her mind it is not certain if all this was literally true or if it was only concerted between the mother and the daughter to get her brought out of that country where her father in law dwelt and of which she was wearied that she might live with her mother who longed so much for her company whatever was in this the lady having spoke of it to his majesty obtained an order to the dukes father to send his daughter in law back to paris he was enraged against both of them for the affront which they had put upon him and therefore though he ought to have been the first who should have reproved his son for conversing with his new mistress which now began to appear yet he was at no great pains to dissuade him from it he alleged they had served him a very scurvy trick and he was glad to revenge himself by this connivance but if he thought this a good way to be revenged of them he had very soon reason to be satisfied with it for his son became so passionately in love with this new  or rather he became such a very fool as when he knew that she was big with child he left his wife and went and lived with her and his father having given him no great yearly revenue when he married him though he himself had  00000 livers a year besides great sums of money in his coffers and not one farthing of debt he found himself so  because of the two families he had to provide for and the charges he had been at in the camp that he resolved to do what people will scarcely believe of one of his quality that was to live without coach and without that great number of pages and lackeys that men of his quality usually have about them and thus he reduced all his expenses for the winter time to a very small matter having only one lackey for himself and another for his mistress and these he put in gray clothes that when he took a hackney to go abroad neither he nor they might be known the women servants wereas few in number as the lackeys she had only a chambermaid and a nurse and this last served with both hands that is she was servant of the house and nurse at the same time his friends could bear no longer with his inconsiderateness and this disgraceful way of living they spoke to him of it as a thing that would stain his honor to such a degree that it would be impossible for him ever to retrieve it and that he might not be altogether confounded with shame as he ought to be for such practices they told him that this woman had certainly bewitched him that at least they had reason to think so since it was so unnatural a thing in him to part with the most lovely princess in the world and to keep house with a beggarly strumpet whose very trade and profession was enough to make any body disgust her though she was a thousand times more charming in her person than she seemed to be all the answer he made them was that they spoke so of her only because they did not know her but if they had conversed a little with her they would soon be of another mind in this they could not agree with him and having taken leave of him without being able to persuade him to alter his measures they were grieved that he continued so obstinately to disgrace himself  when they found this they caused to speak underhand to the woman her self and threatened that they would have recourse to royal authority to have her shut up in a convent or in some prison if she would not even persuade the duke to part with her one in her condition could not be well pleased with such a proposal and it quite confounded her she knew that those threatenings were not groundless for she had known a woman kept in prison seven or eight years because she had been mistress to the count dharcourt whom we have already spoken of and therefore being resolved to prevent so great a mischief she promised to do all that was in her power to satisfy them and she was as good as her word for that very day after she had on set purpose made a show of melancholy to the duke she told him that she could not any longer converse with him as hitherto she had done because her conscience reproached her continually with her guilt and represented to her every moment that she only was the cause that he abandoned his lady the duchess and that every body blamed her for it as no doubt she deserved to be insomuch that was there nothing but that one consideration she was obliged to tell him that he must resolve to break up with her since their converse was equally shameful and sinful to them both the duke was surprised at a discourse which he so little expected but having still the more esteem of her upon this very account because the two things she made use of as a pretense for this divorce are agreeable to a lover that is his own interest and the virtue of the person he loves he did all he could to make her change her thoughts but the fears of a prison made her deaf to all his reasons and to all his caresses she persisted in her resolution to give over all converse with him and knowing nothing could more prevail with him to cause him to reflect upon his past conduct than his own ladys charming beauty which was indeed incomparably above hers she told him that if she was as beautiful as his lady and if his lady had nothing more charming about her than she had she would not think it strange that he should forsake her and live with her but being obliged to confess that all the advantage was upon his ladies side she could not suffer any longer that he should be called a man of so ill a taste as to choose the worse and to forsake the better he would fain have persuaded her that only her modesty made her speak so of herself that if his thoughts were asked in that matter he would soon tell just the contrary that he was as capable as any other to judge of their beauties having conversed so much with her but his mistress finding how he answered her and that it was impossible to make him gainsay any thing of all this she betook herself to her first argument that her conscience would not allow her to converse any longer with him  the duke considered all these discourses as the effect of some secret discontent that had put her into an ill humor and that he might bring her back to her ordinary gaiety he offered her some presents but she refused them generously and as the most disinteressed person in the world in the mean time she gave notice to those who had threatened her that she was using her utmost endeavors to satisfy them but if they were desirous that she should succeed it was needful they should do something upon their parts they bestirred themselves immediately knowing that it is best to strike the iron while it is hot and they came a purpose to wait on the duke he would have resisted all the batteries they could have raised against him had they been alone but his mistress treating him with so much indifference and like a woman who was absolutely resolved to abandon her former vices he told them that there needed no more importunities for he was resolved to give them full satisfaction but if they would know the true reason why he resolved so it was because his mistress had determined him in it she who alone had a more absolute empire over him than it was possible for all of them to have when they were united together that he cheerfully and frankly owned so much to them hoping that for their parts they would also acknowledge that she was a much worthier person than he could express an evident proof of which was that she was fully resolved to bid adieu to all sorts of intrigues and amors a thing very unusual for women after they have once been accustomed to those pleasures but for her he told them that he had so good an opinion of her he could be surety for her she should never return to them that at least he would comfort himself with those thoughts of her his friends did not trouble themselves to dispute this matter with him nor were they such fools as to inform him how much they had frighted her with their threatenings they thought it enough that they had brought him to their own terms and it was all one to them by what means soever it was done the only thing they desired was how to bring the matter to an happy issue now that it was so well begun they went to his ladies parents and desired they might concur with them in reconciling them together but the dutchesss mother who after she had once taken back her daughter to her house could never resolve to part with her told them resolutely that she would never consent to it the dukes father gave them much the same answer for he continued to be extremely angry at what the young princess had said of him but as men ordinarily yield sooner to reason than women do he was at last prevailed with but upon condition that when his daughter in law should be reconciled to her husband she should not see her mother any more this was to throw oil into the flame and served only to provoke the ladies indignation so that she withstood their reconcilement more than ever the prince her husband was much wiser and more reasonable than she was he told her that by the laws both of god and man they were obliged to contribute their endeavors for reconciling husband and wife even though they had but small hopes to succeed in it but that in this case she was much more obliged to it than others were because it was the concern of her son in law and her daughter but for all this she continued obstinate and she had such an ascendant over him that he used to do nothing but what she was pleased with it was at last found necessary to speak to the king of it  his majesty was of the fathers opinion and thought that in procuring such an agreement they ought not to stand upon punctilios and therefore ordered the duchess to follow her husbands advice  the condition proposed by her son in laws father that she should not see her daughter was qualified and she was allowed to see her sometimes but not above twice a week lest the dukes father should take it amiss it went much against the ladies stomach that they should set bounds to the kindness she had for her daughter and therefore she proposed that if she was not to see her daughter but twice a week then her son in laws father should not be allowed to see her at all and much less that they should live in the same house they found out also a medium for this which was that he might see her as often as his son would allow him and they told the lady that her son in law was more concerned than she was that his father should not see her daughter if all was true that was said of him after all these things were concerted nothing remained but to know what the duke would do with his mistress and his child and that he would pitch upon a day for being fully reconciled to his duchess as to the first he promised to allow them a pension which perhaps he has not been over careful to perform yet i will not vouch this for a truth but because he was then as passionately in love with her as ever i may presume he was prodigal enough of his promises but perhaps he has been as sparing in performing them for lovers easily forget their promises when they are not any more to see the person to whom they are made as to the other matter he made no difficulty in it the day was appointed and there was a new marriage solemnized before he went to bed with his wife their parents paid their compliments to them as if they had been but a new married couple and their other friends after their example did the same in fine they were both together carried to the opera and to other public places that those who had heard of their divorce might see that the greatest follies do not last always  one would think that such an example as this might have had a good influence upon those who werefallen into the same frensy that is upon those who made but small account of their wives for the sake of these naughty creatures but we have not hitherto seen any good that it has done to a certain duke who though he has not as yet parted with his wife as the other did yet he lives not in much better terms with her one of these unhappy women of the playhouse having by some means engaged his affections has so bewitchd him that of a long time he has had no converse with his wife and vet she is very young and which is more she is a lady of great virtue which is so valuable an accomplishment yea and so singular in this age as to deserve that a husband should esteem it much more than he does  it is true she is not so great a beauty as is an aunt of her husbands who yet has not been much more fortunate though she be a lady of great virtue as well as her neice this lady was married to a person of honor and a man of as good sene as was about the court which is another reason why he should have used her well for the more a man has of honor and true sense the more will he endeavor to acquit himself of his duty but he was so desperately in love with a young lady who is also of great virtue and is at this time superior of the maids of st marie de chaliot that he could not open his eyes to see how happy he might have been in his own wife and he did even much worse than did the two dukes i last spoke of for he did not so much as bed with her the first night of the marriage and if we will believe the accounts we have at court he suffered her to continue always a maid though they lived a long time together and though there was never any public breach between them his father who was also a man of good sense and so far from approving his want of affection to this lady that he was extremely vexed at it when he perceived it and told him his thought of it very freely and finding the arguments he made use of made him nothing the wiser man he be thought himself of others and tried if perhaps they would be of greater force he told him that laying aside the authority of a father he would now only advise him as his true friend and that all he had to say to him was that all the court looked upon his wife as a very agreeable lady and that among them who esteemed her much she might perhaps find one whom she would think worthy of her affection that the best means how to prevent that was for him to perform the duty of a husband to her otherwise perhaps another might supply his place this advice was sound and wholesome but as this young gentleman had shut his eyes and would not take notice of his ladys true worth so he stopped his ears at his fathers reasons and held on his course without ever troubling himself with the thoughts of his future destiny yet the horoscope which his father had cast for him proved false for there was never a lady at court made her self be less talked of than she did however her husband died and she kept for a second husband that which is so much valued in a bride she was reputed a widow but was truly a maid when she was married the second time and as if she had been born under the strangest planet that ever was it is generally believed that this second husband has not as yet made her change her condition he was one of the handsomest men in france yet altogether unfit for the marriage bed and therefore his first wife did not care much to dwell with him though there was never any public rupture between them and though she might have made a very good figure at court too but she chose rather to leave him there alone and to revenge her self of her hard fate upon the hearts and other wild beasts with whom she made war so long as she lived it is true that when she was a dying she made a will in his favors which would seem to import quite other things than what i have been just now alleging for it is seldm that a wife will be so obliging to a husband unless she have first received of his favors but all women are not of the same humor and it must be said to the advantage of this lady that as to this matter she was less concerned and much more modest than many others are hunting was that which she took greatest pleasure in and because her husband treated her always very kindly save in that which most of other women think the chief and essential part of a husbands kindness it seems she made no great account of it and she had rather that her husband should enjoy her estate than some of her relations whom she did not much esteem she gave the trust of her will to the duke de lesdeguires but he being surprised with a sudden death when he was least thinking of it and when he had lived but to half the age that by the course of nature he might have done it created much trouble afterward to her husband yet this was a seasonable relief to him and he had much need of it to repair the breaches he had made in his own estate in the time he had been at court  as the court is the place of the world where the greatest number of extraordinary things fall out so about the same time that the terms of the reconciliation which i spoke of were agreed to there was one thing happened that did not sound well for one of the principal actors in it and it has made people have but an ill opinion of a man whom we now bring upon the stage  we must know then that among other methods which the king had taken to raise money for maintaining the war he had published an edict for the sale of some governments within the heart of the kingdom and there was more need of money for the purchase of them than either of service or merit there is a little town named rue lying toward abbeville in piccardy and the late duke d elbeuf was formerly governor of it and his son the present duke d elbeuf finding that it would be very convenient for him that he had the government of the same place resolved to purchase it there was one monsieur d augancourt a gentleman of that country who was neither rich nor much taken notice of some    years ago but has now a good estate and lives in plenty because he belonged to the late marquis de louvois and carried his portofolio when that minister went to do busines with the king this gentleman i say designed also to purchase it and so soon as he knew that the duke d elbeuf had the same design he took an odd method to carry it against him a method which any other man than he would have been afraid of but he was for bold adventures that he might bring about his designs and because he had not been altogether unsuccessful in another business wherein he was once like to have been quite ruined he hoped he might succeed well enough in this especially seeing what friends or interests soever the duke d elbeuf could make he was still much less to be feared than was his former antagonist the marquis de barbesieux yea it was not only with him he had contended but with the whole family of his old master the marquis de louvois whose memory he endeavored to blacken i shall first give an account of this affair and then i shall return to his business with the duke delbeufe  the marquis de louvois being dead this d augincourt who had the honor to be known to the king because he had so very often carried this minister s portofolio to the door of his majestys closet having asked and obtained a secret audience told him that he thought it his duty to advertise him of one thing which his majesty knew nothing of before which was that his majesty had always believed that all the projects which the late marquis de louvois had presented to him were of his own contrivance but it was far from being so and that that minister had always had recourse to him when he had any thing to do of consequence that it was he who had projected such and such things and that the marquis de louvois was never able of himself to do any thing to purpose that his undertakings at maintenon were a sufficient proof of this that at that place he had committed a great many faults which he had never fallen into had he but followed his advice that he was ready to discover these faults and oversights to his majesty who because of his great skill in fortification would soon be convinced that what he said was true the king who is truly skilful in these things and perhaps much more so than many people believe of him finding that he offered to prove to a demonstration all the oversights which he charged his late minister with gave him upon that account a fuller hearing than otherways he would have done d augincourt having said whatever he thought fit for his own advantage and the king knowing that in some things he was in the right though in some also he was mistaken was so far from telling him that he did not approve of his ingratitude to his master to whom he had been obliged of his estate that though these were his sentiments yet on the contrary he told him that he would continue the pension to him which he had given him upon the marquis d louvoiss recommendation d augincourt though he was in some measure pleased with the kings bounty because the contnuing of the pension was a proof that his majesty approved of what he had said yet he was not altogether satisfied for he had flattered himself with the hopes of a much greater reward and that his majesty would make use of him in his secret affairs of which he pretended to have the key and expecting that the king would bestow the late marquis dlouvois place upon him he continued as often as he could find occasion to speak all the ill of him he could think of it is impoble for one to behave himself after this manner at court but that a minister shall have notice of it and the marquis dbarbiseux was soon advertised of it and he was struck to the very heart with it especially when he knew that the king had granted him his pension by which he understood that his majesty believed many of the things which he had alleged against his fathers memory these thoughts galled him so much that he resolved to be revenged on him and meeting with him that very day as he was going to the kings appartments he was not master enough of his passions for at first sight he gave him very harsh language as he well deserved but d augincourt who flattered himself that since the king had heard him so favorably he would certainly grant him the honor of his protection answered him with as much insolence as if he had never been his fathers domestic this insolent behavior raised the marquis dbarbiseuxs passion to such a height that he himself forgot the respect he owed to the place he was in he took him by the cravate and would have certainly strangled him had not his friends put him in mind that the king would be highly offended at what he was doing he yielded to their reasons and went immediately to the king and told him that he came to beg his pardon for something he had done in a sudden fit of passion that his majesty knew how unaccountable d augincourts ingratitude was toward his father though it was to him he owed all he had that he had met with him accidentally at the door of the antichamber and not being able to command his passion he had offered some violence to him of which he humbly acknowledged himself guilty that though his passion lasted but a moment because he had reflected upon it yet he did not pretend to be excusable upon that account and therefore he would submit to all the punishments that his majesty should order for him only he besought him to consider how natural it was for a son to be sensibly tched with every thing that concerned his fathers honor the king having heard him calmly answered him that it was good for him that he had so soon reflected upon his fault and had put a stop to the course of his passion but that he had done better if he had reflected sooner upon it so as not to have committed it that yet he would pardon him upon the account of what a son owed to his father but upon condition always that he should never again fall into the like enormity the marquis de barbiseux acted like a wise man thus to prevent the other in addressing himself to the king for scarcely had he done it when d augincourt presented himself before his majesty and demanded justice for the ill treatment he had met with from his minister the king told him he should have it but that he would first examine how the matter went but seeing he had once promised to pardon the marquis d barbiseux all the satisfaction d augincourt could ever obtain was that his majesty told him he had given him such a reprimand as was proper and that he would be wiser in time coming he told him also that when one had been a menial servant to a man as he had been to the marquis dlouvois he ought to behave himself respectfully toward his children  daugincourt might have learned from this to have been wiser afterward than to contend with one that was above him yet never thinking that the same accident might befall him if he fell again into the same error he no sooner formed the design of carrying the government of rue against the duke delbeuf but he gave in a memoir against him to the king which contained that this prince had been several times guilty of extortioning the people within the bounds of his government of piccardy and artois and that his majesty might give credit to this he offered to prove it so soon as he was commanded to do it the king who knew that this prince had some good qualities for which he is deservedly esteemed was troubled to see him stained with so black an accusation as that of extortion is not but that he knew well enough that accusations are not always true he had seen abundance of instances in his own time where the accusations fell back upon the heads of the accusers as it happened to courbier and some others but because this memoir was so conceived as to have all the appearances of truth the king knew not well what to say of it and would not so much as speak of it but the duke delbeuf finding that the farmers of the kings revenues asked much more for the government of rue than it was worth because daugincourt had offered them money he had recourse to the king that he might not fall into their hands  his majesty who remembered what the other had said to his disadvantage instead of answering him so obligingly as he used to do told him only that he would consider of it the duke who knew his majestys humor which is to be kind and obliging even to persons of far less quality than he concluded presently from this answer that some person had done him an ill office he did all he could for some days to discover who it might be and knowing that daugincourt had an eye upon the government of rue he was almost persuaded that he was the man his ingratitude to his late master was enough to make him entertain these thoughts of him yet that he might be more assured of it he spoke again to the king and begged to know if he had as yet considered of his request as he had promised to do his majesty told him that he had thought of it but it could not be granted him for some reasons which he was unwilling to tell him the duke delbeuf was yet more surprised at this answer than he was at the first and was more persuaded than ever that the king was not well pleased with him and therefore he supplicated his majesty with the greatest earnestness that he would be graciously pleased to tell him what it was that he had to lay to his charge his majesty answered him that he had resolved to conceal it from him that thereby he might save him the trouble which the knowledge of it would certainly give him but since he was so very earnest to know it he would tell him plainly that he had received a memoir against him wherein he was accused of extortioning the people who lived under his jurisdiction it is true the duke delbeuf who is not very rich and who loves to live great and therefore had need to make the best advantage of every thing had used his utmost skill and industry in looking narrowly after his affairs so that nothing that did of right belong to him could escape him but how much soever he looked after his own interest yet he had never been an extortioner and he could not endure that he should be unjustly accused of it and therefore he requested his majesty that inquiry should be made into it he told him that he who was but a young man had rashly done some things in his time which his majesty could not approve of that he most humbly begged pardon for them as he had also done when he was first charged with them but that he was content to lose his head if ever he was in the least guilty of what was now laid to his charge the king who was prepossessed with an opinion that daugincourt would never have dared to have given him the memoir if he had not been well assured that what it contained was true especially since he lived in the neighborhood where he pretended that the duke had been guilty of the extortions answered him that he would not at all advise him to search this matter to the bottom least perhaps it might prove more to his hurt than he expected and that at least it was probable it would prove so this answer afflicted him yet more than any of the former answers had done and therefore he continued to solicit his majesty that he would be pleased to allow him to justify himself the king turned away from him to speak to another person of quality to whom he had something to say and the duke delbeuf going out with an heart full of sorrow resolved to employ all his own and his friends interests that he might be allowed to clear himself of this calumny as he went out of the antichamber he found daugincourt with one of his friends at the door of the guardhall he took him aside to speak to him in private daugincourt left his friend alone and the duke asked him if perhaps he was not the man who had given the king a certain memoir of which his majesty had been just now speaking to him daugincourt who had so much impudence as to speak ill of his dead master by whose favor it was that he had acquired all that he was worth was impudent enough to own in the dukes face that he was the very man and which was more he told him that he had promised to the king to make good every thing that was in that memoir and that ere it was long he would be as good as his word the duke was so wise as not to do as the marquis de barbisieux had done when he fell into his hands but instead of that he contented himself to tell him that he was satisfied to know how far his impudence had carried him that he might come to be treated as he deserved at another time and in another place that he would take notice of him and at last he threatened him that he would cause him to be cudgelled to death for a rascal as he was daugincourt went and complained to the king and demanded justice of him the king told him he was ready to do him justice but he must first prove what he had alleged against the duke delbeuf who expressly denied all that he had charged him with and if he had calumniated him without ground then the duke had much more reason to demand justice than he had the duke returned to wait upon the king and requested him to appoint judges to enquire into that matter for if that were not done his reputation should be brought into question and that it was not just that in prejudice of his innocence any credit should be given to such a lying wretch as daugincourt he told him at the same time the designs that daugincourt had upon the government of rue and that he had taken this method of calumniating him fearing least otherwise he should not be able to carry it against him the king who is extremely prudent and judicious began to perceive how the matter stood as soon as he heard this and he guessed that jealousy and interest had made daugincourt do what he had done and therefore he allowed that the duke should clear himself and promised to name judges for that affair and which was more he told him that if he found daugincourt had accused him falsely he should cause to inflict any punishment upon him that the duke thought fit but the judges were not named for some time after insomuch that now when i am writing these memoirs this affair is not as yet ended  the young beaus of the court were become so profligate that many lewd women came to be in vogue among them and among the rest the women of the playhouse and the opera but there were some others besides them who came to be as much esteemed as they were and especially one mademoiselle chambonneau the daughter of a gentleman of poiton who finding her self every way fitted for amors thought it was pity to bury so good qualities in an obscure country place and therefore she came to paris where she might set them forth in the view of the finest city and of the finest court in the world prince philip was one of her first admirers but he dying soon after there were others succeeded him who were fully equal to him both for personal worth and quality so that she was no looser by the change but before i say any more of her i beg leave to give an account of a silly impertinence of the marshal de milleraies lady who is the most whimsical woman in the world as to what concerns quality  this prince had not lived a very christian life at least so far as appeared to the view of the world and there was a devout lady who soon after his death said in a public company where the marshals lady was that his salvation was much to be doubted of considering how irreligiously he had lived that many people had been witnesses of his debaucheries but none had ever heard of his repentance the marshals lady answered that she confessed that all that was true but that god was merciful especially to a person of prince philips quality and that since god was good to all mankind he would be much more so to such a man as he was and when it came to the damning of a person of so great quality god would think twice upon it before he did it the lady to whom she made this answer would not let her pass with it though she knew her weak side and that she was but a magotty woman about these things and therefore she could not hope for much satisfaction from any thing she could say about them  but to return to my subject madam chambonneau being the widow of a person of such a character and being married to a second husband who is yet more of it all the young people of quality resorted to her house her new husband was not at all jealous of her and allowed her to see every body and she got a good number of young favorites about her out of which she was sure to make a choice of such debauchees as were most agreeable to her humor especially the count de donsi eldest son to the duke de nevers a man of as odd a temper as his father is and to give his character in one word i need only say that he has all the vices of the manchinies yea and surpasses them in two things that are extremely shameful in any man but especially in a person of his quality he can scarce speak a word without adding the name of god to it and blasphemes as often as he speaks and as for drinking it would seem that in what place soever he is bacchus had set up his throne and kept court there yet these are the two great qualities he boasts most of whereas he ought rather to consider them as very dangerous distempers for in my opinion he who is become a slave to two such disgraceful vices may justly look upon himself as the most wretched and miserable of all mortals notwithstanding all this he is so very comely and handsome in his person that were he as sound in the head as he is well shaped in the body we might easily excuse not only this mad chambonneau but many others who after her example should show some affection for him  this counts father who is sordidly penurious in some things though in others he seems rather to be prodigal did not allow him so much as one farthing of money which was the reason that he had neither servants nor equipage perhaps he would have had him to go to the market as he did himself for we must know that when the humor takes him he makes no scruple to go thither and it is pretty odd to see a knight of the holy ghost with his blew ribband in a public market asking a fruit woman how she sells her fruit and her carrots there was a man came once and told monsieur baville intendant of languedoc that he was seen doing so in the public market at montpellier but he could not tell his name for he that had seen him did not know him he sent immediately to all parts of the town to know who this knight of the holy ghost might be that was come thither and so soon as he knew that it was the duke de nevers he went to pay him a visit and that he might engage him to reflect upon his own conduct as unworthy of his character he told him that he should not have known that he was in that town but that it had been told him that he was seen in the market that when he first heard of it he could not believe it till it was confirmed to him by so many people that at last he was forced to give credit to it lest he should seem to be too incredulous the duke answered him that he had gone from his lodgings with a design to pay him a visit but that having thought it too early and that he would not be up so soon he had done after the custom of italy which allows masters to go themselves and buy whatever they have a mind to eat that he knew it was not so in france but that for his part he never stood upon such small matters so that he might have the satisfaction to have nothing upon his table but what did relish with him  but this man is of a singular humor in other things besides this especially in his way of housekeeping for when he is not to have any strangers at his table he gives fifty sols a day for himself and as much for his lady to the steward of his house who must therewith provide victuals for them both and as to his servants he gives ten sols for every one of them so that he is in no great hazard of being cheated since the steward can neither augment nor diminish the daily allowance by this means its only when he entertains strangers that any thing beyond ordinary is to be seen in his house and it is then that he uses to go himself to the market which might be thought a sure mark of a penurious humor were it not that there is one thing remarkable in his house that is not to be found elsewhere and that is that if another man have one cook and an undercook this duke has six or at least four of them for he has an humor that he will not suffer that one cook should meddle but with one thing so that he who has the charge of the roast meat never meddles with the ragoos and he who has the charge of the ragoos meddles not with the more dainty dishes and so of the rest  a man of so singular an humor as this is could never allow his son to live such a life as he did he had already quit his house so as not to lodge in it and he thought it high time to give a check to his extravagant way of living he sent to him and warned him not to see mad chambonneau any more or else he knew what remedies to find for his distemper he was afraid either that he should run himself into debt by spending too much with her or that he should be such a fool as to marry her privately as was reported of him he had reason to look upon him as a man that was capable of anything that was foolish and extravagant though there had been no other ground for it but only this that he had taken upon himself the title of a duke though it did not all belong to him and which is yet worse had no ground to hope that ever it should belong to him for his fathers patent is not for his posterity but only for his own life time so that when he comes to die his family has done with that title as it happened not long ago to monsieur vieuville by this we may easily judge of the fathers humor for he married his lady when her aunt madam de montespan was in greatest favor with the king and at her greatest height yet he neglected to have that honor ensurd to his posterity and family though it would have cost him nothing to obtain it if he had but asked it  however the count de donsi who had heard that while his father was a young man he had lived much after the same manner that he did himself now while he was also young and that he could not justly challenge him for copying after his example answered the gentleman whom his father had sent to him that he could not think of leaving paris as he would have him do the duke procured a letter de cachet from the king for comitting him to the bastile  mad chambonneau went the first and second day after he was taken up and wandered up and down about the castle to try if perhaps she might see him upon the terrass or in the windows but she dared not adventure to go in and inquire for him for they had threatened to put herself in prison if she should be found in a disguise offering to pay him a visit but she was so much a coquette that in two or three days she became indifferent whether she should ever see him again or no she troubled herself no more about him but considered him as a dead man because he was no more in a condition to do her service only she thought fit to keep some rules of decency with him and therefore she wrote some letters to him and expressed herself as tenderly as if she had loved him as much as ever and even employed mademoiselle de soissons who is conduct is not much approved of by those who are concerned in her person and interest that she might assure him of it mademoiselle de soissons went twice or thrice to the bastile to deliver her commission and it may be she was glad of the opportunities that she might see him her self but the duke de nevers who was jealous of her and to whom the governor of the castle would not refuse any favor because he owed his fortune to cardinal mazarin the dukes uncle prevailed so far that she was stopped at the gate and not suffered to enter as if it had been by order from his majesty this was a notable affront for this princess who though she was warned of what was to befall her yet could not believe that the governor dared do such a thing because she was grand niece of the same cardinal to whom he had been captain of the guards  but as he had learned from him to make no great account of any sort of people but of those who were rich and powerful and she being neither the one nor the other because of the many disasters that had befallen her family he got soon over those considerations that so he might gratify the duke she might have complained of this to the king if she durst have spoken to him but his majesty was far from having any esteem for her and he had already caused notice to be given her that if she did not alter her conduct he would be obliged to send her orders that would not at all please her and therefore she had rather put up the affront and be silent than by complaining to put his majesty in mind that she did not live as a lady of her quality ought to do yet the king did not forget her so soon he remembered her more than ever now that the duke of burgundy had married the princess of savoy the honor that mademoiselle de soissons had to be of the same family that the princess is of made him often reflect how unworthy it was of her character and quality to live as she did and seeing she would not be reclaimed by what was said to her either from the king or from her friends he sent her a letter de cachet to depart out of the kingdom  her sister mademoiselle carignan got also a secret rebuke though her conduct was not altogether so disorderly as hers was yet she came to be talked of as conversing too frequently with a certain duke who was married the king therefore sent to her and offered her an apartment at versailles upon condition that she would take a governess of his naming she had one already who was as old a woman as any i know and mademoiselle carrignan took occasion from this to excuse her self for not accepting the honor which his majesty had designed for her and she told those who spoke to her from his majesty that it would occasion the death of her old governess if she should now put her a way when she had been so long time with her that it would look like a tacit accusation that she had not been so careful as she ought to have been of her education that in all appearance she could not live long and that so soon as she was dead there could be nothing which she would so much rejoice at as to make good use of the favors which his majesty was pleased to offer her mademoiselle de carignan having by this means got her self off she was very well pleased that she had thereby shunned the constraint under which she should have been had she lived at versailles she chose rather to keep her own little court at the hotel de soissons than to be one of those who make up the splendor at the princesses court the good old woman madam de st martin who is her governess was extremely well pleased a the answer she had made in the mean time the duke was advertised of this and it was desired of him that he would take care not to pay her so many visits as he used to do lest the king should send her such another order as he had sent to her sister  mademoiselle chambonneau was in a great consternation when she heard of mademoiselle de soissons fate she was afraid that since the king had dealt so hardly by a person of her birth he might come to deal more severely by her how small provocation soever she should give him she therefore entreated many of the young beaus that frequented her house that they should come but seldom thither but he who had succeeded to prince philip having encouraged her by an oath that he made to her that he would preserve her from all hazards she soon recalled those whom so lately she had advised to seek for diversions elsewhere but there were two of them whom she endeavored all she could to discourage from coming to her house because she thought neither of em fit for her purpose the one was the baillif dauvergne eldest son of the count dauvergne who had already so much offended his father that he had nothing to expect from him for he had forced him to engage himself in the order of malta and to give up his right of primogeniture in favors of that brother who was next to him in age the other was the chevalier de kailus a younger brother of the marquis de kailus who has married mademoiselle de vilette a cousin of madam de mantenons this man had not the same faults that the baillif de auvergne had yet he had as small a share in mademoiselle chambonneaus favors as the other had though i know not upon what account it was so and she endeavored to set them at variance that by the one she might come to get rid of the other or rather that she might get rid of them both at the same time the best means she could think on for this was under pretense of friendship to make every one of them believe that the other spoke much to his disadvantage they easily believed what she said for each of them was persuaded that she loved him dearly and therefore thought it impossible that she could tell him any thing that was false they began then to look a squint upon one another but their resentments were too strong to stop there they agreed to do one another justice with sword in hand and to try which of them madm de chambonneau should belong to they agreed to meet in the court of the abbey of st germain and that the one of them should make as if he were going into the church while the other was coming out of it that so it might seem that they had met only by chance for they knew how severe the king was to those that dared to transgress his edicts and especially that which he had made against duels they knew that he could never be prevailed with to grant a pardon to any man who had been so unfortunate as to fall into that crime  they met as they had appointed and drew their swords but were parted before much blood was shed yet the one of them wounded the other and each of them retired to a friends house and resolved not to come abroad till they should know first if it was safe for them to appear but they had notice very soon that they should do well to lurk and that the king was no sooner informed of their fighting but that he had sent an order to the procuror general of the parliament to enquire after that matter the count d auvergn went at the same time to versailles and said to the king that though he came to beg a favor of him yet it was not at all for his son who had now of a long time behaved himself so unworthily that he did not concern himself in any thing upon his account  but seeing as the case stood if he was sentenced to die the like sentence must necessarily pass against the chevalier de kailus who deserved much better than his son did that his condition and circumstances should be regarded he did therefore upon his account rather than upon his own supplicate his majesty to give orders that the whole affair might be well examined for if there was any credit to be given to those who waited on his son he had fought only upon an accidental rencounter and without any premeditated design to transgress his majestys laws it would have been a very extraordinary thing for a father who what faults soever his son has committed easily forgets them when his life is at stake thus to have expressed himself in good earnest but it was fit the count should use some art upon such an occasion he knew that sometimes prudence will oblige a man to blame those who he designs should be found innocent especially when he is speaking to those whom they are accountable to for what they have done and who are offended with them for as one seldom gains any thing by opposing a passionate man while his anger is at its height but upon the other hand brings him soonest to reason by seeming to go along with him in his sentiments so it is with regard to a prince who alleges that such a man has transgressed his laws and therefore deserves to be punished however the king having given him as favorable a reception as he could have desired answered him that both for his sons sake and for the sake of the chevalier de kailus he wished that it might be found so as he had heard but that he would be very soon informed of it for he had already given such strict orders about it that it was altogether needless to give any more  in the mean time the king came to be informed that it was upon madam chambonneaus account that they had come to fight and that she had industriously set them together by the ears by her false reports upon which he sent a letter de cachet ordering her to be banish d to rowan there were some young counselors of that parliament who got into a humor of courting her but she found a great difference between them and that great crowd of persons of quality who used to frequent her house at paris and being soon wearied of that town she would have languished to death but that she hoped that her friends would employ all their interests to have her recalled but as among the vast number of women who live as she did there are but few who are so fortunate as was ninon lendos that is there are but few of them who have the art to engage people to love them notwithstanding all the lewdness they can be guilty of so those who had seen her at paris forgot her much sooner than she thought of and at last having lost all her hopes she was so overwhelmed with grief that she died soon after  the duke de nevers who while she was at rowan knew his sons character better than to be afraid that he would be at the pains to go thither for the count de donzi is a man who can very soon forget both friends and mistresses the duke de nevers i say who had nothing to fear on that score got an order to set him at liberty but it was upon condition that he should go to moulins and wait there till the duke de vendome his cousin with whom he had made the last campaign and with whom he resolved that he should make the next should be in a readiness to set forward for the camp in the mean while mademoiselle de soissons left paris in obedience to the kings commands and went to her mother a brussels  this lady who while her husband was alive had been an honor to france as far as a costly and magnificent way of living can be accounted so had fallen on a sudden if i may so say from greatness and splendour into poverty and misery having been accused of poisoning her husband for which she was forced to make her escape into flanders without having so much as    hours allowed her to put her affairs in order if we may give credit to what she says herself she was altogether innocent of this crime and it was her mortal enemy the marquis de louvois who had forged that accusation against her because she would never be in friendship with him but whatever may be in this it is certain that at court she has always been reputed guilty of that crime whether it be that she has still powerful enemies there or that the king is convinced that she is not unjustly accused i cannot tell but there is not one that offers to espouse her interests before that mademoiselle de soissons went to that country it was reported that she would go to avignon and that madam de soissons her mother would go and live there also because she could not live any longer at brussels where every thing was so dear a certain woman named vendome who is well known at court not by her quality but because she brings thither sallads for the king and nobility which are better than any that comes from another hand hearing that this princess was brought so very low and remembering her former splendor that she had often seen was so touched with compassion for her that she sent her as much money as one of her small stock was able to spare and it is said that she received it yea and that she was very well pleased with it but this is what i cannot aver for a truth though i have heard it told to some persons of the greatest quality who may have known something of it themselves but i can scarcely believe that this princess was ever reduced to so great straits as to accept of so small a sum as that was and at least i wish it may not have been so after having my self been witness of the great pomp she formerly lived in yet it was commonly reported at court that had not the lady of a foreign princes minister supplied her with money she had not known how to satisfy her baker and butcher who dund her continually for the money she owed them  whatever was in this her family has been in a declining state these twenty five years past and is very much lower than it was before that time and this princesss son who should have raised it up again having been so lowspirited as to marry a girl who is unworthy of his birth has been obliged to go out of the kingdom because he found that he could not live in it with honor and if it be true that this princes mother was guilty of what was laid to her charge we may presume that all that has befallen her is the effect of divine justice which does not suffer that crimes of this nature should continue unpunished  mademoiselle de soissons was not the only person whose conduct the king endeavored to reform he took much the same measures with madam de la force who is one of the two daughters which the late marquis de castelmoron had left behind him the other was married to the marquis de bricquemau a name well know among the french protestants as well as that of de la force but that religion being now prohibited the marquis de bricquemau thought fit to obey the king who commanded all his subjects to be roman catholics  mademoiselle de la force had already had many intrigues which had made much noise and among others those with the marquis de nesle and with the president de brions son this last had disgraced her yet more than the other because this presidents son was but of a very mean extract in comparison of her for without having recourse to the idle fancies of the family of la force which pretends to be descended of the kings of england about which the genealogists are not agreed or to what is pretended that the name of nompart which they bear with that of caumont was given them because one of their ancestors killed a dragon which destroyed all that country where their chief possessions and interests in land do now lie i say that without laying any stress on these things it is certain that the family of la force is a very illustrious and a very ancient family it has produced two mareschals of france the one just after the other of the first of which the father mainbourg has given us a history which he has composed after his own fancy in his book of calvinism but he is so often mistaken in every thing that he has written that a man must be at pains to compose as many volumes as he has done if he would take in hand to discover all his mistakes but since we have occasion here to speak of this marshall who was called james i shall give a true and genuine account of what befell him at the massacre of st bartholomew quite different from what is given by that jesuit  charles ix having formed a design to catch all the protestants of france in one net and at the same time made as many of them as he could especially of the leading men among them come to court that he might cause them to be murdered so to speak in his own sight while by his orders the same was to be done upon the same day and at the same hour in all the parts of the kingdom it is not my business to tell here how it was possible that such a design could be executed without being discovered before hand to those against whom it was formed besides that though i should make all the plausible conjectures imaginable i could not expect to succeed better than they have done who have beat their brains to tell us their conjectures about it and at last i should be forced to confess as they do that it was a thing that god had resolved from all eternity and that he put a vail before the eyes of all those who were appointed to suffer that they might not know the imminent dangers that threatened them however this be jamess father being come to paris where he was called by the king and having brought along with him his two sons viz james and his elder brother he and they were among the first who were assassinated james was but fourteen years old but was of a much readier wit than is usual for boys of that age and he seigned himself dead upon his receiving the first blow that was the reason why he was left there and had no more wounds given him and lying stretched out at full length between his father and his brother who were killed dead he had also so much presence of mindas to take off a diamond of great value which his father had upon his finger and to put it in his mouth with an other which he had himself for he did not doubt but the people would soon come and strip them and take every thing that was about them and he was afraid that if he should keep nothing for getting his wound cured and for maintaining himself in some private place till the storm were over he might come to be starved to death it happened just so as he had guessed would all the people about the louvre where his father was lodged hearing what had been done came immediately to make all the advantages they could of the clothes of these murdered protestants the master of a tennis court that was in that part of the town who knew monsieur de la forces sons because they had played sometimes at the tennis which he kept happened by good luck to come to their house when he was going a pillaging as well as others he was so touched with compassion when he saw them in that condition that he cried out and spoke of it aloud though he was all alone  james who knew him thought that he might trust himself with him and tell him that he was not as yet dead the master of the tennis being overjoyed to see him yet alive bid him get up and go along with him and promised to keep him in his house and that he should not at all discover him but that he should be in as great safety with him as ever he had been in his own fathers house but because he had no cloak to give him and that he could not go out naked as he was for another had already stripped him of his clothes james therefore desired him to go and seek for one to him and to bring a lanthorn with him that he might have the greater benefit of his kind offers the master of the tennis brought him all that he had desired and a hat also and making him go before him as if he had been his boy he brought him to his house where his wife asked him who he was he told her that she was not concerned to know that and that she had nothing to do but to use him kindly she judged by this that he was some huguenot of note which she was yet more persuaded of when upon his finger she saw the diamonds which he had saved and she coveted very much to have them but not knowing any other way how to come by them she began to say to her husband that she was very desirous he should put him out of doors that she could not suffer him any longer to expose himself for his sake to those inconveniences that would inevitably befall him if it should ever come to be known that he had harbored such a guest her husband who had been forced to tell her who he was that the hopes she might have of being well rewarded one day might give her satisfaction endeavored to satisfy her with the same hopes but she had rather have what was present than what was but to come and she continued to press him that he would rid himself of this stranger telling him that it seemed he knew not well what he was doing when he put himself into so great hazard without any prospect of advantage the tenniscourt keeper finding that he could not satisfy her with reason advertised james of it that he might choose rather to go elsewhere than to expose himself to new dangers la force answered him that he would soon find a remedy for that he knew that this woman coveted his diamonds because she had many times spoken to him of them he therefore gave her one of them which procured him peace and quiet for some days but because that which he had kept to himself was the finest of the two and that he had given her only the least her wicked humor returned very soon insomuch that she disturbed her husband with her importunities as much as before he who was a man of much honesty could not approve of her behavior and reproved her sharply for it but finding that she persevered in her covetousness and that she valued her interest more than any other thing he spoke to monsieur de la force that he might have a care not to make a present to her of the other diamond and he told him that it would be much better for him that he should go to one of his friends houses and that if he knew any of them with whom he could trust himself he would go himself and ask him if he could be in safety at his house monsieur de la force answered him that he knew none but monsieur de biron and he entreated him to go to his house as from him and that he knew him to be so generous that he hoped he would make no difficulty o shelter him the master of the tenniscourt went thither and having asked a private audience of him he was surprised and overjoyed at the same time when he told him that the young la force was still alive monsieur de biron desired that he might come so soon as conveniently he could he came to his house immediately and that he might not be discovered monsieur de biron after he had discoursed a little with him put him in his livery as one of his pages and sent him to biron he was cured of the wound he received at the massacre and having taken post he stayed in guyenne till the persecution of the protestants was over he went afterward to the war where he signalized himself so gloriously that he came to be in greater esteem than any of his predecessors had ever been and he came to be so much in favor with henry the third and henry the fourth that he was made master of the kings wardrobe and captain of his lifeguards he afterward married monsieur de birons daughter in gratitude to him for having sheltered him when he was in hazard of his life and at last he was advanced to the dignity of duke and peer and marshal of france he died when he was eighty years of age loaded with riches and honor his son enjoyed all the same honors and having but one daughter she was married to monsieur de turenne the duchy of la force fell to the posterity of jamess second son who enjoy it at this time  mademoiselle de la force of whom we are now discoursing was descended also of the same james who was her grandfather but her way of living being altogether unworthy of the grandchild of so great a man who had lived always like a man of true honor and virtue the king caused a complement to be made her much like to that which had been made to mademoiselle de soissons he ordered that it should be told her that there were but two things of which she might choose one that was either to go out of the kingdom or to go in to a convent such an order as this was like a thunderbolt to this young lady but as there is no disputing with the king she chose the convent upon condition always that his majesty should give her wherewith to pay her board for though she had many intrigues in her time yet she was so much a beggar that she had not wherewith to maintain herself perhaps had she been richer she would not have gone and buried herself alive within the walls of a cloister but as necessity forces many people to do many things which otherwise they would not incline to it was impossible for her to take any other course than what she did there was one madam thaumur who underwent the same fate though she was married and her husband captain of the galleys of versailles yet he was so good natured as never to complain of her conduct but the king who had declared openly before all the court that he would not suffer any person to give ill example to another knowing that himself was charitable enough to comfort an old suisse for the loss of his wife caused her to be shut up among the penitent maids  this frighted a great many women whose conduct was nothing better than hers while all good people approved of his majestys resolution for the reformation of manners  he commanded the archbishop of paris that in his station he should vigorously pursue the same design as well as he did that prelate gave orders to the clergy of that great city that every one of them should enquire diligently within the bounds of his parish after those who lived licentiously whether under the pretense of their greatness or under pretense of clandestine marriage his majestys care extended also farther than this capital city for he sent the same orders to all the bishops of the kingdom the bishop of angers had a man in his diocese who was rather rich than of quality and who was in one of these two cases it was the count de serran who had been chancellor of monteur he lived familiarly with one madam racapee but it was not known how they came to live together whether they lived in whoredom or if there had been a clandestine marriage between them for these sorts of marriages are much in fashion at this time insomuch that we seldom hear of any other the bishop went and paid him a visit as he used frequently to do but after he had dined with him and with this lady who ordered all the affairs of his house he told him that he would not delay any longer to acquaint him with the reasons that had obliged him to pay him that visit that his majesty had commanded him to enquire of him what was the relation he was in to that lady who had the trust of every thing in his house for if she served him only for his pleasure and was not married to him he must resolve never to see her any more the count de serran knowing that his wealth which made him absolute in that country could do him no service in shifting a question that was put to him in the kings name was forced to own that they were married together the bishop answered him that his owning of the marriage was something and that he could discourse willingly with him upon the reasons which he offered him at the same time for having so long concealed it but that all that was not enough for such an answer as he must give the king that if it were only he who as bishop of the place came to enquire after it he would believe it upon his word but since his business was with the king it was absolutely necessary to show other proofs for it the count hearing him speak after such a manner went and searched for the marriagecontract which he had made with this lady and showed him at the same time a certificate of their marriage he asked for no more and having given an account of it to the king it has produced so good an effect that this count owns it openly in his family so that madam de racapee is now considered as his lady  about this time the city of paris came to have one of its principal magistrates changed though this office be neither ancient nor honorable i mean the office of lieutenant de police which was at its first institution in the year      bestowed upon monsieur de la reinie who is still alive for there was never any such magistrate before that time and all the parts of that office were performed by the lieutenant civil but his majesty considering that in so great a city as this metropolis it was too great a charge for one man to attend particular affairs and the more public concerns of the city at the same time he created this new office in his favor it is true political reasons obliged him to institute it as much as zeal for justice did for the king had found by experience while he was under age that this city alone was capable by its example to cause an insurrection throughout the whoe kingdom and therefore he thought fit to have a man there of his own appointment in whom he might put confidence who might narrowly observe every thing that was done in the city he settled twelve thousand franks a year upon this magistrate and monsieur de la reinie after he had discharged this office for at least    years becoming old and perhaps that he might complement the chief minister of state desired him some years ago that he would give him his nephew monsieur de bignon for his coadjutor  as this office gives a man much authority and interest at court upon which he immediately depends therefore monsieur bignon who is now intendant of picardy accepted of it by the advice of his parents and friends but being of a family that has been always obliging and full of humanity he became soon wearied of it for he saw that he could not discharge that office unless he became severe and rigorous and therefore he made an interest to be intendant of a province and obtained that of amies in the mean while monsieur de reinie growing now very old for he is about eighty years of age supplicated anew that he might be eased of this burden and that he might be allowed to sell his office the king granted his request upon condition that he should resign in favor of monsieur d argenson this gentleman is of much better quality than monsieur de la reinie and falls nothing short of him as to good sense besides that he has all necessary qualities to make himself to be feared and his very presence strikes dread if it does not create respect his father had been the kings ambassador to the republic of venice and his ancestors were equally famous for the gown and for the sword but it is seldom that a man grows rich by embassies and his father who is still alive spent a good part of his own estate in that employment so that his son had been forced to accept of an office that was below him that is to be lieutenant general of limoges but his good fortune having brought him to court and having got some commissions of which he so acquitted himself that the court was fully satisfied with what he had done he thereby opened the way to this employment we are now speaking of the lieutenant de police is answerable to the parliament of paris and therefore monsieur d argenson some days after he had entered upon his office went and paid a visit to the chief president and begged the honor of his protection this magistrate who has a grave aspect and affects to appear graver than he truly is received him the same way that he uses to receive all other people and heard his complement without so much as moving an eyebrow finding that he had done with it made him no answer but these three words safety cleanness light and immediately turned his back upon him monsieur d argenson would have been more surprised if he had not known his character but having known it of a long time he returned home thinking what could be the meaning of these three words and he soon found it out he understood easily that by the first he meant that he should take care of the night watch that no robberies or murders by night might be heard of in the city by the second that he should take care that those who had the charge of cleansing the streets should punctually do their duty and by the third that he should do the same as to those who have the charge of the lanthorns these three parts of this office made monsieur bignon nauseate it and there were also some other things in it that were no less disagreable to such a man as he is  however his niceness was much to monsieur de la reinies advantage for he got fifty thousand crowns from monsieur d argenson for resigning his place to him and he would have got much more had not the king determined the price the lieutenant de police pays no yearly tax to the king for his office as all the offices of long robe do except the chancellor the chief president of parliament and and the king gave monsieur dargenson a warrant of retension for a hundred thousand franks he entered upon the exercise of it by declaring war against all those whether men or women that used to play at lansquenet he had express orders for this from his majesty because he had observed that in some years before that unhappy game as well as the other game of basset had ruined a great number of the officers of his army who had been forced to quit their companies because they had lost all the money with which they should have raised recruits  monsieur bignon counselor of state who was the father of that gentleman i was just now speaking of came to die suddenly about this time without having any time to prepare himself for another world he had gone to bed at night after having taken his supper as he used to do without complaining of any pain or sickness but the next morning he was found dead in his bed the office of state which he had enjoyed would have been very convenient for his son who had nothing else to hope for by his death for all his estate was not sufficient to pay his debts but because the king had declared long ago that he would not at all make those offices like hereitary ones to descend from father to son he therefore thought it his interest to proceed cautiously in this matter and to take prudent measures before he should address himself to the king for it it was easier for him than it would have been for another man to bring about this design because he was the nephew of monsieur de ponchartrain who had served the king to very good purpose ever since the time that he was made comptrollorgeneral in the place o monsieur le pelletier there were few who could have acquitted themselves in so difficult a post with so much art and success as he has done at a time when the public affairs were in such a posture as they have always been in since he was called to it it is certainly matter of wonder and of amazement at the same time to see the difference betwixt the way of managing the kings revenues at this time and that which was taken under the ministry of cardinal mazarin for when there was need but of a million they were at incredible pains and toil to contrive a way how to raise it those who are acquainted with the history of those times know that when dunkirk was taken in the year      it could not be ransomed out of the hands of the english because we had not three millions of money to give for it for which sum we could have recovered it by virtue of a secret treaty with cromwell so that the king was forced to add a million more to that sum when he redeemed it some years after besides it was needful then to use all the political arts and pretenses imaginable before that such a sum could be raised whereas now if the king had use for fifty millions he has nothing to do but to speak the word and he has it so to speak in a quarter of an hour however monsieur pontchartrain did not rely so much upon his own merits as upon that account to flatter himself with the hopes of obtaining this favor to his nephew because of some difficulties which he foresaw must be removed before he could speak of it to his majesty the great difficulty was that the king had promised to monsieur de caumartin intendant of the kings revenues the first place that should fall void among the counselors of state he knew that the king was mindful of his promises and that he would not forget them but for very good reasons and therefore he spoke to monsieur de caumartin and told him he would oblige him very much if he would quit his pretensions in favor of his nephew as every man loves to oblige a minister of state so monsieur caumartin promised not to do any thing that could put his majesty in mind of what he had promised him but the king remembered it himself so that when monsieur de ponchartrain spoke to him for  bgnon he answered that he was very sorry he could not grant what he asked of him but there were two reasons that hindered him from doing it the one was that he had resolved not to set thse offices pass from father to son the ohter was that he was under a promise to give monsieur caumartin the first of those places that should fll  so monsieur caumartin was made counselor of state though he was willing to have renounced it at monsieur de pontchartrains desire the first time that he sat in council he pretended to take his place as if he had been always there from the first day he was named intendant of the revenues because these intendants have a brief of the crown as counselors of state but those whom he would have taken place of if he had succeeded in his claim opposing him in that matter the chancellor who was proper judge in it determined it in their favor two or three days before monsieur de bgnons death his brother who was chief president of the great council fell sick when his sickness appeared dangerous for he died of it within six or seven days after no body would tell him what had befallen his brother lest he should become apprehensive that he should soon follow him  but because his brother had come to see him in the beginning of his sickness but could not come afterward for he was in his grave he asked the only daughter he had if he had already forgotten him he had married this daughter to monsieur de verthamont master of requests who was already one of the richest men that wore a gown but who came to be much richer by succeeding him in his estate for this monsieur bignon had incomparably a greater estate than his elder brother he was worth at least four hundred thousand crowns yet his daughter was nothing the happier for that for her husband did not love her at all either because he thought she had not beauty enough to deserve that he should love her or because he was too much inclind to weching to love a wife for it was known that he had mistresss and she was forced to behave herself obligingly to them and to keep  with them that so she might be often in company with her huband for she had as much affection for him as he had indifferency for her  monsieur de verthamonts inclinations to the female sex his been  enough known of a long time though somewhile and he ell thereby into such an inconvent me as might have discouraged him from  for the  he was in love with a young girl that had so me brothers who were offices in the  she was at least of as good a family as had as but th was a vast diffrence betwixt the is fortunes and the was a poor as he was rich the  their sister to comply with him  take  measures as should  to give her a portion perhaps she  though they had not advised her to it and if we may believe what is repor of her she loved him as much as he loved her however this girl having given him an  is surprised him with her and  to be  hard upon him if he would not do them justice h offered them a considerable sum of mercy i they would let him go he had it not about him for it was a greater sum than a man usually carries in his pocket but having given them his noe he thought it even best to pay it without more ado that his misfortunes might not come to be talked of  if a certain knight of the holy ghost who is now at court could have thus compounded the matter with his ladys brothers perhaps he had never married her but these gentlemen were not for capitulating on such terms as the brothers of the former girl had done he was forced against his will to yield to their terms besides that it may be his note would not have been so well answered as was monsieur de verthamonts  but that i may not go farther from my subject i say that this magistrates lady having by some pretense or other satisfied her father when he complained that his brother came not to see him he died without knowing that he was gone before him and that he had paid that debt that all men must necessarily pay though his office was but of a late creation yet there were abundance of candidates for it for the place of chief president and especially of such a famous society as is the great council is not to be slighted when there is a fair opportunity of obtaining it but the king who has always a great regard to the children of his ministers when the offices they have enjoyed may without any bad conequence be disposed of as if they were hereditary bestowed it upon monsieur de verthamont for the reason why the places of counselors of state should not be so disposed of is that if the king should let them descend to the children or to the nearest kinsmen he should not have wherewith to reward those who serve him faithfully in the counsel and in the other offices of the gown for they serve not for any other end but that one day they may come to be counselors of state at least the hopes of this has been their great motive for some time past because we see that the king has chosen two or three of that body to be chancellors of the kingdom and therefore every one strives to recommend himself to his majesty by his diligence in his service whether in the intendancies or in any other commissions we may easily be convinced how much it is for the kings interest to have persons of this sort about him and perhaps he should not find them so exact and punctual in the discharge of their duty if it were not that they have always that recompense in their view as the fruit of all their labors  there were two other brothers died some days after the death of the two bignons and there was one strange thing observed of them that never any thing happened to the one but what befell the other at the same time they were twins and so like one another in the face that had not the one been a soldier and the other a lawyer so that their different garbs made them known the one would have been often taken for the other they were both much given to gaming and if one lost his money it was sure the other lost his also at the same time when he who went to the army was wounded the other was wounded also by a fall or some other accident if the one had a mistress that jilted him the other met with the same treatment from his in a word all the difference that ever was taken notice of was that the one continued a bachelor much longer than the other and there was nothing wanting in their whole life but that one thing to justify what is ordinarily said of children that are born at the same birth that whatever happens to the one inevitably befalls the other but perhaps he who continued a bachelor so long after the other was married did so because he thought his brother not very happy in his marriage there are some wives who give no great encouragement to men to venture upon marriage especially when they set up for wits and will pass a judgment upon every thing it is the two bauquemars of whom i am now speaking the one of them was marishal de camp and governor of bergues the other president of requests of the palace the king gave this government to the count de la motthe nephew of the late marshal d la motthe hudancur who was also marishal de camp the count a brion eldest son of monsieur le grand and who had the survivance of master of horse to the king fell at this time into an applex though he was not at most but thirty five years of age and it was so extreme vilnt that his face was disorted to that degree that not only his mouth stood awy but what was yet more mazing one o his eyes came dwn into the middle of his face his father and mother sent him to the waters of burbon and as he was upon hs journey thithe he sell into anter it of the same disease so that it was belived he was quite gone yet he recovered of it as he had doe of he first and having made out hi jurney the waters and the ntural strength of his youth rcovered him to a etter state of healh the kg  as alas loved his fat was o goo as to  how glad he was at hi rcovery bu  gave maame la   and mr sensible roofs of  every body she had a  ccerning the inheritance of  which she alleged  king alleed the contrary  to be well ouded because  which the dete  the portion of one of the sons of  fance and reurned always to the  were not heirs mae to enjoy it  madame la grande   his first cousin was not very rich  gie her only sixty thousand  of  for which reason it is that she travels only with one coch which is not very becoming a princess of the blood and especially a granddaughter of henry iv the king i say considering her poverty and that besides she had some reasons for her claim which seemed to answer his own reasons told her that if she pleased he would let her enjoy her sisters estate during her life upon condition that she should renounce the property of it this princess who desired only to be rich by the revenue without troubling her self with what might happen after her death consented very willingly to this proposal but his majesty has since that time had some scruples of conscience because he had only given her the profits of that estate during her life which perhaps belonged to her in property and therefore he has resigned the property in her favor as he had formerly done the revenue this tenderness of conscience that will not allow this prince to do any thing for which it may reproach him had made him reflect often upon many things that had passed during his reign which might be represented in other colors than those were which had been made use of to persuade him to undertake them he saw that his whole kingdom was in a flame and that there was no other way to extinguish it but by restoring a great number of places which his enemies alleged he had taken only by force of arms and because he found it for his own convenience to have them without having any other right to them if he had pleased he might perhaps not only have let all europe see the contrary since he can give good reasons for what he has done but he could have also maintained his right to those places y his arms since in despite of the prodigious consederacy that has been formed against him he has always had the advantage of his enemies ever since he first perceived their designs against his crown  however as his majesty has of a long time been chiefly concerned with his eternal salvation the care of which has made many scruples arise in his conscience so we admired and were astonished to see that on a sudden he had offered to deliver up the towns of strasburg and luxenburg which were the strongest barriers of his kingdom nay he offered also to deliver up many others which it must be confessed were taken airly with sword in hand when his enemies were witnesses of his victories and could no longer resist his arms though they were all assembled against him so that it seems just to say that he had a right to keep them or at least to demand the equivalent of them but the king considered that  would break this dreadful conspiracy and restore peace to his people who groaned under e burden of the most cruel war that ever was raised against any sovereign he must part with his own interests he had sent long ago the steu de callirs to holland to make proposals of peace he addressed himself to that people rather than to any others because he knew that the states which subsist only by trade would hearken sooner than any of the rest would do when one spoke to them of putting an end to a war which troubled them upon all quarters besides the dutch could gain nothing by the continuance of it for they were not like the house of austria which flatters it self that by the continuance of war it shall at last recover that supreme power that it once had in the time of charles the fifth there was not one of the alles except only this house who could hope to make any advantage of what was then doing in europe insomuch that it may be justly said that all the princes who were in that confederacy had taken up arms only for the interests of the house of austria for all the conquests they could hope for from the king must have belonged to it and though the princes of the empire had other pretensions yet seeing they find by long experience that the emperor makes use of them if i may be allowed to speak so only as the ape made use of the cats foot to take the chestnuts out of the fire and that he has always known how to make use of the right of sequestration to which he pretends to his own advantage and their loss and that at the peace of nimiguen he kept philipsburg to himself though it belonged to the bishop of spire they could therefore easily see that they exhausted themselves only for his sake and that they could expect no benefit by it themselves and though they had run headlong into the confederacy against his majesty when it was proposed to them yet that was only because of the fears they were under from the greatness of his power they considered that it was their misfortune to have their dominions lying between two princes whom they ought equally to suspect and that they should do best to declare against him who seemed to be in the greatest readiness to ruin them rather than against the other who was not as yet in a condition to hurt them these were the considerations that formed the bonds which united them so firmly with the emperor and which became the more indissoluble that his imperial majesty found a way how to keep these princes in a dependence upon him by making them believe that the king had violated the treaties of munster and nimiguen and was a sworn enemy of the empire it was not in his majestys power at that time to address himself either to them to inform them of his good intentions or to the english because they had set a prince upon their throne whom his majesty had not acknowledged as their lawful king and whom he also considered as the very soul of the confederacy that had been formed against him it is true the hollanders had a sort of dependence upon this new king both because he was their stateholder and because of a strict union between him and the chief men of their republic yet as his majesty was resolved to acknowledge this prince at last for king of england so he believed that what bonds soever might be betwixt him and the dutch they would never coldly entertain the proposals which he cesigned to make them especially when they should see that by removing this one obstacle there would be no great difficulty to obtain a general peace and truly monsieur de callieres needed not to have been at great pains to make them sensible what were like to be the ill consequences of the war as well for themselves as for the princes of the empire that he might thereby persuade them that it was their interest to concur with his majesty in restoring peace to europe they knew their own interests too well not to be sensible that their own safety as well as the safety of many other potentates consisted in keeping france and austria in a balance or to speak more properly in keeping them in equality to one another seeing they serve as counterweights to all the princes of christendom to save them from falling under the power either of the one or the other for just as in a balance we see that when one side is much heavier than the other if a sufficient weight be put into that other scale then both are equal so has it always been since these two families interfered with one another all the princes of europe have acted by the same rule in assisting the weakest of the two and putting a stop to the growing power of the other and this maxim is observed at this time and has put the sword in the hands of so many potentates who were formerly in his majestys interests especially the hollanders and the princes of the empire who found no protection either so ready or so safe as his was when they were like to have been subjected to the house of austria  however the hollanders finding by the proposals the king made and his offers to deliver up so many places that if they could not bring these two houses to a just equality yet they should at least make a peace upon such terms as that they needed not be so very much afraid of his majestys power they gave monsieur callieres a very favorable reception yet they would not grant him a passport but by allowance from the prince of orange and before they would enter into any conferences with him they would first see if the powers he had brought from his majesty were in good form but they could be in no better form than they were since they were sealed with the great seal of france there was one thing that much hindered this treaty which was that the hollanders would do nothing without the consent of england and their other allies but this was nothing but what monsieur callieres expected for before he came from france he doubted very much that he could persuade them to enter into a separate treaty with the king yet that had been done at the treaty of nimeguen where his majestys plenipotentiaries found a way how to make them jealous of the prince of oranes power so that they made have to make a separate peace which did soon oblige all the other allies to an accommodation with the king but it was not fit at this time so much as to propose what they were able then to effectuate the dutch became sensible of their mistake and they would take care not to fall into it again but callieres who as i have said had considered of this before and who had orders from the king not at all to acknowledge the prince of orange for king of england till he should be assured of the peace found out an expedient for reconciling the orders he had from the king his master with this difficulty which the dutch made not to treat without the consent of their allies it was that they should not come to a final conclusion in any thing without their approbation but if they found reason to agree to any thing they might communicate it to them and that convenient measures might be taken afterward there was no inconveniency in following this advice and the dutch were satisfied with it and by consent of their allies too they demanded as preliminaries of this treaty the restitution of lorrain and of the towns of strasburg and luxenbourg callieres consented in the kings name both to the one and the other but upon condition that lorrain should be restored to the duke of that name upon such terms as had been agreed to at the treaty of nimeguen the president cann who took care of the duke of lorrains interests in holland opposed this under pretense that when his master engaged in the confederacy it was promised that peace should never be made till he had full satisfaction he represented to the confederates that if his dominions were not restored to him but upon the terms of the treaty of nimeguen he should be so far from reaping any advantage by the confederacy that he should be a loser by it since he could have made a much better market had he taken other methods by which he might have been put in possession of his dominions before the war but having thought himself obliged to follow his fathers example who would not hear of these conditions near twenty years ago it was very hard for him now after so many years to find that no better conditions were offered him  but as great potentates who are well pleased to engage those in their interests who are much inferior to them in power that they may be the more successful in their designs take not much care of their concerns when they have no more use for them so the allies after having spoke once or twice of this affair thought it not worth their while to insist any longer upon it mr president canon gave in several memoirs concerning it and they told him that they would take time to consider them before any thing were concluded and though the emperors ministers joined with him for obtaining full satisfaction to this duke yet neither the one nor the other were able to effectuate any thing things being thus far advanced upon the part of the dutch and the english having as strong inclinations for a peace as they had because of the many prizes that were taken from them at sea which had brought their trade very low it was agreed upon all hands that plenipotentiaries should be named for bringing that to perfection which as yet was only begun but they had some difficulty to agree upon the place of the congress the emperor would have had it in some town of germany and the king would not hear of that proposal but his imperial majestys great desire was to protract time for he was not very desirous of the peace because so long as the war should last he knew that he was master of all the princes of the empire who were obliged to obey his absolute commands and he was afraid that if the peace should be concluded they might come to open their eyes and be sensible of their true interests and to perceive that in being so earnest for the increase of his power they should themselves be the authors of his usurpations upon their own liberties and prerogatives but there was also another thing in his view in which he consulted his own interest when he desired that the treaty might be in some town of the empire for since the peace with savoy the king was superior in forces to all the confederates having sent all the troops which had served in that country from thence into germany and the emperor was afraid lest mentz should be besieged which would have been no difficult enterprise had the king thought fit to employ his forces that way  but if he could not obtain that mentz should be the place yet he thought at least they would be satisfied that frankfort should be it and that a neutrality should be established for    or    leagues round about that town so that mentz should be comprehended in it but the king being stiff in this matter and the dutch having proposed the hague for the place of meeting it was  agreed to that those whom his majesty should name for his plenipotentiaries should reside at dlf which is ut one leagues distant from it and  were to be named by the other princes  reside at the hague and that the conferences should be kept at the castle of ryswick which stands in the middle and is equally distant from these two places  though the emperor consented to this as well as the rest of the confederates yet it was a long time before he sent his  thither which was a proof that he loved manner that the war should continue than that a peace should be concludeds for the king he made no deay to name monsieur courtin counselor of rate his plenipotentiary a man every way capale of such an employment and who had acquited himself very honorably in many negotiations of great importance but he befought the king to excuse him in this because he found his eyes so bad that it was to be feared he should lose his sight altogether it vexed the king to think that he m look out for another and he was at pains to examine him if perhaps there were some secret reasons which hindered him from embracing this employment but having at lust found that  in good earnest he namd in his place monsieur de harlay the chancellors soninlaw who is also a counselor of state he gave him monsieur do creci for his colleague and honored also monsieur de callieres with the same title of plenipotentiary there were great things talked of this mans conduct though i do not see that there was need of much art to do all that he did for a man has no occasion to show how well he is qualified for negotiations of state unless he have to struggle with great difficulties which at last he overcomes by his prudent conduct and brings the whole affair to a happy issue for the interest of the prince that has employed him but this could not be said of monsieur callieres who had made the confederates listen to his proposals only by promising in the kings name that he would deliver up to them a great number of places which they could not have been able to retake by force of arms in twenty years time though they had been much stronger than they were monsieur de harlay had been already employed in some secret negotiations but had not been successful in them but he and monsieur callieres had a third person joined with them in the great affairs they were now to be employed in who could direct and assist them when they met with difficulties that were too hard for them i mean monsieur de creci who is one of the best qualified men in france for affairs of this nature he and monsieur de harlay took their journey together that they might be at the place of the congress in due time but they were not very well satisfied with one another company monsieur de harlay was dssatisfied because monsieur de crecis reputation eclipsed his own and monsieur de creci because monsieur de harlay carried it so high as if he had undervalued him  the dispositions they were both in made them soon give some proofs that they were dissatisfied with one another for being come to lisle there was one le normand a farmergeneral who took upon him to regale them he was one of monsieur de crecis friends upon which account he detained them there a whole day longer than they intended to have staid and that they might not blame him for making them lose so much time he gave them flying coaches to carry them ten or twelve leagues farther on their journey but he put his friend monsieur de creci into the finest coach with the finest horses in it while monsieur de harlay got but a sorry coach and horses with such collars as draught horses use to have instead of harness this vexed monsieur de harlay very much who presumed that if there was any distinction to be made between them it should have been to his advantage the farmergeneral might have perceived by his looks that he did not take it well of him and he was heard to say behind his back that those who from nothing came to possess good estates could never learn to behave themselves like gentlemen however he made use of the coach and horses such as they were but gave not many thanks to him who had provided them  these two plenipotentiaries had met with a number of people betwixt paris and lisle who wished them a good journey and in the mean time besought them earnestly to put an end to their miseries by concluding a happy peace they were not at all surprised at this for before they took their journey they knew how much france needed it and we may easily judge how much the treasure of the kingdom was exhausted when we consider what taxes and subsidies must have been paid to the king to enable him to resist so many forces as had conspired against him he had no less than  00000 men under pay by sea and by lard which no doubt will appear incredible to posterity it was necessary that people of all ranks and conditions within the kingdom should bear their proportionable share of this burden so that in imposing the taxes there was a necessity to do every thing so to speak by weight and measure that no man might be oppressed or obliged to pay more than his proportion and this is what the kings ministers have done with so much conduct and prudence that though every man is sensible of his own loss yet it is nothing in comparison of what it would have been if those affairs had been managed by persons of less skill and art than they are however these plenipotentiaries saw the same thing in flanders that they had seen in france that is they saw that the people there were no less weary of the war than the french they likewise besought them with the greatest earnestness to use their utmost endeavors for succeeding in the treaty which they were going to negotiate at last they came to delf where the houses were become so dear since the people of that town knew that they were to come thither that they could scarcely be had for money  while these things were a doing the procuratorgeneral whom the king had ordered to enquire into the matter of the duel that had been fought between the bailist d auvergne and the chevalier de kailus gave him an account of the discovery he had made in it but it was not at all to their advantage he reported that according to the affidavts that were made before him it was far from having been an accidental rencounter as their parents had alleged that never duel was more clearly proved and therefore he desired to know what orders his majesty would give about it his majesty ordered that they should be arraigned indicted and tried as criminals so that the same officer having caused it to be published through the city by sound of trumpet as is usual upon such occasions the parliament met and outlawed them by his majestys edict against duels they ought to have been hanged in effigy but the king consented privately to remit something of that rigor because of the kindness he had for their parents and they were only condemned to lose their heads which was accordingly executed at the greve where their pictures were put up but were not suffered to be long there for there were some people took them away about an hour after that is in the twilight of the evening these sorts of things are very ordinary in france insomuch that it is commonly said that there is not one great family in the whole kingdom but what the like has happened to and what has had ladies and daughters of naughty lives and therefore the parents of these two unhappy young gentlemen were not much afflicted with the loss of their sons nor were less in favor at court than they had been before the cardinal de douillon who is the bailiff d auvergnes uncle made a jest of what his nephew had door and of what had befallen him in which his eminence was not like many other people who had rather be egaged in the most difficult affair in the world than e accountable for a duel and it is certain that the mssicurs de la frette could never extricate themselves out of those troubles which they brought upon themselves    or    years ago by quarrelling with the prince de chalais as they were coming out of the palais royal they ght  against our but though all of them or at least the greater part of them were of the first falies of the kingdom nay though the ppe himself interceeded for a remission to them yet the king would never grant them one so that some of them died making their escape to one part others to another and of all those that were engaged in that duel i know none alive but the elder la frette and the marquis de flammarin it is true the marquis d autin the eldest brother of monsieur de montpan lost his life in this quarrel having been wounded in the vena cava so that he died upon the spot i the count d auvergne was afflicted for the loss of his eldest son he was in some measure comforted by what the monks of cluni did for one of his younger sons when he was not thinking of it the cardinal de janson the kings ambassador at rome had desired that his majesty might be pleased to recall him and the cardinal de bouillon had got a commission to succeed him and he being abbot of cluni he visited that abbey as he was going to rome he is always very obliging and engages all that know him to wish him well so soon as he told these monks that he was going to rome and that perhaps he might never see them any more they replied that they should be very sorry if that should happen but if it should be the good will of god so to order it they would at least before they took leave of him give a testimony of the deep sense they had of that kindness and concern which his eminence had always shown for them they told him no more of it that day but on the morrow they ordered that a bell should be tolled for a meeting of the chapter and then they chose monsieur d auvergne who is the cardinals nephew for his coadjutor they brought this good news to his eminence who knew not the cause of their meeting and they told him at the same time that since he was going to rome and that it belonged to the pope to confirm their election they did not doubt but he should obtain that favor of his holiness when ever he thought fit to ask it and they took leave of him with this compliment for which his eminence thanked them very heartily for this is one of the most genteel and most honorable abbeys in france though it be none of richest yet it has seven or eight thousand livres of revenue but that for which it is most to be valued is that it has benefices at it is gift to the value of near a million of revenue so that the abbot of this place has many opportunities to make new creatures to himself and to reward those whom he has already  the cardinal de bouillon would fain have carried along with him monsieur de coulanges who is a pleasant sort of a man and what he says is very diverting he drinks composes and sings and he has good skill in sauces and ragoos and in a word he knows how to spend his time agreeably which makes many people desire his company he had once stayed with his eminence in his abbey of pontoise where he had always people of his own choice at his table he had formerly traveled to rome with monsieur de chaulnes and he was as well known there to the cardinals as was the ambassador himself but he refused cardinal bouillon what he had granted the other and excused himself under pretense of some affairs whether what he pretended was true or not i cannot tell the instruction of greatest importance which his eminence carried to rome was concerning the affairs of poland where the question was who should be chosen king of that kingdom because john sobieshi who had possessed that throne since the year      died in      he had left many children by his queen whom he had married before he was promoted to the royal dignity her maidenname was francoise de nation daughter of the marquis d arquyen of whose family there was once a mareshal of france under the name of montigny her birth should have united her closely to the french interests but women resent the affronts or the refusals they meet with more highly than others do she had become an enemy to the king long ago because he would not grant her the favor she desired of him which was to make her father duke and peer of france ever since which time she has done all was in her power against france and has not kept those measures that prudence and civility obliged her to insomuch that she caused some insolences to be done to the marquis de vitrich the kings ambassador the king her husband who though he was a man not only of as great valor as any in the world but of great experience in war of which he gave sufficient proof at his raising the siege of vienna when the infidels besieged it ann      yet he was not a man of so much prudence in other actions of his life for while he was upon the throne he behaved himself rather like a private man than a sovereign his chief care was to hoard up money without taking any pains to make creatures and friends to himself and his children he never considered how necessary these were for placing one of his posterity upon the throne after his death or if he did consider this he has thought that they could always make themselves friends by the treasures which he should leave them and therefore he sold all the palatinates that came to be void as well as every other thing with which the former kings of poland used to gratify the nobility and gentry of that kingdom these practices had alienated the hearts of his subjects from him as well those who had bought those places as those who expected to have had them in gift and without money so that his children were far from having any ground to hope that they should have the same good fortune that three several families who possessed this crown successively had formerly had i mean the families of mamcllus jagellon and palatin whose children so long as they had any succeeded to the throne so that it did not pass into any other family than their own  however the king having advice of all this thought to place a prince of his own blood upon that throne who was a subject and such a one too as the polanders must always have to be their king for they are a people that soon despite their prince unless he be a brave man and capable to lead their armies himself in person without which qualification he has buy a melancholy life among them  the last of the palatins who enjoyed that crown was an instance of this and it is known that this people obliged him to apdicate so soon as they perceived that his conduct did not answer to that of his ancestors the prince whom the king proposed was francis lewis de bourbon prince of conti who in this war which his majesty had maintained against the greater part of europe has given such extraordinary proofs of his valor and conduct that all the army said openly that the very spirit and soul of the late prince of conde his uncle who was one of the greatest captains that ever france had was returned to this world and had taken possession of the prince of contis body that he might save his king and his country from the confederacy that was formed against them i know that this way of expressing themselves was altogether extraordinary and new but as it was impossible for them to express more emphatically the just ecem they had for that prince as a singularly brave man so this way of speaking passed so current and was so often repeated that his reputation for true courage is established in foreign countries as well as in france though this prince is not rich yet he sent  00000 crowns of his own money into poland to gain the suffrages of those who had already inclinations for him only upon the account of his great fame for as this is the only time of harvest with the great men of poland so a prince needs never pretend to their crown unless he will sow before hand that they may reap the fruits of it the more that this prince had of true merit the more was sobieskis widowqueen enraged against the king she entertained hopes to have her eldest son prince james chosen to succeed his father and for this very end she had married him to a sister of the empresss and of the queen of spains that he might have the emperors assistance but all the assistance in the world being of no use in that country unless it be supported with liberal donatives and she being narrow and penurious that way as her husband was the prince of conti would have soon carried it against prince james had there been no other competitors for it  the queen of poland finding that she could hardly succeed in her designs for her eldest son endeavored to persuade monsieur l abbee de polignac the french ambassador to alter his measures by offering that if he would recommend the duke de vendome to be chosen king instead of the prince of conti she would unite her friends with his upon condition that the duke should marry her so soon as he was chosen at the same time she sent two of her sons to paris under pretense of traveling but her true designs was that they might be spies at the french court and might see if the king was in such a condition to support the prince of contis pretensions as the abbee de polignac pretended for it was reported in poland and almost in all foreign countries that france was drained both of men and money and that it was so far from being able for such an undertaking that it was upon the brink of ruin unless a peace was speedily concluded the abbee de polignac gave the king an account of the queen of polands proposals but at the same time advised him not to trust her and assured him that she would rather make her faction join with that of the house of austria than with the prince of contis for she had so far forgotten that she was a born subject of france that she thought of nothing so much as how to embarass all his majestys projects and designs in the mean time the two princes alexander and constantine younger brothers of prince james came into france and that they might make the french court entertain a better opinion of their mother than i did from the account that the abbee de polignac had given of her they brought along with them near three millions of gold and put eight hundred thousand crowns of it into the townhouse i e the bank of paris the queen of poland designed by this to let the world see she had not renounced france as the abbee de polignac had insinuated and that she was resolved to settle her two sons in that kingdom in case they could not  with honor but besides that this  seemed for her interest she made also  strantage by that gold which she had sent  for as to its fineneis it was much below the standard of the french coin yet it was taken into the mint as if it had been the finest gold in the world for the king stood so much in need of money that he was content to take it as it was when these two princes were come to paris and to the court they were soon convinced by the luxury they saw in both these places that the reports which had been industriously spread in poland were altogether false they betook themselves to those diversions that princes of their age do usually entertain themselves with they went to all the balls that they heard of and there was one thing besel them that deserves we should give an account of it  being at one of these balls with five or six gentlemen of their retinue who were masked as well as themselves there was there one of the mousquetaires of the kings household who had put on the habit of a counselor and was therewith disguised he chanced to meet with the young princes whom he did not know and told them very gravely that it was to no purpose that they should put themselves to so much trouble in a business wherein they could not succeed and therefore as their counsel he would seriously advise them to agree with their adversary otherways they would be cast in their suit the two princes had received letters from poland the day before wherein they had the bad news that the queen their mother despaired of succeeding in her designs and this news had spread through the town so that they never reflected that this discourse was said innocently and without any other design but that it might suit with the garb he had then put on they imagined on the other hand that he had spoken with relation to the news they had received and they were so enraged against him that they thought it not enough to call him villain and rogue and that he was but an insolent rascal to behave himself with so little respect to them but they also bastinadd him soundly the poor counselor finding that he had but a bad cause to plead for himself began to cry out what do this to me a mousquetaire to me as those of the company of mousquetaires use to do when they find that they have to deal with too strong a party but the princes of poland pulling off their masks that it might be known who they were there was not so much as one person that would come to the assistance of the poor bastinadod mousquetaire he marched off with the blows he had received and resolved to complain to the king from whom he expected more justice no doubt he had reason to demand it and would certainly have obtained it if he had had to do with those of hit own rank but the princes were beforehand with him in complaining to his majesty and he had the hard fortune to be sent to prison so soon as he offered to speak of it by this treatment and by what he had before met with he became sensible that it was not for his interest to take up a trade that he had no skill in and therefore he resolved never to profess it any more or if he did he would never give counsel but to those who asked it of him the one of these princes was much handsomer than the other and the king was resolved to give them the blew ribban i e to make them knights of the holy ghost this was to do good for evil for the queen their mother never failed to do all that was in her power to traverse his majestys designs when they gave her advice of this she sent an express to them and told them that she was surprised to find that they had so much as listened to such a proposal since they could not but know that if they accepted of it they should thereby act directly contrary to the interests of their family that they knew how a she was engaged in the interest of the house of austria and that they must follow her example in adhering closely to that house by this it is manifest that she had altogether forgotten her native country ever since she was put to it to keep up the splendor of her childrens family by endeavoring to raise her eldest son to royal dignity these princes having received these orders from their mother gave the king thanks for the honor he had offered to do them but excused themselves for not accepting of it they frequented the balls as formerly though they were sometimes engaged in other business as particularly with the marquis de coaquin a person of quality in brittany who had but a little before married one of the marshal de noailles daughters  this was no ill match for him especially seeing the mareshal was so much in favor the king had given him the command of his army in catalonia though he was not a man of so much experience as many others for except that he had commanded some troops in the time of peace because he was first captain of the lifeguards all the preferment he had come to was to be aid de camp to his majesty but the king added yet another honor to this and made him mareshal of france in the year      though no body could see that he had done any great things to deserve such a preferment however whether it be that his majesty knows peoples merits better than others do or if fortune which has favored him in all his undertakings designed to approve of his choice this mareshal gained very soon a considerable battle he had formerly taken the towns of roses and gironne and then it was said of him that though he had not done any thing to deserve the mareshals staff when he first received it yet he had afterward made it appear that he was worthy of it his father who was one of cardinal mazarins creatures had been also a captain of the lifeguards and it was his fortune to be raised to that post when he was least expecting it it was in the kings minority and the occasion of it was this the queen mother had become jealous of the count de terms who was provided of the same charge so that he was forced to remove from the kings person at a time when it was his turn to have waited upon him when he was dismissed she ordered that another captain of the guards should take his batton but they had all promised to one another to do nothing to the prejudice of their fellowofficer for which the count de charost was banished and monsieur de chandenier was yet more unfortunate for the queen took his commission from him and gave it to the marshal de nouailless father so that he was never able to recover it though he lived a long time after it was not for want of time that he could not succeed nor was it for want of conjunctures that seemed favorable enough for him for he was of the same family that madam de mortepan was of and since he was not more guilty than the count de charost who was soon recalled from his banishment and made duke and peer of france it may be said that there is nothing in this world but good or bad fortune for this man was so far from being in a worse condition because of his disobedience that he raised his fortune to such a degree that he could not desire to raise it higher while the unfortunate marquis de chandinier was quite undone with his fall  though it be to the only late duke de nouailles that his family owes the present greatness to which it has arrived yet it must be confessed that it is an ancient and honorable family i know that the present madame de bouillon when she was striving for the door with the duchess de nouailles spoke of her and her family with so much disdain that if her word could have been taken for it the family of nouailles should have been thought a very despicable one i know also that she produced some old papers by which it was found that one anthony de nouailles had been steward of the house to the viscount de turenne but as stewards of the house at that time were usually gentlemen and as there are younger brothers of good families who are forced to condescend to meaner things than he did so that one instance ought not to give us any mean opinion of that family which is certainly very noble and very ancient and it cannot to be said that the marquis de coaquin matched below his quality when he married a daughter of it though it be true that his family has sometimes made greater alliances for not to go far back his mother was rohan chabot and his grandmother orleans longueville he had a great estate in brittany which his mother resigned in his favor as she did almost every thing she could claim by her marriagecontract and for her dowry for this is a lady of extraordinary virtue and so soon as she had put her affairs in order she resolved to retire into a convent and reserved nothing to herself but  0000 livres per ann which was by very much less than what she had a right to if she had exacted so much as she might have done her son was but    years old when he married mademoiselle de nouailles but he was as tall a man as he could expect to be at    and his mother importuned him to take a wife because he was the only child his father had left this lady had not been very happy in her marriage though she was of an agreeable complexion and of a very good air yet she had not so much beauty as to please her husband and since she knew by her own experience what disgusts husbands use to take at their wives when they are not altogether agreeable she ought at least to have chosen an handsome lady for her son that he might not fall into the same immoralities that her husband had done but this was what she had thought least of and she had soon reason to repent of it for upon the morrow after the marriage when some of her sons friends came to pay him their compliments upon that occasion he could not forbear telling them that they needed not give themselves that trouble that his mother had chosen a dwarf for him instead of a wife that it seemed she who was a devout lady had made this choice because the duke de nouailles was devout also but for his part he wished his wife more so than either of them that he might not be troubled with lying with her and that he was resolved henceforth to treat her as a relic that is that he should never come near her but upon holy days from that day he gave such proofs of his want of affection to her that all the family took notice of it they all consulted what was fit to be done in such a case that monsieur de coaquin might not engage himself in those lewd coures that husbands use to betake themselves to when they come to despise their wives the archbishop of paris who is the mareshals brother was called among the first to give advice in this matter and they all agreed that because the new married lady was pale as death which made her the more disagreeable to her husband it was therefore necessary to find out some expedient to give her a better color they had recourse to painting which is highly esteemed among the ladies who by daubing their faces with white and red make themselves look to be of as fine complexions as they pleae but many of the more scrupulous sort of people were surprised when they heard that so good a man as this prelate and so devout a lady as the dowager of nouailles had advised such a thing as that but though the archbishop of paris and the duchess de nouailles did not only cause this ladys face to be painted with white and red but also caused shoes to be made for her with heels that were a quarter of an ell high that she might thereby appear so much the  yet she was as unlovely in the eyes of her husband as she had been before nay he thought her the more ugly upon this very account insomuch that instead of conversing with her he entreated his friends who spoke to him sometimes of her and of his father in law that if they would oblige him they would not so much as speak either ill or good of them in the mean time he endeavored to comfort himself as well as he could with good cheer and in the company of some ladies whom he visited not upon the account of any familiar converse but that he delighted to vex them and they were never more out of humor than when they saw him come into their company so that they would gladly have gone out at the window to shun any converse with him if they could have done it  the mareshal de nouailles who has had more than twenty children by his lady though she be not to this time much above forty years had as yet another daughter to marry there was a great difference between her and madam de coaquin the one was as agreeable as the other was deformed which made one say to the marquis de coaquin that the mareshal had given him leah but had kept rachel there was abundance of young gentlemen who were suitors to this new rachel both because her father was much in favor at court and because she herself was so great a beauty the count d estrees who came to be happier than the rest for it was he that married her was of the number of those who made their addresses to her his ambition carried him to this as much as any thing else he considered that though he was of a family which is in the possession of more honors in the person of his father and his two uncles than any other family is yet that was nothing to him unless he could attain to the like honors for though his fathers elder brother was duke and peer of france and that his son had succeeded to him in the same honors and though his father was mareshal of france and his uncle a cardinal yet he himself had no place or rank at court and was only considered there as a person of quality as ten thousand others are so that he saw nothing that could satisfy his ambition unless he went aboard of the fleet where he would be obliged to signalize himself because he had the survivance of the office of vice admiral which his father was in possession of his uncle the cardinal who had a greater kindness for him that for the duke d estrees though he was his nephew as well as he and by his elder brother too advised him to this marriage and he used his utmost endeavors to bring it about as the only means whereby he might be made a duke as his cousin was and he was so earnest in this affair that he sent word to the duke de nouailles tha if he could presume so much upon his favor a to employ him to procure a dukes patent to his nephew he should marry his daughter without one farthing of portion and he promised also to make him his heir and to make the inheritance as good as he could the duke de nouailles who had not much money to give with his daughter and who had given no great portion with madame de ceaquin though he had made a show of contracting for  franks but it was in cats are rats  to  that is he had given him a regiment and some other lesser preserments the duke i say was not so rich but that he had  to be  and sparing of his money and he was well  with the proposal but he was  to be ond of it and  to him  in the  had better  to that honor upon the a  fathers great services  had with the king but  to marry his daughter  he had to  was true he had more  others to carry on such  he was captain of the  him an easy access to the kings person but that was not enough for a matter o so great importance and therefore he ought no to trust to it so much but that besides marrying his daughter he should take all the same measures he would do if he were to marry another but it was very difficult for the count d estrees to take those measures because the mareshal would not give him so much money as was necessary to put his affairs in a good condition for want of this they resolved upon all hands to deal with one madame de thoist a rich lady she was the widow of a maiere de comptes and she had lent a considerable sum to the cardinal d estrees and was not paid of it and besides she was a friend of the duke and duchess de nouailles and because she had no children they told her so often that she ought to adopt mademoiselle de nouailles for her daughter that though they could not prevail with her to leave her all her estate yet they persuaded her to do something for her and she offered at last to give her what the cardinal d estrees owed her but because they would have more the matter is put off to this time for she will not give away all her estate in her own lifetime yet she promises that besides the sum which the cardinal owes her which she is willing to part with presently she shall also consider this young lady in her will so that she shall be sure of something more at her death that which sell out between the princes of poland and the marquis de coaquin was not at all for his advantage if we may believe what is commonly reported in the mean time they took their journey to return into their own country after they had been magnificently regaled by many persons that belonged to the court monsieur de langlee who is none of the least considerable of them if we consider nothing but his expensive way of living was the first who gave them a splendid entertainment and acquitted himself very handsomely in it he is now in possession of being the first who regales strangers of great quality upon their arrival which made the king say some time ago i e before the arrival of the two princes that monsieur langlee seemed to be made for no other end but to entertain all the strangers that came to court but he entertains persons of quality who are of the french nation as magnificently as he does strangers there is not a man about the court that regales our princes and princesses so often as he does and he has got into a custom of providing a collation for the dauphin as often as he comes to the opera it is but of late that he was in a condition to acquit himself well in such an undertaking for though his father who was once but a poor man and of mean extract made up some small estate to him yet it was far from being sufficient for such costly entertainments he has raised his estate by gaming which has put him in a condition to build so many fine houses and by which he has so great yearly revenues and considering the first years of his gaming and now that he is become rich it may be said of him what was once said to the president bellievre by one that designed to flatter him i confess that the beginning of this discourse would be insipid but that it is agreeable to the first beginnings of his fortune and that the last part of it would be impertinent but that it suits with his present circumstances  this president who was the chief man in the parliament of paris had always some debate with cardinal mazarin whom he did not much esteem and it may be the cardinal had as little esteem for him and perhaps he was in the right too however the man i just now spoke of knowing what opinion this chief president had of his eminence said to him once whilst they were speaking of him that no great account was to be made of such men whose fortunes were volatile and what show soever they made yet they were but like glaring meteors which disappeared in a short time but on the other hand he said that the presidents fortune was built upon a rock and that he must be a man of very little sense who did not see a great difference between the one and the other we may easily perceive that the man who spoke so was best acquainted with old customs since he magnified a chief president so much and undervalued a chief minister and at most it is only during a kings minority that this way of reasoning will hold good but now a days he should be accounted a madman or one that had returned from the other world that would speak at such a rate in a word if monsieur de langlees fortune might have been compared to a meteor while his high spending was ounded only upon what he gained at game yet he has now settled it upon so many fair buildings in paris and in the country that we may say what the man said to the president that he had now founded it upon a rock madame la marquise de bethunes who is the queen of polands sister gave also a magnificent entertainment to the two princes her nephews there were many persons of quality of both sexes at this feast and it ended with a splendid ball yet this marchioness is not at all rich nay she is very poor to be sister of a queen yet it was her own fault that she had not a better estate for when her husband was ambassador in poland the queen her sister was resolved to make her rich but she became jealous that the queen was in love with her husband and that it was for his sake that she made so kind offers her jealousy made her commit a thousand follies which so displeased that court that her husband dying there all that she brought to france from that country was a gift of a hundred thousand crowns which the late king of poland gave her upon the estate of the late duke de longueville  this monarch had lent this money while he was but great mareshal of poland and when the duke de longueville was aspiring to that crown but his sister the duchess de nemours refused to pay it as well as all the other sums which he had borrowed at that time that he might attain to royal dignity she pretended that her brother was under age when he borrowed these sums and therefore she was not obliged to pay them this gave occasion to a law suit before the council and it appeared intricate and doubtful for the law forbids to lend money to minors unless it be manifestly for their advantage and therefore sobiesky ought to lose his money because the duke was not of age when he borrowed it but the marchioness de bethunes as well as the dukes other creditors answered to this that what might be considered in the case of ordinary loans ought not to be considered in such an extraordinary case as this was when the borrower of the money designed to employ it for obtaining a crown and that this had been always the opinion of the prince of condee who while he was alive was still desirous that monsieur l abbee d orleans who was brother and heir to the deceased duke de longueville should pay punctually the full interest of all the money that had been borrowed upon that account that it was he who took care of all the affairs of the family of longueville because l abbe d orleans who was the dukes elder brother was but a weak man and unfit for business that their sister the duchess de nemours dared not to have spoken any thing against the payment of those debts so long as her brother was alive but now that he was dead and that the prince of condee who had always supported the claim of the creditors was dead also she who loved cavils and litigious debates had brought them to the trouble and expense of a law suit it was first debated before the parliament of paris but at last it was brought before the kings council either because the affair was of importance or that it ought in course of law to have been carried thither and it was truly the kings interest to take cognizance of it himself especially at such a juncture as that was for it was his concern to gain the polanders to the prince of contis interest and not to give them cause to complain that they were cheated by the duke de longueville who had borrowed money of sobiesky and of several other persons of quality among them therefore the king ordered the marquis de barbesieux to consider the case and to report it fully in his presence for the secretaries of his majestys commands of which this marquis is one are also counselors of state and have the same commissions so that the king may charge them with all sorts of business as he can do any of the rest of that number but after some days his majesty considered that so young a man as the marquis de barbesieux was scarcely capable of an affair of such importance and that an old and experienced counselor of state would be much fitter for it he therefore took it out of the marquiss hands and committed it to monsieur de ribere but madame de nemourss council had found so many shifts that this has been put off from time to time and is not as yet determined yet it is believed that she will be cast in it as she was in another lawuit which she had against the prince of conti before the requetes du palais this case was of yet greater importance than the former and there were some circumstances in it that were very considerable and therefore i shall give a full account of it  monsieur l abbe d orleans whom i just now mentioned having renounced his right of primogeniture in favor of the comte de st paul his younger brother who thereafter took the title of duke de longueville he was in a short time restored to all his rights by the death of that prince who like a fool was the occasion of his own death as he was passing the rhine monsieur l abbee was willing to have made over the whole estate to his uncle the prince of condee but this prince who enjoyed eighteen hundred thousand livres of yearly revenue thought that he had already more than was sufficient to make him happy if riches alone can make us so and therefore he advised him to give it to his mother madame de longueville who had more need of it than he the abbee was a man that did every thing he was advised to especially if the advice came from a person of authority like the prince de condee so that he agreed that those who managed his affairs should draw up his will and that he should sign it it was done as the prince of condee was pleased to order it and the abbee altered not so much as one word in it by this will he gave over the principality of neufchatel in suitzerland with some other possessions to his mother the duchess de longueville during her life but after her death the prince of condee had right to them by the same will if no new will should be made but he who had already refused them was resolved not to make any advantage of the abbees will for the future and therefore he caused his right to be made over to the prince of conti after the death of the duchess the prince of conti had need of a good estate for his fathers marriage was disadvantageous for his fortune as well as for his honor he had resigned the abbacy of st denis with many other good benefices for the sake of a niece of cardinal mazarins who was truly a virtuous lady but her uncle gave her nothing in marriage though he had so pillaged france that he might have given her a great estate without pinching himself in the least yet he had promised him mountains of gold as he always used to do when he had a design to cozen any body but having dealt by her and her husband as he usually did by all those with whom he had any business though he might at least have put some difference between him and others both upon the account of his quality and because his niece was married to him this prince died very poor for a person of his rank however the duchess de nemours being informed of the will which her brother had made importuned him so as that she prevailed with him after the prince of condees death to make it void and to make another will by which he left the whole inheritance to her now this abbee dying soon after and the prince of conti pretending that the will which had been made in his favor ought to prevail against this last will the requetes du palais were the proper judges in the first point of the controversy the reasons of his plea were that monsieur l abbee d orleans was non compos when he made the last will so that it ought to be considered as if such a thing had never been done if madame de nemours had been well advised she would have said the same of him when he made his first will and she would have had no difficulty in proving it so that the first being no better than the second she should have succeeded by law to the whole estate without any sentence in her favor because she was his sister but her council it seems was as visionary as those who live beyond the alps who plead for the popes infallibility they maintained that the testator was sound in his judgment when he made the second will whereby the first was made void and they had no other way to prove this but by the popes infallibility who had put him into priests orders at the very time that he made this second will and they alleged that it could not be supposed that the pope would have ordained him priest if he had not been in his right wits and they thought this so good a reason that they could not conceive how it could have been answered so that they neglected all other reasons and adhered only to this one to support their cause the prince of conti desired he might be allowed to prove that the abbee was noncompos when he made his last will which he offered to do by evidences that could not be excepted against he was allowed to prove it and he produced his evidences upon whose deposition the whole cause depended the question was if monsieur l abbee dorleans was sound in his judgment when he made his second will but there was no great diffiulty to resolve this question for there were evidences that told things of him that could not have been said of any man but one that was fit for a bedlam and among other things they deposed that when he was going to say mass the first time after he was ordained priest he stopped when he came near to the rails which usually separates the sanctuary and the altar from the neve of the church and there he tried if he could jump over the rails with his feet close together they deposed al that when he found he was not able to do it he came back about  0 pac that he might give himself more force by running and in this mann  the holy sacrifice unto god almighty and  gve a thousand other proofs of his being a fool an account of which would be too tedious madam de nemours council were aston shed when they heard the evidences depose such things as these and they wished then that they had not relied so much upon the popes infallibility and that they had taken better measures but it was now too late the judges proceeded to pronounce a sentence by which that prince the abbee was declared to have been non compos when he made his second will  although the city of paris and all the court were overjoyed when they heard that the prince of conti whom they loved so dearly had gained his cause yet madame de nemours appealed to the grand chamber where she is still prosecuting it but no body doubts but that the sentence which was pronounced will be confirmed by a decree some time before this sentence was pronounced madame de nemours acted her part very dexterously and like a lady of good conduct she knew that she had a strong party to deal with in her lawsuit and therefore as her brothers heiress she had given the principality of neufchatel to the chevalier de soissons a bastard son of the late count de soissons who was a prince of the blood and her uncle for she was the daughter of one of his sisters who was married to the duke de longueville her father and after whose death he married the prince of condees sister now when she gave this principality to this chevalier she had obliged him to marry the marshal de luxenbourgs daughter hoping that the need the kingdom had of the services of so great a captain in so formidable a war as it had to maintain against so many enemies would give her an interest with the king sufficient to balance the prince of contis but this marshal died to his daughters great loss before that the sentence which i have given an account of was pronounced so that the hopes vanished which madame de nemours had comforted herself with when she contrived that marriage though it must be confessed she took very good measures to bring about her designs but there was something in it that was still worse for the chevalier de soissons for he had resigned a good abbacy that he might marry a lady who was neither rich nor handsome and he had also taken the title of prince of neufhatel when he was upon the point of losing the principality  though the gaining of this cause was for the prince of contis advantage yet it was nothing in comparison of the crown of poland which perhaps the king had obliged him to think of more than he would have done had he followed his own inclinations for he was become passionately in love with a lady of great quality insomuch that though a crown be so considerable as that it deserves to be preferred to all other things yet he seemed not to to be too much concerned with it lest he should have been obliged to quit his mistress but it was quite otherwise with madame the princess of conti the thing in the world she wished most was that her husband might be a king ambition which is natural to persons of her rank and quality made her passionately desirous of this but besides she hoped that the crown of poland would take off her husband from the affection he had for the other lady which yet she durst not complain of for fear of displeasing him and for some other reasons that must not be published however this design for the crown of poland met with great opposition and as the house of austria was mindful of its own concerns in the present juncture of the affairs of europe that it might by all means procure that crown to one who would closely adhere to its interests so the prince of conti was not the only person that was in competition for it with prince james prince lewis of baden general of the imperial forces and whose merits were not much short of his own was also one of the competitors and king william seemed to favor his pretentions against prince james but this was only a sort of phantome which was brought forth upon the theater to frighten the actors while his imperial majesty had resolved underhand in his cabinetcouncil to cause the elector of saxony to be chosen who for some years past had been closely in his interests and commanded his forces in hungary this elector was a man of true courage as well as the prince of conti and prince lewis of baden so that the polanders could not refuse him upon that score for they are people who will not have a king but one that is capable both by courage and conduct to head their armies in person when it comes to fighting but the great difficulty that they had to remove was that he was a lutheran and this seemed a very great one because among the many laws that the polanders have made for the government of their kingdom they have established this for an unalterable one that no man shall be chosen king of poland but he who is of the roman communion and therefore when the emperor communicated his designs to the elector of saxony of advancing him to the throne of that kingdom he insinuated to him at the same time that there was a necessity for him to change his religion at last whether it was that he had but little religion as ordinarily the great men of the world have but a small share of it or if it may be imputed to any other cause i do not know but he not only agreed to do what was desired of him but he also abjured it privately before the bishop of javarin yet he did not this till he saw that there was a party in poland formed for him which was capable to put the crown on his head the designs of this party were kept so secret that monsieur l abbee de polignac had not the least notice of them but continued to believe that he had no body to grapple with but prince james whom he was not much afraid of because of his disobliging conduct and the people were generally of opinion that he would follow his example in too many things so that monsieur l abbee wrote to the french court that he hoped in a short time to bring the whole matter to an happy issue the bishop of cujavia whom the whole house of austria did chiefly rely on for making its designs effectual being afraid that he should not be successful because all the people had so great an esteem for the prince of conti and especially the ladies who all desired him for their king thought it best to deal craftily in this matter and to manage it to the best advantage he could for himself when he found that he was at the head of a faction that at least might make the french ambassador jealous of him though it was not as yet so strong as his own he caused it to be told him underhand that if he desired that he might not cross his designs it was in his power to hinder him from doing it that he knew he aspired to be a cardinal and that he considered that the only way how he could attain to that dignity was by his being successful in his negotiations for the prince of conti but if he would renounce all pretentions in his favor he would join interests and unite factions with him by which means the crown of poland would be infallibly secured to that prince no good subject would have refused what this bishop desired though perhaps no man would have yielded to it but with some reluctance but monfieur labbee scorned to hearken to such a proposal and did not so much as communicate it to the french court but pursued his former designs while the bishop strengthened his faction by bringing over into it the party that had been for prince james for his mother the queen of poland was so enraged against the french because they had traversed all her designs for her son that she had rather the polanders should choose any other man than the prince of conti so little did she remember the place of her birth or that the king of france had been so instrumental as he was in the election of the late king her husband yet among all the factions that were among the palatinates there was one thing in which they all agreed that what person soever they should choose for king he should purchase their suffrages with good round sums of money so that the  00000 crowns which the prince of conti had sent into that country was but as a drop of oil in a great fire but the king supplied his indigence and sent thither at one time and another  000000 of crowns the elector of saxony borrowed money with both hands from several princes that he might satisfy the covetous desires of the polanders and king william lent him great sums as well as the elector of brandenburg in the mean while this prince made some of his troops march toward the confines of the duke of saxonys dominions that lie nearest to poland as if there had been some difference between them and the elector of saxony took occasion from that to carry his own troops out of hungary under pretense to defend his dominions against the duke of brandenburg but all this marching of troops on both sides was only that they might join their forces together in case of need that is in case there should be a double election as there was great appearance of it that so the duke of saxony might make good his election by force of arms  while these things were doing the prince of conti diverted himself the best way he could as if he had not in the least been concerned in any business of importance he spoke of buying a house at berci as the dukes de chaulnes and de gesvres had done for each of them had one in that town the duke delbeuf who has that in common with many other persons of quality that he does not always speak truth hearing him speak of a particular house that belonged to one of the farmers of the kings revenues whose name was  with which he said he was very well pleased offered immediately to deal effectually with the landlord and that the prince should have a good bargain on it and that he might believe that he could persuade the farmer to do any thing he told the prince that if he pleased to sup in that house to morrow night he would oblige the master of the house to provide a supper for him and then he should have an opportunity to see the whole contrivance and all the conveniences of the house the prince of conti was well pleased with the proposal and told him that he was engaged to be with the duchess de bouillon at that time but he would rather disengage himself than miss such an opportunity so they made an appointment at that house to morrow in the evening but while the prince of conti was at dinner the duke delbeuf sent to tell him that the appointment could not be kept because the landlord who was not accustomed to entertain princes of the blood in his house was conounded with the thoughts of it as for himself he was resolved to take the advantage of that disappointment and that if the prince was pleased to put off the appointment till to morrow he would do himself the honor to entertain him at dinner in the same house with seven or eight of his friends such as he should choose the prince of conti said to the man who brought him this message that he thanked the duke delbeuf for it and that he accepted of it and would be timely at the house to morrow that he might have time to take a full view of it and consider it he invited the marquis de coastin the president de mesmes monsieur caumartin and some other persons of quality to go along with him but on the morrows morning came another from the duke to make an apology that he could not wait upon him as he had promised because of some business of importance that had unexpectedly fallen out and which he was obliged to look after but there was not so much as one word of all this true he did not so much as know the man to whom the house belonged he had not given him any notice of the appointment which the prince and he had made to sup at his house nor had he any design himself to entertain him at dinner in the same house so that there were as many lies as words in all that he had said to him upon that head the prince of conti made a jest of all this with his friends without troubling himself any more about it there was one mr chapelle who had been formerly one of the princes domestics but at this time a farmer of the revenues hearing one speak of it to mr caumartin went to his old master and told him that though he was far below the duke delbeufs quality yet he should acquit himself better of his promise than he had done in giving him an entertainment at that very house provided the prince would not take it amiss that he had presumed to invite him to it the prince answered that he was well satisfied with it and made a new appointment with his friends to be there to morrow in the evening and mr chapelle regaled him splendidly there were at this entertainment many persons of quality both of civil and military employments and among the rest there were present those whom the prince had invited when he was to have supped there upon the duke delbeufs invitation they discoursed about a great many things and as it was impossible they could forget the duke so they took occasion to speak of a visit that his mistress had lately paid to the archbishop of paris because he had made an ordinance wherein this lady found herself concerned there were many persons who had taken advantage of his predecessors easy temper and had obtained leave of him to have chapels in their own houses and under pretense of hearing mass in these private chapels they came so seldom to church that they scarcely heard mass there at the four great festivals of the year now the archbishop thought it necessary to remedy this custom and for that end he suppressed all those licenses that his predecessors had granted and ordained that all those who desired to have the benefit of them for the time to come should appear before him that he might examine the reasons upon which the licenses had been granted the dukes mistress had got one of these licenses and she paid a visit to the archbishop and entreated him to confirm what his predecessor had done but this prelat having heard of her lewdness and licentious way of living which was so public that even her son had made no scruple sometime before to say to the king when he asked him if he would be ready in a short time to go to the army that he could not be so soon in a readiness to go thither because his mother had been more concerned to get ready the duke delbeufs equipage than his this prelat i say who knew all this and a thousand other ill things of her answered her coldly that those who would woship god acceptably must first know him and fear him and that those who did know him and fear him would always think their pains well bestowed when they went to church where the rest of his srvants use to serve and worship him and without saving any more to her he refused to grant her requests the prince of conti and all the company commended the archbishop for having spoken to her after this manner for tho it was but a word or two that he had said yet it was enough to make her reflect of her own ill conduct the most part of them said also that the duke delbeuf was much in the wrong to deal so unkindly as he did by his own lady for the sake of an old antiquated whore who had the impudence sometimes to boast of the fineness of her complexion when it was well enough known that it was entirely owing to painting but there were some who undertook to justify the duke though they could not justify this lady his mistress they pleaded in his behalf that since he had nothing to live by or to support his character except his government he could not be much blamed for having a kindness for a lady that rewarded him so liberally as she did that she was frequently giving him good sums and therefore he dispensed with her age that there were several others who would do the same thing if they were in his circumstances and in a word it was an ordinary thing among the young beaus of the court  this was not the only lady whom they had put on the foot of paying them well in the mean time it had been always the fate of king charles the  d who had been mightily in love with this lady to have mistresses who fought only to enrich themselves at his expense and with his spoils to enrich others before his face another duchess whom this prince had loved before this had used him the very same way as this did and the chevalier de chalillon who is known at present in the world under the name of marquis had continued to render her good service as long as she had wherewithal to recompense him and she thought she employed her money very well because he was handsome and very well shaped and besides he was always ready when she had a mind for him for she was a woman that gave no quarter to her lovers and paid them only in proportion to their services she had learned from a lady that was her friend and who had learned it herself from an old countess de vertus that things ought to be done in this manner and at least that this was the practice of the old countess her self who passed amongst the women of her time for the cunningest that was among them all the world indeed had accused her of weakness of judgment but they had done her the greatest injustice that can be done to a woman since so far from being a fool as was pretended she had made it appear by one of the principal actions of her life that never any lady had better understanding for being grown old and yet the prick of the flesh continuing to torment her she took the method that any honest woman ought to take which was to find out a husband for herself tho she was quite decrepid in the mean time knowing by the experience that she had of the world that she might come to be deceived unless she took all the precaution that prudence could possibly suggest she did two things which show the greatness of her judgment one was to cast her eyes on a man whose figure promised fairly the other was to make a bargain with him to oblige him to his good behavior this man was the chevalier de la port who after the same manner as the chevalier de chatillon is now from chevalier come to be a comte he was of a good family and tho he was not come of the dukes of brtagne as her first husband was yet she could put him in his place without being accusd of making a mean alliance so being satisfied both of his person and of his birth the question was only how to secure herself against the disgusts which a husband usually takes especially when interest has obliged him to take the burden of an old carcass which he never marries but in the view and hope of being quickly rid of it a woman of so much knowledge and experience was not easily to be deceived and behold too what measures she took to avoid it after she had expressed the tender sentiments she had for him by which he reckoned himself extremely honored because he had nothing and she was very rich then she showed him a strong box in which there was fifty thousand crowns of ready money having opened it too that he might be the more fully assured of what was in it and having let him look on it as long as was enough to make him in love with it she told him that here was what she intended to give him on condition that when he was her husband he should use her kindly the chevalier de la port who knew as well as any man alive how to make promises swore to her mountains and wonders to persuade her that if ever she did him that favor he had rather dye a thousand deaths than ever to be guilty of ingratitude it seems he thought she would trust to his swearing but the countess retaining still her former sentiments told him that though she believed him a man of honor and in that quality that he would keep his word to her nevertheless that she would take such precautions with him that she should have no reason ever to repent of that a husband very often laughed at the promises which he made to his wife that she had no mind to be disappointed and therefore had resolved to tell him once for all that if he would have her  0 thousand crowns he must merit them by using her obligingly that the best thing a husband can do to a wife is to caress her frequently that on her part she promised to give him ten louis dors for every time he caressed her and as often and as far as he erred his performances he might reckon to be paid accordingly at this rate if he caressed her but three times a night there was thirty louis dors sure for him in the morning but if he pushed his valor further he might quickly make the strong box pass from her closet into his own this clause and condition was not very agreeable to the chevalier tho on other occasions he had been often at work without being so well rewarded but having a passion for this money he consented to gain it with the sweat of his brow the lady married him privately and keeping her word to him every morning in proportion to his services he had quickly emptied the strong box if the ladys children had not perceived the intrigue betwixt them they spoke to her of it as a thing that made the world talk strangely of her conduct and the lady finding herself straightened in this point told them at last that they were unjust to suspect her of lewdness that she did nothing but what was lawful for her to do that she was married to the chevalier and that she would lie with him as often as ever she pleased her children knowing that she had ready money and that this was the high way to squander it endeavored to get the marrige annulled on pretext that her great age for she was at least seventy and two had made her incapable to know what she was doing the affair being brought before the judges the advocates pleaded on both sides these for the children alleged strongly what they had been told that the lady was moapd and silly and that the chevalier had surpised and imposed on her weakness but the advocates on the other side having utterly run down this pretext by producing the bargain which she had made with the chevalier and which she had given him fairly in writing the children had certainly lost their cause but the judges would not suffer the chevalier whose desire to empty the strong box had brought him almost on his last legs already to go on to kill himself  they considered likewise that the lady by this means would ruin her children for if this coffer were once emptied she would sell all that she had rather than fail to fill it again in order to entertain the good services which the chevalier had not failed to perform very constantly so the marriage was annulled by decree of parliament who nevertheless appointed the chevalier to have  0000 crowns for the reward of his labor  the king of englands mistresses used him much after the same manner and made him pay as dear for his pleasures as this old lady paid to the chevalier especially she to whom this little history was told and whom the marquis de chatillon did so drain of her acquisitions that she is now as poor and miserable as once she was opulent as for the other whom the duke delbeuf frequented she managed it a little better though in the mean time she stuck at no expense or reward when he threatened to leave her and go and push his fortune elsewhere  but let us now pass to some other subject we must know then that she who was lady of honor to madam la duchess being resolved to retire from court her place which is worth  000 crowns of pension per ann was sought for by a great many ladies of quality who besides the  000 crowns which they had in their view considered also that thereby they should have opportunities to get into his majestys favor for he desires to have one always about madam la duchess who will give him an exact account of all that she does and it is of for that reason that he has appointed these sorts of ladies of honor both for her and the other princesses of the blood and that he himself has settled pensions upon them and he has a politic design in it for thereby he keeps both them and their husbands in their duty because they know that they have one in their house who takes notice of every thing they do so that they dare not adventure upon any thing that may in the least displease the king the marchioness de la port whose husband was once admiral of a squadron and nephew of the comte de la port whom i spoke of just now having but a small estate to live by thought that it would be very convenient for her to have that post especially she having been a widow for several years she had several friends and among others the marquis d angeau who has some interest at court and did his utmost to have carried the place for her he was once in a fair way to have succeeded in it but that it was told the king that this lady was not of sufficient quality for so honorable an employment yet no body adventured to speak any thing against her conduct for though she be no great beauty yet she is of so great virtue that she is as much esteemed as those who are much more beautiful and the late monsieur de croissy was once afraid that his son who is now secretary of state should be so taken with this ladys true merit as to make a secret marriage with her and therefore he sent him into italy where he made him stay some years and did not recall him till he thought it probable that his long absence had cured him of the wounds which his converse with her had given him  but her enemies made use of another argument against her to which had she got but a fair hearing she could have so satisfied the king that no doubt she would have obtained her desire but they imposed upon his majesty and told him that there were two families of la port in france that the one of them was a good family and the other was naught that she was of the last and monsieur de mazarine was of the first and if he should prefer her to be lady of honor to madame la duchess people of the lowest rank might pretend to advancement as well as she and by this means they prevailed so far as that she was excluded and the marchioness de l angle was preferred to that place though in the mean time she could have justly pleaded that her husband was of as good a family as the marquis de la port for the marquis was of la port de vesins and monsieur de mazarin was of another la port at least this was said when the mareshal de la milleray who was the marquiss father had made his fortune under the ministry of cardinal richelien with whom he was first cousins it is true there were some who then alleged that his father the advocate la port was not descended of the family de la port de vessins though he pretended to be of it and the marquis de vesins was not well pleased with his pretenses insomuch that he would have challenged him for taking the coat of arms that belongs to his family but that he was so afraid of the cardinals greatness that he spoke nothing of it unless it was to some particular friends to whom he would sometimes say by way of jest that those who advised him to enter into a lawsuit with the mareshal upon that account gave him bad counsel that he did not see how it could be pretended that the mareshal had done him any dishonor by entering himself a descendant of his family that on the contrary he looked upon it as an evidence that the mareshal considered his family as better than many others for which he was much obliged to him  this was not the first time the king had been imposed upon on such occasions the late marquis de renel had some enemies at court who insinuated to his majesty that he was but of a very late family so that though he was a person of great merit yet the king who has great considerations for birth looked upon him as one of those whom he ought not to advance so soon as others for there are people of certain names and ranks who have some right to hope that they shall not languish so long as others do in the mere expectation of the favors which his majesty uses to bestow upon his subjects however this marquis having a great desire to be lieutenant general of the kings armies and thinking that he ought to have been preferred sooner he took occasion to speak of it one day to the king and fairly represented to him what good services he had done him the king gave him a favorable hearing as he always uses to do to those who address to him though few of them have the honor to be known to him but when his majesty was pleased to answer him the marquis was surprised to hear him say that he was in the wrong to be so impatient and that he believed he had done as much for him as for any man of his rank that every man ought to do him so much justice as not to think he was forgotten or neglected though persons of great quality were preferred to him that it was true that merit ought to be rewarded wherever it was found and that he had always had a special regard to it ever since he had governed by himself but that there were certain families which he thought fit to prefer to others for they had been always in possession of the most honorable offices and the highest preferments both at court and in the army and that he could not without injustice deprive their children of them unless he found that they had degenerated from the virtue of their ancestors the marquis soon perceived by this discourse that his majesty had been possessed with a mean opinion of his birth but he was so far from cont adicting what his majesty had said in favor of those who had been of honorable families that he told him it was for that very reason that he thought himself neglected that though he was not a duke and peer or had not so much as any office of the crown yet he was of as good a family as the most part of those who had been advanced to higher posts that his ancestors had had the honor to do good services to his majestys royal ancestors and that so long as he followed their example he did not see why he was not capable of any of those offices that are designed for persons of the best quality if the marquis was surprised at his majestys discourse the king was no less surprised at his he had always thought that the marquis was one of those upstart marquises of whom there are so many at paris and especially of citizens who take upon them this title though the foundations of it were laid only in their fathers coffers or in some offices of the gown which some of their family has enjoyed and being desirous to be fully informed in this matter he asked him if it was not true that had been told him that he was only de la noblesse bourgeoise i e one who derived his pedigree only from rich citizens or from those who had enjoyed offices of the long robe as was said of the late archbishop o paris when i speak after this manner it is in imitation of the bishop of noyon for that prelte who is the glory of prelates yet not in the  in which he ought to be it but only becae he thinks that no man is comparable to him for the quality of his ancestors and speaking one day of the family of that archbishop he said that it could not be called an honorable family but only one of the best of those families that have been raised by lawyers or that had made a figure among the citizens of paris what he said was true upon the matter for there is a great difference between a family that is truly honorable and such a family as he was speaking of but sometimes all the truth should not be told especially if there is a great man who may take it amiss for some days after the chief president of the parliament who is descended of the same family that the late archbishop was of made the bishop of noyon sensible of his folly the bishop being come to dine with him and his coachman having carried home his coach horses resolving to return with them in the afternoon the chief president who had been informed of what he had said of his family and who is seldom upon the reserve with any man especially if he have any quarrel against him no sooner saw him but he gave orders to the steward of his house not to serve up dinner till he was gone the bishop staid till the ordinary time of dinner was past and longed for it but seeing no appearance of it he asked the president if that was one of his fasting days he told him plainly that it was not but that he had given orders that no dinner should be served up till he was gone because it would be too great presumption in him and a token that he had forgotten the meanness of his birth which was but of the noblesse burgeoise if he should offer to entertain at his table so great a seiger and one of such an illustrious descent as he was of to this he added some other words to the same purpose and the bishop was puzzled what to say to him but after some dull apologies he was forced to go home and dine at his own house yet he would fain have staid dinner with the president because his coach horses were not there but the president chose to let him have the use of his coach rather than he should have staid dinner at his house but to return to the marquis de renel he said to the king that he knew no such thing in his family as la noblesse burgeoise that every one of his ancestors wore a sword by his side and if there were any of the family that had not done it it was because he was consecrated to the church as was the cardinal d amboise who had the honor to be the first minister of the crown when he spoke of this cardinal the king perceived that he had been imposed upon by those who had made him believe that the marquis was but of a late family and of mean extract so that afterward he did him justice and gave him what he had asked  the duke de choiseul who had discorded with his lady was reconciled to her after his return from savoy she could hardly be prevailed with to live with her husband and though she was fully as much to blame as he was for the breach that was betwixt them yet she pretended that it was not safe for her to live with him but the king told her that she had but one of two things to choose either to cohabit with her husband or to go into a nunnery the very thoughts of a nunnery is enough to fright a lady especially when she has any inclinations to be a coquette so that the very speaking of it was enough to oblige her to obey his majestys commands but the kings care extended farther than to those ladies who did not live as they ought to do with their husbands he took care also to curb the extravagancies of many others even though they did not belong to the court and being informed that monsieur l abbee lionne the son of the late monsieur lionne minister and secretary of state and who enjoyed the abbacy of marmoutier with a great many other rich benefices did not behave himself so well as his character obliged him to do he sent him a letter de cachett ordering him to retire into a seminary he also appointed one to stay with him and to take care that when any benefices that were at his gift became vacant he should neither diminish the revenues of them nor bestow them upon unworthy persons monsieur l abbee roullier whose father had made so great an estate by the post office that he settled all his children as if they had been persons of some quality was also sent to the seminary of notre dame de vertus with an order to those that had the inspection of him that they should not allow him to correspond with any person and that they should oblige him to do penance for all this was necessary to reduce him to a right sense of his duty seeing he had become a rake and led such a profligate life that he equally disgraced the character of an abbee with which he had been honored and that of a magistrate with which he was also clothed for he was counselor clerk of the parliament of paris but he had so little regard to what became the dignity of those two places that there was not a greater debauche in all the city but notwithstanding all the care his majesty took to repress immoralities and to oblige all persons to live suitably to their characters yet the generality of them were so far from answering that design that there were greater abuses committed than ever for where there was one that was thereby prevailed upon to abandon his former vices there were thousands who thought it enough if they were so far hypocrites as to please his majesty by an outward appearance so that hypocrisy began then to come in fashion and there were never so many tartuffes or hypocritical puritans as began to appear at that time among people of all ranks especially among the courtiers though one would think that such a character did less become them than any others for it seems to be peculiar to the court that though dissimulation may be learned there better than in any other place yet it is a diffimulation of a quite other kind than what i am now speaking of for when a courtier dissembles he does it that he may procure to himself as many pleasures and conveniences as he can and to shun troubles and inconveniences and not to be his own tormentor and executioner as the hypocrites who makes himself miserable in this world as well as the next so that it is an ordinary saying that an hypocrite is tho devils martyr those who had new opinions to publish could not have found a time more convenient for their purpose than this was there was a certain sect which had lain hid under the ashes ever since molinos had adventured to broach his wild sentiments at rome and it began now to appear again at versailles the archbishop of cambray who was preceptor to the young princes of france and had the reputation of a very devout man declared himself zealous for this sect those who were of it did teach by a subtle kind of reasoning though to speak the truth they did not avow it plainly that the body might do all sorts of wickedness while in the mean time the soul might be altogether innocent and unconcerned as to what the body did for if the intention of the soul was directed to god and for his glory then it was not in the least to be blamed for the ill that the body did which is under a strange captivity to the corruption that is in mans nature there was one madame guyon a lady of no great quality but of so great an estate that she had married her daughter to the comte de vaul eldest son of monsieur fouquet who had already endeavored to propagate this abominable doctrine for which reason she had been sent to vincennes but the archbishop of cambray undertaking to defend her publicly he published a book in which by an abstract way of reasoning which no body was capable to comprehend he endeavored to show that this doctrine was not in the least erroneous he alleged the writings of st francis de sales to justify himself and pretended that he taught nothing but what had been formerly taught by that holy man every body was astonished at the sight of this book and it had never been printed if the author had been obliged to ask a license for it but the bishops have a privilege to publish what books they please though their works be not examined by those who are authorized to give licenses for printing books and this piece was published before it was known that he had begun to write it all the hypocrites were overjoyed that a way was found out for them to gratify their sensual appetites while they outwardly appeared virtuous which they thought themselves obliged to do lest they should lose the kings favor but they were not suffered long to boast of this imaginary victory for as soon as this book appeared the archbishop of paris the bishops of meaux and chartres with many other prelates declared against it and the bishop of meaux began immediately to write a refutation of it and besides he joined with the archbishop of paris and the bishop of chartres both which had a great interest at court to deal earnestly with his majesty that the young princes the dauphins sons might not be kept any longer under the direction of a prelat whom they accused of the most horrible impieties that had ever appeared in the church  the king knew not well what to say to this because he had always looked upon the archbishop of cambray as a man of good morals and of exemplary piety and it must be confessed that there was never any prelat appeared more zealous for gods glory for he was so far from having ever given any bad example that on the contrary he had been very useful for the edification of those who saw him or conversed with him however the archbishop of paris and those other two bishops gave his majesty no rest till they had obtained what they desired and what they thought necessary to be done upon such an occasion and they prevailed with him at last to order the archbishop of cambray to retire to his own palace till father orders but before he came there he had occasion to practice the doctrine which he had undertaken to defend it is commonly called quietism the meaning of which is that a man ought never to be troubled at any thing that can happen to him now the archbishops palace had taken fire by the fault of some servants whom he kept there and it had consumed not only all the buildings but also all the furniture of the house which had been very richly furnished every body desired to know how he would take this accident but he appeared still as firm and unconcerned as if he had been altogether disinterrested mean while many persons of quality were suspected of the same errors that were charged upon him and among others the duke de bavilliers and his brother in law the duke de chevreuse the first was governor to the young princes of france whose preceptor the archbishop of cambray had been and the thoughts of this were uneasy to the king till he was satisfied in it by the duke himself the king discoursed with him a long time in his closet upon this subject upon which he had likewise a long conference with the duke de chevreuse after which it appeared that his majesty was undeceived both as to the one and the other yet their ladies who had always been of the number of those who went to marli did not go there to often as they had used to do before that time which made some people believe that the king dissembled a little in his carriage to them the archbishop of cambray wrote in his own vindication and pretended that all that he had said in that book was true and orthodox and offered to submit himself to the court of rome while the bishop of meaux accused him of heresy more than ever the abbee de la trape who had some years before renounced the quality of an abbee that he might complete his penance which he had been long under in the quality of a simple monk declared himself also mr de cambrays enemy without waiting till his holiness should pronounce any thing concerning his book tho this archbishop had sent it to rome that he might know his thoughts of it the abbee wrote two letters upon this subject which the bishop of meaux caused to be published in the beginning of his own book he thought by this to strengthen his cause and that since he had to do with an archbishop who was a man of learning and had many friends he ought not to neglect any thing that could in the least support him in it he also sent his nephew monsieur l abbee bossuet to rome that he might there employ all his interest to have the archbishop condemned at which many good people were offended for they thought that when a man acted only through zeal it was not fit to create him so much trouble madame guyon who by the interest her friends had made for her was set at liberty fell into another enthusiastic fit in favor of this sect she propagated it every where and infected the house of st cir with it so that it was found necessary to put some of the nuns of that house into other convents in a word the king took all the measures that prudence could suggest to him to crush these errors before they should do any harm to the church while he was at so much pains to prevent the ill consequences of this debate there were other debates broke out in the churches of rheims and roan the archbishop of this last city had made a list of some books which he had recommended to those of his diocese to be made use of for resolving cases of conscience but had not mentioned any of those books which the jesuits think fittest for that purpose these good fathers took this so ill that some of them appeared in print against him the archbishop accused one of their number as the author he pretended to know his style and demanded of the society of jesuits that they would do him justice in punishing this author the fathers denied that he was the man and he denied it himself and they sent him to paris that he might withdraw himself from the effects of the archbishops anger who was doing all the mischief he could against him as well as against all the rest of that society he made an exact search after the printer of the pamphlet that had been published against him and having kept some of them in prison for some time the whole business vanished into smoke for want of evidences the schism that broke out in the church of rheims was also occasioned by a debate between the archbishop and the jesuits these had publicly maintained in the schools of the college which they have in that city two things that the bishop was not pleased with the first was that the doctrine which molina taught concerning grace had been virtuous in all the attacks that its enemies had made against it the archbishop of rheims who is no molinist censured these theses as full of falsehoods and published an edict declaring that they did not contain the true doctrine of the church he therein also censured some other passages which they had cited in another thesis and this edict being conceived in terms that they were very much dissatisfied with they did much the same that those of roan had done they wrote against it and exposed it so that the archbishop to oblige them to do him justice was advised to cause the provincial and the three rectors of their houses at paris to be cited that they might declare if this pamphlet which had been printed in that city had been done by their order or without their order the author had been more circumspect than to put his name to it and the bookseller and printer had concealed their names but the author had said enough to let the world know that he had composed it by order of his superiors and it was upon that account that the archbishop would oblige the provincial and the three rectors to make their declaration after they had met in a chapter upon this business they were so foolish as to declare that the pamphlet contained nothing but what was consonant to truth and what they were ready to defend so that having made this confession the archbishop of rheims gave in his address to the parliament desiring that judgment might pass against them and that they might be obliged to make a public reparation of the injury they had done him in publishing so scandalous things against him in this address he said that if they pretended as it seemed they did that they had been injured by his edict then the laws and customs of the church taught them that there were but two ways by which they could have redress the one was to have made it known to himself by representing to him wherein he had injured them but if they thought that he would be too partial in his own cause and would not retract what he had once done how unjust soever it might be to them then the other way was to have addressed themselves to the primate he represents also that it was not becoming private men to expose the conduct of an archbishop by seditious pamphlets that such a thing might be of dangerous consequence besides that it was a breach of charity the thing which had given occasion to all this was capable to have revived the great dispute concerning grace which had made so much noise in the beginning of this age and therefore the king thought it necessary to put a stop to this lawsuit and told father de la chaise that it was his royal pleasure that the society of jesuits should give satisfaction to the archbishop of rheims and having called the chief president of the parliament to versailles that he might give him such orders as he judged necessary about this affair he took up i know not how much time in discoursing with him of the best methods for putting an end to it the jesuits who had made a foolish step in justifying every thing that was in the pamphlet were very glad that the king had fallen upon a way how they might evite the shame and disgrace which would have infallibly come upon them if the parliament had proceeded to pronounce a sentence they went to the chief president and told him they were ready to obey the kings orders the president told them he was glad they were come to a resolution that was so much for their interest as well as reasonable in it self he concerted the whole matter with them that they should draw up a writing by which they should acknowledge that they had taken wrong measures in not addressing to the archbishop himself as they ought to have done that he might have been pleased to have heard them in their own vindication and promising that they should take that method for the future if ever they should be so unfortunate as to have occasion to complain of him and that in this writing they should entreat the archbishop to pardon what was past and to receive them and their society again into his favor the president communicated this writing to the king before it was signed that he might know how his majesty was satisfied with it the archbishop could not demand any more so that he was content to put an end to the debate provided they should sign that paper perhaps they would not hay done it if the king had not interposed his authority but the good learned fathers knew better than others did that scripture commands us expressly to obey superior powers and therefore it was no hard matter to persuade them to do what the archbishop had demanded of them  about the same time that the archbishop of cambrays opinions of which i have already given some account made so much noise the princess d harcourt was obliged to go to normandy where her husbands estate lies to look after his private affairs she had been long at court and had always found a way to preserve her interest in it in all the changes that fell out though there were many others that were fully of as good sense as she who were not able to do so much so soon as she was gone from it it was reported that it was partly upon her account that the archbishop had been cast out of favor and many were of opinion that she was a quietist and so much the rather because she retired so often sometimes into one convent sometimes into another but a lady who thought she knew her better than others did said to those who were speaking of her that they were mistaken as to that princess and that she was not for creating trouble to herself by an indiscreet zeal and that she could be surety for her that till the king as well as his ministers became quietists she should not be one but if they should declare themselves once in favor of that party she would not then promise for her for never lady was more inclined than she to perform exactly what was enjoined by st peter to obey every ordinance of man whether the king as supreme or those who are in authority under him those who were concerned in this lady and had been under some fears that the reports of her being quietist might be true were well satisfied with this account of her soon after she returned from normandy and was not behind with any lady at court in exclaiming against quietism and spoke upon all occasions of no less than fire and faggot for those of that persuasion  about this time the chief presidents son was made a counselor of state in the place of monsieur pussort who at last had paid that tribute which all men owe to nature after he had been two or three years without being able to go to the counsel of which he was dean he was uncle to the late monsieur colbert minister and secretary of state and he was as his right hand to him when he was contriving ways and means for enriching the king at his subjectcost for he had laid down some maxims of his own by which he determined always in favor of the exchequer and it was never seen that he had been so much as in one single instance prevailed with even by the strongest arguments to determine otherwise so that in the council he got the name of pussort the fiscal and when any man was so unhappy as to have a lawsuit with the king he had reason to give over his cause for lost if it depended upon his vote but at last when he found himself at the point of death he began to reflect that he must give an account of all these things the thoughts of them put him under great fears his confessor endeavored to encourage him by representing to him the mercies of god who pardons all the sins a man has been guilty of so soon as he comes to repent of them the archbishop of roan who was his grand nephew and to whom he had left some part of his estate as he did to all these who were within the same degrees of kindred to him nay and to the marquis de seignelais children too though they were farther removed than the rest i say the archbishop spoke much to the same purpose to him that the confessor had done but the poor man was still afraid that he did it only as thinking thereby to comply with his humor and he was the more confirmed in this when he observed that the archbishop when he had gone into the withdrawingroom to bring the viaticum chided the parson of st roche that he had not caused him to be put in his bed instead of exciting him who was a dying man to pay that respect and veneration to that god in whose presence he then was however in a short time he was called to give an account of all his actions before gods tribunal and his heirs had  00000 crowns of estate which he left them to divide among themselves and there was not so much as one of them had any use for his house to dwell in and therefore they sold it to monsieur bertin treasurer of the casual revenues who is a man of the greatest curiosity of any in paris in the matter of household furniture and as those at court entertain the king with accounts of every thing that falls out so it was told his majesty that mr bertin had bought the house and that when he came to dwell in it it would look quite another thing than it did while mr pussort was alive they told him also that he had the finest carpets in the world better than any that were in his majestys palace the king had the curiosity to go and see them and he asked him how much they had cost him and where he had bought them he answered that he had paid  00 crowns for the piece of them at the auction of the marquis de segnelais furniture the king said before all the court that that minister had always dealt so by him so that when any fine thing was brought from the indies he gave him the refuse and took all the best to himself and he added that he had never known a more vainglorious man than that marquis or one that was so conceited of his own personage that his vanity had made him oftimes fail in point of good breeding and in the respect he owed him for without considering that he was speaking to his king he would have asked him sometimes if he did not think he was well dressed and if he had not a good air mr bertin finding that the king had a desire for the carpets entreated his majesty to accept of them from him the king took them but would not have them in a gift but caused him to be paid the money that he had given for them there were three ladies who had been friends of mr pussort that expected he would have considered them in his will and for that end had complied for several years with all his humors they had every night entertained him with diversions suitable to his own fancy and he had never given them so much as a cup of water for a reward except two meals that he gave them a year the one of them was marchioness de merce who was his wifes niece and the other two persons i shall not name but they had fully as great a desire to have their shares of his money as she had but they were quite frustrated in their hopes as well as she there were a great many who made interest for his place of counselor of state as well as for his other place of counselor of the council of the royal revenues by which he had   000 livers of sallary but the king gave this last to monsieur de pommere and the other to the chief presidents son as i have already said he had been attorney general before but because he had made no great figure in that post his father addressed to the king that he would be pleased to bestow this upon him and frankly told his majesty that his reason was because his son was not sufficiently qualified for being attorney general that when he purchased that office for him he believed that he had been capable of discharging it but he found he had been in a mistake and that therefore he would be glad to have him eased of the honor of that burden which he was not capable to bear this was thought an odd sort of a compliment from such a man as the chief president of the parliament and those who heard of it asked one another if it was necessary that a man that was of the parliament should be of greater parts than he who is of the council where the nicest affairs of the kingdom are treated of for it could not be said that it was the want of memory or the art of speaking in public that made him incapable of the office of attorney general for while monsieur talon had been in that post he had shown a way how to supply those defects he had always read his pleadings and as it was no shame to imitate a man who as all france confessed had acquitted himself honorably in that office therefore they concluded that certainly his father knew of something else that made him incapable of it however the fathers merits supplied all the sons imperfections insomuch that the king not only granted his request but another favor also which he had not asked for he allowed him to sell the office of attorney general to the best advantage upon which there were a great many offered for it who were as incapable of it as the presidents son was and who had much more money than merit they considered also that as the incapacity of his son had been the cause of his being promoted to be a counselor of state so they might at last come to some promotion for the same reason among the rest there was a master of requests who was the son of another master of requests and he concluded that this was the only way how he could raise himself to the greatest offices of the council and therefore he offered money for it as others did and believed that he ought to have been preferred to them because he excelled them in the art of pronouncing ill and stuttering in his speech and had lately married a young girl which had made him be much considered but the chief president made an ill step in politics for whereas he ought to have chosen one of the meanest qualifications that he might thereby let the world see that his son was not the only person that was incapable of that em employment the man he bargained with was monsieur joli de fleuri whose father had been counselor of the great chamber he got four hundred thousand franks for it which was more by  0000 franks than is usually given for such an office then people began to say of this new attorney general that it seemed he had no mind to be raised to the office of a counselor of state in that way that the presidents son had been raised to it for so soon as he was instald in his office he made it appear by his eloquence and his great capacity that he was far above the ordinary sort of attorneys  while these things were a doing among the lawyers the duke de lausun who has been so tossed by fortune ever since he first appeared upon the stage of the world was very diligent in a law suit he had against his ladies family when he was near sixty years of age he had married a daughter of the mareshal de lorges who was not above sixteen in which he played the fool as much as when he put in for the command of the army in ireland for it is equally ridiculous for a man of sixty to marry a girl of sixteen and for one that has never had any command but over his own domestics or day lobourers to command an army yet as good sense would qualify him for the one much more than for the other so he managed his wife in such a way that he never became one of those husbands whose wives make them to be pointed at in the streets he gave her as many fine clothes as she pleased and as much money as was needful for her diversions but it was upon condition that she should not keep company but with some old dotards of whom he was not much afraid for as to the young sparks about the court she was discharged in any terms to see them or to admit of any visits from them for by his own experience he knew the frailty of young ladies all these precautions were the more justificable because if it was in his power to secure this young lady for himself alone she was well worth all the pains he would be at in doing it and he left nothing undone that was necessary for that end the governess whom he appointed to wait upon her was well advanced in years she had once been with madame de guise and he trusted much to her virtue she was as seldom from her as was possible for her to be and it was a rare thing to see this young lady without her guardian she had great advantages secured to her by her marriage contract without which the mareshal de lorges would not have given her in marriage to him but the mareshal and his lady had not given him any portion with her yet fremout who had ammassed many millions of money by farming the kings revenues which had been his employment almost fifty year supplied the want of a portion for in the marriage contract he had engaged to leave them a hundred thousand crowns after his death and when he died sometime after the duke de lausune was surprised that his son mr donneuil and the mareshalls lady who was his daughter had renounced all interest in the estate and had brought from languedoc a little girl of eleven years of age who called herself his relation and pleaded she should be his heiress by the benefit of his inventory his widow had also renounced yet before she did it she had concurred with his children to put the best and most valuable things out of the way upon this the duke found himself under a necessity either to content himself with any effects that he found still remaining of the inheritance or to enter into a law suit against the widow and her son for as to his father in law and mother in law he could not ask anything of them for they had not signed the grant which his ladies grandfather had made in prospect of the marriage besides that they adhered to that grant which he had made to themselves when they were married together so that he had not any reason imaginable to sue them at law but he sud the mother and the son and pretended that they had secret conveyed out of the way the effects of the estate and that they ought to be ordered to pay him an hundred thousand crowns in ready money without putting him to the pairs of seeking for payment out of such remains of the estate as did still appear but this was not all he craved of them for besides this  00000 crowns for which fremon had paid interest so long as he lived as of a thing that was already acquired he had promised them a hundred thousand franks out of the whole estate but his widow and her son had adjusted matters so that all that was remaining of the estate after the debts were paid was but at most  00000 crowns so that they designed to have frustrated the duke of  00000 franks besides that they would have left him in hazard of being called to an account by the king and his ministers as ordinarily all those are who marry the daughters or grand daughters of farmers of his majestys revenues unless the marriage portion has been paid in ready money the duke de lausun who had no great skill to dispute his ground in ireland chose rather to quit it in time than to expose himself to the dangers that threatened him if he had stayed to dispute it with sword in hand thought he could better understand the debates of the pallais and though he had no more served an apprentiship in this than he had done in the war yet he armed himself with a strong resolution to plead to the utmost rather than do what monsieur donneuil would have obliged him to the case was brought before the requetes du palais because of the quality of the parties who had the right of committimus for mr domneuil was master of requests besides that the duke was not obliged to appear before any other court of that kind unless he had pleased to do it he was enraged above what can be expressed at the methods that were taken by madame de fremont and mr donneuil in which they had engaged the mareshal de lorges and his lady and therefore he enjoined the duchess that she should not see either of them this did very much trouble this lady as well as her mother the mareshals lady who loved her daughter tenderly but the duke told his own lady that when he enjoined her this it was not so much for satisfying his own resentment of the injuries they had done him as because her interest was concerned in the debate for he could not expect to live long and after his death she could not expect any thing of his estate but what was provided to her by the marriage contract and therefore it was necessary he should use all sorts of means for preserving to her what she ought to have from him that if she had nothing but what they now offered her the effects they would give her would be liable to a chamber of justice whenever it should please the king to erect one and that they might even make him pay a tax by the first order of council that should be given in that matter and that therefore she ought to make her mother sensible that there wa not any hopes of a reconciliation with her unless she should oblige her brother and madame de fremont to do him justice these words made a great impression upon the duchess mind and as it is natural for very body to desire riches even to the prejudice of a near friend so she observed her husband commands so exactly that she refused to be present at the ceremony when one of her sisters was to put on the nuns habit and to enter into a convent at conflaus till her husband told her that he was satisfied she should go thither  about this time monsieur de phelypeaux the only son of monsieur de pontehartrain minister and secretary of state married his lady who was a daughter of a sister of his fathers who had been married to the count de roye of the family of rochefocant he had gone to pay her a visit and the marriage was concluded within three days after the bride had but   000 livers of portion and the king gave her  000 livers of pension of which she had  000 before which the king had granted her when she embraced the roman communion for her father had dyed a protestant in england where he rather chose to end his days out of his country and deprived of the honors which he might have expected upon account of his birth and merits than to renounce his religion the countess de roye was also in that kingdom and had carried thither three of her children that she might educate them in their fathers religion while the rest of them which were many chose rather to embrace the roman religion this lady whom mr phelypeaux married was in a convent at soissons when her marrige was concluded and her relations having sent a coach for her and having appointed changes of fresh horses by the way that she might come in all have she came to the countess de roucy lodgings who was her eldest brothers lady monsieur de phelypeaux paid her a visit there that very day and he returned upon the morrow and dined with her the chevalier de roye who was this young ladies brother was at dinner with them and finding that monsieur de phylipeaux had caused a great many pieces of clothe of gold and silver to be brought to him that he might choose what pleased him best he said to the countess de rocy that if she did well she would take him off a vest of one of the pieces of that was sold for  0 louis dors the ell madame de roucy was not over hasty in doing it and the young bride having chosen what pleased her best the mercer went home before the chevalier de roye had his desire but after he was gone the chevalier fell a jesting with madame de roucy and said it was a mean thing in her to have let the mercer go away with the brocado stufs before she had done what he desired of her that it was the least she could have done for the honor of her sisters marriage monsieur de phelipeaux seemed not to take any notice of what he said but so soon as he was gone home he sent orders to that mercer that the next morning he should wait upon the chevalier de roy by the time he had got up with that piece of stuff and that he should let him have as much of it as he desired the mercer obeyed his orders and made his compliments to the chevalier and told him the commission he had got the chevalier finding he might take what he pleased of the whole piece took not only as much as would be a vest but as much more as would line him a coat the marriage was solemnized within two days after and the king gave only  0000 crowns to monsieur de phelypeaux though he used to make a present of  00000 franks to the son of one of his ministers of state upon occasion of his marriage but he told monsieur pontchartrain that he was not so liberal as he used to be and that the then juncture of affairs was the cause of it for the war forced him against his will to be a good husband of his money but that the present loss should be made up to them another time monsieur pontchartrain was a man of too great sense not to take this compliment as he ought to do and being very glad to have a daughter in law of so good quality he had the satisfaction to hear every body approve of the choice he had made for his son he certainly quite outdid all that the former ministers of state had done for raising their families and those of whom his daughter in law was descended were far more illustrious than the families of the souvrees or the alegres or the matignons with whom tellier and the colberts had marched and the family of crussol of which the marquis de barbesieuxs first lady was a daughter was far short of them though it was honored with the title of duke and peer of france next morning after this marriage there was  00 louis dors put under the young married ladys toilette which was but a small sum for a lady of her quality there being ordinarily a greater present made to a partisans daughter but the evening before she had got a present of a little box with a great many fine toys in it and she found in the bottom of it a little box full of ear rings and jewels  every body went and paid visits to the new married couple and the duchess de lausun having gone to pay her compliments she saw her mothers lacqueys in the antichamber by which she knew that she was there and being unwilling to be found in company with her least she should ostend her husband she went out of the room designing to go home though she had already caused notice to be given that she was there this was told to madame de phelypeaux and to madame de pontchartrain who was then in company with her and who sent to call back the duchess and went and spoke to her and brought her into a closet and put her in company with her mother the duchess was once in hopes to have been married to monsieur phelypeaux and his mother madame de pontchartrain would have been extremely glad that she had been her daughter in law but the duke de lausun making his addresses to her at the same time the mareshal de lorges who knew that the duke was worth  00000 livers a year loved rather to see his daughter a duchess than daughter in law to a minister of state this had made some misunderstandings for some time between madame de pontchartrain and the mareshals lady but they were reconciled by this marriage and she was the first that told the duchess that she ought to live in a better correspondence than she did with her mother the mareshals lady told her the same and charged her with ingratitude since she knew well enough how tenderly she ad always loved her the duchess told her that if she pleased she might easily remove the cause which she had to complain of her that she wished for nothing more than to see her frequently and to live in good terms with her and that it was very unpleasant to her to be deprived of that happiness but she was obliged to obey her husband and it was in her mothers power to cause justice to be done him and then all difficulties would be removed that besides if she loved her as much as she said she did she would cause ready money to to be paid to the duke and her that what they got might be exempted from those after enquiries to which the estates of farmers of the kings revenues are liable the mareshals lady having no inclination to do any such thing or perhaps being afraid that the doing it might discover all the effects which had been conveyed out of the way that her mother brother and herself might be secured from such an enquiry answered her that she demanded what was impossible for her to grant that she could not expect more than what she could have out of her grandfathers estate and that to ask more was a proof that she considered her own interest rather than what was reasonable the duchess replied that notwithstanding all she said yet the duke her husband believed that he did not demand any thing but what was reasonable but since she and her friends were all of another opinion and he was positive in his resolutions it was not likely they would soon agree that for herself she was extremely vexed at it because she found herself deprived of all that sweet converse she might have with her parents without any hopes of a reconciliation because she knew her husband to be of such an humor that it was almost impossible to dissuade him from any thing that he had resolved upon and he was certainly as headstrong as a shemule when he had got any thing once in his head and instead of being softened by the account the duchess gave him of her mothers grief because she and they were not good friends he was more incensed against them than before and he not only prosecuted his lawsuit but petitioned the council that he might be allowed to bring it before other judges pretending that he having accused madame de fremont and her son for having intermeddled with the estate of the deceased they ought to plead their cause before the court of aides and not before the requetes du palais by which we may perceive that while he endeavored to secure himself against an enquiry he endeavored to expose his ladys grand mother and her uncle to one this enraged them more than ever against him especially because it was their interest that the world should not know that monsiur fremont was so rich as he truly was when he died for it is a crime for those who farm the revenues to die so rich and their heirs are ordinarily called to account for it they had a thousand instances of this in other people and though they had not had any yet they had lately had an inance that concerned them nearly and which no doubt put them under great apprehensions  one who had been a deputy or clerk to mr fremont was dissatisfied with him perhaps because he had not considered him in his will or it may be because he had not made any great fortune while he was in his service however he came to monsr pentchartrain and informed him that he knew a certain place where his deceased master had hid  000000 of money that he himself had assisted in putting it there so that he spoke nothing but what he knew to be certainly true he was so positive in what he had said that it was impossible for  pentchartrain o to believe him and therefore he sent orders to the intendant at roan to go to the place where this deputy had told him the money was hid which was in a cellar of a castle which fremont had bought in normandy this dep went nither also by order of the same minister that he might point out the very place where it was hid but when the intendant had gone thither and made as exact a search as was possible for him there was nothing found the deputy thought to have excused himself by saying it had been taken away since the time that he had put it there but as no man should think to deal thus by a minister of state for they would be every day imposed upon if those who offered to do it were not punished for it he was sent to prison and no doubt he deserved it though he had not been guilty of any thing but of designing to ruin the family of that man by whom he had acquired all the estate he had however the duke de lausn pretending that if it was not in that place that madame de fremont and her son had hid her husbands and his fathers treasures yet as he pleaded before the council the case ought to be referred to the court of aides and his reasons were that it belonged to that court to take cognizance of the estates of farmers of the kings revenues wherein the king himself was concerned directly or indirectly that in the case between madame fremont mr onneuil and him the kings interest was manifestly oncerned seeing the question was if they had concealed the effects that had belonged to a man employed in the kings revenues there was scarce any person of note or interest whether at court or in the city but solicited the one or for the other party and though the mareshal de lorges and his lady seemed not to concern themselves in the business in which it was thought that if they would declare themselves it would be in favor of their son in law and their daughter rather than for madame de fremont and her son yet they solicited underhand for these they considered that besides that the memory of the deceased ought to be dear unto them not only because he was the father of the mareshals lady but because he had been a great benefactor to them both before and after their marriage they ought therefore to do all that was in their power for saving his estate from being seized they thought it was very likely that though the stroke could not fall upon themselves because of the precautions they had taken both in their marriage contract and in the gifts they had afterward received yet it might fall upon their daughter who instead of having the  00000 crowns that madame de fremnt and mr donneuil were willing to pay her she might be in hazard of losing the whole of it  these solicitations and underhand dealings how close soever they were kept yet came to the dukes ears and enraged him to a greater degree against his father in law and mother in law so that it was observed of him that he took as much pains to obtain what he had desired of the council as he did four or five years ago to shun the weight of king william of englands arm but all the pains he took turned at last to his confusion for he was cast before the council and the only thing that the chancellor said to him that could please him because of the hatred he bore to his ladys grandmother and uncle was that when such people as the deceased had been did marry their daughters or grandaughters to persons of quality it was the first step they made to restore to the public what they had robbed it of but by the good leave of that magistrate i do not think that the name of restitution agrees well to such an action as that for to restore a thing is to give it back after it has been taken and to give it back to the rightful owner too but for a man to laden his children or grandchildren with money and by great wealth to purchase to them a blood that cannot mix with theirs without some sort of shame and then to call this restitution was an odd way of speaking and it is the first time i ever heard it called so the duke de lauun being cast by the council and the case remitted back to the requetes du palais their friends offered to mediate for an agreement between them they persuaded the duke as well as madame de fremont and her son to submit the cause to the arbitration of two counselors of state and having chosen monsieur de la reine and monsieur de ribere they told the duke that these two magistrates being great lovers of justice would give him as much satisfaction as the requetes du palais would do provided he had a just cause but having got private intelligence that he could not expect great satisfaction from these two counselors of state and that they had said that they did not think that the widow or children of a donor could be obliged to pay ready money when the deceased had not left any he became so suspicious of them that he recalled a blank he had signed with an obligation to acknowledge them for judges and would prosecute the matter in all the forms before the requetes du palais who laughed at his pretensions and a merced him in the expenses of the suit  if freonts pretended hidden treasure mde a great noise and made many people say that there was never a parisan i e one that farms the kings revenues saved since he who had robbed the people of so much money by his extortions had not been at pains to restore any part of what he had robbed yet there was one of them that gave some grounds to think that there are some people of that employment who sometimes think of their own salvation but i do not know if it be enough for a man to think upon it only as he did for i think if a man be as much concerned in it as he ought to be he must join effects and deeds to his thoughts whatever may be the result of them however this business made as great noise as the pretended hidden treasure did of which i gave just now an account one of these farmers of the revenues whose name i have forgot died and left two children behind him who did not live in great friendship together which happens often betwixt brothers the father had in his will considered the one much more than the other with which this last was very ill pleased and resolved to make his brother uneasy and threatened to tell mr fonchartrain of their deceased fathers management unless he would let him have an equal share in the estate i know not if he was such a fool to do what he threatened or if one who had been his fathers clerk had done as mr fremonts clerk did but mr ponchartrain being informed soon after their fathers death that there was something found among his papers that might turn to the kings advantage he sent a commissary from paris to seal up all the papers which he had in the place where he died it was within the generality of alencon and mr de pommereus son who was intendant of it receiving orders to be present when the cabinets coffers etc were to be sealed the whole business was done with all the precautions that could possibly be taken in a matter wherein they were afraid to be cheated and the intendant left a garrison to continue there till the seals should be taken off this business frightened all the partisans who were afraid their children and goods might be used the same way after their deaths but because in the time of so burdensome a war the court had often need of them it was not thought convenient to discourage them and therefore a report was spread among the people that the reason why the papers etc of the deceased were sealed up was because he had made a will in favor of the king when they had observed all the forms that were usual on such occasions so that there was no reason could be given for any farther delay the intendant returned from alencon to assist at the opening of the seals which was done with all the usual formalities and in the inventory of the papers which had been left by the deceased it was found there were two papers by which the partisan had declared that god had given him grace to examine his conscience and that he would not adventure to go into the other world without restoring what he had taken wrongfully in the first of these papers which clearly appeared to have been first done though it was neither dated or signed he said that he had by indirect and unjust methods gained  00000 crowns during the time he had been concerned in the revenues so that it was his will that his heirs might restore that sum to the king as for the other paper it was found to have been written after the former for it contained a declaration that after a mature and serious reflection upon all the business he had been concerned in he found that he had made an unjust acquisition of  00000 livers so that it was his will that his children should restore it to his majesty out of his estate the intendant sent copies of the two papers to mr pontchartrain who in such a matter would not rely upon his own judgment which was that though they were not dated or signed so that they would not signify any thing between two private persons yet it might be otherwise when the king was concerned in them he therefore consulted all those whom he thought capable to determine so nice a question some were of one opinion and some of another those who were more for the forms of law than for material justice did not think that the heirs of the deceased could be sued in law seeing such papers were not regarded in any court of justice but on the other hand those who followed the maxims of mr pussort the late dean of the council who as i have already said voted always in the kings favor whether his majesty was plaintiff or defendant made use of his authority to prove that the king had good reason to demand the  00000 livers mentioned in the last of the two papers  besides this authority which they reckoned upon as a law that had taken place in the time of a great minister who had reformed the state and had put the kings affairs into an excellent condition by the prodigious taxes that had been laid upon the partisans they alleged also that when a man did acknowledge in a paper written with his own hand that he had unjustly acquired such a sum of money that was by a thousand times a more convincing proof than all the other proofs that could possibly be had mosieur pochartrin was much of the same opinion as the truth is a man can hardly be of another yet there are certain rules of law which must be observed least the laws themselves to which they rlate should be violated and therefore he spoke nothing either for it or against it unless that it was to be wished that all the partisans which had been formerly taxed had done as this man did since that would have been an established rule by which the king might have legally demanded what they had cheated him of because of this expression it was thought that he was much of mr pssorts mind as to the partisans yet it was an expression no man could find fault with for besides that common sense will not allow a man to accuse himself unjustly he was obliged to say all this as suitable to his office however all the effects of the deceased farmer of the revenues were seized so that though he who had been the informer in this matter had not promised to find out  0000000 as mr de freonts clerk had done yet the information was found to be truer the great need the king had of money at that time to support the war was the reason that this minister thought it not proper to neglect such a business though to speak the truth it was so small a matter in comparison of what was needful to the support of that war that it was no more capable to do it than it is for a drop of water to quench a great flame  though the king had been already necessitated to make a great many edicts yet he was still obliged to make new ones and one among the rest which gave occasion to a witty expression of the duke de fertes at least it was reckoned witty by some little pretenders to wit though i confess i am not of their mind whether it be that i am but an ill judge or that they have been mistaken at that time this edict was concerning coats of arms belonging to families all the people of quality were striving who should make the best projects for bringing in money to the king for they knew his majesty would reward them for it and most of them had need of some reward because of the great expense they were at in the army and at court the duchess of roquelaure was the author of this project and had a good reward for it and being come to versailles some days after with a very rich petticoat many of those little pretenders who were standing round about the duke de la ferte who made them sometimes laugh desired him to take notice of that rich petticoat and to admire it he said that it was no wonder it was rich and fine seeing it was strewn and decked with all their scutcheons this was the witty expression that was so much talked of though i thought there was as little wit in it if not less than in another which he had some days after upon occasion of the kings going to s germain en lay to pay a visit to k james and his queen those who were with the duke asked him why the king went so often thither he said he did not exactly know what might be his majestys reason but he guessed that the general peace being now upon the point of being concluded so that k james could not stay any longer in that kingdom the king went to acquaint him with the article of six months stay every body was persuaded that seeing by this peace the king was to acknowledge king william for rightful king of great britain k james would not stay and see his ambassadors come to his majestys court and that therefore he would go to rome or at least to avignon to conceal his misfortunes but as he has learned by the exercises of piety and devotion which he has practiced these many years past to take the saddest events as from the hand of god so it is now found that the duke de la frte was out in his guessing when he thought that this prince would soon leave s germains yet k james resolved not to let the peace be concluded without making the confederates sensible that the alliance they had entered into with k william for setting him upon his throne might be of dangerous consequence to themselves he caused a manifesto to be drawn up and copies of it to be given to all the ministers of princes and states that were concerned in the conferences at reswick in this manifesto he vindicated himself from an imputation that his subjects had charged him with which was that he had been always so strictly in the kings interests that he would never enter into any treaty with any other potentates for reducing his power which was become formidable to all europe and the confederates themselves who had often endeavored to gain him but could never prevail whether it was that he was really in his majestys interest or that he thought it was for his own interest not to engage in war against him made also use of the same pretxt when they deserted him for when he sent some of his servants to their courts after k william was entered into england and desired them that they would not give any assistance to that prince they met with so very cold a reception that it is impossible to find its parallel and the pope himself did as it were mock at him so that the person whom he sent to rome brought nothing back but beads instead of sums of money though he informed his hliness that the true reason of his misfortunes was that he had zealusly endeavored to reestablish the roman catholic religion in his dominions but how much soever it was the popes interest to have protected him upon that account ye his holiness had his own share in those fears which the kings great power gave to all the other princes of europe so that he would not hearken either to what religion advised him to or to what the ordinary interest of popes uses to suggest to them on such occasions after k james had published his manifesto he met with the same treatment be had met with before for though he cleared himself as well as he could from the accuation i have already mentioned and endeavored also to make the consederates senble that they might come to fall under as great misfortunes as had befallen him if they should sufter that by the teaty of peace which was upon the point of being concluded the prince of  should be acknowledged king of england yet they did not think it convenient to treat him better than they had done before so that there being no hopes left him of being restored to his throne unless some great revolution should happen in his country he entreated the king that what treaty soever he should make with his enemies yet he ight never oblige him to go to any great distance from his court he thought prudence obliged him to ask this of his majesty for he remembered how after his fathers misfortunes his brother and he had been forced to depart out of fance where they thought to have found protection  the end of the first part memoirs of the court of france and of the city of paris part ii k jamess manifesto had no effect it being the interest of all the confederates to keep k william upon the throne that he had mounted by the unanimous consent of his people they took no notice of it the plenipotentiaries at the reswick treaty carried on the conferences without any great concern in his interest all that france could do on his behalf was a secret article providing for the een his wifes jointure to be signed at the same time with the treaty the insignificancy of this manifesto appeared in his most christian majestys declaration to all the allies that he owned k william as the lawful king without which article he could expect no accommodation this accknowledgment did not uch perplex that prince who went upon sure grounds for in the articles of peace proposed by the king when his plenipotentaries offered to state that article he advised em to dash it out because he knew very well how to keep up the dignity conferred upon him by the parliament of england with the succors of his people and allies so that this question was to bear no figure among those contested by the respective parties  in the mean time the armies pursuant to their usual custom made preparations for the field and the king having reenforcd his troops with those he had recalled from italy would not listen to the truce that was offered to him by the allies the mareshalls villeroy and boufflers commanded the army in flanders which was the most considerable but though they succeeded to the command the duke of luxemburg had before his death yet they were far short of succeeding to his reputation villeroy for his first adventure suffered the prince of vaudemont to escape whom he might have entirely defeated and his carelessness not to mention his insufficiency occasioned the loss of namur boufflers having thrown himself into that place made so sorry a defense that after his return from that expedition l apparat who was chief engineer at the siege of barcelona told him to his face that if he had been within the walls of namur it had either been still in the kings hands or else he had cut off a great part of k williams army the marshal was mightily surpised with this discourse which seemed to charge him either with cowardice though indeed l apparat was mistaken if h took that for his weak side or else with want of experience for one of these two must needs have occasioned the loss of that place however he replied that his success before barcelona made him take such measures as became him very ill and that he would make him eat in his words were it not that he knew he had received some blows on the head which had turned his brains l apparat made answer that the mareshal ought not to apply to himself what he meand of another that he prayed god to forbid that ever he should censure his conduct that he was very sensibie of the deference and respect that was due to him that he only meand that mr de megrigny who was employed to defend namur in the quality of engineer had acted his part so very ill that he would not stand to affirm that he either wanted courage or at least had forgot himself by this means l apparat cleared himself and the mareshal was very well pleased to see him throw upon another what he had applied to himself but soldiers do not always examine things so nicely whoever has the general command they impute all their good or bad success to him the whole army regretted the loss of their late general besides there was a vast difference between him and those who filled his post mareshal villeroy was puffed up with a great opinion of himself though at the same time he never had done any thing upon which he could ground so much conceiedness on the contrary the soldiers called to mind how contemptuously his father treated him upon his return from the siege of lisle by reason of some charge laid against him insomuch that if he had not by a desperate turn retrieved his reputation in the conquest of the county which happened the next year he had run the risque of never returning as for mareshall boufflers it is true he could not be charged with any such thing for he was so cautious and irresolute that twas manifest he was a stranger to that presumption that rendered the other unsupportable but after all this irresolution spoke him diffident of himself for which reason the soldiers said the duke of luxemburg read what he had to do in his hunch but neither of the present generals could find any thing in their heads  some hours before that generals death he called the duke of montmorany his eldest son to his bedside and gave him to know that to make him easy he behooved to give him a promise which would afford him some comfort in his passage to the other world the duke of montmorancy promising obedience to his commands the poor dying general buoyed up with hopes told him that since he had been long  marchioness f belleonds  be the fool to marry her on  desd he would  upon  not to marry her when his eyes were  this lady was the duke of mazarins  her fathers devourness occasioned her being married to the marquis of bellfonds for the  his father was as devout as the  but the maquis was not a proper ma for her or he had ier the estate nor a thousand other things that a lady of her quality might have expected in a husband however as children do not always follow their fathers ootsteps so the marquis was not near so devct as the mareshll upon which account the duke of mazarin frequently repented that he had made him his soninlaw at last after the marquis had lived some time with the dukes daughter he was killed at the head of his regiment in the battle of stenkerke the government of vincennes being given by the duke of mazarin with his daughter became vacat by the marquiss death so that the marchioness was but in sorry circumstances for a lady of quality for though the king gave that government to her son and the survivorship to the mareshll of bellfonds yet the incomes arising to her out of her husbands estate were but very narrow twas for this reason that the duke of luxemburg feared his sons marrying of her he being then a widdower by the death of his wife who was a daughter of the duke of chevreuse the duke of montmorancy whom his father never press d to any thing that was not to his advantage readily complied with his fathers demands in giving his promise two days after the duke of luxemburg died and his son resolved to stand to his promise though he continued still to visit the widow and even became more in love with her than before however having no issue by his wife and being a person of a great figure in regard of the government of normandy which his father had procured him he had a mind to marry again the marchioness of seignelay was a proper match for him both for estate and quality she was very handsome and her age bore a suitable proportion to his but this lady being the widow of a minister of state in whose lifetime every body stooped to her stood upon the point of honor when she preceivd that the dukes agents pretended that she behooved to give the duke considerable odds because she had children after which she would never hear of the proposal again she thought that notwithstanding her widdowhood she was at any time as good as the duke of montmorancy who had assumed the title of luxemburg after his fathers death and that it became him to treat with her at even hands the duke finding she would not give him any thing looked out for a wife elsewhere and having pitched upon the only daughter of the marquis of clerembaut who had formerly a place in monsieurs household married her a few days after she was but fourteen years of age and was very pretty though she was not a beauty her mother being the widow of count du plessis the present duke of choiseuls eldest brother had married her husband for love and being acquainted with the pleasure of the conjugal state when man and wife live in perfect union would needs put her soninlaw upon the same foot with the marquis of clerembaut she used all manner of perswasives to oblige him to keep company with no woman but his wife but the duke of luxemburg having married her daughtr only for his interest and having always loved the marchioness of bellefonds did not like her remonstrances he told her all the world was not like her husband and scarce any body but himself could confine their addresses to one woman his motherinlaw not discouraged by this answer renewed the attack several times she would even oblige him never to see his mistress again but the duke would never give her his promise to that effect upon which she put the shrew upon him and treated him just as if the regulation of his conduct had been her province the duke did not like her ways however to make her sensible that that was not the way to win or break him he redoubled his visits to the marchioness of bellefonds this put the old woman into a passion she teased her soninlaw so incessantly that he was obliged to tell her he would either take away his wife to another house for they lived all together the motherinlaw and her husband being obliged by the contract of marriage to give them both lodging and diet or else dine and sup always abroad and indeed he was as good as his word but when he saw all his remonstrances were ineffectual he began to lie out in the night sometimes in the bagnios and sometimes in luxemburghouse which was still furnished but all this was so far from producing the proposed effect that his motherinlaw grew still more uneasy and troublesome insomuch that he was quickly obliged to leave her for good and all  this duke had three brethren and two sisters one of which married the prince of neuschattel as i intimated above the other was shut up in a convent but would willingly have come out if she could as for the brethren one of them was hunchbackd like his eather for which reason the late duke of luxemburg designed him for the church pursuant to the common practice of persons of quality who allot only to god almighty what is not fit for the world the two other brethren were count luce and chevalier luxembourg the former being already a brigadier in the kings army and in good repute among the soldiers quickly assumed the title of duke of chatillon upon the death of the duchess of mekleburg his aunt who made him her universal heir and among other things left him the duchy of chatillon with the lands of marlau which brought in better than forty thousand livres a year the king revived that dukedom in his favor for it had lain extinct by the death of the duke of chatillon his aunts first husband this new duke married afterward mademoiselle de rhan descended of an infamous branch of the house of tremouille for the marquis of rhan her father and her grandfather as well as the abbot of tremouille her uncle were persons that did not deserve such illustrious titles as for count olnne her fathers elder brother it is true he had more sense than either her father or the abbot and did not love drinking as they did but after all he had never been much known in the world if his wife had not made up that defect for the care she took in spreading his reputation was crowned with such admirable success that there were generals in the army who were not so much spoken of as he however he did one thing that met with a general approbation from the world namely his separation from her as soon as he saw her bestow upon others what was only his due but having inured himself to her customs while they lived together he retained a tincture of em after her departure he loved to see a great deal of company in his house as she did in hers and a great many met there and gmd every night by ths means his majesty who always discouraged impiety came to be informed that he wnt beyond many others in a dexterity of coin oaths upon this his majesty sent him word that if he continued in that course e  me to repent it ere long this complent made him wiser than he was before so that what further progress he made in his wonted course was done incognito twas to be wished that the kings authority could have reformed his brethren as soon as himself though swearing was not their crime yet one would not have taken them for persons of quality unless he had known them the chevalier de rohan and the abbot tremouille lodged in a scandalous tipplinghouse though the last was worth almost ten thousand livers a year and the first had enough to live upon upon this account a gentleman belonging to the court to oblige them to recollect themselves sent em a great packet countersignd by a secretary of state as if it had come from the court twas addressed to my cousins the abbot tremouille and chevalier rohan at the six monks tavern in paris twas delivered to their landlady at a time when they were abroad and though they had not much sense yet they understood it to be a ridiculing of their drunkenness the name of cousin in the subscription was a privilege that all their family formerly enjoyed though at present it is confined to the eldest so that if they were not dukes and peers as they are at present yet the king would always dignifie them with the title of my cousin unless his majesty pleased to take that prerogative from them as he has sometimes done to other families  for instance the counts of clermont lodeve whose posterity the marquis of sessack pretends at present to renew this family i say in former times were entitled to the same privilege and it is only of late that the king deprived em of it and that upon this occasion the elder brother of that marquis being ordered to the bastile by reason of a blow he gave to the bishop of londeve in languedock was in a quanday whether he should obey the order or not because he was not styled cousin in the sealed letter that was sent him however count olonne who was worth almost forty thousand livers a year having no children resolved to marry chevalier rohan his brother in hopes that the offspring would not resemble the father there being few ladies of quality though never so ordinary and poor that would accept of him for a husband he fixed upon one of his own cousins that had nothing namely mademoiselle noirmoutier sister to the dutchesses of brachiane and lanti she was likewise of the tremouille family and the daughter of the duke of noirmoutier who had so great a hand in the first paris war as soon as he opened the matter to her she trembled from top to toe as being acquainted with the character of her designed husband but his promise of settling his whole estate upon his brother in case the marriage went on and a great many other things that he represented to her as matter of comfort did so tame her that she presently complied and thus she married the man in the world that deserved least to be loved and upon other scores had so little knowledge of his own character that some time after when some citizens came to game at her house e of em not knowing the chevalier and seeing him offer her a seat bid him give her another because that one did not please her mademoiselle noirmoutier who then enjoyed the title of marchioness of rohan was obliged to put up a great many other affronts but gaming which she loved to the last degree made amends for every thing and the profit she drew from it compensated the avarice of count olonne who having made her husband his heir was so sharp set that he would give him nothing while he lived mr harlei soninlaw to the present chancellor loved gaming as passionately as she and used to game in her house where he made such a voyage that a few such more would have ruined him she and madam thereon won twenty thousand crowns of him at one bout and upon such losses it being natural to offer some plea or other for not paying he did not do as mr verthamont did for instead of paying the money without any words in order to stifle the scandal he gave it out that he was cheated the chancellor displeased with his conduct told him twas a sorry excuse and that when the king had caught a man cheating him he expelled him the court which was a lesson for others that it behooved him to follow in fine he gave him twenty thousand crowns to be delivered to those that won that sum of him the marchioness of rohan had several such little jobbs which helped her out while she waited for count olonnes death at last he died as well as her husband who left her only one daughter upon this she resolved to breed up her daughter as a great heiress and to enjoy her self but as the saying is man proposes and god disposes her self was snatched away soon after em she was seized with a violent pain in a very sensible part and to appease the unsufferable pain and procure her some rest she took a dose of opium that was somewhat stronger than ordinary immediately after the taking of it she slept effectualy but so as never to awake for next day she was found dead in her bed twas her daughter that the duke of chatillon married and though she was the daughter of a father and mother that were not very well spoken of and withal not so agreeable as her sisterinlaw yet she found out the secret of living more happily with her husband than the duchess of luxemburg did with hers for that duke continued still to visit madam bellefonds which enraged his motherinlaw so much that if she had had her will she had taken her daughter from him but as there are some rules in the way of justice that one is obliged to follow in spite of all that may happen so it behooved both she and her daughter to be patient  at the same time the king gave a pension of six thousand lives to madam de cavis and when he bestowed the gift gave her to know that he was angry with himself for being so late in grtiying her and that she should lose thing by staying so long for that the pret he then made her was but a pattern of what he designed to do for the future both for h and her husband mr de cavoy was grand marshal of the apartments of the kings house a place that entitled his predecesors to the order of the holy ghost but at the last installment he had not that dignity conferred upon him though many others that had not so much reason to expect it as he were then invested with it the reason was said to be this he appeared to be too much interessd in some things for which he employed the marquis of signlys iterest being in very good terms with that minister for the purpose the scene was lid between him and a merchant to whom he promised upon a consideration of ten thousand crows to release a vessel of his that had been sizd as a true prize and in effect he prord the restitution from that minister upon whom it depended but as every man has enmies so those that had an interest in the confiscation of the ship took occasion to acquaint the king that mr cavoy in consideration of a private interest had caused a seizure to be restored without a valuable ransom up on this his majesty reversed the decree that the counsel had given on the merchants behalf so that his ship and cargo was confiscated anew and sold for the kings benefit this done mr de cavois was obliged to return the ten thousand crowns he had already fingered and forasmuch as he did not repay it till he was pressed and urged to it it came to the kings ears for there are always people about court that are never a sleep when they have an opportunity of injuring their neighbor besides a chief reason why they would not forgive cavos was that there was a misunderstanding between the marquis de louvis and the marquis de signl and the creatures of the one hunted only for opportunities of ruining the creatures of the other presuming that ch a sacrifice would be very agreeable to their tron in fine the death of the marquis de signly had in a manner buried mr de cas in his masters disgrace when the king evivd him by this his bounteous present he had bought a house at lovettienne a small village about a muske shot from marli at this place his wie a native of britany kept a dairy and having made some butter after the fashion of her own country made a present of it to the king as an acknowledgement of his late bounty his majesty liked the butter above all things in the world insomuch that he desired her to send him some not only to marli but to versailles when he returned thither  in the mean time the marquis of cascaye ambassador from portugal entertained the public with a very diverting scene he was a very rich man and brought as much silver plate to paris as might have served for twenty ambassadors tables he was a passionate lover of gaming especially at lansquenet which was always in vogue notwithstanding the efforts of a nw lieutenant of the police to suppress it who for that end went about to several houses of the city where the gamesters assembled madam le camus destouches having a house in the arsenal and being fearless of that officers visits kept two days in the week for that game the ambassador went thither and having lost all his money began to play upon tick an adventurer that played at the same place and lost his money as well as the marquis being out of humor happened to say twas a strange thing to see men loose their money every day and yet play upon credit the gentleman spoke it with reference to some others that distinguished themselves that way as well as the ambassador but the ambassador applying it to himself testified his displeasure by giving him two blows upon the spot with all his force and to entertain him yet better ordered his gentleman of the horse who always followed him to give him some blows with the flat side of his sword the gentleman of the horse put his masters commands in execution before the other could put himself in a posture of defense so that he was treated at a very handsome rate madam de frenoi being present said she wondered that a man especially one of his character would give such usage before ladies there being several in the company be sides her self this she spoke in a finical way affecting the air of quality and that in such words as might make her pass for such but the duchess de la ferte having a design upon her either because de frenoi was handsomer than she or because she was one of the losers replied that it did not become a little cit like her to censure the actions of a person of the marquis of cascay s quality the scene being thus changed they were so intent upon the new dispute about decorum that they forgot what had passed only the poor man that was banged kept a heavy clutter swearing and blustering that he would die by it or have satisfaction for the affront he had received but whatever was in it it is now almost a year since the thing happened and i do not find that he has done any thing suitable to his words as for madam de frenoi she was as good a tonguepad as the duchess and managed her point to the advantage some days after the ambassador came again to the royal palace to play at the house of a lady of another sort of quality than madam destouches the duchess of ferte happening to be there and retaining a resentment of the disagreeable words that madam du frenoi had uttered upon the account of his conduct asked him if he ordered his gentleman of the horse always to follow him for he was with him then and indeed at all times followed him as close as a shadow does the body the ambassador was about to give her some answer or other but she interrupted him by setting forth that there was no body in the company to beat so that the champion would loose his time in staying there that it was a thing unheard of among ladies of quality such being in that company to converse with a man that at the last meeting had treated their sex without respect or honor and that if such things took in portugal it was not so in france where the ladies knew better things this last article the ambassador would not grant to her he had taken too much pains to learn of the court and city ladies how to play at cards to quit the profession so easily but as to the first article he made answer that since she desired his gentleman of the horse should be sent away it should be done the new quarrel being thus put up they went to gaming in the mean time the poor fellow that was drubbd run up and down versailles and paris in quest of reparation for the atront but his interest being insignificant in either he lost his labor and put up the blows he had received  the marquis of ceaquin continued still to slight his ady and her relations understanding that he went often to the opera and had and  a she creature retaining to it ob  his majesty an order prohibiting all  of quality or any others to stand upon  for twas there that several in were first set on foot which were afterward improved behind the scenes and at last finished elsewhere this unsowd a great many little sparks that went thither only to belch out a thousand smutty and rank stories among these women who did not so much as wrap up the foulest bawdry in clean linen for they were all so very lewd that they did not blush to speak themselves such things the very hearing of which would at other times have covered them with confusion and disorder  the chevalier de la hilliere governor of roro died about this time he had formerly been a lieutenant in the lifeguard he did not much distinguish himself in his lifetime and i remember to have read some where or other that as he walked one day before the king the point of his sword having pierced through the scabbard gave his majesty a prick in the leg upon which the king told him he believed his sword never hurt any body before i shall not confirm this piece of detraction of which his majesty is less capable than another for whatever occasion men of quality may have given him to complain he never spoke to any of them in disobliging terms but it is certain that though this knight was not much talked of in his lifetime yet it was otherwise after his death he made a will that many wondered at which was much of the same nature with that made by the farmer of the revenues mentioned in the first part of this work nay it was rather more valid for instead of choosing soft smooth words to signify that he had cheated the king he downright owned himself guilty of robbery he set forth in plain terms that he had robbed the king of twenty thousand livers while he was governor of the place abovementioned and ordered his heirs to make restitution of the same before they appropriated to themselves one farthing of his estate a great many put in for his government for there were people enough about court ready to take the alarm upon any vacancy who wanted some subsistence of the king because they had spent most of what they had in his service but mr bartillac lieurenant general of his majestys forces had the best luck he had served a long time without getting any thing and the king having gratified all the old officers would not let him be the only one that could say he was forgot  in the mean time marshal boufflers represented to his majesty that he was dissatisfied with one of his lieutenant generals not that he was a coward and unworthy of his post but because he was so saucy that he had all the trouble in the world to make him receive his orders the king replied that he ought to discard him and that would quickly make him easy this marshal who is a younger brother of the house of piccardy served first in the guards in the quality of aidmajor after that his eldest brother marrying madam guenegaut the daughter of mr du plessis guenegaut secretary of state paid him down his portion then he bought the royal regiment of dragoons and began to distinguish himself at the head of it in the battle of st francis upon this mr de turenne who studied to serve all the world spoke so much of him to the king that his majesty had a deep impression of his character after that he served as the rest did till turenne his good friend died marshal crequi who succeeded turenne in the quality of a general could not endure boufflers at first and charged him with intermeddling officiously where he was not desired and very often without knowing well what he said he drew this check upon himself by boasting of some intelligence he had received of the enemy for the marshal being a proud man did not like such doings alleging that they insinuated an accusation against him as if he had not taken all the necessary measures for having as good intelligence as he whatever was in it mr boufflers by his patience conquered the generals aversion and they became such good friends that general crequi was the first that confirmed to his majesty the character that turenne had given him of boufflers and that marshal having in the latter part of his life retrieved the eclipse he met with at consardick bridge his confirmation did boufflers no harm for the king befriended mr boufflers and having made him a lieutenant general  after the peace of nimeguen raised him awards to a higher post he was already coll general of the dragoons and the late duke of lesdiguieres lent him money to buy that post perhaps more to disoblige the marquis of louvois than to oblige mr boufflers for that minister designed the post for the chevalier tilladet his cousin german though all the army said he was less worthy of it than the other considering his interest at court and mr boufflers his incapacity to purchase it he thought he could not miss the procuring of it to tilladet especially since tilladet had the most considerable post next to boufflers in the regiment his design in procuring it to tilladet was to transfer it afterward to one of his own sons for which reason he was not pleased with the duke of lesdiguieres for lending the money and mr boufflers was for sometime doubtful whether the marquis was his friend or his enemy but at last that minister finding that mr boufflers had the kings ear and that his majesty looked upon him as another turenne not with reference to his capacity which was far short of that generals but by reason of his being disinteressd like him and his inviolable respect for his person that minister i say upon these considerations dropped the spite he had against him and accordingly did not oppose his majestys bounty to him he was made governor of luxembourg after the king took it and marshal crequi dying some time after his majesty bestowed upon him the government of lorrain which was vacant by the marshals death after that the war broke out  he gave him the command of an army though he was then but a lieutenant general and ordered rubantel a lieutenant general and lieutenant colonel of the regiment of guards to receive orders from him this disobliged rubantel the more that he had een eldest captain in the regiment when the other was but admar having succeeded to his brothers company who was killed in the siege of vlennnes he would have shown his resentment before the judges but his interest was not great there because he had refused to marry madam s panges who was since married to one vernel judge of the court of requests so that they were not troubled at this his mortifiation  he served under this new general with a great deal of discontent but he quickly met with a greater affont for mr boufflers his interest at court grw so much that he had not only a blew ribband but was made a marshal of france governor of the french flanders and colonel of the regiment of guards this last piece of honor conferred upon him disobliged rubantel more than any thing else for being lieutenant colonel of that regiment he was obliged to obey his orders every day whether in camp or at court some time after the king designing a review of that regiment boufflers made his review first in order to remedy all deficiencies before the king saw them during this review mr rubantel sat upon thorns and as soon as mr boufflers gave orders that the regiment should file off before him mounted his coach and came to paris to avod the necessity of saluting him with pike in hand the marshal complained of this to the king and this was the person that boufflers pointed to when he told the king as we intimated above that he was dissatisfied with one of his lieutenant generals his majesty finding it his interest to prevent such an occasion of scandal in his army in which the measures of subordination must always be maintained ordered rubantel to be reprimanded by the marquis de barbesieux the son of the marquis de louvois who had died suddenly and whose place of secretary of state he had succeeded to this did not make rubantel the wiser for upon several other occasions he displayed an impatience in being subject to the marshal upon which the king was so angry that he resolved to take his commission from him his majesty discovered part of his mind to the duke of rochefoucaut who told him that though rubantel was in the wrong yet if his majesty would be pleased to consider the case he would find that his crime as great as it was did not deserve so severe a punishment that he had been captain of the guards forty years and though he was bound to give a blind obedience to whatever superior his majesty placed over him yet considering twas natural for a man not to love to see himself commanded by another that had been long his inferior twas very possible for him to depart from his duty these words softened the kings humor but his majesty being obliged to put another in his place by reason of the ill consequences that might ensue upon the failure of an exact discipline in his regiments commanded the marquis of barbesieux to order rubantel to resign his post in favor of count avejeant an old captain of the guards and marshal de camp this count was the soninlaw of the late mr valot the kings first physician and was at first looked upon by his wifes family as a person unworthy of their alliance for she had a great estate and he had scarce any but the king had a kindness for him because he was bred up his page and changed his religion betimes and in the progress of time he whom they looked upon as the most scandalous member of their family such as it was became not only the ornament but the support of the same the like happened before to the family of bourdeaux which made almost as sorry a figure as vallots the eldest daughter of the intendant of the finances a widow of a member of parliament being courtted by mr sanguin the father of the marquis of livri first steward to the king inveighed so bitterly against him that she was heard say he was unworthy of being received into her family but after all she was so wise and happy as to court him when she saw him in favor and if she had not engaged him in her interest she had been at a loss upon several occasions  to return from this digression the marquis de barbesieux having delivered the kings commands told rubantel at the same time that his carriage to marshal boufflers had so displeased the king that he would never have done any thing for him if the marshal had not interceded on his behalf that upon his intercession his majesty bestowed upon him the government of baratufort with a pension of four thousand livers and that he behooved to return thanks to the marshal upon that score rubantel considering that a great many of his juniors had some of them governments long before and others more considerable posts was so incensed upon the compliment that he immediately returned the marquis this answer that he would rather choose to receive no faours than to purchase them at that rate and that so long as he had the honor to serve his majesty he thought he had done his duty in such a manner as to deserve some grants without needing the recommendation of any one this said he went away without staying for any reply and the marquis barbesieux having given the king an account of his answer his majesty said aloud before all the court that he was not much surpised with his procedure because he had known him long before to be a man of that kidney he spoke likewise some other words which gave rubantels friends a jealousy that he might come to be committed thereupon the duke of rochefoucaut being touched with pity toward this unfortunate man whose long service seemed to deserve a better fate this duke i say presumed to offer to his majesty all that he thought was capable to appease his wrath his majesty replied that he would consider all his remonstrances but that he had suffered so many things from him already that he wondered himself was so late in doing what he had then done that this was not the first time he had given him occasion to be angry with him and that he had met with other instances of his insolence when he did not seem to take notice of it these words displaying still a resentment the consequences of which were to be feared the duke of rochefoucaut took the liberty to make answer that though his majesty had bore something of ill humor in that man yet he would be pleased to consider that he had stood the brunt of many a muskershot in his service and for the space of forty years the regiment of guards was never employed in any siege but he appeared and haarded himself as well as any of the regiment that himself had seen him charge again five or six times when a great many men were killed that he had given equal proof of his valor in i do not know how many battles and had spent so much of his blood that the honorable marks he bore in his body deserved at his maiestys hands a pardon for some escapes of his tongue  this discourse had the desired effect the kings anger relented but things being then at another pass than in the reign of cardinal mazarin in which favors were obtained by complaining or pretending to be formidable for by such means two or three persons got marshals staffs and others were preserd to posts of honor this time i say being of a different stamp from that insomuch that the greatest complaisance and submission were necessary means for having success the king did not renew the offer either of baratufort or the pension on the contrary he bestowed that governors place upon mr bacevilliers who had been long forgot and whatever merit he might have was like to have continued so all his life if he had not luckily been the marquis of montchevreuils sisters son without this circumstance his majesty had never heard of him for he had the misfortune to serve in the former war either in catalonia or messina and it is a great misfortune for an officer of any ambition to be so far out of his masters sight he continued a great while lieutenant colonel of horse but at last his uncle being loaded every day with royal favors and apprehending that it would be an unhandsome thing not to make his nephew share in his good fortune entreated madam maintenon to represent his services to the king that lady performed his request very willingly and the king told her frankly that if she had not spoken to him he might have continued a long time without knowing that officer that being the first time that ever he heard of his name thereupon his majesty made him a brigadier without staying till he had a regiment for him however the first vacancy was his and that he was scarce possessed of when he was made a marshal de camp and soon after a lieutenant general so that no man was ever observed to rise so fast at last his majesty crowned all his favors with a present of the above mentioned government and took his younger brother into his household where he is at present an ensign of the lifeguards  another officer in the army was yet more unfortunate than rubantel for after being imprisoned in the bastile and losing his regiment which was worth better than ten thousand crowns a year he had never obtained his liberty if the peace had not been made this was a son of the duke of tirconnels by a lady that he had promised marriage to tho he never performed his promise his name was talbot which was likewise the dukes name and is a name very famous both in england and in france from whence that house derived its original he was a brigadeer in the army in italy and had a regiment there he came from that country to court about two or three years ago at the time when king james pretended to sail for england upon which king james bid talbot follow him but talbot made answer that though he had an irish regiment yet being in the service and pay of his most christian majesty he could not dispose of his person without his majestys leave and that if he would be so kind as to speak of it to the king he would be glad to obey his commands i know not whether talbot spoke these words with such an air as signified his unwillingness to go or whether that prince took it ill that one of his subjects should say he could not obey him without his most christian majestys leave but in fine kine james discovered by his countenance that he had forgot that talbot was the son of a man that had done him great service and to this day is by all that know him esteemed the most faithful and affectionate to his prince of any that we have seen for a long time talbot perceived this as well as the rest but whether it was that he did not trouble himself about it or that wine which he loved too well had sunk his judgment he told that very day to the marquis de larre at a drinkingmatch what had passed between king james and him adding withal very imprudently whether through the influence of wine or real thought that he could not imagine what that prince meand to do in england and that he was respected or beloved by very few every body almost being persuaded that he was a thousand times fitter for a convent than for the throne next day the marquis de larre visited the marquis de barbesieux with whom he was in favor and gave him an account of what passed between him and talbot thinking perhaps rather to do him service than to injure him for the purpose he might have in his view to inform that minister of his inviolable affection to the kings service upon the comparison with k jamess but the marquis of barbesieux having told the story to a lady that he courted and she having told it to the queen of england this princess solicited the king to cause talbot to be taken up accordingly he was taken up at versailles and carried to the bastile believing that a prince of k jamess devotion would confine his resentment to a few days imprisonment but as devout people are seldom guilty of granting pardons or at least have no great name for it so he was quickly made to understand that k james had a mind to have him broke the duchess of tirconnel being a lady of honor to the queen of england used her endeavors to prevent the blow that was about to reduce that poor gentleman to the state he was in when he came from his mothers belly for though he had served a long time and had great incomes yet he had been so careless a husband that he could scarce raise two thousand crown upon all he had marshal de noailles who was his friend and under whom he had served in catalonia solicited the king to avert the misfortune but his majesty replied that it did not lie at his door and that if the king and queen of england did not desire him to be broke he was satisfied but at the same time he justly blamed him for drawing that disgrace upon himself and the marshal could not excuse it otherwise than upon the score of wine which often sinks the reason of the most sensible men mr de vendome interceeded likewise on his behalf but twas all in vain for k james and his queen made not only his regiment but a pension that he had to be taken from him and thus he had the mortification of seeing himself unplumd by one stroke of his tongue of all the fruit of his services and which is yet worse though at present he is at liberty i do not know that he has yet obtained any thing though i see him every day going from paris to versailles and from versailles to st germains he has been a long time without obtaining leave of k james and his queen to come and beg their pardon their majestys thinking it proper to show that their resentment continues still  among all this matter of affliction especially to talbot and rubantel as well as their friends there happened a new scene at paris that may be entertaining to the public the wife of one that belonged to the payoffice a very coquette lady in her way had one day a mind to ride in her coach her coachman having combined with some of her servants to play her a trick got upon his coachbox without dressing his horses or cleaning the coach the lady asked him what he meand by serving a person of her quality in that fashion her quality after all was not very great but since madam du fresnoi the wife of a common citizens son when speaking of her self took upon her to say a woman of my quality by the same reason this good woman might call herself a lady of quality for both her own and her husbands father were something more than the others however the coachman gave her no answer knowing that nothing provokes a woman more than not answering her whether she be in the right or the wrong she redoubled her reprimands to make him speak and finding that he was still mute attacked him with threats and hard words at last the coachman very unconcernedly answered her that she made a great deal of noise for a small matter and if she would take his advice she should give over bawling and make no more words of it the lady enraged with such an insolent answer redoubled her threats and abusive language but the coachman having kept the best to the last told her that he wondered that such a one as she should be so ill to please and that she was too well served for a w  at that word she was out of all patience and called up her footmen who had sheerd off on purpose to have the more diversion by the comedy they ran up to her all in a heat to know her pleasure she asked them to act for her in being revenged upon that insolent fellow the footmen pretending to know nothing of the matter she gave them to know that he had the impudence to call her w  and that the least they could do was to break his arms or legs but she was mightily surpised when instead of being provoked as she expected they looked down then she asked them what they meand by it and forced them to speak as if it had been against their wills their answer which was much more provaking than any thing she had yet heard was that if she wanted only to have her coachman beaten she might go see for other executioners that they would not beat or thrash any body without a just cause and that they did not take speaking of the truth to be such she replied that it seemed they took her to be a w  as well as the coachman did and they answered very freely that they knew her to be such and were ready to witness it when she pleased this raised her passion to that degree that she called upon the rest of her servants to give her the succor that her footmen had refused the first that appeared was mistress cook who asked her what put her in such a passion the lady had no sooner told her the matter but she made answer that the coachman and footmen were not much to blame and that they charged her with nothing that was not true then came in the chambermaid who not being in the conspiracy with the rest said that twas not worth her while to make so many words and that she would go and call a commissary to put them all in prison but that word cost her very dear for as soon as they saw her making ready to go out they fell upon her and beat her one after another the lady fled to her chamber for fear they should give her as much and at last the chambermaid got clear and fled likewise to her chamber both of them bolted their doors and continued there waiting for the master of the house in order to complain of the usage they had received the coachman perceiving that his mistress was mewed up took the horses from the coach and curryd them and in a word did all that was to be done in order to make it appear upon his masters return that his mistress was in the wrong but both he and his accomplices had used another precaution that was yet better they had complained four days ago to the commissary of the ward that she would not pay them their wages and having at the same time given a summons in order to have her cast in court they only stayed in the house till the husband came and before his wife could speak with him gave him to know that they would stay no longer with her because they could not get a farthing out of her hands the husband would have kept them but they did not care to stay after they were all gone he was surpised with an account of the tricks they had played with his wife had he been wise he would have advised her not to speak of the matter to any body and would have taken the same advice to himself but as every man is not as wise as his affairs require so he was the fool to go himself and complain of his servants and thus was the first that divulged what he ought to have concealed but the complaint given in by the servants four days before made people believe that whatever he said was by way of recrimination upon which his friends advised him to drop the thing and make no more noise of it they had much ado to persuade him for his wife threw in all the fire she could to dissuade him but at last his own reason convinced him that that was his only way unless he had a mind to make himself to be pointed at as he walked along the streets  as this lady was branded for a coquette by her servants so i present you with a story of another that indeed had not that misfortune but was no less such in her husbands opinion mr tourville before he was made a marshal of france married the daughter of a farmer general who was the widow of the marquis of poplinicre the nephew of the late madam colbert twas a lucky hit for the marshal to marry that lady especially at the time when it happened for he was only a younger brother in normandy and that of a family that was in no great circumstances but fortune stood by him when every body thought he was lost we must know that after the marquis of seignelay his protector was dead he was writ to from court that then was the time or never to show his mettle for he had never given proof of it all the time that he was employed as a marine this reproach served for a spur that twitched him to the quick insomuch that when he received orders to fight the enemies fleet at any rate he did his duty and though he was unfortunate in the way of success yet he was thereupon preferred to that degree that if he had still been unmarried he could perhaps have desired no more of that woman but whether it was that he began to slight her or that he thought he might keep company with misses without giving her any dissatisfaction he had a sweet eye upon one of his neighbors that she was as jealous of as of another she told him her sentiments of the thing and not only took the pains to undeceive him but made a noise that was very troublesome to the lady that she deemed her for her rival i cannot be positive upon the truth of the matter but it is said that this jealous lady acquainted the womans husband with the marshals intimacy with her it is likewise reported that the husband surprised them in a posture that did not allow him to doubt of the information he had received whatever was in it the woman was put into a convent and the marshal either out of the chagrin occasioned by her confinement or through the discontent his lady had given him upon other occasions sent her out of paris to one of his own territories his plea was that she would not do something that he desired of her and the pretense was the more specious that it related to his interest but the lady bore her banishment from town the more impatiently that she was eternally galled with jealousy and returned to paris without giving him notice she lodged in his apartment designing to lie so close that he should know nothing of the matter till her own friends and her first husbands relations should have acquainted the king with the injustice done her the marshals servants seeing her come into his house gave notice of it to their master who without asking her the reason why she returned without his order complained of it to the king at the same time he desired his majesty to grant him a warrant to put her into some convent pretending by that means to enjoy all her estate but his majesty being informed of several things would not be so hasty and desired in the first place to know the occasion of their divorce the mareshal endeavored by all means to cover and perplex the story and turned it upon the score of interest but the king made answer that commissioners ought to be appointed to inspect which of them was in the wrong this was all that his lady desired and thus she continued at paris in spite of him and made it her business to thwart all his intrigues  in the mean time his misses sister came to be married and that being a favorable opportunity of reconciling her to her husband the poor recluses friends invited her to be present at the marriage he was a little restive upon the point however being uneasy in living alone and wanting only to be urged to it he pretended that in marrying her he had not received the same advantages as they gave to his sisterinlaw if they pleased they might have given him the same answer as the marshal feuillade gave one day to the brother of mr courchamp master of requests who is at present master of the kings household and colonel of a regiment of foot he had a mind to be an ensign in the guards and that marshal offering to sell him a commission at double the worth he represented to him that it was not worth so much upon which the marshal replied that he owned it was true but withal that he ought to know that that sort of posts were sold according to the merit of those that pretended to buy em that there was one price for a man of quality and another for such as he and in effect that neither his physiognomy nor his air would bring any honor to the regiment i do not insist upon the consideration of his birth for that regiment has been filled i do not know how long with men of the same degree and i think the marshal had no reason to inflame the price of the commission because he was only a tradesmans son but let that be as it will as i said before the recluses relation might have alleged the same reasons to her husband nay they had a better title so to do for it is natural to give with a girl in marriage in proportion to the circumstances of him that marries her in fine he stood out boldly notwithstanding that he had a mind to take his wife home again he was not present at the marriage which was accompanied with a sad scene for the brides mother that was well but four days before died the same day that the nuptial benediction was pronounced the bridegroom who did not marry any great beauty was not much troubled at that circumstance because he had no great prospect of pleasure in her company his brides face promising but little satisfaction he willingly abstained from the duties of a husband upon the plea of the loss of her mother but he could not handsomely put it off longer than the second night at which time he was obliged to break the ice and this comforted the new married lady upon the loss of the first night especially considering that she feared her deformity would have eternisd her affliction  another lady was married at the same time that would have taken it very ill if her husband had thus amused himself with crying and lamentation on the weddingnight twas madam girardin the widow of mr girardin who was first a lieutenant of a province and after that was sent ambassador to constantinople he had played his game to good purpose for upon the division of his estate his widow had above a hundred thousand crowns for her share besides a great quantity of movables that was worth half as much she had likewise a good marriage of it upon other scores which made her bear a good figure insomuch that many persons about court had her in their eye but she liked the marquis of canillac better than any other of her suitors though he had nothing but his sword to trust to this lady had two brethren one of them president to the parliament and the other master of requests and intendant of a province fearing they would oppose her marriage if she discovered her design she resolved to be married without giving them any notice for they were both lawyers and forasmuch as that sort of men are very sharp sighted where they have any interest she would not be obliged either to have recourse to the king to stifle their opposition or to secure herself at law thus was the matter concluded without their knowledge and it happened that on the wedding day the intendant having arrived at paris but twenty four hours before sent her word by his footman that he would come and dine with her the footman coming to the gate was surpised to find a porter and footmen with liveries different from his and being introduced by one of these footmen into my ladies chamber he found her a bed with a man however not knowing what the matter meand and not daring to ask any of her servants he only delivered his masters compliment the lady made answer that truly she had other things to mind than the giving his master a dinner and that she doubted if she could be stirring when he should come to dinner with the same breath she bid him give her brother to know that she only put off the complment to another time and that then she would acquaint him with the reason why she would not give him a meeting that day the air with which she spoke these words gave the footman to understand that she liked the trade she had lately taken up when he returned and gave his master an account of all he saw or heard the intendant went immediately to impart the good news to the president the president having known by experience what small stress ought to be laid on a womans prudence took the matter at first to be criminal he thought his sister had entertained a gallant and told his brother that he would ruin her and that they should think of expedients to prevent it the intendant having a better opinion of the women than his brother replied that he was too forward and that they ought not to condemn their sister upon such slight grounds and that he believed she was married because his footman said her servants had changed their livery the president who upon the hopes of having a share in her succession had shown his displeasure upon the apprehension of her entertaining a gallant was yet more disgusted when he heard of a husband and forasmuch as all his remaining comfort consisted in disanulling the marriage in case she had married a fortunehunter he sent one of his footmen to her gate to know what name she went by but when his footman returned and acquainted him that her name was canillac and that her husband was an officer in the second company of musketeers he then was sensible that he had nothing to hope for upon that score  about the same time mr bignon de blansi master of requests the nephew of mr pontchartrain was likewise married to madam hebert debuc the niece of madam pompone and the daughter of mr hebert debuc master of requests mr blansi was brother to the intendant of piccardy his first lady was mademoiselle brunet who died in childbed when she was but twenty two years of age and left him no issue some days after his second marriage mr pontchartrain procured him a commission for being a master of requests that might be worth two thousand livres a year he had another commission before that brought him no profit though after all those who have such sort of places continue still to desire them because they are not only posts of honor but make way for others that are more profitable mr pontchartrain who commonly has the disposal of that sort of things designed this post for mr harouis soninlaw to mr richebourg madam pontchartrains uncle who besides the honor of being her kinsman was thereby qualified not only for this but for a more considerable commission accordingly he ordered mr depinet one of his deputies that looks after such things to make ready an act and carry it to the chancellor but this magistrate having a grudge against pontchartrain instead of filling up the blank with mr harouis his name according to mr pontchartrains desire signfyd to him by his deputy asked him how long a controller general had offered to give laws to a chancellor and at the same time gave him to know that he understood his own business without being taught it and filled up the blank with the name of arnothon master of requests depinot returning to mr pontchartrain gave him an account of the chancellors compliment mr pontchartrain was unwilling to make any noise though perhaps he had reason enough only after that he did nothing relating to his office without speaking first to the king so that it was not in the chancellors power to thwart him  much about the same time there happened another marriage which i would be loath to insert here if it had not given occasion to one word that was taken notice of mr de la ferrier the son of that berrier whose memory is still odious to all the world though he has been a long time dead this man married his daughter to the son of des chiens whose birth and places bore a near resemblance to his father and all that he did for though he had the impudence to say that he was descended of a noble family yet all the country bears witness that his father and his ancestors derived their extraction from the scum of the people however mr de la ferriers lady being grandchild to the late mr novion first president his alliance with that family of which his lady descended by the motherside was so monstrous that all the world cried out that the blood of the novions was disgraced since whereas it was formerly mingled with that of luxemburg in the person of the late count de tremes father to the present duke de gevres it was now bestowed upon chiens dogs but the matter lay here these chiens were furnished with golden teeth and the father had got so considerably by the places he had in this war that the novions were nothing near so considerable as he this mr de la ferriere was not reckoned a beast either in council or in his own domestic affairs though there was a time when he passed for a bankrupt and upon that false report twas said that the king would take all his places from him for fear his poverty should tempt him to be unjust in the discharge of his offices but if we may credit what happened soon after the marriage of his daughter to whom he gave nothing all this pretended poverty was only a faint to impose upon the public for his brothers with whom he was at law for their portions presented a request to the judges setting forth that their father had left an estate of two millions of money which he was actually possessed of and that their eldest brother kep it up without doing them justice this petition made his creditors very uneasy they alleged that since his own brethren had thus informed against him the council before which they pleaded and which he endeavored to move to compassion by his pretended poverty ought not to have any regard to his allegations for depriving them of their right in former times cardinal mazarin made use of much such another argument to ruin mr fouquet for abbot fouquet his brother reviled him horridly and whenever anybody offered to plead for him the cardinal made answer that they did not know mr fouquet so well as his brother and that by consequence his testimony was preferable to theirs and in effect the abbot who was an odd sort of a man being at once the greatest braggadochio and the greatest coward in the world this abbot i say had a great hand in ruining the superintendant he presented memorials against him and it is well known what weight they were of when the question was put whether he should be arrested or not this abbot was such a vaunting fellow that he pretended he would take the prince and the marshal of hquincourt by the beard to make them repent of their taking up arms against the king but on the same very day that barbesieres came from lnders on purpose to carry off the father of mr girardin mentioned above who was a famous partisan somebody came and told the abbot that the prince had sent out a party to take him up having heard the stories he had spoke of him and thus put him in such a fear that he durst not venture to go out of paris without a strong guard  soon after all these marriages a sentence of banishment was granted against medemoiselle de varennes a lady of quality in the country of maine who was more known by the affection that great prelate had for her than by the reputation of her ancestors twas said that this affection was the effect of amorous embraces and that her friend before his death advised her to marry some person of quality that had nothing upon condition that he should own her children to be his he had made her so rich by his bounty that he thought she was in a condition to tempt every body it is true there were a great many poor wretches that would have been glad of such an adventure but twas not that sort of men that she had a mind to notwithstanding the scandalous terms she pretended still to have her choice and received visits from all the court in a house of hers that resembled an enchanted palace to carry on the wheedle the better she entertained them very handsomely and in lent regaled them with meat notwithstanding the kings orders to the contrary for his majesty to put a stop to all manner of libertinism had ordered that only those who were sickly or otherwise incommoded should have liberty to eat meat with the churchs permission and that they should not let any body share with them under the pain of incurring his displeasure but though madam varennes was far from that condition being in very good health yet she not only eat of it herself but invited all her visiters to eat with her the king got notice of this and sent her a letter under the great seal to be gone her friends promised her a grant of some time before she went into exile but instead of making preparations for her departure she promised a thousand pistols to count gramont for procuring a revocation of the sentence count gramont being a person that subsists only by the kings bounty and at such windfalls does not use to be asleep this count i say did not pretend to deny the thing to the king that being the wrong way to compass his design but represented to his majesty that the lady being set allalone at table where she fed upon mear pursuant to a permission she had from the curate some people came in and surpised her and in spite of her teeth sat down with her that this was no infraction upon the design of his majestys order and that all the world might be catched in the same trap as well as she without they kept their gates shut at mealtimes as in a convent in fine he pleaded her cause with such dexterity that the king granted his request upon a promise that the lady would be more cautious for the future then the marquis of vieuxburg began to declare himself a suir to the fair lady though he could not well do it without a breach of faith to mademoiselle de bulli a lady of quality near neuchatel in normandy to whom he had given a promise of marriage he was the son of the chancellors lady and having lost his eldest brother at the siege of namur carried on by the enemies succeeded to his estate which was not inconsiderable the good name he had in that province together with this succession and a little honor if he had had any ought to have deterred him from so scandalous an alliance but this lady having enchanted him he opened his mind to her and by the discovery of his design pleased her so well that she offered to give him all she had provided he married her in effect the business was kept private for some time and in the mean time the chancellors lady happening to die both of them were sensible that it was a favorable accident for them in regrd she would never have suffered her son to be guilty of that folly in her lifetime the chancellor who had been kept ignorant of his ladys illness for some days and hindered from going to her chamber under the pretense of some prejudice that might thereby accrue to either of their healths this magistrate i say gave his lady a magnificent funeral in the mean time he went and spent some days with the president fourci and after that returned to his own house and recommencd the exercise of his office which has this privilege beyond all others that those who are invested with it never wear mourning either for their relations or for the king himself monsieur and mr de chartres gave him a visit to solace him upon his loss the next day the popes nuncio came to his house and every body thought he had come upon the same errand but though the measures of civility required that compliment especially since he came to the chancellors own house yet he made him another that quickly discovered the chief reason of his coming however it was not disagreeable for after having assured him of the popes respect for him and his family he presented to him a brief from his holiness permitting the second son of madam harlai his daughter to possess all sorts of abbeys even those mortgaged to regulars though he was then but nine years of age the reason that moved the pope to this dispensation was set forth in the brief it imported that his holiness was infinitely glad to hear that mr harlai was gone from france upon a design of making a general peace and that his holiness thought himself obliged to testify this his joy by granting that favor to his son but after all the holy father had not taken up this desire of giving peace to christendom till the king was expelled italy by the savoytreaty under the pretense that italy would always be fettered so long as his majesty was possessed of any thing on that side thus popes kings and great folks talk as they will though at the same time they are glad to insinuate to others that they design nothing but what will redound to the advantage of those who are subject to them  count marsan the youngest brother of all the princes of the house of lorraine who married the marchioness of siegnelay after the duke of luxemburg broke off from her got at that time a pension of twenty thousand livers this was matter of surprisal to everybody not only by reason of the small service he had ever done to the state but because he had always a sorry interest at court for the purpose when he married the marchioness of albret widow to the marquis of albret marshal de camp who was killed when he went to see his mistress at that time the king turned that lady out of the queens retinue not that she had done any thing deserving that disgrace but only because she had married a man that the king did not like the reason of the kings dislike was grounded on his having some intrigue with a young prince that his majesty took care of and his being charged with cajoling and wheedling a young princess that he was equally concerned for but after all he found ways and means to atone for all that and upon that score was obliged to his lady who has friends of interest and credit at present he enjoys above fifty thousand crowns a year though before his first marriage he was not worth a groat and just now he has bought one of the finest houses in paris he had it from president tambonneau and that magistrate bore some hard words from the first president upon the account of some difficulties relating to the execution of the bargain that house had formerly a large garden to it part of which mr tombonneau cut off and joined it to another house of his and count marsan alleged that though that part was cut off by a particular clause calculated for that purpose yet at that time it ought to be undone because it returned naturally to the purchase to which it had always belonged they agreed to leave the matter to the arbitration of the first president but whether this magistrate was partial or thought it was justice to give it against tombanneau he delivered his mind in such harsh terms as insinuated that he had overreached count marsan twas some time before mr tambonneau would agree to his verdict but at last the matter was accommodated and at this day count marsan lives in that fine house mr pontchartrain had a mind for the house but being a man of a different stamp from some ministers who do not grudge to give any price for what they like he could not come up to mr tombanneaus price to be plain when a man throws away his money at such a rate it is a sign he comes easily by it whereas good husbandry speaks a fair purchase  the princess of harcourt whose husband is of the same family with count marsan but not ear so rich lost at that time a lawsuit with madam nemours which she thought she had been sure of twas laid before the council and related to the register of lions which she justly alleged to have been the property of her grandfather by the mothersside this her grandfather was the famous farmer of the revenue called garnier who though he was born to very little had got such a vast estate that he might have boasted of greater matters than sebastian zamer did in former times for whereas this man entitled himself a master of five hundred thousand crowns the other might have pretended to sixteen millions he was effectually possessed of eight millions clear of the best money in the world and the king owed him as much but soon after mr fouquet was caught the court of justice came upon him and there he was taxed in proportion to what he had got so that his whole fortune was melted in a moment by good luck he had married a whole regiment of daughters very handsomely and having paid their portions in ready money mr colbert who raked into the very branches of families could find no plea to suck out the blood that they endeavored to maintain their honor with the princess of harcourts mother who was married to count brancas gentleman of honor to the queens mother had thus escaped that ministers scrutiny because all her portion was money paid down however her daughter was of the same humor with her grandfather so that it was not long of her if she was not rich she lost the abovementioned suit only by one vote which she thought ought to have lest opposed her having always been very careful in making interest with the ministers she hoped that mr pontchartrain who was one of the judges would favor her but equity prevailing with honest men beyond all other considerations he was one of those that cast her though after all when he was asked wherein madam nemourss cause had the advantage of hers he replied that he could not well tell and that if he had thought the rest would have been of his mind he would have managed that cause like the oyster in boileaus satyrs in giving the two shells to the two princesses and the fleshy part to the king because the property contested by them belonged in effect only to his majesty the princess of harcourt who will never lose any thing for want of a vigorous defense does not yet give her cause over for lost and having sometimes been lucky in lawsuits she hopes to have the same good fortune in this but since her fortune has been out of her hands these twelve or fifteen years it is not probable that twill ever return to her she made a shift by the interest of one of her friends to persuade mademoiselle de guise to give her husband the dukedom of guise and guisehouse which were worth at least three millions the procuring of this favor had cost the prince of harcourt some compliments and addresses to his benefactress but his humor being not so pliable as his ladys he reassumd his character when he thought the business was done madam guise complained of this to the friend that had acted the part of a mediator and he being not able to persuade the prince to continue his visits she resumed her gift this thunderstruck his lady who upon this affair had displayed her utmost prouess however she is to be commended for managing so wisely the affairs of her family which her husband neglects he minds nothing but his diversion while she scrapes up money to pay a pension that she is obliged to give him upon the consideration of his having turned over all his estate to her but the times we live in being so unhappy that little can be made of a landestate she would find it very hard to do what she does if she did not find ways of getting of something from time to time she neglects no opportunity small or great it never scapes her provided she has any prospect of success  about that time the court was very hot upon the execution of a project that had been proposed by several persons a long time before i mean that of taking carthagena where the banks of several nations were lodged as well as part of the riches of perou in the beginning of the war a rochelman called petit was taken up who had gone to holland and there abjured his religion upon the persuasion of his wife and after her death had returned to france he was well versed in seaaffairs and having been employed by the dutch orders were given to take him dead or alive mr vilette a lieutenant general at sea was employed to execute the orders and indeed he once made up so close to him that he thought to have given a good account of him but petit being on board of a better sailer than any of the lieutenantgenerals ships he luckily got off tho some time after he delivered himself into the hands of the governor of vallenciennes who gave notice of the same to the court in regard he returned with a resolution to reassume his wonted religion and obedience and had spoke so to some people who had acquainted the ministers with it they could not handsomely indite him but contented themselves with securing his person in the bastille that being thought necessary for that after such an escape as his twas to be feared he might do the like again if ever he fell into the hands of such a woman as his first wife was his imprisonment was a great surprizal to him however having time enough in prison to think of his concerns he bethought himself that he would never be set at liberty unless he attoned for his crime by some great piece of service having considered again and again of the matter and being well acquainted with the coast where carthagena lies he lit upon the same thought as others had before him he was of opinion that twas not impossible for the king to make himself master of that place and even of  which is yet richer and as it were the magazine of all the riches of perou having hatchd this thought his next business was to give it vent for which end he asked to speak with mr besmaux governor of the bastille but whether the governor thought the man was troubled with maggoty fancies or whether he had no mind to be himself an instrument of losing his prisoners by whose maintenance he got a great deal and for that reason called them his pigeons whatever was in it he would not allow him paper to express his thoughts upon but only promised to speak of his project to a mininister of state though after all it is very likely he did not that for it is plain that if he had mr pontchartain who had the management of marine affairs was too good a servant of the kings to neglect such a proposal as that the prisoner receiving no answer notwithstanding the governors promise to bring him one cut off the margins of a book that he had and having made some ink of soot or charcoal wrote down his project together with several other things that then came into his head he had not well finished his scheme when marshal tourville came to the bastille to try some cannon of a new invention the cannon were fired into the ditch which the prisoner observing through the grates of the chamber threw out his paquet well wraped up it fell at the marshals feet who having time to read the superscription viz to marshal tourville upon affairs of great consequence relating to the sea this packet to be delivered to mr pontchartrain having read i say this superscription he refufed to deliver it to mr besmaux who asked it of him the governor endeavored to persuade him to it by setting forth that a minister whose time was so precious ought not to be disturbed with idle whims that probably there was nothing in the packet but such vapors as the damps of a prison are apt to excite and that for his part he was teased every day with such things but that he never minded them mr tourville looking up to the window where the packet fell asked him who was in that chamber mr besmaux made answer that twas a rochel renegado without telling his name but the marshal knowing that petit was prisoner in the castle and taking that to be his apartment told the governor that since the packet came from so good a place he was obliged to give it to mr pontchartrain accordingly he gave it to him and that minister having perused it found some things in it better explained than in the other memorials that had formerly been given in upon that subject then he let the matter sleep for a while in order to digest things more maturely and at last spoke of it in private to some seaofficers that he thought capable to resolve some doubts he had upon that head some of them represented it as impossible and others as a very dangerous enterprise only mr pointis spoke of it as an easy thing because he wanted to be employed in the expedition one must be prepossessed with an expectation of success in any enterprise in order to go through with it accordingly in several conferences between that minister and pointis the latter appeared still more and more forward and removed several difficulties that the other looked upon as very considerable so great an itch had pointis to signalize himself in that expedition but glory was not the only motive in his view he had another that weighed as much with him though it was not altogether so honorable he was in love with president ferrands daughter and neither of them having any estate in the ardour of his passion to enjoy her he thought no wall whatsoever would stand before him mr pontchartrain perceiving that he was the man he wanted and that he could never find another that would carry on the enterprise with so much heat upon this consideration i say he gave him a promise of being employed upon that design pointis recounted the affair to his mistress and among many other sweet words told her that she should have the triumph of that place that for his part all his ambition was to lay at her feet all the riches that the expedition should afford and that he accounted himself but too happy if by that means he could procure her favor while he was thus taken up in courtship mr ponchartrain went effectually about the business there being a necessity of an infinite sum of money to answer the charge that his majesty was at upon other accounts he had a mind that this expedition should cost the king nothing with this view by the kings permission he erected a company which advanced the money for carrying on the expedition upon condition of receiving the profits that should accrue by it some put in a thousand pistols some more some less the fleet was got ready and mr pointis put to sea when no body knew where he was going the english thought he had a design upon their possessions in carolina and gave the necessary orders to prevent it the dutch were apprehensive of a design upon them however mr pontis fell in upon carthagena all on a sudden when the spaniards least expected it and landed there some soldiers that he had brought with him at the same time the governor of st domingo being acquainted with the design brought some buckaneers to assist at the siege pointis stood much in need of them and without them he had never compassed his end but they were so dissatisfied upon the small share they had of the booty that they first complained to him and then threatened openly to send some body to court to demand justice of him he laughed both at their complaints and threats fancying that his success would procure him a hearing to their prejudice there was an immense quantity of riches in that city both in bars of silver golddust and precious stones and he did not neglect his own coffers no more than some captains of ships whose avarice was more notorious than his own for on board of one of them there was found effects to the value of eighty thousand crowns he having converted the money into goods which he was afterward obliged to convert into money again others were likewise convicted of having endeavored to enrich themselves upon the companys charges while it was only suspected but since malice and calumny is very forward especially upon such things for which every man is believed to have a good appetite twould not be just to be positive in the accusation in that city there was a young man who was the son of the governor of lima and by his folly had a mind to furnish those who vented romances with truths instead of their ordinary fables he was seized with a passion of love for the princess of conti the kings daughter upon seeing her picture which fell accidentally into his hands by an engagement with the buccaneers he found it in the arms of one that was killed and presently took it into his own as being a treasure that he esteemed more than the pearls and diamonds he had found among the spoil never were such follies committed as that young fool was guilty of after the sight of that picture every day he kissed it a thousand times and he never engaged without invoking it before hand as the only deity that could assist him  good fortune he had he imputed it all to it which enlarged his esteem of it more and more but at last being overpowered in an enggement with a king in the neighborhood of his fathers government the king as barbarous as he was loved the picture as passionately as he as soon as he cast his eyes upon it he asked what picture it was and would have snatched it from him upon that he threw himself at the kings feet conjuring him to take his life before he robbed him of his picture the conqueror seeing him in so humble a posture took pity of him and offered to let him keep his picture provided he gave him to know the original the young gentleman replied that he could not satisfy him upon that point because he did not know himself whose it was and with the same breath acquainted him how it came into his hands and offered to get it copied the prince was so much taken with the beauty of the picture that he caused several copies to be drawn from it these he ordered to be hung up in the temples of his false gods in order to adore the original which he thought could not be so pretty unless she were divine the young gentleman having thus saved his picture was afraid of losing it at carthagena when mr pointis took it fancying that all the world were as great fools as he and the prince that made an idol of it the first compliment he made to mr pointis was that by the right of conquest he was master of all that he had but as for that picture he would part with it and his life at the same time mr pointis was so much dazzld with the prospect of the riches that lay before him that he had forgot every thing and even madam ferrand and thus having other things in view than the picture he gave him to know that he might be easy and what pictures he had a mind for were those of the king of spain and other princes engraved upon gold and as for the pictures of women he would quit them for a trifle provided they were only valuable for their beauty or good painting this promise put the young gentleman in good heart and mr pointis having cloyed himself with the plunder of the town had the curiosity to look upon the thing that occasioned the spaniards sighs for he gave deep sighs every minute which made people believe that he was a very ponte lovr he showed mr pointis the picture upon his making oath that he would not fll in love with it as soon as mr pointis saw it he knew it to be the princess of contis and  he knew the lady and that his love was fixed upon a very deserving object the young gentleman pressing him to tell who the lady was he could not deny his request upon this discovery it had been very unhandsome in such a lover as this not to go to france accordngly he entreated mr pointis to let him have a place in one of his ships mr pointis having promised him that favor did not make him stay long  he set sail but though the seaair cld the gentlemans passion for his mistress the admiral round himself in a greater quandary than the gentleman an english squadron much stronger thn his own having notice that he was still  carthagena stood toward that place in order to dispossess him of the riches he had pllagd the governor of st domingo who had  to his government and was not wll pleased with the usage that he and the buceers h met with did nevertheless give him advice of their design because it concerned the kings nterest mr pointis made such good use of the intelligence that he weighed anchor and avoided the english and at last arrived at breast after having sapd several storms and other troublesome accidents  before his arrival at breast several accidents happened both at sea and land the most considerable occurrence at sea was mr nesmonds falling in with three english ships homeward bound from india they made a tolerable defense but being unequally matched i e three to six they were taken all the three were richly laden and mr nesmond having put mr montchevreuil with one been an irish man both of em sealien tenants on board of one of these ships these two plotted together to defraud the owners of the prize while nobody minded em accordingly they secured all they could and shared some diamonds and other valuable goods equally between em but mr montchevreuils indiscretion in spending at breast much more than his incomes could afford quickly discovered the intrigue his father allowed him nothing and all he had was a pension of one thousand livers and his equipage upon this intendant begnon smelling the matter gave notice of it to the court his interest at court might have prevented his arrest if mr begnons intelligence had not been put out of all doubt by his imprudence in setting out his very footmen with the best musins he had taken in that ship been indeed acted more prudently and it was not long of him that the thing took air but mr montchevreuils imprudence carried it so far that they were both taken up been who had not so much interest as the other could not get off notwithstanding the wisdom of his conduct begnon wrote him a thundering note concluding in these few words you are happy in having mr montchevreuil for a partner in your robbery assure your self that if you were by your self i would have casd you to be hanged in forty eight hours at the maries interceeded on his behalf because he was a good officer but forasmuch as the one could not be indicted without the other they were both cleared after five or six months imprisonment but after all if all the thieves had been hanged been had got more company than mr montchevreuil for at the sale of these prizes which amounted in gross to   00000 livres a great many things were transacted that were not very fair those who had a mind to em gave a large present to the persons that were empowered to adjudge em to prevent their being sold by retail pursuant to the desire of those who were interessd in the matter but whatever the present was they lost nothing by it for at nants they sold the goods by retail at three millions profit  in the mean time the archbishop of paris employed his utmost endeavors to make good the character the king had procured him by giving him that rich benefice though his brothers fortune might have done something for him yet he did not owe his preferment to that but only to his own merit while he was bishop of chalons a see that he had before his accession to that of paris he always acted up to the office of a holy prelate to continue the same course of piety that he had always followed he made head against vice and accordingly one of his first edicts after his accession to the last see was levelled against the masquerades an abuse that in earnest ought not to be suffered among christians what a strange preparation is the commission of a thousand lewd and foolish actions for the repentance that ought to be preached up in lent the emperor extirpated this disorder at vienna under the sole pretext of the war with the turks nobody was there allowed to disguise themselves and even schoolboys were not allowed to do it with impunity however the archbishop not using the same pretense to sink that disorder at paris but that of the love and gratitude we owe to god for shedding his blood for us upon the cross had not the same success as the emperor had at vienna if he had had recourse to the king for the putting his edict in execution perhaps the fear of displeasing that monarch would have gone farther than the fear of god but whether it was that he did not speak of it to the king or that the king had some reasons of state for not minding him there was as many masquerades that year as if there had never been an order against em the archbishop finding he could not compass his design bent his thoughts upon another disorder that wanted as much to be remedied i mean the debauchery of women that was got to such a height that no language can reach there was always two convents at paris for shutting up these wretches and two societies have been since erected for the same purpose by the care and charity of some virtuous ladies in these societies they are far from being used so severely as at the magdalonnettes and filles repent where the whips are o far from freeing a sol from vice that on the contrary they make em regret that they cannot continue their past course of life we must not pretend to translate a person all on a sudden from vice to virtue especially by correction for that ought to be effected by degrees and rather by persuasion than by force this gentle method was used in these two societies one of which is called st isidore and the other bon postur the latter had this peculiar custom that they forced none to come among em all the actions of that house were answerable to its title the girls that repented of their lewdness or were afraid of falling into it came thither of their own accord and were entertained there as long as they pleased and their governantes either procured em some place in a person of qualitys house if they were fit for service or got em husbands if they liked that better when they desired to be gone they were suffered to go though twas to be feared they might return to their vomit this society and this custom is still kept up and all pious persons of what condition soever not only visit these lost sheep that are thus returned to their flock but likewise eat with em very often this they take to be a more effectual method as indeed it is to reclaim them than that of letting dogs loose upon em and it is for this reason that the house is entitled bon pasteur the good shepherd for the good shepherd who properly speaking is the son of god did not scruple to eat with publicans  as for the daughters of st isidore they were not used so very gently as those of the bon pasteur but kept a sort of a medium between these and the magdalonnettes the archbishop whose province it is to take cognizance of all that passes in that sort of houses knowing that these lived under a director whose doctrine he suspected would have taken them from him but they stood by him with some warmth and the more they showed their zeal to keep him the more the archbishop pressed to put another in his place at last they told him freely that if he put in another they would not receive him and that they would rather disperse than comply with it now they had liberty to disperse for they were not settled there either by the kings letter or an order from the court of justice accordingly perceiving that the archbishop was immovable and fully resolved to subject them to his obedience they actually dispersed for which the archbishop was blamed by a great many especially by those who were not acquainted with the reason that had obliged him to do as he did  at that time mr verthamont de villemont dyed who was the only man that perhaps made the king depart from his wonted moderation he was master of requests and making use of the authority he had among the gownmen both by his place and by the numerousness of his relations and friends did what he could to ruin a gentleman of the name of servon that had been his neighbor in the country servon being related to mr perefixe archbishop of paris had recourse to him who engaged to protect him after he found that magistrate so proud of his interest that he openly contemned both his friend and him verthamont finding that the archbishop had declared against him and that he had embarked in that cause for the sake of some interest of his own formed a design against his life and alleged that he had a love intgue upon that side on the other hand the archbishop formed a design against his life thus th raised between em the greatest suit that had en seen for a long time and the cause being ought before the council the king himself ad at the decision which mr villemont who knew his integrity and justice was not pleased with the archbishop being sensible that his honor was very much touched by the accusation preferred against him by that magistrate and that twas not enough for him to maintain that it was an imposture as it was but to prove it to be such upon this view i say he desired him to condescend to the circumstances of the fact in order to his conviction accordingly verthamont advanced that on such a day at such an hour in such a year and at such a place he had an interview with a certain lady whom it was well known he had formerly visited with some sort of familiarity now mr perefixe was at that time at rhodes of which he was bishop before his accession to the sea of paris and for fear verthamont should retract and throw his mistake upon the weakness of his memory he pretended at first to make but weak defenses in order to make the other maintain his forgery with more impudence this verthamont did not fail to do for fancying that the whole court was on his side the answers being so frivolous he insisted on the charge because the archbishop had summoned him to declare whether he adhered to his accusation or not he likewise condescended to a great many particulars of matter of fact which seemed probable the archbishop finding him engaged so far that he could not afterward retract desired to be allowed to prove himself alibi this was the best method he could take o justify his innocence and retort the calumny upon his adversary the court could not refuse to hear his proof so he proved not only by witnesses but likewise by an order he made as bishop that day which was published throughout his diocese he proved i say that he was above one hundred and fifty leagues off from the place of the alleged interview verthamont was strangely surprised when he saw himself thus convicted however as all litigious men have some back door or other he alleged that indeed he was out as to the year but as to the fact it self and the day he was certainly in the right but after what was past that reason would not bear so that he was not only ordered to make reparation of the prelats honor but he and his posterity were declared incapable for ever of enjoying any magistracy the sentence contained likewise other punishments against him which twere too tedious to insert here however fancying the king would be so good as to dispense with part of em he had the boldness to appear at the kings levee some days after the king was incensed when he saw him and commanded him in harh words to depart his chamber verthamont obeyed without staying for a second order and was even obliged to retire to the country for the king would not allow him so much as to continue at paris  the plenipotentiaries continued still at reswick and it being uncertain whether the peace would be concluded or not new edicts were issued forth one of em obliged the great cities and towns of the provinces to take lanthorns like those at paris and to buy themselves off by a tax to be laid upon the twentieth penny by that edict the king promised in consideration of that tax to be at the charge of the lights for ever in fine twas visible that this was only a new invention for raising of money which was much wanted at that time mr caumartin intendant to the finances was ordered to carry the edict to the first president in order to have it conveyed to the attorney general who read it with the coldest humor of any man in the world mr caumartin expected that when he had read it he would give him his sentiments of the matter which he meant to communicate to the minister of state but the magistrate continuing silent for some time he turned the edict over and put it several times into the hands of the magistrate who still returned it at last being tired with shuffling it to and again he broke silence and said it was a fine edict and that he and his friends ought to be convinced that it was such at least said he for my particular satisfaction i expected you would have done me the honor to tell me in whose head all these lanthorns were first projected upon this expression mr caumartin could not refrain from laughing and imparted the occasion of laughter to his friends after all the case was laid before the parliament and no one had the same curiosity as this magistrate had  the conferences at reswick did not divert the king from sending puissant armies into the field by virtue of the peace of savoy he was superior in force to his enemies and part of his troops that had served in italy he had transported to catalonia in this province he was still master of the cities of roses and gironne with some other places of importance and had a free access to barlona which is the metrapolitan of that country and in a manner the barrier of the spanish monarchy this city which is rich great well peopled and the ordinary residence of the nobility of that country is situated on the mediterranean and has a very considerable port upon that side the opposition that the house of austria had hitherto made to the peace moved the king to besiege it he thought that if he could take it he could at least bring the spanish branch to reasonable terms considering that after that even madrid itself was not secure his majesty wrote his thoughts of this matter to mr vendome who commanded the troops in that country this general sent him word that the troops he had there were not sufficient for so great an enterprise and that it could not be compassed with less than fifty thousand men now at that time he had sarce wenty five thousand but his majesty having ten thousand more ready upon a call commnded him to make preparations for the design and promised to send em to him when he wanted em after such positive orders mr vendome had nothing else to do but to concert all measures for satisfying the king the spaniards having already taken the alam at the loss of their other places in that province and perceiving that the king meant to possess himself of that place sent their best troops thither the queen of spain being the empresess sister desired the emperor to send some regiments under the pretense of preserving that province but that was not her main design she had a greater eye upon the interest of archduke charles her nephew for her husband having no issue and being not very healthy she had a mind to secure to him the crown that philip iv had bequeathed him by his will pursuant to this design she had brought some germans into the council in order to stifle the artifices that france and even some spanish grandees might set on foot either for the interest of that crown or for their own for there were some of em that laid claim to the blood of the ancient kings of cstile and others to that of the kings of arragon these german counselors acted in concert with her and the emperor sent em instructions to the end that nothing might be concerted contrary to his interest or that of the archduke his son in the mean time his imperial majesty sent the troops that were desired and it being much his interest not to lose barcelona he entreated the english and dutch to send a fleet into the mediterranean he was very sensible what was likely to happen because the king made new preparations in provence and seemed to have nothing so much in view as the conquest of that place however his entreaty did not come so very seasonably whether it was that the english and dutch had occasion to employ their ships elsewhere or which is very probable that they thought the taking of that place would so humble the house of austria that they would not oppose the peace any longer for they did not much trouble their heads upon the matter  while preparations for war were made not only in that country but in all the other seats of war a new war broke out in the church which might have caused great disorders if it had not been quickly stifled indeed it might have been sooner stifled if the archbishop of paris and the bishop of meaux had not been very complaisant to a certain gentleman that i shall call by his name by and by by which means it took deeper root than it might have done to understand this matter thoroughly twill not be improper to carry our account of things a little higher in the popedom of innocent xi a priest called molinos started up at rome who taught very uncommon doctrines and did not want followers among many erroneous doctrines this was the greatest that when the soul came once to a certain point of sanctity it was not capable of sinning and then it had no part or concern in the actions of the body it is a standing maxim that we ought not to censure a mans intentions especially when his morals are unculpable as to outward appearance and for that reason i shall be very cautious of saying that this new sectary under the pretense of so great purity concealed a great many disorders that his enemies have falsely charged upon him perhaps he meant that the soul cannot control some infirmities that we are subject to from our mothers womb and provided these are detested by her she is not accountable for em before god were it so nothing could be objected against his doctrine for such is the doctrine of the church and what st paul teaches us who was continually tempted notwithstanding his being one of the greatest saints in paradise however since a great many uncouth consequences might be drawn from his way of explaining himself both upon this article and many others the whole church rose up against him rome in whose view the thing happened arrested him and his case being brought before the inquisition he was there condemned by such commissioners as were appointed he submitted himself to their censure and some years after died in prison upon which twas generally thought that this new heresy known by the name of quietism was so far from passing the alps that it died outright with him but the case was quite otherwise for not only italy was stuffed with his errors but even france itself was tainted with them one madam guya the widow of mr montargis who after the gtting of a great estate upon the canal of briae left her with two children this lady i say minded nothing less than the true education of her children not that she wanted either wit or judgment nay on the contrary she had a greater share of both than what is natural to woen or what herself ought to have desired for she meddled with what did not become her and shoving her noe into books pretended to explain not only the fathers but even the scripture it self in fine having heard of molinos and his herefie she could not be easy till she had  copy of his books and canvassd em all over malicious people will tell you that she approved of em to cover some enormities that were charged upon her in the mean time she fell in with a barnabite a savyard by nation who resided in a convent belonging to that order at montargis she made him her confessor in ordinary and her confident and having poured her venom into his bosom compiled a great many books either with his help or without it so as to make the same figure in france that molinos had done at rome mean while she ought to have been apprehensive of his ate for though the inquisition has not the same ooting in all countries yet she was not ignorant that the venting of a new doctrine was a disallowable action she dispersed her books among the convents and several other places and the abbot of fenelon the gentleman whose name i promised not to forget finding them of a piece with his sentiments approved em secretly this he durst not do publicly by reason that he was made subpraeceptor to the children of the royal family and that the discovery of this his approbation would not only cut off his arrival at a bishopric but dispossess him of the post he was then in however madam guyons writings being published began to make a noise in the world and in regard that the advances contained in em encouraged all the periods of a dissolute life or at least made way for very odd consequences upon this consideration i say the bishop of meaux as well as the bishop of paris who was then only bishop of chalons undertook to make her sensible of her error they had conferences upon this head with the abbot of fenelon whom they deemed to be tainted with the same doctrine he on the other hand justified her assertions and maintained that her thoughts were just and orthodox though the meaning and explication that they forced upon her was heretical he likewise spoke up for her morals and the conduct of her life which he pretended to be particularly acquainted with though both the one and the other were much suspected  the warmth he showed in justifying her confirmed the two prelates in the thought that the doctrine he vindicated was as much his own as hers they told him as much and he on the other hand did not deny it but had the submission to assure em that he would willingly change his mind if he were convinced of the error to this purpose an assembly was held at issi but before they met madam guyon had given in to the bishop of meaux a copy of all her writings in order to be examined at his leisure the bishop examined it with all possible care and likewise was at the pains of inspecting the conduct of her life for some time by which means he discovered that she inflamed the evil by pretending to authorize her doctrine by miracles and a gift of prophecy bestowed upon her by god she recounted stories to this effect pretending to confirm em by credible witnesses and in a word never did woman or man carry fanaticism so far as she did in fine there was cause enough for putting her up in bedlam if it had not been for those who supported her all the abbot of fenelons friends were hers the duke of beauvillers governor to the princes of the royal family was suspected to be an abettor of her errors as well as the duke of chevreuse and their whole families the thing that confirmed the general suspicion of the duke de beauvillers beyond the rest was the putting his eight daughters into a convent at montargis twas concluded from thence that montargis being the place where this heresy was first hatched in france that convent being a convent of benedictines was likewise tainted the whole family of charost was suspected in like manner of falling in with this heresy but that which restrained scrupulous and nice consciences from condemning it at a time when they were very sensible of its pernicious consequences was that neither the court nor france itself could boast of persons of such christian lives and regular morals as all the favorers of the new doctrine were of their piety was not of so late a date as the heresy of moins that madam guyon revived from their first appearance at court they were all eminent for virtue and twas in consideration of that that the king chose to put the children of france under the government of the duke of beauvillers he had been thirty years a courtier and during that space of time had never counter acted the measures of virtue which shined in all his actions and in a word no man could be in greater esteem at court than himself so that when the public saw him charged with the abetting of this new doctrine they looked upon the charge as invidious as well as zealous they put this construction upon the matter that the post he was in created him private enemies who wanted to succeed him and stood at nothing to compass their end  whatever was in it the abbot of fenelon who always showed a disposition to obey what decision should be made at issi joined with madam gyon in singling out a third person who would cast the balance upon the side he declared for if the two bishops who were to meet should be of a contrary sentiment the bishop of meaux pretends in a book he has lately published that all this was carried on without the kings knowing any thing of the matter this i am willing to believe because he said it and i likewise believe that the reason in his view was to prevent the kings having an ill opinion of the abbot of fenelon his majesty being an enemy to all new opinions not only out of piety but out of policy since nothing is more apt to disturb the repose of a state than innovations in religious matters the third person i mentioned but now was mr tronson doctor of the sorbonne superior of the seminary of s sulpitius a man of sound principles and one whose life and conversation were blameless before the assemblies met the abbot of fenelon had time to compile a vindication of madam guyons books but notwithstanding all his precaution they were condemned with one general voice madam guyon had promised to submit to the judgment of these three doctors as well as the abbot of fenelon and both of em seeming to submit these judges thought the matter was laid asleep tho at the same time the fire was only smootherd under the ashes the abbot of fenelon had a mind to be a bishop before he kindled it again and in effect he was no sooner installed archbishop of cambray but he returned to his vomit notwithstanding that he had invited the two prelates that contemned his doctrine to assist at the ceremony of his consecration however he went on with a great deal of precaution pretending that the sentence pronounced against him was only owing to a misunderstanding of the true sense of the books under examination he gave high encomiums of the virtue of that lady which at that time began to be more warmly attacked than before for twas alleged she had only revived molinoss doctrine for a cloak to the disorderly things she was charged with madam guyon for her part was so far from a true submission to the censure of those judges that she began again to write a vindication of her doctrine the archbishop of cambray who pretended all along to keep in with the two prelates that had condemned him as if the allegations he had made on the behalf of the lady and her principles were such as they would have joined with if they had been fully acquainted with her person and doctrines this prelate i say made a counterfeit censure of the liberty that the lady took in setting pen to paper again at last the king was informed of the matter but so that nothing was said against the bishop of cambray either because they had a mind to try if they could gain him otherwise or because they feared his plot was so well contrived that he would come off clear notwithstanding all the testimony they could bring against him madam guyon was imprisoned at vincennes by the kings order as the mind of man is always curious and fond of novelties so her books were sought for every where insomuch that there was not half enough for those that wanted em this lady had a daughter that was married to the count de vaux the eldest son of the late mr fouquet superintendant of the finances he was brother to the duchess of charost and being troubled at the imprisonment of his motherinlaw as indeed he ought to have been he left no stone unturned to procure her release the abbot of fenelon did the same thing under hand twas represented to the king that she herself would condemn her own advances if she thought they imported what was alleged against her and that she was so far from meaning any such thing that she thought herself obliged to take up her pen again to undeceive the world but since his majesty was displeased with her writing she would take care not to transgress his orders for the future in fine her resolution to submit to the doctrine of the church was so dexterously represented to the king that he condescended to set her at liberty upon condition that she should retire to a convent just by paris where her conduct might be more narrowly inspected thither she went and behaved herself for some time so well that twas really believed she was weaned from her errors in the mean time this thing having made a great noise the bishop of meaux resolved to publish a book to undeceive those that might favor the new doctrine he communicated his design not only to the bishop of chalons who was then made archbishop of paris but likewise to the bishop of cambray he gave the latter to know that he hoped he would affix his approbation to the book which he desired both out of respect to him and for enforcing and recommending it to the world he represented farther that there was a general report that he had favored that lady and that by this means he would show to the world that though he once thought well of her yet he did not subscribe to her errors the bishoy of meaux alleges that he promised his approbation and that after this interview they parted good friends this he avers openly in a book of his that is but just published however the archbishop of cambray went some days after to visit the archbishop of paris and acquainted him that he had a mind to write upon that subject himself but would not put his book to the press before he knew his sentiments of it the archbishop of paris endeavored to dissuade him from pursuing his design and remonstrated to him that the least partiality to that ladys tenets would infallibly ruin him the other replied that he might easily imagine he had no mind to print any ill thing since he offered to show it first to him but this answer did not please the archbishop of paris he continued his utmost endeavor to take him off from his resolution but at last finding he could not prevail he desired that at least he should not print his book till the bishop of meaux had published his the archbishop of cambray promised not to do it and the archbishop of paris thinking he would keep his word acquainted the bishop of meaux with what he had said in the mean time he expected a sight of the manuscript and indeed the bishop of cambary sent it to him but it was writ in such an abstracted manner that the first time he read it he could understand little or nothing of it in that manuscript he set forth that if the doctrine of the quietists consisted in the belief of such and such things he was ready to condemn it but if it maintained such and such things he was ready to vindicate it thus was his book divided into several chapters some containing a description of the quietism that all doctors ought to reject and others of the quietism that as he alleged all the world ought to approve of the archbishop of paris who had not much time to peruse it being much taken up in the exercise of his episcopal office thought he might keep the manuscript as long as he would especially considering that the archbishop of cambray had promised not to put it to the press till the bishop of meauxs book was published but he would needs have it again and the archbishop of paris gave it him after he had shown him two or three chapters that he thought proper to be licked over again but after all this book was published before the bishop of meauxs and the author having thus broke his word to the archbishop of paris fell out both with him and the other prelate the bishop of chartres joined with them in representing to the king the pernicious consequences that would ensue upon the toleration of that new doctrine his majesty having spoke of it to the archbishop of cambray that prelate pretended to maintain that he had said nothing in his book but what was conformable to the tradition of the church and that he was willing to refer the matter to rome and submit to their decision the king not being qualified to judge of these things himself was obliged to strike sail to such a plausible submission but the other three prelates being still at his ear remonstrated to him that twas not proper for the royal offspring to be under the conduct of a man that was so notoriously suspected of heresy this gave his majesty such an alarm that he ordered the archbishop of cambray to retire to his archbishopric in the mean time the cause was transferred to rome as being the only tribunal capable to determine a question of that nature each of the parties endeavored to make friends in that place mr bossuet sent his nephew thither who by the interest he had beyond others might be capable to put his orders in execution the archbishop of cambray sent likewise a person that he confided in though his greatest hopes depended upon cardinal bouillon who was his particular friend he ordered him to prolong the affair as much as possible that he might have time to set things in a clear light and to give his holiness to understand that the opposition he met with proceeded more from a party concern than from a religious zeal in the mean while madam guyons principles were found in the royal abbey of st lewis at st cir and a discovery was made that some nuns were so influenced by em that they were downright quietists madam maintenon was mightily troubled at this she being the person to whom the nobility of france owes the erecting of that religious house in which they have the opportunity of being rid of their daughters for a time and sometimes for ever and what troubled her yet more a nun that was her particular favorite was one of the poisoned number however the king transplanted em to other convents to prevent their infecting of the rest this sect which had been extinct at rome from the condemnation of molinos began to revive there when the abettors understood that it still had footing beyond the alps and even that an archbishop had openly declared himself a protector of it such was the conformity of their sentiments with his that they cried up whatever he advanced and though they did not know him and indeed had scarce ever heard of him yet the whole city was presently filled with several writings in which they not only applauded his doctrine but made an infinite number of panegyricks upon his person as if they had been intimately acquainted with him the archbishop of cambray being acquainted with all that passed at rome by an express he had sent thither did not nevertheless confide so much in them as to abstain from writing himself for he sent em several papers by way of letters in which he explained the objections made against his book in order to rectify the consequences that might be drawn from thence in the mean time nothing was said to madam guyon nor to the archbishops friends that were about the children of france among these was the abbot of beaumont his nephew to whom he had procured the place of being subpraeceptor to the young princes and who had always acted up to the duty of his post in regard it is natural for a nephew to adhere to his uncle and that the obligation he had received from his uncle suggested a presumption that he would not easily depart from his interest the king was solicited to disgrace him twas represented to his majesty that the young princes were not safe under his conduct no more than under his uncles and that though he had not publicly taken up with his errors yet twas to be feared he might suck in their contagion the king thought it an unjust thing upon a simple suspicion to turn a man out of his post that could not be convicted of any crime he was resolved to see farther into the matter before he would condescend to any such thing thus was he continued in his place and his enemies were forced to wait for a more favorable opportunity to ruin him  while the bishops were thus making war one with another two ecclesiastic orders were reconciled that had not always lived in a good understanding i mean the jesuits and the priests of the oratory who upon several occasions have demonstrated to the world that they are not always of the same opinion the doctor of st martha a person of great merit distinguishing piety and profound learning was turned out from being general of the priests of the oratory by the intrigues of the jesuits supported by the late  de chanvallon archbishop of paris to pry into what was done in that society the jesuits as well as the archbishop had got a false brother there who gave em notice of every thing so that nobody could imagine how the discovery came for he was so disguised that he was taken for the greatest zealot of all the brethren an archbishopric was promised him in recompense for his service and the good fathers were as good as their word in due time that is when they found another of their society that promised to perform what he did the conferring of a bishopric upon this traitor raised a suspicion in that society but since it might be attributed to something else than the true cause that was not enough for a true conviction at that time the traitor of st martha was not yet deposed he continuing his steady course quickly observed that there were traitors among them though he did not determine whether the bishop or another however that bishop being removed from thence the simpler sort of people looked upon that as a vindication of him though the more sensible part of mankind did not excuse him the more for that they fancied what was true that he had given his place to another who would be equally zealous upon the prospect of the like recompense they were in the right of it for they did nothing but what the archbishop and the jesuits knew however they did not trouble themselves being sensible that they did nothing but what was to be done in the mean time the doctor of st martha had occasion to have some business with the archbishop and one day when he had his audience that prelate put him into his closet till he had finished a conference with a person upon a business of consequence as soon as the doctor entered the closet he spied upon the table among other papers one that he knew to be the hand of one of his priests and having the curiosity to know what it was found it to be an account he gave the archbishop of a thing that had been privately concerted among them this paper he put in his pocket thinking the archbishop would not perceive that twas he that took it and carried it home after finishing the affair he came upon immediately upon his return he consulted with those of his society that he knew would be faithful in keeping the secret whether or not he should show this paper to him that wrote it some were against the showing of it because that would give the archbishop to know that twas he that took it but others thought this no inconveniency nay on the conary they thought they were obliged to show that they knew both the traitor and the treachery the father joined with the last and accordingly took aside the writer of the paper that was then in his pocket and checked him for what he had done the writer offered to deny the fact fancying that he spoke only by suspicion then the father of st martha advised him in a christian manner not to add a lie to his former fault and withal acquainted him that he knew all the particulars for which reason twas in vain for him to offer to disguise any thing the treacherous brother was of the same humor with those who when once they have advanced a thing could rather see it cut in pieces than lop any thing of it for in pursuance of their temper he insisted still upon the negative but the general not being able longer to bear his impudent lying produced the writing out of his pocket and proved the charge against him by his own hand writing the traitor was mightily surpised at the appearance of the paper having then nothing more to say all his reserve was to cry out upon the archbishop for ruining him entirely by giving his paper to the general the archbishop made oath that it did not come that way and well he might since it was discovered as above however the archbishop smelling from thence that the father had snatched up that paper when he was in the closet advised the false brother not to be concerned for that he would procure the royal protection for him in case his society offered to affront him in effect the society of which he was a member designed to expel him but the archbishop prohibited them in the kings name to think of it so that he continued among these priests and does to this day in the mean time the archbishop could not forget the trick that the father of st martha had played him that joined with other things gave the archbishop an opportunity of representing him to the king as a jansenist and employing the royal authority to depose him father de la tour the present general of that order was elected in his room and deserved that post upon several accounts especially by reason of his singular piety and distinguishing zeal the jesuits opposed his election under hand alleging that he was as much a jansenist as the father of st martha several things were offered toward his justification but that very thing that was designed for his further ruin prevented his exclusion he was confessor to one madam de fond pertuis that was a zealous devotee to mr arnaud insomuch that she went to flanders several times during the last war this new general having advice of this prohibited her to return to flanders again unless she chose another confessor but she did not stand to go thither once more in spite of his order to the contrary however he did not offer to enquire further into her conduct but the thing being heard of at court the king saw plainly that he was not so much a jansenist as he was represented to be in regard he censured that ladys adhering to one that was reckoned the head of that sect thus was his exclusion prevented and the jesuits finding what a good opinion the king had of him invited him to pch a a solemn festival in the church of st louis he returned their complement by desiring them to single out one of their society to preach before the priests of the oratory upon the day of another solemn festival thus was the reconciliation brought about that i spoke of but now but after all i doubt if the jesuits were cordial in the matter for this general had for some time endeavored to stifle their practice a great many ladies of quality that used to confess to father bourdaloux or some of their society desired that he might be their director among others the duchess of aumont deserted them and put in with him and this being a practice that seldom passes with impunity among directors would have eternized the quarrel between the two companies if the jesuits who have fully as much policy as learning had not thought it proper to take no farther notice of it at this day father de la tour preaches in their church but as he is not equal to many of em either in gracefulness or eloquence so they did not stand to give him the precedence as to the direction of consciences because he for his part was obliged to stoop to them in the way of preaching madam harlai the plenipotentiarys lady had become one of his penitents ever after she had the happiness to be convinced that it was impossible to work her salvation in this world if she lived as most women now a days do but being as fond of gaming as ever her husband could be particularly of lansquenet which is as bewitching as bassette insomuch that when women are once seized with a passion for it they will rather sell their smock than abstain from it this lady i say being such a passionate lover of that game that twas to be feared she might relapse into her old vomit by frequenting public company every day this director gave her four of his other penitents to have an eye upon her these spies relieved one another under the pretense of keeping her company and she was the less sensible of the design because they were all four much of her age and condition one indeed was of a higher birth than she as being the widow of a son of the blueribbon one of whose ancestors had been a marshal of france for notwithstanding that the lawyers have a great value for their character especially when their magistracy gives as great a distinction as the family of harlai is possessed of yet it is certain that there is a great deal of difference between the gown and the sword when the latter is attended with distinguishing circumstances this lady had been the marchioness of st valeri as for her own family she was a bullion that is to say the daughter of the marquis of mon lovet a marquis indeed of a late standing but of a golden nobility for he was the son of mr de bullion superintendant of the finances who left three children among which the descendants of the eldest were only capable to keep his riches as for the other two their posterity has no resemblance of the superintendant that was once in their family they are as poor as devils and the third of these children commenced his misery in their life time by making an unlucky marriage he fell in love with his mothers woman and married her upon whch his mother disinherited him after he had quenched his passion with enjoyment he quickly became sensible of his fault but twas then too late to think of a remedy however being very much troubled for the loss of such a fine succession he left lions where he was wont to live and came to paris having first instructed his wife in what she was to do toward the backing of his design the orders he gave her were to go into the country and spread a report in the city that she was at the point of death now it being customary in all places to enlarge reports as they spread the whole city of lions was presently filled with the noise not only of the ladys sham illness but even of her death her husband who had been hitherto frustrated in all his attempts toward the regaining of his mothers favor knowing how cases stood at lions went into deep mourning and so repaired to st eustache where his mother commonly went he cast himself as twere accidentally in her way and she seeing him in such a garb had the curiosity to inform herself under hand of the reason of it for she would not speak to him herself her followers being persuaded that his wife was dead told her what they heard of the matter upon which she gave her sons relations and friends to know that forasmuch as the occasion of the difference between her and him was gone she would not keep anger longer she invited him to come and see her and the deed by which he was disinherited being tore he found ways and means to retain her friendship insomuch that she not only pardoned his marriage but likewise his abusing of her credulity in making her believe that his wife was dead  madam harlais three other keepers were the attorney generals lady madam harouis and madam chateaurenard this last was the handsomest of all the four but had not been always so devout as they for she was mightily taken up in the way of the world but the disgrace of her husbands family with some other melancholy circumstances that are not uncommon in the way of life obliged her to pursue a course that might screen her from all disquiet so that she became so very pious that her piety was a pattern for those who had grown old in the pursuit of it before ever she thought of such a course of life her husband was the son of the late mr dacquin the kings first physician who not being satisfied with the estate he had occasioned his own banishment from the court by importuning the king with unseasonable requests nay he was so bold as to represent to his majesty that his services were at least equal to any that could be done of what nature soever and in effect that since his life was to him the most precious and dear thing in the world twas an obvious consideration that the person who preserved it by his prescriptions was not be despised before he ventured upon such discourses that is while he observed the measures of respect due to his majesty both he and his family had a thousand liberal gifts conferred upon em his majesty had made his eldest son secretary of his own closet and an honorary counselor of the parliament a favor that is not promiscuously granted and besides all this he was intendant of the generality of moulins when this honor was conferred upon him he was scarce twenty five years old but immediately upon his fathers beginning to talk so high he was included in his fathers disgrace and recalled the name of chateaurenard which he bore was the title of an estate he bought from mr amat the son of a famous farmer of the revenues this amat who scarce understood his interest so well as his father discovered upon his first imbarking in the world that gaming was his only delight and upon that score several sharpers courted him in hopes to have part of the riches left him by his father among others an ensign of the lifeguard had pretty good success for he won of him a large sum in ready money and another upon tick but that sort of commerce being the kings aversion and the ensign being better versed in shuffling the cards than in unsheathing his sword for the kings service upon these considerations he was broke when his majesty purged the companies of their scandalous members the abovementioned estate belonged formerly to a very good family of that name it had once a castle upon it that served to overawe the burgundians when they were under the dukes of burgundy who were the greatest enemies that ever the kings of france had notwithstanding that they had the honor to spring from their blood the heir of that family having done something in opposition to the kings interest his estate was forfeited and reunited to the royal demesnes the family of chatillon coligni whose possessions were adjacent to that estate bought it of the king as lying conveniently for them and kept it a great many years till william prince of orange married louise de coligni the daughter of admiral de coligni who bears so great a figure in our history by which means it passed into the house of nassau and there continued till the princes of orange the present king of englands mother sold it as her sons guardian to mr amat farmer of the revenues at this day the arms of the princes of orange are placed in the most eminent part of the city if it be allowable to call a place a city that is only a hole and that one of the most wretched holes in the universe but let it be as it will the inhabitants of that hole or town call it which you will thinking to ingratiate themselves at court in the beginning of the last war by setting forth their hatred of king william entreated the marquis of louvois by a letter to allow em to take down these arms but such a request deserving no answer that minister gave em none and thus were the arms preserved from their mistaken zeal so that they stand to this day where they were placed an age ago  at that time the bishop of dax died and his death robbed the public of his history of the king which he was carrying on upon the precedent of mr perefixes history of henry iv he thought it became a bishop to undertake that sort of performance but after all if he had employed his time in finishing the history of the church begun by mr godeau that province as i take it had been more suitable to his character however he searched every corner for the finding of memoirs to answer his design and not long before his death i saw him come to one of my friends that had belonged to cardinal mazarin to know of him whether the late king of england was present at the negotiation of peace carried on by that minister with don louis de haro in      upon his departure my friend acquainted me with the occasion of his visit which was to me a mighty surprisal for that all the world knows that that prince would have been there but that his eminence would not allow of it the reason he went upon was that he feared the disobliging of richard the son of cromwell who had been declared protector of england after his fathers death so that that prince who had advanced within six leagues of the place where the conferences were held was obliged to return my lord bath whom he had sent to know if his presence would be acceptable received this answer that twas not proper for him to appear there and that the abovementioned minister would still take the same care of his interest but had the prince been so simple as to trust him and take no other measures he had been in a fair way of never mounting his throne the bishop i mentioned but now had resigned his bishopric a great while ago perhaps in order to have the more leisure to pursue his history it is probable he thought to outdo racine or boileau but i question if he should have succeeded if his talent lay that way i must say that it was a hidden one for he was never found to be capable of doing much  had the marquis of rouville who was eighty years old died as he did he had not sustained so great a loss because he had not any history upon the stocks but instead of dying the old gentleman acted the part of a very lively man and one that had no mind to die so soon he commenced a suit against his relations who meand to interdict him under the pretense that he was very old and having always been an ill husband there was no hopes of his growing better in his old days had the late prince been still alive and sat as his judge he had not only given it for his adversaries but ordered him to be imprisoned for he used to say that if there had been two es in france he would not scruple to leave it for his lifetime his meaning was that he was the most troublesome man in the world which was also the opinion of a good many people who in imitation of this prince did not satisfy themselves with trifles he chose rather the condition of one of his own men in a  corner at chantilly than to be obliged to hear such an idle fellow speak nor did he stand to say that he was far less uneasy with his pullets and the other creatures that he kept in his managry and visited twice a day than he would be with men of his character yet it was a strange manner of occupation for a prince so famous for having gained so many battles and whose very first essays in war had equaled the actions of those that grew old in the trade the enterprise of barcelona was still in hand as well as the design to have the prince of conti chosen king of poland and the court was exceeding diligent to bring both the affairs to a happy issue the one was indeed more easier than the other though both appeared very hard at least there was some reason to judge the latter more easy than the former because all they had to do was to spare no money to make it succeed they were only to gain the votes of those who are always for the highest bidder for as that is the harvest of the poles who reap nothing when they have a king upon the throne so it is long since they owned their resemblance of the swiss in regard nothing is to be done with them without money the prince of conti had sent thither already two hundred thousand crowns of his own and the king for his part who would have reaped a great advantage by obtaining that crown for the prince sent fourtimes as much abbot polignac the kings ambassador at that court distributed the money amongst those he had engaged in his party and taking that election to depend entirely upon cardinal radzionwski archbishop of gnesne who by virtue of this last dignity was prince and regent of the kingdom during the vacancy of the throne lavishd his money upon him while he thought it sufficient to feed others with fine promises but the generals of the army of the crown and the lithuaian troops who were equally sharp set with the cardinal did not find their account in that sort of management neither were the palatines satisfied forasmuch as they thought their swords deserved to be considered no less than the cardinals mitre abbot polignac had disguised his project for a long time and made the queen dowager of poland believe that the king his master had only put up the prince of cnti by way of provision in case there were no other in whom he could confide besides that the prince of conti was veryindifferent upon the matter and if he consented to it twas rather to please the king than to gratify his inclination so far he said well and that prince who was passionately fond of france was afraid of nothing more than to hear that he was elected king of poland but as for his majesty he was of another mind for he desired nothing more earnestly than to see the crown upon that princes head by reason of the advantage he expected from thence the queen dowager being like most people easily persuaded to believe what she wished gave credit to the insinuations of abbot polignac she took a great deal of pains to justify to him her conduct in what she had done for several years against the kings interest and gave him to know that his majesty had ford her to it by his ill usage and that whenever his majesty pleased to alter his measurs with reference to her she would really show that she drd nothing more than the restoring of the good understanding that had been betwixt the two crowns in the beginning of the reign of the king her late husband she continued to reprert that i his majesty would vouchsafe his pction to prince james her son whom she meand to prefer to the throne as soon as he avd at that dignity he should do every thing in  with his majestys pleasure and that his majesty ought not to fear that the alliance he had concluded with a suspected family would oblige him to counteract his interest that he knew well that princes have but little regard for their wives relations at a time when either their glory or grandeur are in view and that her son would continue in an inseparable union with his crown insomuch that he would put the service of his majesty upon the same balance with his own  these words were very acceptable to the abbot of polignac who knew that a reconciliation between two parties is the more sincere when both sides are eager in justifying their past conduct nay he pretended to have some sense of the justness of her complaints against the king in order to insinuate himself more effectually into her breast in fine he agreed with her to transfer all the votes for the prince of conti to her son and upon that consideration she promised to use her utmost efforts in taking off sapieha great general of lithania from the house of austria the interest of which he seemed to espouse very warmly sapieha was extreme powerful in that duchy and was rather master than general of it possessing vast territories and great charges in it which was the reason that every one trembled under him the abbot of polignac had no other design in it but to weaken the party of the house of austria flattering himself with the thoughts that prince james his party would never be able to make head against his own for he was very far from thinking to keep his word to the queen and all he said to h was only to the end he might the more easily deceive her nevertheless she was so credulous that to assure him the better of the confidence she had in him she sent him her picture which he seemed to have desired very earnestly he set it up in the most conspicuous place of his chamber to make her the better believe how much he esteemed it however that princess acted nothing but in concert with him she endeavored to take off sapieha from the house of austria sapieha did not deceive her in the least he told her freely that he was so engaged in the interest of that family that there was but one thing that could oblige him to quit it and that was to have the crown set upon his own head and that it was in her power to contribute to it if she pleased that she should only join her interest with that he could make for himself which if she pleased to consent to he would infallibly set her upon the throne with him for that he being a widdower and she a widow nothing could hinder them from marrying the queen dowager however earnest she was to reign did not at all relish that proposal she knew sapiehas spirit who though he would have kept his promise to her yet would hardly have allowed her the very shadow of the kingly power while he himself would manage the whole without control she had had already two husbands over whom she had always a great ascendant and now she did not pretend to degenerate in the least from what she had always been though she was passed the time of inspiring any new flames  the house of austria in imitation of that of france caused the ministers which they had at that court to act so secretly that it was impossible even for the most clear sighted to pry into their conduct there was hardly any one who did not believe that their design was to advance prince james to the throne the honor he had in being brotherinlaw to the emperor and the king of spain confirmed them in their thoughts however that house had quite a different inclination they mistrusted the queen of poland whose actions they were no strangers to and knowing that she had sent money into france they looked upon her as a woman that had been always inclined that way they knew that the french have always a secret inclination for their country which never dies but with their last breath besides they knew that princess had a certain ascendant over her son that would assure her of the reins of the government if ever they set the crown upon his head however all these reasons were more than sufficient to oblige the emperor and the king of spain to prefer their own interests to that of their brotherinlaw who was a prince upon whom they could not rely very much for he was far short of the qualities of the king his father they cast their eyes upon a person very worthy of that crown the duke of saxony a young prince who had distinguished himself to a great degree in the wars the emperor had against the infidels and whom he had set at the head of his army seemed to both of them to be the man his imperial majesty labored to remove a difficulty that opposed their design the duke was of the lutheran religion and ever in some measure considered as the head of all that party because it was one of his ancestors that afforded a retreat to luther and who after having embraced his doctrine undertook also his protection against the emperor who pretended to have him punished because he dared to preach a new religion it is truly astonishing why his imperial majesty and the king of spain would not rather endeavor to choose the duke of bavaria who was soninlaw to the one and nephew to the other he being also a catholic which was a necessary quality for the king of poland besides he was much richer than the duke of saxony and that is no mean quality to be considered in a design of that nature but whether that elector was altogether indifferen or whether the two princes judged it necessary to continue him in the government of flanders they fixed entirely upon the other duke the emperor proposed the matter to him and told him that it should only be long of his religion if the affair did not succeed the duke found the thing of too great a consequence to determine suddenly however charming the proposition was he considered the condition they annexed to it was too weighty for him he demanded some time to give his answer and the emperor judged that because he listened already all would have a favorable issue if he pressed him never so little he began to infinuate to him that both the first calvinists and lutherans had always believed that one might as well be saved in the catholic religion as in theirs and that the crown they proposed to him was certainly well worth all the trouble they asked of him and at the same time made him converse with a number of doctors that pushed the affair a great deal further and alleged a great many reasons to prove that the catholic religion was the only true religion and that which had been always professed in the church  the bright luster of the crown of poland made the duke relish their admirable reasons and some ministers who conferred before him with these doctors though neither the one nor the other knew to what purpoe all this was doing agreed that according to the explication the catholics make now adays of their faith it was void of all manner of venom so that the duke was more than half persuaded to go all the length they desired of him the catholic doctors hearing the ministers speak after that manner that the prince might harbor no further scruple in his mind alleged that nonehad ever explained their faith after any other manner than what they do at present excepting some sort of people that were glad to make others believe some different thing that one might only read the council of trent to know the truth of it and that all those of their religion had no other doctrine than such as was taught there the duke was glad that they prepared for him the way he desired being informed by the emperor that his intrigues in poland were so strongly laid that his enemies would find it hard to overturn them there was nothing that diswaded him so much from making a profession of that religion as the fear that his hopes would prove abortive accordingly being a man of precaution he promised to the emperor to perform all they desired of him upon the proviso of the certainty of his election now this assurance that he demanded was a very difficult point because it depended upon the votes of a great many people that were capable of falsifying their words the very bishop of cujavia though he headed the interest of the house of austria showed no great resolution in determining who he should vote for notwithstanding he had already taken of his money he designed to make use of that election as a means to make himself a cardinal and was sensible that whatsoever side was preferred he would meet with invincible obstacsle to his pretensions the bishop of passaw waited only to see the emperors success in order to make a proposal for the succession to that crown he being brother to the empress the bishop of cujavia was convinced that he would be too hard for him and that upon that score the same thing would be said to him that upon the like occasion was formerly said to the coadjutor of paris cardinal mazarin had formerly promised to invest him with the purple upon the proviso of some things that were mutually concerted but he forfeited this promise the cardinal desired the prince of conti to procure the nomination of another the bishop of cujavia fearing and that very justly that the same thing might happen to him would gladly have gone over to the french side if he had not been jealous of the abbot of polignac whom he took to be of such a temper as not to give up the pretentions he equally made to the cardinals cap in this quandary he caused some to feel his pulse to try if he would quit his pretentions but the abbot being as fond of the preferment as he thought his request very indiscreet and neglected the kings interest in carrying on his own in effect had he resigned his pretentions to this prelate he had by that means joined the prelates interest to his own and had certainly procured the election of the prince of conti but he fancied that by the primats assistance and by the help of some money he still expected from france he would compass his design without him  the bishop perceiving how confident he was of his good success since he despised his offers which any other would have valued at a far higher rate than what he demanded of him endeavored to cast in some difference betwixt him and the queen of poland he caused inform that princess that she would be extremely imposed upon if she relied upon his promises and advised her to have some better security of him than his word unless she had a mind to leave room for a future repentance the queen who was naturally suspicious resolved to make her advantage of this advice and that she might have the more confidence in polignacs expressions she desired that he might procue for her the kings letter by which she might be assured of what his majesty was pleased to quaint her by his ambassador the abbot put her in hopes of it designing to elude her whenever she urged him too close to make good his promise in the mean time he wrote to france that affairs went fairly for the prince of conti but if they designed to make the success not only probable but infallible they should not ail to send him a considerable sum of money the court of france was never in greater necessity than at that time having resolved to attack barcelona they were equipping a strong fleet in provence that put them to a vast expense besides they were considerably exhausted to procure a peace from their enemies that at that time was so necessary to them all their provinces were ruined by the war and though other states were hardly in better circumstances yet they were afraid that the subjects would scarce be any longer capable of bearing so heavy a charge  they had been a long time resolved as is already mentioned upon the design of barcelona in hopes that the spaniards who alone with the emperor opposed the peace would change their sentiments when they saw themselves attacked even in the very bowels for though that place be upon the frontiers of france yet there being only two or three places of strength betwixt it and madrid it was not doubted but that conquest would alarm them much more than the loss of four better places in flanders but after all though these reasons pleaded for carrying on the attack without any delay it was nevertheless put off for some time upon important considerations the very inhabitants of marseilles opposed it is bombardment in regard they had a great many effects in it which would have been lost if it had been reduced to ashes they made a considerable present to the court to procure a due regard to their interest but at last all the considerations that retarded the seige  being taken away it was discoursed on more warmly than ever  this enterprise could not be carried on without a great deal of charge as i intimated before but the court that is seldom sensible of the public miseries and had a minister that found the mystery to raise as much money as they pleased without overcharging the people thought that this ought not to hinder them from bringing their enemies to a compliance in effect the provinces were rather miserable because they wanted hands to labor the ground than that they were overcharged by exorbitant imposts so that his majesty who was still full of money notwithstanding all these immense expenses thought fit to satisfy the abbot of polignac in regard that he assured them there was nothing else wanting to make all have a prosperous success so that he sent him not only the sum he desired but four hundred thousand livers over and above that if he came to fail in his negotiation he should not blame an unseasonable parcimony the queen of poland seeing him receive so large remittances and distribute them according to the cardinals advice found him very remote from her interest and began to be extreme jealous of his conduct she had reason to suspect that he only thought to amuse her and as the esteem they had of the prince of conti in that kingdom was far superior to that they had for prince james her son she began to press the abbot upon the assurances of his promise he shifted it by telling her sometimes that the king being now ready to begin the campaign had no time to think of any thing else at other times that the king expected that if he brought over to the party of prince james the voices he had gained for the prince of conti she would be pleased to repay him the money he had sent into that country for making the party  the queens council could hardly blame so just an offer but distrusting that it was only a pretense of the ambassadors to delay affairs advised the queen to yield to him in that article for if he meant to be ingenuous the prince her son could never fail of the crown the queen believed her council and she herself communicated it to the abbot but that ambassador being now at a loss what to answer thought fit to propose to her something concerning his own particular interest he told her that during the life of the king her husband he had the promise of the court that if he got the prince of conti to be chosen king he should allow him to name whom he pleased for the cardinal dignity that he expected she would be pleased to stipulate the same thing with her son that all his pains might not be fruitless that there were some prelates in her sons interest who had the same pretentions in case he were chosen king and that he desired they might resign in his favor that her majesty ought not to take it ill that he should require this of her for perhaps in his lifetime he should not have so favorable an opportunity to arrive to that honorable dignity  as soon as the queens council heard him talk after that manner they were the more confirmed in their sentiments of him however to cut off all opportunities to make use of that difficulty they used their interest with the prelates that were of prince james his party to resign what the abbot desired which they did in consideration of the promises the queen had made to them and that princess acquainting the ambassador with it he pretended all went well and that all that remaind  e done now was to reimburse the sums he  advanced o which he had the accounts readvly by him now he had not proposed that as to be done presently all he desired before was that when prince james should be chosen the queen and he should be obliged to make that restitution so all that were in the interest of the queen finding that he had only altered his conduct the better to amuse her judged it expedient that her majesty should not only break off all measures with him but do it also very openly their reason was that as france had it is enemies as well as partisans the secret union which they suspected she entertained with him hindered those who had openly declared themselves against france to embrace her interest the queen believed them and after once sounding the abbot of polignac touching his last resolution she made him sensible that she was no more of an humor to be amused she wrote a letter also to the marchioness of bethunes to be delivered to his most christian majesty in it she complains of the abbots disengenuity and how uselesly he lavished the kings money for however powerful he believed his interest it was no ways capable to equal that of the house of austria except they joined it with hers this marchioness was sister to the queen and both of them were daughters to the marquis of arquien who was captain of the duke of orleans hundred swiss and afterward cardinal by the nomination of the late king of poland the late princess mary of gonsague had carried that queen with her into poland when she herself went thither in the same quality being married to ladislaus who then possessed that crown she had taken her for one of her maids of honor and the prince lubomirsky falling in love with her as well as sobiesky who was afterward her husband the queen declared herself in favor of the first because he was by far the greater prince of the two in the mean time lubomirsky dying a little after and the affairs of that country proving unfavourable for casimir ladislaus his brother who was chosen king after ladislaus and had moreover married his widow queen mary knowing that sobiesky continued always his affection for princess lubomirsky promised to procure her for him in marriage if he would declare himself for the king her husband which he did and as he had already gained a great reputation in that kingdom his declaring himself was of vast advantage to casimir however after a great many different accidents that are foreign to my subject casimir dying without issue as well as king ladislaus his brother and a french prince making interest for the crown as well as the present duke of lorain his father the bishop of marseilles who was ambassador for france in that country seeing it go cross to the interest of the person whom his master proposed changed his conduct very dexterously and told the diet that it was none of their business to court their neighbors for what they might easily find among themselves provided they were satisfied with it that john sobiesky was a person very worthy of their crown who would govern them with all the prudence and satisfaction that it was possible for any other prince to do sobiesky had beat the turks in many rencounters and even very lately had rescued the republic from imminent danger by a glorious victory so that his fresh services pleading more in his favor than it was possible for the ambassador of france to do he was chosen king notwithstanding a former decree of the republic by which they excluded their own subjects from the crown  by these means the queen of poland of an ordinary french girl became queen however though her birth ought to have obliged her to all the respect imaginable for the crown of france under whose government she had drawn her first breath yet she very soon forgot it because his most christian majesty would not comply with all her desires the marquis of vitry ambassador of france at that court in the king her husbands time passed his time there very uneasily and he missed been assassinated very narrowly because she suspected him to be the cause of all the displeasure she received from the court of france the king who made use of the prince her husband as a check over the emperor and empire was obliged to conceal his resentment of that princess her conduct matters were better adjusted by the moderation and prudence of his most christian majesty and by the secret reflections that princess might have had of her injustice to a prince worthy to govern the universe but as it is impossible always to dissemble ones sentiments she soon made the breach between her and his majesty wider than ever for being by the divine goodness raised to so high a dignity it vexed her extremely that her father had no mark of distinction in his court she therefore entreated the king to create him duke and peet the marquis of arquien was a person abandoned to his pleasures and became so far a slave to them that though he was advanced to a great age yet  wise but plunged into debaucheries that  extremely upon the honor of his daughter and gained no reputation to himself either as fatherinlaw to a great king or as a man of quality he avowedly kept his miss whom he allowed to go by his name for she was known by no other than by that of louison d arquien and that coming often to his maiestys ear he thought it not very convenient to grant the queen the dignity she demanded for her father  that repulse was resented with all the malice woman is capable of she obliged the king her husband to discontinue all secret intelligence with his majesty and as the emperor at that time was engaged in a bloody war against the turks she incessantly importuned him until he had concluded an offensive and defensive league with his imperial majesty the almighty brought all that to pass for the relief of vienna which the turks had besieged and beyond all peradventure had also been taken had not his polish majesty come to relieve it however so lively and impatient a princess could not but show her resentment much more to the abbot of polignac because the present affair was of far greater consequence than any thing that had passed formerly and the world saw by the violence of her resentment that she would continue it all her life she sent to him to have her picture again and because he refused to restore it thinking still to amuse her she immediately sent the same person that had formerly spoke to him to let him know that if he would not restore it in a friendly manner she would oblige him to do it by force the ambassador who was sensible how she had treated the marquis of vitry would not run the risque of a second refusal he returned her picture and seeing the queen had broke off all measures with him he observed none with her but what her sex and dignity obliged him to in the mean time he distributed some small money he had received among the commanders of the army of the crown and of that of lithuania they thought it convenient to refuse it but as all he gave them was not capable to satisfy their hungry appetites so they were not the more obliged by it to comply with his design  an officer of the army of the crown who was the elector of brandenburgs subject having heard even those who received the money vent their railleries resolved to come and acquaint his majesty of it at versailles believing the king would certainly reward him liberally so quitting his charge and leaving that country expressly he passed through all germany and arriving in holland came to the marshal bofflers army upon the frontiers of the spanish flanders the officer of the main guard having stopped him was informed by him who he was whence he came and in some measure of the nature of his business and sent him to the marshal to acquaint him of what he was not willing to declare there this stranger did not know one word of french but as he spoke latin to perfection he made the general easily understand that he came from poland and that he had affairs of moment relating to that country and this is all he would tell him as if the marshal had not been worthy of his secret the general seeing a person of an ill mein that pleaded nothing in his favor but rather gave him an ill opinion of him was like to cause him to be taken up but considering he would do better to send him under a sure guard to court he put him into the hands of an officer whom he ordered to take two or three troopers for his escorte  the officer went along with him to versailles where this man was reputed a spy as soon as he offered to speak for after what the abbot of polignac had wrote to them they were fully persuaded that the affairs of the prince of conty went as well as they could wish in that country they would not believe a tittle of what he alleged it being quite contrary to polignacs relation he told the secretary of state to whom the marshal had sent him that they were highly mistaken if they believed that the poles would ever choose that prince for their king they asked him the reason but he not being able to produce any other than that i mentioned but now it was reckoned so bad a one that he was immediately sent to prison they were resolved to draw up an indictment against him but mons dargenson who was employed to try him being a man full of justice and equity had no sooner examined him but he found it plain that all his crime consisted in having thought to make his fortune by bringing this news he reported the same thing to the court and the process against this pretended criminal consisting only of an interrogatory or two it was dropped till they saw how the election of poland would go  the duke of saxony thought it convenient in the mean time to make a faint show of the catholic religion without having the least inclination to it he saw that it was absolutely necessary for obtaining the crown of poland so having brought over to his interest a bishop of his own family that was of that religion this prelate at the emperors solicitation gave him a certificate that he had privately abjured lutheranism this they showed secretly to the palatines that were in the austrian party who seemed to have no other view in corresponding with it than to advance prince jamess election at least the world believed so and france was of that opinion so that they did not dream that ever that elector had thought in the least of the crown the queen of poland was imposed upon as well as others the palatines delayed affairs on purpose that they might be more courted and have the opportunity of filling their purses the elector was obliged to borrow money from all hands to forward his interest the elector of brandenburg lent him considerable sums upon a mortgage of the baillages that lay convenient for him he likewise raised immense sums in his own dominions upon the pretense that being in the emperors service he wanted the assistance of his own people because it was not possible for the emperor to pay the subsidies they had agreed upon moreover instead of making his correspondence with the duke of erandenburg to appear he feigned he was at variance with him upon the account of the domains that both of them had upon the confines of poland and accordingly both of them marched thither their troops as if they designed immediately to come to a rupture france that had too many enemies to deal with to be indifferent in desiring to get rid of at least some part of em was caught as well in this snare as in the former they were willing to believe that this would not fail to make a powerful diversion in their favor and as it was impossible for some part of the german princes to be mere spectators in the differences of these two princes so they expected a considerable ease upon each side  the march of these troops was very cunningly contrived and disproved with a witness what had been published a while ago to the disadvantage of the house of austria some would have it that for many years together that family had been always tricked by france and that by observing only their ordinary course as if there had been none else more ready and sure to forward their designs they had so degenerated from the wisdom and greatness of charles v that all europe had forgot them but as they managed this intrigue that was contrived at vienna they were overjoyed to know that france had lost its pretensions to the title  while these considerable affairs were transacting in poland some other matters passed in france of less consequence for the state but in which some particular persons found themselves more interressd paris that had furnished the scene for that lady who had met with so ill usage from her own domestics afforded also the following which is extraordinary enough to plead for some place in these annals it appeared to me so uncommon that i doubted for a long time whether i should insert it i was sensible that among so many certain things as i here present you with i ought not to run the risque of writing any that i have reason to suspect in fine this matter has been confirmed to me by so many hands that if i be deceived it must be because they took pleasure to impose upon me i received six different letters from paris that contained the same thing so that after all the precautions i used i suppose that however extraordinary the matter appears it may be credited after the enquiry i have made in it in effect if we should doubt of all the surprising things paris affords we must necessarily doubt of all that happens there for every day produces such accidents as one would hardly believe without infallible testimony  a girl was forced to profess by the uncontrolable will of parents who by this means meant to take her off from the inclinations she had for a person they would not have her marry notwithstanding she was shut up she always continued a respect for him that troubled her extremely in the exercises of her new profession her lover for his part could never forget her but having seen her put on the habit he ought to have laid aside all hopes of ever enjoying her yet being always tormented with his passion which was so much the more violent that while the young nun continued in the way of the world she gave him all the demonstrations of her esteem that he could reasonably desire he robbed his father a rich merchant of twenty thousand livres in gold clothed himself in a girls habit and went to the convent where she was after having hid himself for a whole month in the city pretending to be sick his first compliment to the convent was that he was resolved to become a nun he told em he was come from the country and was the daughter of parents that had made a considerable estate by trafficking and having showed his treasure to these nuns it secured him more in their esteem than any profession whatsoever  so extreme desirous were they to have it that they easily dispensed with inquiring any farther after the place of her nativity or what faults this disguised girl might be liable to in her youth they were satisfied for that she promised them the whole provided they would maintain her while she lived however she told them that they might not think she was ill natured that if she meant to let them have the whole sum it was because she had no relations in france that her father and mother who had come thither were originally english and thus having told them a thousand pretty stories at length she concluded that she was a poor orphan and would be very glad to lay out her money to the best advantage or at least to secure herself from the miseries of necessity  this relation of the pretended orphan appeared so ingenuous to the hungry nuns that they resolved to receive her into their cloister without troubling themselves with any farther inquiry into her circumstances than what their eyes could afford them into the goodness of her coin however there arose a little difficulty betwixt the parties for the nuns desired to have the money presently delivered up to them or at least when she assumed the habit but she for her part pretended only to do it when she professed though she meant never to do it for she designed her money for some other use than what the nuns had ever thought of and to that purpose told them that she could not be satisfied whether their rules and manner of life would suit with her temper and till she was fully assured of that they ought to demand no other conditions of her but that of paying handsomely for her board which she would never scruple to do that in the mean time she would put out her money to interest which would fall to them in course whenever she had assumed the profession but that she intended to secure herself before she was stripped of her money she demanded nothing but what was just and besides threatened to find out some other place if they refused any longer to accept of her conditions being afraid to slip the opportunity they agreed with her upon her own terms so this pretended young gentlewoman having put on the white vail in a few days bestowed so liberally upon her habit as if money had cost her nothing all the nuns were wonderfully edified by her generosity only her mistress in the midst of all their joy for so rich a prize continued still in her wonted indisposition as if she had been altogether mortified the resemblance she found between herself and her spark opened her wounds afresh that were still too tender not to be sensible of any thing that touched them  the scene being thus over the novice began soon to accost the lady that obliged him to dissemble his sex but being unwilling to entertain her in the torment she was in she told her all of a sudden what love had forced her to do she added moreover that she was fully resolved to starve herself if she would show her no compassion that she was certainly informed she had assumed the profession against her inclination and if she had yet any sense of the passion she had for her while with her parents she had no reason to doubt but the recent testimony she now gave her would engage her to enter into all the measures she would advise her that she had fallen upon this invention not to rob her of her honor but to restore her to to the tranquillity she had lost and to recover her own also that she could enjoy no more after she had entered into the convent that she wanted not money to carry them through in expctation of a better fortune and though the sum was not of great importance yet she knw how to manage it to that advantage as would secure them from the injuries of necessity that she was fully resolved to marry her if she pleasd that it was certain her vows were of no force since she was compelled to them and so it depended entirely upon herself to be freed from her present captivity since it was not possible for her to be happy without her that neither of them ought to regard the meanness of the present she offered her now in comparison of what both of them could have reasonably expected if love had not embroiled them with their parents that she would endeavor to be at ease without them and oftentimes there was more satisfaction in a middle ordinary frtune than in a sumptuous one that great rches are always attended with great cares and provided that a husband and wife who love one another tenderly be out of the reach of necessity they may be indifferent for other superfluities  the nun found this way of reasoning very pertinent it eing altogether conformable to her own sense and inclination she agreed with her lover in all things they passed three months in this intrigue doing nothing but what became the strictest honor the there might have been some encroachments upon decercy the novice feigned herself sick alleging after they had asked her a great many times what she ailed that her sickness proceeded only from the austerity of the convent which she could never be able to go through the discreet mothers were a little vexed to hear her speak after that rate forseeing that the twenty thousand livers they had relied upon would slip out of their fingers but there being no remedy they were fain to restore to her her temporal habit and give her her pass she presently took up her money and gave it to the bankers for bills of exchange upon italy where she was resolved to pass her time as soon as she made sure of her mistress having mutually adjusted all things the night before they put their plot in execution the nun uninterd a sister that had been just buried carried her to her bed and having set fire to it made her escape into the garden of the convent where her spark had fastened a ladder of cords to a certain place of the wall they had condescended upon he waited for her at the other side with a coach and receiving her into it while the whole convent was in an uproar about the fire carried her to a lodging he had entirely at his command  the poor nuns had much to do to quench the fire that frighted them extremely for fear of having their whole convent destroyed by it however having mastered it at length though with a considerable loss they all of them run immediately to the chamber where the fire first began and being extremely troubled that she did not appear they doubted not in the least but she had perished in the flames they were soon confirmed in the certainty of their belief when they found the remnants of a dead body in the ruins of that chamber thinking really the rest had been consumed by the fire nothing was heard but grief and lamentation upon all hands some rehearsing the praises of the dead nun whom they thought they could never lament sufficiently others who were as much interessd as compassionate grieved more for the loss of the house than of the dead and while they amused themselves with these or such like reflections not one of them dreamed of what had happened but the most probable thing they said was that her parents when acquainted with her unhappy disaster must needs censure themselves in regard they had forced her to assume the profession against her inclination  in the mean time the two lovers escaped into italy pursuant to their design there they were married having met with a priest to their mind or one perhaps so tender of their interest as to ease a poor girl of her vows without giving her the trouble of applying herself to any other authority than his own the young husband applied himself to traffic in which he was so fortunate as in twenty years time to make a considerable estate in that time providence blessed him with a numerous off spring but at length he died in the five and fortieth year of his age the lady who was much about the same age notwithstanding the tender love and prosperity of her husband being still frighted with a check of conscience resolved upon a journey to rome to obtain the holyfathers absolution for what she had done the pope refused it absolutely without she promised faithfully to return to the convent she was extremely unwilling to comply in regard of the tender affection she had for her children in fine preferring the tranquillity of her conscience to every thing she conquered all obstacles that would have hindered her and promised his holiness to obey his command she had a favorable passage by sea into france together with her whole family which she carried along with her to rome to move his holiness to a compassion for them when she arrived at marseilles she took the way to paris concealing from the world both herself and her affairs she lodged some time incognito in the suburbs of st germans to dispose of her family before she would withdraw into the cloister and though she had put her affairs in order she would by no means go thither before she was assured of a civil usage she was not ignorant of the terrible penalty they were liable to that leaped over the walls of the convent as she had done that she should not be exposed to it she offered underhand twenty thousand livres for her pardon this sum charmed all the nuns eyes which they looked upon as a present sent them from heaven they were mightily surprised at her resurrection and acquainted her friends with it who doubted a long time whether they ought to rejoice at it or show her some mark of their displeasure for wandering about the world with a person upon whose account she had been forced to turn nun as it was never seen that all the world was of the same opinion so some continued their indignation against her and would never see her others did not mind the matter so much but all of em agreed to have her stripped of the money she brought from italy pretending it was not in her power to dispose of it to her children she secured it in a persons hands whom she had reason to confide in to have it divided amongst her children whenever they should either marry or establish themselves some other way in the world however they were not the only persons who gaped after it her deceased husbands friends began also to bestir themselves upon the news of what had passed both parties commenced their process against the children pretending to have them declared bastards so much for this extraordinary scene which in effect appeared in such a manner to me that i should never have had the confidence to have mentioned it here without having taken all imaginable precautions with reference to it it is not very hard to conjecture what decision justice will make in it however it will hardly be soon determined the judges are seldom very prompt in deciding causes when the parties are in circumstances to dispense with money they believe it would derogate too much from their laudable custom to dispatch readily affairs that afford gleanings  the court being about that time at marli the count of chamilly was named amongst others to go thither in a discourse of the war some young gentlemen there took a share in the conversation and the king asked the count of grammont softly how he liked the young gentlemens way of reasoning grammont who has a pleasant freedom in all his expressions being glad to make use of this opportunity to serve the count of chamilly who had been neglected for a considerable time answered his majesty that he ought not to be surpised at these young mens way of reasoning for if any were at the pains to ask them if ever the grave was besieged they would say nothing of what had passed there nor who had defended the place the king perceived his design which was to upbraid his majesty that after so glorious an action chamilly had not been rewarded as others had who had not his merit to plead for them but it is no surprising matter now adays to see actions of renown shot in their carier courage and conduct does not entitle a man to a plentiful fortune he must also be learned in the art of truckling to the ministers the marquis of louvois was extraordinary upon this account and however highly he valued the good and advantage of the state which none could deny to him yet to serve the king faithfully was no sufficient character to recommend one unless he were his creature without that nothing would do it was his constant maxim that it was impossible to be his majestys friend without being the ministers i shall neither justify nor condemn him there is a great deal to be said on both sides his majesty who without dispute is the most sincere and prudent prince in the universe took this occasion to do chamilly all the justice that could be expected so that those who were entirely strangers to the siege of the grave as the count of grammont pretended might easily be informed of all that passed there  in the mean time the spaniards being alarmed at the preparations the king was making in provence acquainted the english and dutch afresh of i to the end they might send their fleet into the mediterranean to make head against the kings these two powers being full as weary of the war as his most christian majesty for that no advantage could accrue to them by continuing of it amused them from time to time with fair promises without troubling themselves to perform them they thought it convenient to allow france to act its utmost efforts upon that side that the house of austria might become the more tractable and oppose no more a tranquillity of which all europe stood in need the pope made use of his interest in vain to draw over that house to it so great was their confidence that france would at last be oppressed by so many enemies as were united against it the duke of savoys falling off gained nothing upon their obstinacy though it eased france very sensibly the pope could never offer his mediation to decide the quarrel most of the parties interessed being of another religion in fine the swedish king accomplished what his holiness could never bring to pass he made the parties agree to accept of him as mediator of their differences the castle of ryswick was named for the place of their congress though the emperor opposed it upon several accounts they endeavored to accommodate matters in an amicable way which was exceeding hard to do considering the exorbitant demands of the house of austria these insisted always upon the restitution of all they had lost since the treaty of the pyrenees and had no regard to the two later treaties of aixla chapel and nimiguen alleging they had only been obliged to make them by a superior force to avoid the utter desolation of their states the duke of lorrain for his part demanded the restitution of his domains without any regard to the conditions that were agreed upon by the treaty of nimiguen which seemed so insupportable to his father that he chose rather never to enter into the treaty than accept of them upon these terms a great many other princes came also to thwart it who demanded reparation of the king for a great many places and villages that they alleged he had divested them of insomuch that his most christian majesty might have been compared to the bird in the fable from which all the other birds his enemies meant to pluck a feather  it had been very hard to redress all these confusions if the common misery had not obliged the english and hollanders to remove the difficulty it had like to have proved a gordianknot where the sword is more necessary than art but as these two powers to speak properly were the very life of the alliance that had no motion but from this spring they asked the french plenipotentiaries at ryswick if they meant to stand to the preliminaries that were stipulated with monsieur calliers otherwise it were to no purpose to meet but if they intended faithfully to perform what was agreed upon they would soon remove all other obstacles these preliminaries were of no less consequence than the restitution of two entire provinces and of one place of equal importance to all the rest these two powers doubted that calliers had made these advances of his own head that he might with the greater facility discover their pretensions but his colleagues having assured them it was the kings sincere intention they went on with the treaty in such a manner as the world might perceive they meant to bring it to a happy conclusion  in the mean time the court of france increased in the number of subjects by the conquests it made during the course of the war tho it had to do with so many enemies as one would have thought were sufficient to bring it to desolation nothing but coaches was to be seen at versailles some of them with the ornaments peculiar to the electors of the empire and that was become so fashionable that even the french themselves had them set upon theirs however the better sort of men despised it seeing no apparent reason why they were so ready to imitate the cusoms of the empire for if his majesty had firmly pretended to it he was so far from it now that there was not the least appearance of his arriving to it however there were some of these gentlemen who had a just title to carry them particularly the count of egmont who married mademoiselle de conac the archbishop of aixs niece his majesty conferred the honors of the louvre upon her and these were justly due to her because her husband was lineally descended of the dukes of ghelderland which created to her a great deal of envy amongst the other ladies of quality insomuch that the marshall destrees lady could not dissemble her resentment of it one day at dinner with mons pontchartrain she said without regarding if any there would resent her discourse she admired that the count of egmont would condescend to marry such a girl as mademoiselle conac the chevalier dobtere governor of couelloure overheard her and being uncle to the young gentlewoman could not avoid being concerned at it he told the gentleman who sat next him how unbecoming it was for morin the jews daughter to talk after that manner of a person of his nieces quality that he owned the honor the alliance had done both to her and all her friends but great as it was it failed of that the morins had by the blood of the estrees that the difference was not so great between the egmonts and the conacs as betwixt the etrees and the burgesses of the city of tours all the company expected that the chevalier would not fail to resent it after that manner and knowing that the lady was ignorant of the chevaliers interest in mademoiselle they continued the conversation upon the same subject with her that she might avoid a second oversight then she became sensible of her fault and of the private reproof they gave her but whether she had done it because she knew him not or through imprudence she never made him any acknowledgement of it  lent followed soon after and a certain monk named seraphin guardian of the capucins at meudon was chosen to preach before the king that season he behaved himself with such freedom that it was generally believed he would be forbid the pulpit but his majesty was so intent upon his devotion as some allege out of a principle of christianity in favor of the peace that he overlooked a great many things which at any other time he would have maintained with the point of his sword i say his majesty who honors all men of probity was so far from being offended at it that he owned nothing pleased him more than his sermons and desired him to continue them after the same manner nor did the king ever neglect any of them but perceiving that the duke of rochefoucaut never came to them he asked him the reason the duke replied that he had no seat in the church his majesty conferred the bishop of orleans his first almoners seat upon him the bishop being then at his cathedral two days journey from paris whence returning very soon he desired to have his seat again the duke refused it pretending he never had it but out of decency and now his majesty conferring it upon him he meant to shut him out of it this difference made no less noise than monsieur boleaus lutrin both parties were backed by their friends in their pretensions and if they durst to have fought for it they were sufficiently animated against each other to have done it but resting satisfied to show that they were both men of spirit they turned their indignation to solicit his majesty that he would be pleased to decide the cause in favor of the respective party  the king gave it for the duke which vexed the prelate to that degree that out of spite he returned to his diocese he carried the abbot of coaslin along with him as if by that he meant to engage him in his resentment this abbot had the survivorship of the prelates charge as first almoner and the expectation of the first bishopric should fall besides his uncle had no reason to complain of the favors of the court after the death of monsieur chanvallon archbishop of paris the king had awarded him his nomination for a cardinals cap which he had formerly gratified the archbishop with so that neither of them could be excused from imprudence that showed so much passion for so small a cause  about the same time his brother the duke of coaslin had another kind of vexation that seemed to be better grounded than theirs his coach was arrested for debt which the advocate master of requests and register of the points of honor before the mareschals of france alleged was unduly done because of his dignity some years ago he made a great deal of noise about it in favor of the duke of ventadour who suffered the same affront but as he was far inferior in wit and reputation to monsieur pomponne his brotherinlaw after he had been crushed in the defense he undertook in ventadours affair he never dared to appear in defense of coaslin he was even ready to lay down his charge before the mareschals of france which made him the more wary of engaging into new troubles for fear of ending as he had begun  though this was some mortification for the duke to be oblig to walk home afoot yet about the same time a more pressing vexation afflicted the duchess or svlly for the princess of furstemberg caused to seize both her bed and furniture for her rent though she had run only three years in arrear there being thirteen years rent due at the death of the duke her husband of which the duchess had cleared ten since she was a widow but there being a misunderstanding between them and the princess alleging that the duchess had spoke with more freedom than decency of her when her husband had been wounded at hunting she laid hold of this opportunity to make her repent of her imprudence these two affairs were represented to the king to knw if his majesty would exempt the duke  or reduce the o their immovables but his majestys answer gave them small encouragement he replied that every one was concerned to pay their debts and tho he did not approve of some procceedings yet it was sufficient that they were screend by justice  the duchess of ludes interest had better success for the duchess of vernevil her mother the king conferred a pension of twelve thousand livres upon her which she had almost refused reputing it too mean for a person of her rank for as she had the honor to be the widow of the kings uncle she thought it her due to be treated as a princess of the blood though the advantage he boasted of came the left hand his majesty seldom gave them less than twenty thousand livres and she thought it was none of her business to accept of so little considering what others received who could not come in competiton with her in effect the count of brancas enjoyed fourteen thousand livres for his life and after his death his majesty continued it to the princess of harcourt his eldest daughter a great many others had also larger pensions than here is which vexed her to that degree that she told her daughter she meant to resign it again freely to the king the duchess of lude not thinking it convenient for her to resent after this manner the first fruits of her favor dissuaded her from it for it is his majestys prerogative to give and not to receive laws  about that time the only son of the marquis of gordes presented a petition to the king that vexed the marquis of rhodes much more than his gout which afflicted him for many years the marquis of rhodes had married the other sister he was no such gamester as his father but had a much lighter head for had he been only a gamester the bishop had pardoned him for in that he had been of his own kidney but the prelate thinking him somewhat maddish causes him to be shut up in a convent this poor gentleman believed that the bishop had imposed upon his majesty in the affair and thought he could easily persuade the king of the contrary had he the honor to see him but as fools do not think they are so or rather believe they are the wisest of men if you credit their oath the king did not think it convenient to trust him he was afraid to be deceived as he had been lately by a numscul who had escaped out of the bastille where his friends had shut him up upon the same account he was a cadet of the house of usez but so little reformed by his imprisonment that immediately upon his escape he committed the height of folly in marrying very miserably he chose a woman that was neither rich young nor handsome and for an additional comfort the widow of a common fellow that became a gentleman only at his death for they did him the favor to cut his throat in consideration of his wife who was more honestly descended for had they treated him according to his merit they were afraid she might lie under the imputation of the wife of a man that was hanged but his folly did not stop there for he carried her along with him to versails and st cloud where he had revived the angels that had died a long time before but as people have sometimes more pleasure in fools than in wise men every one disturbed his brain the more in making him believe they delighted in his folly  much about that time there happened a quarrel betwixt two persons of quality at st cloud who treated one another after the rate of true billingsgate their sex excused them from the use of the sword to decide it but being equally provided with the ams of the sex they fairly disputed for the victory the one was princess of montaban and the other madam of grancei at last both having spent their spirits in the controversy without the least respect to one another reputation madam of grancie appealed to monsieur  who was present to decide their difference the princess accepted freely of the motion and having called him that minute entreated him to judge the affair impartially he gave thim an attentive hearing but after both of them had taken the pains to set forth their cause he made answer that he discharged the process they asked him in a grumbling way what he meant but the answer he made them shocked them more than all that went before he replied that he had no other sentence to give to such people as them and all they offered was as light as wind they could never get him to give another reason which made them resolve upon a mutual accommodation without giving any body any further trouble upon the matter  this gave great joy to the judge who finding them afterward in a good understanding with one another accosted them in this manner i told you said he that the sentence i pronounced was the only one that could be given amongst such people as you women of your quality quarrel and agree again with equal facility and unless a lover be in the case there is no fear of an accommodation had the duke of orleans who loves novelty been chosen judge of their difference he had possibly decided it rather in favor of the one than the other though he had formerly some inclinations for madan grancie he thought now that her face wrinkled with age was not to be put in competition with the charms of the princess of montauban this lady made him laugh when he had no mind to it she inherited from her ancestors a genius for comedy for she was daughter to the count of nogent and sister to the chevalier of nogent who is still alive and whose only trade since he left the war was to make the marquis of louvois laugh this minister had him along with him in his own colash in all his journies nor was he the only person who loved to divert himself with childish expressions for monsieur colbert at his leisure hours had also people to entertain him with ridiculous stories it is pity but madam danoy and madam de moral had thought at that time of diverting him with their fairies they had been often very acceptable thus you see great men have their weak side as well as others and there is nothing that convinces us more of the frailty of humane nature  the pleasure the duke of orleans found in the princess of montaubans conversation made him resolve to carry her along with him to marly all are not free to go thither and it must be by stratagem that leave is obtained to go for after the king is earnestly solicited he reckons it a particular favor to grant it as in effect it is to go where the prince goes and to appear before him in a place where there is no confusion to be seen though it prevails in other places where the court comes the dukes expectation was frustrated for his majesty refused his request however the duke not being much discouraged at the first repulse insisted in his demand hoping to obtain it at last by his importunity at last seeing his majesty inexorable he entreated him at least to impart his reason no doubt though the king who always goes upon good grounds had a very plausible reason but suspecting it might prove disobliging to the princess he desired in a smiling way to be excused from a thing he had resolved not to tell the duke who is always very pressing in what he undertakes observing that the king had only old him so in a smiling way importuned his majesty more than ever to know his reason his majesty to be freed from his importunity at last made him answer that because he was so very earnest he would tell him freely that he was always well pleased to see handsome women and the princess of montauban being none of the number he would not accustom his eyes to look upon her in effect she was very far from being handsome her face was marked with scars from her infancy she was hunchd backed but found the secret to conceal it in some measure by the help of steel bodies besides being somewhat advanced in years she was the more insupportable however being still as handsome in the dukes opinion as a great many other women whom his majesty honored with the same favor he still pleaded on her behalf he asked his majesty if she was not as handsome as such and such ladies whom he always carried along with him to the castle of marly the king fell a laughing when he saw his brother take it so patiently and left him to continue his discourse which tended only to persuade him that the ladies which he mentioned had no better title to such marks of distinction than she for whom he was pleading for he made him no other answer than what he told him at first  madam de montauban resolving to go to versailles at any rate and seeing all the dukes endeavors prove fruitless thought of a more plausible pretext she applied herself to the princess of harcourt who had the secret of obtaining a great many things when others met with a refusal five hundred crowns brought her project to bear and by these means she had the honor to go to marly an honor she had aspired to of a long time and which was like to have cost her her wits if she had not obtained it the king was well enough pleased with the grant he had made he found her very pleasant and good humored and this lady who never knew what t was to fast fridays or saturdays found it no difficulty to comply with what others did there in effect finding herself in a place where the king never allowed any one to eat flesh she out of love to his majesty or out of fear to displease him did what neither the love nor fear of god were ever capable to oblige her to do but every person there knowing her ordinary practice in that affair she thought it convenient to vindicate herself to those who were highly offended at the difference she made betwixt a mortal man and god but all she said had rather more gallantry in it than real apology she could say nothing but that the food there had a taste very different from the food of the rest of mankind that the beams of the sun of france created another kind of warmth than the ordinary sun insomuch that there was a certain happiness under his influence that was not to be found any where else  but this sort of discourse produced a quite different effect from what she expected for those who blamed her before condemned her much more now they thought it had been much more proper for her as no doubt it was to have avoided all manner of apology than to make use of that she made for as they maintained very well it was an adding of impiety to the scandal to attribute more power to a man than to god but she suffered them to go on being sure to have the wanton youths on her side for it is at court as at other places they divert themselves often with ridiculous trifles and  est and most pous are not always the most respected this appeared too evidently not long after in a difference she had with her husband he came to court alone while her entry was accompanied with a numerous train of all sorts of people showing by that means the respect they had for her hence she took occasion to insult over him as if his solitude had given him an aversion to innocent mirth but he replied so smartly home that she would gladly have dispensed with the severe compliment she obliged him to return they found what he said was somewhat extraordinary especially of one descended of a family that never had the reputation of being over witty for he was the son of the duke of montbason whom they had shut up in a convent for his giddy brain at least that was all the reason they gave for divesting him of his estate though in good earnest they would be obliged to build more bedlams than one if they meant to shut up all that are many degrees greater number sculls than he  debauchery was still in vogue amongst the women and consequently amongst the men ho the king omitted nothing that could be done to oblige all people to a just observance of their duty the italian comedians who had a dexterity of acting every thing happily took thence an occasion of introducing so many indecencies upon their stages that twas complained of to his majesty this displeased him the more that they published an advertisement of representing very soon a person of quality therefore his majesty expelled them out of the kingdom and for a long time he was indifferent as to the play and if at any time he ordered them to act before him it was rather to amuse the young people or through policy than for any pleasure he himself took in it in effect it is convenient to keep the  in action and some people allow even of a lesser evil to obviate a greater though i hardly believe that the gentlemen of port royal would be of that opinion were they consulted in it and amongst all the casuists we shall never find any reasonable pretense that can warrant us to commit any evil however his majesty had no sooner formed this resolution than he sent monsieur dargenson to shut up their theater accordingly he went immediately before they could have the least intelligence of the storm that threatened them and called a great many commissaries to attend him not that he feared any rebellion but in regard the king commanded him to go about it with the greatest solemnity for the scandal they had given being public the king would have their punishment to be the same besides he commanded to seal up all their seats he knew they had kept their manuscripts in them and therefore would make sure of all they had given advertisements of they were extremely surprised at this manner of usage and the more in that they had never dreamed of it they went all in a body to versailles to prostitute themselves at his majestys feet they represented to him how they were called before they came to france which was matter of fact for cardinal mazarin who himself was the greatest comedian in the universe and perhaps was afraid to forget a part he had acted all his days desired from time to time to see some new scenes to put him in mind of his trade upon this score they alleged that having left their country upon that invitation it was an injustice done to them at that time to turn em out of the nation but the king foreseeing what they aimed at prevented them saying he doubted not but it was to please cardinal mazarin they undertook that journey and if they pleased to own the truth they had no reason to repent of their trouble they came into france a foot and were in a condition to go out of it in a coach this reply gave them to understand that his majesty was displeased therefore they thought to make their application to some good patron to appease him but whether it was that every one was more ready to abandon them than protect them because they had spared no body upon their theater or that the courtiers were sensible the king had no inclination to show them any favor not one person was found to plead for them they were therefore obliged to look out for some other trade for their future subsistence and their theater continues shut up till this day  in the mean time the kings army in flanders laid seige to ath a place his majesty had given up to the spaniards by the treaty of nimiguen the count de rheux commanded within the town with a good garrison amongst whom were a great many french deserters who looking upon themselves lost if they came to be known desired to have the charge of the principal attacks in all appearance they would choose rather to be cut to pieces than to surrender but the count of rheux considering they might also deliver up the post in expectation of a pardon was so far from trusting or uniting them in one body as they desired that he dispersed them amongst the different regiments to avoid the present consequences he feared there were three marshals of france in that army namely the marshal of vlileroy the marshal of boufflers and the marshal of catinat but this last being beyond dispute the greatest of the three it was to him the king gave the direction of the siege villeroy and boufflers made head against the enemies army which was jointly commanded by king william and the duke of bavaria but if these two princes made any motion it was not to run any risque for they were sensible all their attempts would prove in vain the treaty of reswick was going on a pace and knowing very well that the king would be obliged to give up that place by the peace they did not think it convenient to sacrifice one man for its relief if they had no mind to venture a battle they might easily lay siege to dinant while marshal de catinat was busied at ath but then brussels that was bumbarded the year before was left exposed for villeroy and boufflers to besiege so that they could not conveniently quit their post besides they knew that ath was one of the places the plenipotentaries of france offered to give up to the allies it had been therefore very needless for them to throw away the lives of men upon that design since they were sure of having it without stroke of sword  these reasons obliged them to keep their stations or if they moved at any time it was only to find a camp where their troops could be supplied more conveniently with all necessaries by that means marshal de catinat found little difficulty in his enterprise the count de reux for his part was prepossessed as well as king william and the duke of bavaria with a design of husbanding his men it being his interest as well as the kings insomuch that there was hardly any shooting from the town nor was there ever a siege where the besieged made less noise the french were extremely astonished at it and the governor having surrendered said in a merry mode to the hostages who were sent to make the capitulation that it must be owned the french are very bad husbands considering how poor they were said to be for that they had lavished many thousand weight of powder before that place and yet he was ready to hold if they pleased five hundred pistoles to a penny that in less than four months time the spaniards would enter the place without being at the expense of one grain of powder these hostages were not ignorant of his meaning and could hardly avoid condemning their own folly they owned they were very much to blame to throw away so many lives upon a place without the least expectation of any advantage not that they had lost any person of consequence nor indeed so many common soldiers as was at first alleged but what they spoke was with regard to the insignificancy of that conquest for as few as they were it was still a greater loss than necessary since their blood ought to have been valued  the duke of vendome for his part besieged barcelona both by sea and land though he had acquainted his majesty that he was in no circumstances to do it yet being commanded by a supreme order he was obliged to undertake it against his inclination it was never known that any place was invested after such a manner for he had not troops enough to make the circumvallation so that the besieged had always opportunity to keep a communication with the vice roy of catalonia who took the field in order to relieve them the duke of vendome to supply his want of men took out of the kings ships that were before the town all who were able to carry arms this added somewhat to his force but not sufficiently to complete his circumvallation so that all the world believed he had engaged in an enterprise which would cerrainly cost him his honor in effect besides that the besieged could depart and enter the town at liberty they were so numerous that one would have thought it was rather an army than a garison they had eleven thousand men in the place and the queen of spain being in hopes of preserving it for her nephew recommended it in particulor to the prince of armstadt who next to the governor had the principal command he promised her majesty confidently to behave himself so as she should have no reason to be dissatisfied and to make good his promise there passed very few days without making some sallies which extremely retarded the advancing of the works they disputed every inch of ground with em and the world was ready to believe that as the arms of france had gained some reputation at the taking of ath their glory was like to be obscured by a far different event before this place and for an additional misfortune the news from poland gave them reason to suspect that the abbot of polignac had acted too precipitantly in declaring the prince of conti king for all the advices particular persons received from that country were so unfavourable that now they despaired of success  however their news from all hands made no mention of the duke of saxony and the emperor concealed his design as to that affair so closely that it was impossible to penetrate into it it was generally believed that prince james was the only rival the prince of conti had to fear and this was the common opinion in poand for not one dreamed of the duke of saxony but such as were in the plot nevertheless prince james was universally hated by great and small in regard of the king his father who ever since he had mounted the throne behaved himself toward his subjects rather as a particular interessed person than as a true sovereign for he had made open sale of all the favors with which the kings his predecessors had always used to gratify their subjects so that though these people were for many ages accustomed to choose noking in a strange family when their own royal family afforded one yet they had forgotten that custom so far in regard of him that they would rather have seen the meanest of themselves upon the throne than have chosen any of his issue they were extremely afraid that they following his example when advanced to the royal dignity would squeeze their subjects to the very marrow as he had always done  this general aversion raised the hopes of the abbot of polignac though he saw that a great many of the palatines would not declare for the prince this he attributed to their avarice and thought it was only out of a design of obliging him to give more money they were glad to find him of that opinion for while he continued ignorant of their conduct their affair was like to have the better success in fine this and the affair of barcelona were the two things that were most in view at france when the duke of vendome wrote to his majesty if he did not send him some succors he had reason to fear that his honor would certainly suffer in the enterprise in which he was engaged he gave the king a particular account of what had passed before the place that his majesty might be the more sensible of his straits so that the king having no more reason to doubt of his necessity caused all the troops he could draw out of languedoc and provence to march thher this fresh reinforcement wrought won though even then they nere not in a con to draw the line of circumvallation the  lost no time to attack the outworks which  battered for a long time with a great many  the soldiers behaved themselves with an  bravery and having made theselves masters of the covert way they afterward attacked the bastion which was taken and retaken twice a colonel of the irish named dillon who commanded one of these attacks had passed his time there very indifferently if he had not been well beloved by the regiment one of his soldiers who had deserted into the town came within four paces of him and having distinguished him from the others dillon said he mind that it is in my power to kill thee but i will not for thou never have done me any harm however because thou have by thee an officer who is a common hangman of the soldiers i will at least hinder him from doing any more mischief this said he shot him through the belly dead upon the spot this bastion having been thus disputed by both parties it fell at last into the hands of the duke of vendome who raised a battery upon it from which he thundered in such a manner into the town that he judged in all appearance the enemies would be obliged to surrender it in a short time he acquainted the king with these news and wrote to him that he hoped in five or six days to send chameraut to his majesty with an account of the places being surrendered every one was glad to hear this news with which his majesty was overjoyed this express was very acceptable and while they were impatient for the arrival of the other who was to complete his majestys satisfaction they admired mightily that good fortune that made him master of a place where there was not only a numerous garrison but where it was also impossible for his own army to shut up all the passages however from day to day they waited chamerauts arrival and expected him with the first post at last there arrived one who they believed came from that country because his haise was extremely dirty but no dirt comes thence for it is always dry there in regard it seldom or never rains in that country but the roads leading from thence being very deep and it having rained so much lately there was a sudden report in paris that an express was arrived with the news of barcelonas being taken however it was a pleasant sort of courier that came in that chaise namely a lusty sturgeon which they had caught in normandy and sent to the dauphin yet it was needless to tell the world so none was like to believe it being so prepossessed with chemerauts arrival this obliged a court lord to answer these faithless people who spoke to him after that manner that it was true the courier was arrived but had rencountred with a misfortune upon the road so that none could learn the particulars of the towns being taken from him that having met with assassins the postillion brought him dead in the chaise and that no doubt they had carried off his packet for having searched him they had found none about him this discourse gave occasion to another piece of news fully as true as the former for the report flying about very suddenly all paris believed the next day that chemeraut had been killed however the man was in excellent good health and so far from having any desire to die that he took all possible care of his person he was as fat and gross as four other men nor did he become so by feeding upon the air for he generally eat as much as other twelve men  after all these news proved only false alarms before the town was taken the viceroy was resolved to hazard a battle with the duke and for that purpose summoned together all those whom they call miquelets in that country and having joined them with his regular troops he approached to the duke of vendome it had been in vain for him to cut off their provisions by land they being supplied from the sea he had a more noble design than to amuse himself so meanly he meant to decide the affair all at once by a battle and to that purpose having called a council of war he resolved with his general officers to march the next day in the evening directly toward the duke he acquainted the governor of barcelona with his resolution to the end that at the same time he might make a vigorous sally upon the enemies and so attack them upon all sides in less than half an hour after the duke knew all the measures they had concerted against him and being thus put upon his guard he marched to meet him the night before he was to execute his design but the viceroy had already divided his army in two parts in order to attack him with the greater advantage this was made known to the duke who fell upon him with extraordinary fury notwithstanding the laurels the viceroy had promised to himself he was still in bed when they came to acquaint him that his guards lost ground they made no resistance at all but betook them to their heels and the duke had certainly taken the viceroy as was expected in bed if they had not awaked him of a sudden the noise he heard about his tent having surpised his attendants as well as himself made them believe that all was lost he excused his valet de chamber from his duty at that time and fearing he had no time to dress he made the best of his way naked as he was thinking the greatest thing he could do was to save himself the part of his army that was with him followed his example except a very few that put themselves upon the defense the duke made a great many prisoners the viceroys small trunk fell also into his hands with twenty tousand pistols in specie and the soldiers made a considerable booty all he wanted now to complete his victory was to know that the other detachment he had sent against him had met with the same fate and in a very little time he had that satisfaction he knew that mons dusson whom he had entrusted with that expedition had behaved himself gallantly and returned to join him with all the glory he could desire  the governor of barcelona was as much surprised as the prince darmstad when he heard these tidings the duke did not keep him long in the dark he sent to acquaint him with it that he might not continue any longer to make a fruitless defense but having still eight thousand men in garrison he thought it dishonorable to surrender to a prince who had not soldiers enough to invest the place entirely and therefore kept out some few days longer rather to fulfill the duty of a brave commander of which he had been always emulous than out of any hops of hindering the town from being taken  in effect in a very few days he caused a parley to be beat pretending to give up the town only and retire with his men into the castle which being situated upon a hill he could hold out for a considerable time but he delayed so long in surrendering that the duke refused to accept any other composition than to have the castle given up as well as the town the governor thought this condition very severe but as those who are conquered are commonly obliged to receive laws from the conqueror so he was fain to accept of it it was then that chemeraut appeared at court of a different size from a sturgeon he brought these good tidings to the king which pleased his majesty extremely who began to fear some reverse of fortune might have happened to the duke of vendome since he had sent his last express chemeraut had twenty thousand livers for his pains and a commission to act as marshal de camp his majesty being now freed from all his fears had more reason to be assured of the peace for besides that the conference at ryswick went on apace there were some other conferences upon the same subject betwixt the marshal of boufflers and the earl of portland after the loss of ath king william who knows how to make his advantage of every thing judging this earl in every degree as dexterous as the marshal thought it convenient to employ him upon that head by this means he meant to remove more speedily a great many difficulties that could not be so easily terminated in a longer time at ryswick in regard of the formalities the plenipotentaries were obliged to observe measures with one another portland sent a trumpeter as of his own accord to the marshal to ask a private interview with him without making any mention of his affair the marshal thought it convenient with the advice of the other two french marshals to consent to it and having agreed that they should meet by themselves and their guards should be of an equal number the earl proposed to him to remove some differences there that would require too long time at ryswick the marshal being unwilling to undertake any thing without express order from his majesty sent an express to know his will the great desire the king had to make peace made him approve of what the earl proposed without considering perhaps what advantage he might have over the marshal in a superior genius and the inconvenience of putting him upon a level with a marshal of france an honor his majesty ought not to look upon as indifferent it is true as the king of france had advanced boufflers from a cadet of picardy to the dignity of a duke marshal of france governor of the most considerable province of his kingdom and in fine of a knight of his order so king william had raised the other from an ordinary gentleman of guelderland to an earl and peer of england and knight of the order of the garter but still there was this difference that the one commanded an army and the other never did besides there was that also to be said that his most christian majesty had never owned king william and so the french esteemed only the earl as the favorite of a prince whom they had never recognized as king  king william was glad that his most christian majesty overlooked all those considerations not that he wanted to obtain a recognisance from him as well as from other crowned heads but because he knew well that the english were as passionately desirous of a peace as the french their commerce was then at a stand and which is very surprising the most christian king had been a gainer by what was reckoned his probable ruin after he had lost i do not know how many ships at la hogue and was rendered incapable of appearing at sea he had found his account in the way of piracy and had taken so many prizes both from the english and dutch that both of em were quite cast down it is inconceivable what an infinite number these prizes are said to amount to and though i have heard an account of it from one of the greatest traders in england who ought to know that affair as well as any body yet i shall be cautious of repeating it for fear i should be charged with credulity in effect the thing is so surprising that it astonishes one but after all if we consider that these two nations subsist only by their commerce and that the sea was continually covered with their vessels so that the french had an opportunity of attacking em every minute with an advantage especially when they were without convoys upon this consideration i say we may easily conceive how they came to sustain so great a loss but let it be as it will k william being sensible of the necessity of a peace in order to be free from such inconveniences ordered my lord portland to remove all the difficulties that might oppose it  in the mean time k james had but a sorry game to play pursuant to the kings promise of never making a peace till he were restored he had all along hoped that his majesty would effect his restoration sooner or later and this his expectation was screwed higher by the kings open declaration to all europe that he would make his promise good besides that this unhappy prince was turned out of his dominions only because he would not declare against the king he had been frequently solicited to oppose the kings interest before the prince of orange came into his place and had he done that no potentate whatsoever would ever have consented to his being disquieted nay to speak the truth twas a thing of too dangerous consequence for the potentates themselves but that prince having discovered his firm resolution to stand by the secret alliance he had made with the king all other princes combined against him because he would not join with them in reducing a power that seemed to threaten their repose this the most chistian king was very sensible of and did not fail to acknowledge it he did for him all that he could do and offered both him and his qeen a retreat and entertainment though he was engaged in a war with the greatest part of europe yet he gave him fifty thousand louis dors a year it is true this was but a small allowance for the king of england upon the comparison with what he had when he possessed his dominions but twas a great deal for a prince to give that was at the same time obliged to maintain four or five hundred thousand men to make head against the numerous enemies that his grandeur had raised against him and upon that score doubtless k james was obliged to him but after all twas not long of the king that he did not make good his promise the unfortunate prince had been always guilty of the same fault that his brother committed when he occasioned the loss of the battle of dunbar he caressed the scots in such a manner that he himself opposed his own restoration his chief minister was a scotchman and there having always been a great jealousy between the english and scots the preference he gave to the latter at his court alienated the hearts of the former this was the occasion that a great many enterprises formed on his behalf never took and forasmuch as that prince had much more devotion than brains as the french could not but lament his fate so they could not avoid saying that though he had sunk himself by his bad conduct yet twas not reasonable they should suffer themselves to be sucked in along with him in fine the king being much more obliged to his own kingdom than to any other could not avoid the giving him to know that many things he did were directly opposite to his interest nay all his true friends had told him the same thing upon several occasions insomuch that to satisfy the one and the other he pretended to disgrace my lord melfort brother to the chancellor of scotland this minister was hated not only at his masters court but even by the french who had attended k james in ireland these alleged that if it had not been for him things had gone otherwise in that country than they did nay some of em did not stand to charge him openly with keeping a correspondence with the enemies affirming that if it had not been so he had never made such opposition as he did against all that mr roses the most christian kings lieutenant general proffered to attempt in that country and in earnest if the digression were excusable i could easily make it out that that minister wanted either conduct or fidelity god forbid that i should affirm with others that he entertained a corespondence with k william but to overlook all these things and return to my subject all these circumstances obliged his most christian majesty to join with k william in removing the obstacles that might retard the peace the first conference between marshal boufflers and my lord portland was seconded quickly by several others they adjusted several things that the plenipotentaries at ryswick would not have agreed upon in a years time however at one of their interviews where several officers were present on both sides my lord portland hearing a discharge of cannon and muskets in the french army asked the marshal what the meaning of it was the marshal made answer that twas occasioned by the news the king had sent of the prince of contis election to the crown of poland this was matter of fact for abbot pignac had dispatched a courier to the court to acquaint the king that the prince was proclaimed king of poland by the cardinal primate and some palatines that sided with him but this intelligence included another part namely that the elector of saxony was likewise proclaimed king by the bishop of cujavia and all the partisans of the house of austria this ought at least probably to have prevented our making so much haste and upon that score my lord portland fell a laughing and told the marshal that indeed this spoke the french to be quicker than all other nations that they had formerly shown the same disposition upon many occasions and that in this affair they still continued to have the start of their allies but in the mean time the allies having time enough to testify their joy upon the advantages that accrud to em had resolved to stay till night or next morning before they gave a solemn proof of the joy they were filled with upon the news that the duke of saxony and not the prince of conty had mounted that throne  the marshal thought he banterd him in proposing a protestant for a dignity that could not be enjoyed but by a roman catholic had my lord made mention of prince james it had made another sort of impression upon him in fine my lord portland having a mind that he should not flatter himself any longer upon the imaginary success of the french party gave him a naked account of the matter upon this discovery the army that was celebrating the glory of the prince of conty with a full admiration of his valou were then mightily surpised however they were unwilling to believe it for that nation can never be persuaded of any thing that tends to their disadvantage whether it be that this is a common humor among other nations or that they in particular are presumptuous upon their own merit but what inflamed their suspicion the court who knew the bottom of things more than any body else was very silent upon the matter after the solemnity was over their design in the solemnity was only to persuade the people that their interest went well in poland and so to comfort em in some measure for the loss of the money they had sent thither the people were the more willing to show their congratulation that all of em had not only a respect but a love for the prince of conty nay they even adored him so true it is that a good reputation is able to produce mavelous effects in the minds of the people  i cannot tell what the princes own thoughts were or whether he believed the report of the reality of his election he made no discovery of his mind those who were accustomed to weigh things before they cdit em took the liberty to speak  mind some were of opinion that supposi  case had been as favorable as it was represented yet they could not make it bear without blows they were likewise sensible that the war they were obliged to undertake upon that account would be very disadvantageous to em they knew very well that the duke of saxony was a powerful prince and that his confederate princes had their troops conveniently posted that they could easily conduct em to poland without any danger whereas the troops to be sent from france would be obliged to imbark in some seaport of the french landers and land in the neighborhood of certain potentates whose affection to the prince of conty the king had some reason to doubt  the prince of conty perceiving he would be obliged to unsheath his sword if he meant to make good his election durst not display the affliction he was under upon the view of leaving a mistress that he loved as passionately as a crown his only aim was to please the king who pressed him to accept of that crown as well for his own interest as out of the love he bore him however such a degree of indifference was very odd in a prince of his courage and a nephew of the prince of conde one would have thought that he would have exerted his utmost efforts to mount the throne since his uncle upon a design of that nature had not only raised a civil war in his country but put himself at the head of the capital enemies of his king and country some days passed without any noise only the king saluted the prince and princess as king and queen of poland in like manner all the grandees paid em the respect suitable to that dignity and in order to give a color for his not departing to receive the crown twas given out that ambassadors were expected from poland to fetch him the more credulous sort of people satisfied themselves with this news but the more sensible part of mankind were more distrustful than ever of the validity of the election they owned indeed that to wait the arrival of ambassadors was a thing of more glory than to depart before their arrival but at the same time they alleged and that very justly that twas not expedient when a crown is not disputed and that the crown being promised to him he was so far from being tied to that  that he ought to set out with the utmost  and appear at the head of his party let for want of his presence many should be corrupted and drawn over to his enemy  frnce had not forgot that the occasion of the war they were then engaged in which in a manner threatened their very throne was their unseasonable difference with the pope and upon that view were sensible that though his holiness had not so much interest in this affair as in the former yet they ought not to neglect him in order to secure his favor they represented with the utmost application their suspicion of the elector of saxonys conversion indeed that was a very nice point and all men though never so partial were sensible that his declaring for the roman religion had more of ambition in it than devotion however the pope being unwilling that a protestant prince should sit upon that throne was so much against the elector that one would have thought he could never be for him besides the cardinalprimate sent a courier to assure him that the interest of the catholic religion was entirely ruined if he suffered the elector to be preferred to the prince of conty this message he was prompted to as well by his interest as by his zeal for the roman religion for the bishop of cujavia had incroachd upon the privileges of the archbishop of gnesne which justly claims the sole right of proclaiming the elected king  in the mean time there happened a quarrel between husband and wife in one of the principal families retaining to the court twas neither occasioned by jealousy nor the disproportion of tempers as such differences commonly are but by a very odd adventure when the one approved of a thing that the other did not we must know that a noble venetian not a member of the senate but one of the nobles of the terrafirma being married to a lady that he loved very tenderly had so much complaisance as to satisfy her curiosity by carrying her to see france but though the beauty of france draws so many strangers to visit it yet her design was only to have it said that she resembled the queen of sheba in coming so far to see the glory of solomon she had heard a thousand great things of the king and his reign and being fond of seeing with her eyes whether the reports were true or enlarged beyond the due extent she came on purpose along with her husband to versailles in order to make the discovery such an adventure as this was only wanting to complete the history of the king and those who are employed in writing it will take care not to forget it however the husband and his wife appearing of a sudden at court mr bontems governor of the castle had a mind to know who they were pursuant to the kings orders injoyning him to take notice of all the unknown faces that appeared there accordingly he caused to ask em who they were and what brought em there he was the more particular in his questions in that he heard their equipage was a true bohemian equipage and had served to amuse not only men of sense but even the very children when the question was asked em they were surpised for that such conduct was inconsistent with the liberty that reigns in their country but being informed that all unknown faces were treated the same way the noble venetian would needs go in person to acquaint mr bontems with the occasion of their voyage mr bontems was surpised to hear of his complaisance and having spoke of it to the king was ordered to bring em both to see him dine to recompense the charge they were at they were placed in the most convenient place for having a full view of the king i cannot tell what their thoughts were or whether they said what the queen of sheba said of solomon but all the courtiers being acquainted with their errand none of em used em so as one not long ago was by john bart one of the famousest pirates that the king had during the last war if it be lawful to give that title to a man that obeyed the kings orders pray god forbid that in using that expression i should mean to reflect upon the methods used by that prince for disturbing the repose of his enemies i am too sensible of the respect we ought to have for supreme powers to indulge my self in that liberty and i am likewise sensible that he having so many enemies upon him showed in that as in all other things the depth of his judgment  to return to my subject john bart having the curiosity as well as these foreigners to see the king dine there came a person dignified with a blue ribbon that finding he had a good place took it from him without being overawed by his mein which speaks him more a simple tarpallion than a commander of a squadron john bart had heard that some compliment was due to a blue ribbon however he took him by the coat upon which the badges of his knighthood were fixed and told him with a loud voice mr blue ribbon pray give me my place you see the king when you will but for me who does not see him but at the four festivals of the year it is but reasonable that i should not tamely suffer my self to be robbed of an advantage that i enjoy so seldom the king hearing that fell a laughing and told the gentleman with the blue ribbon that bart was in the right and that twas his pleasure that he should give bart his place and rather stand behind him than affront him in that manner upon that john bart being better known on board than at court the blueribbon spark turned about to view him and apprehending his mein to be much different from his reputation whispered to a duke that was just by him that if the noble venetian and his lady had received as little satisfaction from the sight of the king as he had from that of john bart they would be sure to grudge their money but that could not be for though the king is very much altered from what he was yet he still preserves his good mein insomuch that it is still visible that he has been a very graceful man  in fine they were far from meeting with what john bart did for every body knew they came too far not to have the opportunity of seeing the king but they had no sooner received satisfaction in that point than they returned to italy it is said they staid only three days at paris and that rather to rest themselves than to see the curiosities of the place this scene being acted in the face of the whole court and being the common subject of discourse the person of quality i pointed to above happening to talk of it to his lady a quarrel ensued after this manner the lady told her husband that if she were to wish for any thing in this world it should be this that she might have as complaisant a husband as that venetian lady he having undertaken a journey of almost  000 leagues on purpose to please her and by that means shown the greatest instances of a pliant temper that any man can ever show her husband replied that his conduct did not speak so much a flexible temper as folly and that for his part if he had a wife that would desire such a thing of him he would look on her as the greatest and most extravagant fool not only in paris but even in bedlam each of em maintained their sentiments with great warmth and the lady told him that it seemed he was not in the humor to satisfy her in case she desired to see the emperor or the king of spain the gentleman made answer that if ever that maggot took her he would not content himself with shutting her up in bedlam but would stifle her with his own hands as a madwoman perhaps he only said so to signify the aversion he had for these two princes who were the kings enemies but the lady putting a literal meaning upon the reply they came to high words and quarreled outright  this was the product of the complaisance that a noble venetian showed to his lady but in the mean while there happened an accident at court that was yet more surprising and that one day will perplex the historians though they are not very fond of sounding the truth of it there is a little town in provence called salon that formerly gave birth to nostradamus a man very well known at this day by his centuries some of which have come to pass in so convincing a manner that what was formerly obscure is now as clear as sunshine among these articles i reckon what relates to the death of charles i king of england and that of mr de cinqumares provided still that these were not foisted afterhand into his works but let that be as it will this town which produced a sort of a prophet in the preceding age has furnished us with one in this or at least such a character is given of a certain gentleman that appeared then at court of whom this is the history about that time the pretended ghost of that famous astrologer abovementioned appeared to a man of this city i know not whether it was by night or by day but this i know that the apparition put the man in a great fear and above all things advised him not to mention to any body what he spoke to him nay he did not except his wife and the man made a sign with his head importing that he would obey him for he was at that time speechless and fear had so much influence upon him that he could not open his mouth thereupon the apparition advised him to go to the intendant of provence and give him to know from him that he should give him letters to introduce him to the king it represented further that it would not tell him presently what he was to say before the king but that he would appear again to him when he should come near to versailles and there teach him his lesson  upon that the apparition disappeared and left him for dead so much was the man frightened by his wonders as well as by his dismal aspect after some time the man came to himself but so as that twas plain he had something extraordinary in his head his wife asked him what it was but the prohibition laid upon him by the apparition kept him from discovering any thing for some time at last his wife having used a thousand wheedles to make him reveal his mind he opened his mouth i know not how often in order to recount the adventure and shut it as often again by reason that the apparition had backed the prohibition with such threats as scared him he told his wife that he should dye if ever he broke silence upon the matter and the fear that this should come to pass stiffed his words when he was most tempted to speak  his wifes curiosity was inflamed by his reservdness she pressed him more than ever to reveal the secret the husband replied that his life depended upon it and that he could not do it but that word screwed up her curiosity to the last degree in fine she would not let him be easy till he made the discovery and the poor man being foolishly fond of her had no sooner acquainted her with the apparition and the discourse that passed than he fell down quite dead upon the spot upon this the woman was as much astonished as he was when the ghost appeared to him but after second thoughts she construed the discourses he uttered before his death to be only the effect of a brain disturbed by a mortal sickness and told nothing of the matter or if she did twas with such an air as if she had taken his discovery for the ravings of a distemperd brain  this accident made no great noise in salon or the adjacent places which certainly it would if it had been fully known nay the people there did dot so much as mind it for every one as well as his we believed that the mans brais were ut of order when he talked of his vision but at the some time the vision appeared to another inhabitent of the same city and made him the same compliment and he was as foolish as the other fr he spoke of it that same day to the curate and his indiscretion was followed by the same ate for he did upon the spot the noise of his death and the manner of it being spread abroad the people recalled to their memory what was said upon the death of the other this was the only subject of discourse all ver salon and for  0 leagues round it nay every body took the liberty to comment upon it but in the mean time the vision appeared to a blacksmith whose house was not far from those of the two men i spoke of but now it is possible he was as much afraid as the other two but their example being recent and of too great consequence to suffer him to be guilty of the same fault he was very attentive to the words uttered by the ghost and immediately upon its disappearance went to the intendant pursuant to its orders that magistrate gave audience every day to all that had any business with him so that the smith had no occasion for any one to introduce him but his story being such as could not well be told publicly he begged of him that he would retire with him to his closet because he had an affair of extreme consequence to imprt the intendant seeing that the man made ut a sorry appearance could not conjecture wh this important affair might be but being obliged to hear every one and to neglect nothing relating to his post he desired him to stay a little till he had given audience to the rest after which he would hear him at his leisure accordingly after the general audience was over he and the smith retired to his closet  then the blacksmith acquainted him that the affair he was about to open would at first view seem to be a pure whim and that he knew he would be dismissed for a fool that to prevent such apprehensions he told him so much beforehand and in fourteen days time he would send to see for him being then sensible of his error in treating him as a man troubled with maggots in fine he set forth the occasion of his coming thither namely that a vision having appeared a month ago to two different persons that certainly he had heard of upon the account of the fatal consequences had likewise appeared to him very lately that it had ordered him to come to the intendant to desire he might be sent to the king that it had promised to appear again to him at versailles or near to it in order to instruct him in what he was to say to his majesty that accordingly he came to discharge his commission faithfully and upon that score was not afraid of meeting with the same fate that befell the other two  the intendant had heard something of this odd adventure but had always taken it for a fabulous fiction and pursuant to that thought checked the man in a strange manner he asked him if that was his way to abuse an intendants time every minute of which he knew to be precious and at the same time gave him to know that he deserved nothing but a goal the man replied that his threats made no impression upon him for that the vision had sufficiently prepared him that he would return home since the intendant ordered him so to do and that he would only have the trouble of returning when the intendant should send for him  though the intendant used him at this rate yet he had a deep impression of what he said his talking so sensibly and so unlike a distempered head was sufficient to suggest some reflection to the intendant especially if we join to this the former reports of that apparition in effect the marshal was no sooner gone but the intendant wrote to the lieutenant general of salon praying him to acquaint him whether the reports of that apparition were true or false but to prevent the communication of retractible things he ordered him to draw up a formal information in case he found any credit due to the reports that were spread abroad at the same time he desired a character of the man that had been with him for he had taken down his name at first and wanted to know whether he was always reckoned a man of sense such as he appeared to be he likewise ordered him to enquire whether there ever were any of his family either by the father or motherside that were rattle brained for if any such had been found out by chance he had not failed to infer from thence that he imitated their example and by consequence that no stress was to be laid upon what he said  the lieutenant obeyed this letter punctually he drew up an information and sent it to the intendant by which he saw that all the reports of the apparition and its consequences were true and that the marshal was always reputed a man of good sense the lieutenant likewise gve an account of his family which contained  thing that could hinder the intendant to  the court with the affair accordingly he wrote of it to the marquis of barbesieux secretary of state but he did it in such a way as signified that he only looked upon the man as a madman for he did not only set forth his own incredulity upon the matter but the measures he had taken to prevent his being imposed upon and sent him the information he had caused to be taken at salon by this he meand and justly indeed to justify that if there was any imposition in the matter he was not the first author of it his plea was that the magistrate of salon being upon the place ought to know the matter of fact best upon which he concluded that if he was deceived the fault ought not to lie upon him he thought himself obliged in a particular manner to season his letter with a great many circumstances to clear himself from too much credulity in that ministers opinion for that the marquis being very young must be less credulous than other people he knew that at such an age as he was of such things are hardly credited and that even the apparition of samuel would meet with no faith from them if it were not spoke of in the books that cannot be called in question without sacrilege but the marquis was more credulous than one would have thought he writ him an answer probably after speaking of it to the king importing that he might send him the man but so as not to give any ground for charging either the one or the other with any weakness  the intendant receiving this order enjoined the lieutenant general of salon to send him the man upon the pretense of answering to the information he had made pursuant to his order accordingly the blacksmith waited upon him and told him at first meeting that he had said before twould not be long before he sent for him again the intendant made answer that he did not send for him upon the design he thought of but to reprimand him for meaning to impose upon him by this representation he thought to turn the tables upon him in order to satisfy the marquiss caution but the man knowing that he was guilty of nothing that could merit a reprimand the conference ended in this that the intendant gave him to know that if he were as much persuaded of the fact as he would have him believe he would be so far from hindering him to go to vsailles that he would give him introductoryletters to the marquis of barbesieux and to facilitate his journey would give him a place in the first recruitconvoy that was to go that way the man did not care which way he went so he could but satisfy the desire of the vision and accordingly agreed to what was proposed there was a company of recruits just ready to be gone which an officer of the town of  had raised and which were to pass near paris the intendant recommended the blacksmith to him and gave him some money to give him when he pard from him that officer carried him to erte under jnarre after having wrote to the intendant in obedience to his command that he could  nothing in the man but what becme a wie man for the intendant had desired him to observe him narrowly upon the road to the end that if he discovered any turn of thought in him he might acquaint the marquis o barbesieux with it  the blacksmith being thus arrived at ert took leave o the officer and repaird to versailles where he did not knew what to ay because the ghost had not yet appeard to him but the very night that he arrived while he was in great perplexity he heard as he says one undraw his curtain while he was full awake upon that the ghost appeared to him bid him fea nothing and gave him to know that both the secretary of state and the king would give him a wellcome reception notwithstanding the difficulties he met with at first being thus instructed in what he was to say both to the marquis and the king he was at the same time strictly charged never to divulge what was then told him to any body excepting his majesty the ghost acquainted him that the marquis of barbesieux would endeavor by all means to pump the secret out of him but that he was to conceal it from him as well as from every body else for if he failed in that piece of obedience he should infallibly meet with the same fate as befell the two men in his town  the ghost disappeared immediately and the blacksmith having no great inclination to sleep longer went in the morning to wait upon the marquis of barbesieux and delivered him the intendants letter the marquis immediately called him to his closet where they both continued for above an hour the report of the blacksmiths ensuing arrival had been spread all over the court before he came for upon his departure from provence letters were sent to town and he was every where styled the prophet forasmuch as no body doubted but that he was going to prophecy something to the king and had undertook that journey only for that end in the mean time every body was mightily desirous to know what the matter was and there being always some that pretend to refine upon things beyond their neighbors a report was spread abroad that he had been put upon at the same rate as james clement in former times though not in order to commit such a detestable action as he did but to acquaint his majesty under so fair a covert a great many things that could not otherwise reach his ears i do not speak this as if i believed it for i know very well that these are only pleasant whims familiar to those who for want of business employ their whole time in commenting upon whatever happens  however according to the ghosts prediction the marquis of barbesieux endeavored to work the secret out of the blacksmith but the smith replied that all his efforts upon that score would be fruitless in regard he had a lesson prescribed to him which he was obliged to observe under the pain of being punished upon the spot but to show that his advances were not chimerical he might give his majesty to know that the last time he hunted at fontainbleau he was suddenly surpised with an apparition which put him into a great astonishment that the same ghost which appeared to him had at that time appeared to his majesty and that his horse had seen it and started aside as if he would have thrown him that the apparition did not continue above a moment which occasioned his majestys apprehension of being mistaken and his speaking of it to no body and that all this happened to his majesty only in order to procure him access to the king by showing that he knew what none else in his dominions was acquainted with upon these reasons he hoped his majesty would make no difficulty in giving him audience  the marquis of barbesieux was much surpised at the hearing of such a circumstance as that which would quickly discover whether there was any thing supernatural in this mans pretensions or whether he was an impostor and in earnest if the king confirmed the matter of fact undoubtedly he must have known something beyond a natural capacity the marquis acquainted the king with his arrival and with the story he told and all he had said being as it is alleged found true the king granted him a private audience what passed in this interview nobody can tell because twas kept as a profound secret all we know is that the pretended prophet having stayed some days at court while few knew that he had the honor to speak with the king his majesty agreed that he should come and take leave of him publicly when he took coach to go a hunting the duke of duas captain of the lifeguard no sooner saw him but he told the king that if he had not ordered him to admit such a fellow to approach his person he had been far from doing it because he was certainly a fool or else his majesty was much put upon a great many others about court were of his mind for people are not easily convinced of such things as these but the king took his part and gave the captain to know that he was out in his judgment and that he had more sense than he thought for  this expression was evidence that he had told the king some very odd things for otherwise the king would never have given himself the trouble to make such declaration of his thoughts it awaked the curiosity of all mankind and everybody would have given any thing to know the result of his conference with his majesty and barbesieux the marquiss friends pumped him upon the matter but he told em frankly that twas in vain in regard there was something in the matter that challenged his secrecy the vulgar people who are naturally very credulous fancied that his business with the king was to preach up the suppression of the imposts that necessity had obliged him to lay upon em in the time of so cruel a war the prophet having taken leave of the king returned to his own country and the marquis of barbesieux having given him money at his arrival and ordered him to converse with no body repeated his bounty to him when he went so that the prophet spoke nothing of the matter to anybody while he was there and indeed he could not well do it if he would for he was always kept within view  such an extraordinary adventure as this did not fail to make a great deal of noise all over paris and even the whole kingdom but notwithstanding that the appearance of prodigies ought to make people reflect upon their duty yet i do not find that this made any reformation of manners debauchery continued still to reign among men and women and the exemplary piety of the king and part of the court had no effect upon the libertine spirits his majesty who ever since his application to devotion has made it his business to extirpate vice not only out of those about his person but even those who live at a distance held at that time a council of conscience at which the archbishop of paris and some other prelates with father de la chase his confessor were called to assist in that assembly several methods were proposed for preventing the usual disorders among the officers and soldiers the archbishop of paris being a very zlous man cried up his majestys pious intention and gave the rest to understand that they ought to join all their force in bringing it to bear for this purpose twas proposed that a missionary should be sent to each regiment in order to preach to em and catechize em every day but it being answered that missionaries would scarce be ound to undertake the office by reason of their necessary residence with the regiments another motion was made and agreed to i know not indeed whether it has yet produced the desired effect but what is not yet done may be done here after and that time will discover the motion was that none should be employed as almoners of regiments but those who are persons of pious and good lives and who have men of merit to vouch for em and that at the conclusion of every campaign they should be obliged to repair to the seminaries and continue there all winter to speak the truth i must say this is an effectual scheme for having no almoners but such as are quite different from what they now are but i question if they will find any that will submit to that sort of life most people put in for those places only to divert themselves and as soon as they find what constraint is meand em they will rather desert than submit to it probably that is the reason that the thing is not yet put in execution and perhaps never will  while measures were concerting for the introducing of such excellent discipline among the troops one of these almoners being imprisoned by the kings order in one of the hospitals for the poor made a strange end after a very odd life he was a recollet by trade but being uneasy under the confinement of a convent he procured a dismission under the pretense of serving in this employment which by intrigues and the interest of friends he had obtained he had continued in that office some time and as those who are once in any measure corrupted do quickly become more corrupt in an army so he formed a design to render himself so necessary at court by a false accusation that he might be in a capacity to throw off his habit which he r with as much uneasiness as formerly he did the confinement of the cloister he had his eye upon one abbot agnan who of a friar had made himself a chemist physician he had a strong mind to follow his example not in practicing physic which he did not understand but in wearing the habit of a secular priest instead of that of a religious one his plea was that since they had allowed that abbot to dispense with his vows upon the pretense of some cures he might obtain the same favor by some signal service upon that view he repaired to the marquis of chateauneuf secretary of state who managed the affairs of religion and privately acquainted him that an officer of the regiment to which he was almoner had a design upon the kings life he knew that that officer was obliged to go off then or next morning to some foreign country as well as a great many others who would not change their religion nay he had counseled him so to do and promised to come and see him though he meand nothing less  the marquis of chateauneuf who is in many things the least of all the four secretaries of state if it be lawful to call any thing little that is about so great a prince sent orders immediately to arrest the officer and commanded the recollet to continue at court in the mean time the officer was gone which the recollet knew very well however the marquis being informed of his departure told the recollet he was come too late and that the bird was flown three days before the recollet made answer that that was none of his fault and that he could not do the business sooner that after all he believed he was only gone to languedoc his native country where he would be sure to keep close and that in regard he told him most of his haunts he believed he could unkennel him if the marquis would sent him to that country the marquis continued still to believe what he said and accordingly he send him to languedoc where the recollet arrived very speedily with the money he had got for the charge of the journey he had a permission upon his going out of paris to put on a gentlemans habit but at last having drilled on the affair as long as he could the minister of state not offering to encourage him any longer he returned to this city where he was informed that the marquis designed to take him up the marquis begun to see through his knavety and would not suffer himself to be imposed upon any longer the recollet came to know this piece of news very luckily it fel out by chance that in the very inn at which he alighted there was one of the cousins of the person he had accused to whom mr de chateauneuf had communicated his thoughts now this relation had told mr dechateauneuf that his cousin was indeed a true protestant but he could be surety that he was not capable of the thought he was charged with at the same time he had wrote to his cousin to know the truth of the thing upon which the officer receiving such information wrote himself to mr de chateauneuf setting forth that he was ready to return to france to clear himself of the accusation if the king would grant him a passport and assurance that he should not be troubled upon the score of his retiring to a foreign counntry contrary to his prohibition  this letter was but just received and the relation having been at versailles that day told all the people about the inn the whole story as a piece of acceptable news but the recollet was wiser than to discover what hand he had in the matter upon that he dropped his design of going to wait upon mr chateauneuf and took up at another inn under a different name from what he had before nay further he bought such a cross as the knights of malta wear and put a white feather in his hat and went by the title of mr le chevalier the people of the first inn  seeing him next day were surpised for that  had told them nothing of his going but  the officers kinsman had never suspected him if the recollet had not said at table that he came from languedoc for somebody telling him so much happened by way of jest to say that perhaps he was the man he had been speaking of and for that reason had deserted the inn upon this the kinsman returned next day to versailles to know what sort of a man the recollet was mr chateauneufs description agreeing exactly with what he had seen he acquainted the minister with what passed at table and with the suspicion that he grounded thereupon immediately the secretary gave such express orders for searching all the inns in paris that the recollet could scarce escape for the excellent orders we have in this city with reference to all strangers whether in inns or private lodgings are so admirably well calculated that it is no great difficulty to make a narrow enquiry all the landlords being obliged to give an account who are their lodgers and when they arrived the commissary of the ward where the pretended knight lodged was informed by the innkeeper that he had got a new guest thereupon the commissary observing the time of his arrival to jump with that of the suspected persons he informed himself of his features and so took him up so that his pretended knighthood was not sufficient to keep him incognito presently he was conveyed either to the bastile or vincennes where he endeavored to make his escape but being prevented and being at the same time guilty of a horrid piece of sacrilege he was indicted according to his demerit the recollets interceeded for him to prevent the mortification of its being said in the world that one of their society was either hanged or burnt the king graciously granted their request and exchanged the sentence of death for that of perpetual imprisonment so he was put into the hospital i spoke of but now but he was no sooner got in than he made a new conspiracy with the other russians to make their escape now this could scarce be effected without killing him that brought em their victuals but that being not the first crime they had all been guilty of they mutually agreed that they should not stand to do it in effect they committed the murder and having made their escape fled to the palais royal where they had an acquaintance by whom they expected to be entertained but their acquaintance abhorring the crime they had committed and knowing they had broke the prison to which they had been committed by the kings orders refused to receive em thus they were obliged to look out for another hiding place but the goalkeeper being already at their heels they were quickly retaken and tried the poor recollet by virtue of the interest of his order was only condemned to the galleys but god not contented with this punishment which was infinitely short of his demerit did so order it that the gang offering to revolt against their keepers about fifteen or twenty leagues from paris these shot upon em and killed the wretched recollet such was his end and the king having notice of it was the more forward in reforming the almoners of the army for that he knew twas in that capacity that he first began to signalize himself by debauchery and corruptness  in the mean time we received the news of the king of swedens death which gave the potentates that desired a peace some occasion to fear some obstacle or delay but though his successor was very young and twas to be feared that a great many turmoils might fall out in that kingdom during his minority yet his fathers will was so well ordered that it put all to rights his son was declared to be major or of age before the usual term in sweden in order to discourage those who meand to disturb the state at the same time the young kings grandmother being declared his guardian by her sons will took upon her the administration of the government the late king had nominated some counselors to assist her among the rest the count of bielke a zealous favourer of the house of austria who had been formerly ambassador at the court of france and was disobliged there however it being feared that he might endeavor to disturb our game perhaps as much out of private resentment as any intention to serve the crown of spain count davaux the most christian kings ambassador in that country had orders to have a watchful eye upon his conduct i know not whether it was the bad offices done him by count davaux or his being guilty of several unwarrantable practices when he was governor of pomeren that brought him quickly to be disgraced but in fine he perceiving that he was like to sink under the power of his enemies wrote to one of his nephews in france to entreat his majesty to forget what was past and grant him the honor of his protection immediately upon the receipt of the letter his nephew spoke of it to the king and the counts hopes were not frustrated for the king allowed him to come to france pursuant to his request but the letter by which his nephew gave him this advice being intercepted by some of his enemies he was taken up  at that time mr lasun had only two occupations namely pleading and gaming but as he grew old fortune which only serves youth became as unfavourable to him as it had formerly been kind twas computed that in the space of three or four months he lost above sixty thousand pistols it is certain he lost a great deal but it being known that sixty thousand pistols in the gascogne way of speaking does not amount to above five or six thousand others concluded that his loss might terminate there he was likewise cast in a lawsuit against madam fremont and her son and was more cast down upon that than upon his loss at game for he still hoped to regain the latter but the judgment against him excluded all hopes of relief besides he was troubled that he had made such a noise about it both at court and in the city without better success all his friends endeavored to comfort him and to speak the truth they were not much dissatisfied with the rub he met with because they hoped it would facilitate his accommodation with marshal de lorges and his lady but stiffness is so natural to old people that their hopes vanished in smoke he was a turbulent sort of a man all his lifetime insomuch that he oftentimes thwarted the king and he would not then disclaim that quality though indeed twas none of the best the judgment pronounced against him related only to the question whether he was to plead before the court of aids or that of requests now being remitted to the last which was the thing he only wanted to avoid he resolved to plead his cause there though he should meet with the same success that happened to him in ireland though after all i know not what reason he had to fear any such thing for he showed by his carriage before them that he feared k william uch less than them  however he was not the only courtier that loved to be litigious the p of epinois followed his example very close he commenced a suit before the council against the prince of bournonville for the succession to the vicounty of gand to which they were equally related the case had been already decided by the parliament of rouan in favor of the prince of bournonville but great lords are more liable to the pursuit of ill causes than others because their intendants and agents want only to have em engaged to a disadvantage that they may fish in troubled waters his true friends gave him to know that they feared he would he cast before the council as well as before the parliament upon this he redoubled his solicitations hoping by his intrigues and diligence to gain what he was apprehensive of losing in the court of justice the two princesses his wife and his mother took care likewise to make use of their friends his wife endeavored to persuade em that she desired nothing but justice hoping to blind em by their respect for her quality but the mother was less presumptuous whether twas that she thought she was no longer to be considered as a princess having the reputation of being married to a lawyer or that she was sensible of the weakness of her sons cause accordingly she confined her hopes to the interest of her pretended husband the p of bournonville for his part was not asleep being sensible that he had to do with a strong party but twould be a great folly in judges to have more regard to interest than justice and all that the prince depinois and his whole family could do could not prevent his being fined and obliged to pay the costs indeed the debate lasted above five hours because some of the judges had a mind to oblige em  the countess of grignan being then at paris went to see the duchess of orleans at st cloud who had dislocated her arm by a fall from her horse at hunting but she was so ill received that she did not care to go again for a long time that princess came to that house after her arm had been set by a country surgeon that performed his office not amiss but being still much pained she was so angry at the countesss saying to her that she came to congratulate the dispelling of her illness that she was very near kicking her out of her presence the princess who seldom disguises nature checked her so severely that the countess upon her return to paris made it known to all her friends and the duke of orleans came to hear of it his royal highness told his lady that she was in the wrong but she was so incapable of listening to reason in the case she was in that there was a necessity of waiting till she was well before she could be convinced of an error in having used that lady at sueh a rate  the month of august came on soon after and the jesuits in pursuance of their usual custom had a tragedy acted in their college of louis le grand so it is now called the names of the the college of clermont or of jesus being quite sunk the passion that the good fathers had for insinuating themselves in the kings favor made them prefer flattery to gratitude they have forgot that their founders obliged them to put their name upon the gate and have put up another in its place which indeed is infinitely greater and more illustrious than clermonts but at the same time did not want panegyrists enough besides them to transmit it with honor to posterity so that the world did not pardon such an action for they had no sooner taken down the name of jesus from above their great gate than two latin verses were published which are well enough known in the world but there being several that have not seen them twill not be altogether improper to insert them here and to preserve the memory of them if it were capable to be lost they are as follows sustulit hinc jesum posuitque insignia regis impia genes alium non habt illa deum   the meaning of these verses is that this society in which impiety reigns took down the name of jesus and put up the kings arms and so never recognized any other god than the kings of the earth i am very far from saying that this is a truth nay i should rather affirm that piety reigns among em instead of impiety but considering that they have many enemies we must not be surprised if they have recourse to some imposture or other when the smallest faults they can be guilty of are charged upon em with reproach however monsieur being invited to the abovementioned tragedy he and the whole court honored it with their presence upon which father jai who has a great genius for that sort of representation complimented him on the behalf of the rector of that college setting forth that if the performance pleased him all the honor of it was due to him the good father made a long tedious speech screwing in several panegyricks upon the late duke of s agnan who was not only a great lover of acting but so good an actor that upon occasion he acted all the different parts one after another having spoke all that he had to say he took leave and went to cause the representation to be begun but when every one was pricking up his ears that they might not lose one word of the performance this mighty inventer fell out with his fiddlers insomuch that instead of playing they put up their instruments and offered to go away father jai being touched with the affront they thus put upon him preached to em and catechized em in order to make em alter their resolution but after he had thus acted the part of a preacher a trade that in the mean time he knew nothing of he at last came to threaten em with his arms where his greater excellency lay he gave the musicians to know that the least they could expect was to have their instruments broke over their heads but all this did not soften them they still insisted on their resolution to be gone so that the poor father was forced to have recourse to monsieur to make em comply accordingly monsieur interposed his authority and the musicians did for him what they refused to do for the father then the tragedy was begun but its end was much of a piece with the prelude for several people quarelld and were so warm that they stood in need of monsieurs authority to restrain em however the matter was accommodated without monsieurs intervention and the king who loves to be informed of all that passes in paris or versailles no sooner had an account of the adventures at this tragedy but he said a word of monsieur that sounded well enough he turned to some lords that were laughing at this adventure and said the court had been long a sufferer by the less of the duke of s agnan but thank god monsieur was about to repair their loss in effect this duke was all his lifelong a judge among the musicians of paris he was so far from thinking that office to be beneath his quality that on the other hand he thought nothing more proper for him pleading that the players on the violin not only contributed to gallantry but were in a manner the necessary instruments to carry it on and thinking that himself exceeded all other men in gallantry he upon that score laid claim to the government of them entitling himself to a preference to all others  the bishop of orleans did not keep his anger long whether it was that he was sensible of his error in being angry or that he was not apt to continue a resentment long he returned to paris whither he brought his nephew but his nephew who would not sacrifice his hopes of a bishopric to the love he had for his uncle renewed his addresses to father de la chaise and to the king at that time several bishoprics were vacant and among others the bishopric of mentz which is none of the most inconsiderable sees in the kingdom for besides that the bishop of that place is at the same time prince of the empire and has a right to put the sword as well as the mitre in his arms like the ecclesiastic electors the bishop of munster and several other princes his incomes amount to almost  0000 livres a year the eldest brother of the late duke of feuillade had succeeded to it when the duke of verneuil who had enjoyed it from his youth married duke sullis widow the abbot of coaslin scarce made any pretensions to it in consideration of what had passed but the king who commonly takes pleasure in granting unexpected favors bestowed that dignity upon him to the great astonishment of all france and even of his own family this entirely put an end to what chagrin the bishop of orleans retained upon the score of the bank however his majesty who never does a favor by halves observing that neither this new prelate nor his family were in a condition to raise the  0000 crowns that he was obliged to send to rome for his bulls his majesty i say taking this into consideration entreated the pope by a letter under his own hand to let this prelate have his bulls gratis if the king had gratified him with this rich benefice five or six months later than he did he might have saved himself the trouble of writing to rome for the bishop of orleans was made cardinal before that time and the cardinals nephews never pay for their bulls that being a privilege among many others that is tacked to the purple the pope did not deny his majesty so small a request so that the new bishop receiving his bulls gratis was suddenly capable to keep his fathers coach from being seizd again since our parents are the first poor that we ought to relieve and since his father wanted his assistance twas his duty to begin with him in the dispensation of his wealth  the tuilleries are the place of rendezvous for all the persons of quality of fortune in paris and at present it is a custom among the ladies as well as the gentlemen to keep footmen from    to  0 years of age and commonly at the gates and doors there stands such a numerous quantity of footmen as upon occasion would make a recruit of   or  000 men now these gentlemen lacquies having the daily opportunity of seeing the freaks and intrigues of their mistrisses and having no great reason to entertain a very good opinion of em one may know the history of each lady by hearing their conferences at that time one of these comical fellows said to his fellow servants that if they would give him a bottle of wine he would lift up the coats of the first lady that came out they readily agreed to give that reward for such a nice piece of diversion in the mean time mademoiselle d armagnac and the marchioness de villequier came out together and the footman probably not knowing who they were offered to perform upon them the insolence he had promised the ladies surpised with the unaccountable brutality cried out for help and stopped the footman themselves several persons of quality alighting from their coaches assisted them to prevent the fellows making his escape upon this he was imprisoned some judges were for putting him to death to scare those of his kidney from such lewdness but others thought the pillory and the galleys a sufficient punishment for what he had done and thus he was only ordered to go and serve the king in the galleys though to speak the truth his insolence deserved another sort of usage however that wretched sort of cattle entertained the public very often with scenes of this nature which were still worse when they wore swords every day they were guilty of some insolence or other and there was a great deal of reason for forbidding em the use of swords the occasion of that prohibition was the father of monsieur tilladet whom they killed and so stopped the course of his fortune which perhaps would have gone further than that of his children because he had married the sister of the late monsieur le tellier it is true he was not always in good terms with him that minister whose projects bore a proportion to his fortune pretended to marry his sister better than to a little gentleman of gascony but young ladies often marry without their friends consent and she particularly disposed of her self without consulting him upon the matter this was the occasion of their misunderstanding but as time sinks all differences so his brotherinlaw and he were good friends when that accident happened  at that time the duchess of feuillade died and her death was not much regreated by her husband who if we believe the common report lived so indifferently with her that he never enjoyed her but though he did not lament her loss all that knew her did for she was a very amiable lady and never gave any occasion to talk of her besides she was very young being not above  0 years of age but there are some invincible antipathies and it is plain the duke was not of a temper suitable to her since he did not respect what all the world pronounced lovely it seems he likewise despised her alliance though to speak the truth there were a great many of as good families as his at least who would willingly have married ladies that had not so much to boast of as she for if it is true that a family is rendered illustrious by the past or present possession of great places we shall scarce find one in the kingdom at least retaining to the law that could equal this it produced six or seven secretaries of state and at present boasts of three this lady was the daughter of the marquess of chateauneuf who indeed is but a little secretary of state in comparison with the other three but as there are no little saints in paradise because god who is infinitely great communicates somewhat of himself to those who have served him faithfully so there is no such thing as a little secretary of state under the greatest king in christendom  mean while marshal boufflers and my lord portland having removed a great many difficulties by their conferences the king in concert with the emperor proposed to keep strasbourg and to give up to his imperial majesty that part of brisack that lies beyond the rhine the city of strasbourg did not belong to the emperor and by right it ought to have returned to the inhabitants who were proprietors of it before the king had it this innovation did not please the princes of the empire especially those situated on this side the rhine or just by the other but great princes do not much mind little ones when their own interest is in the case and upon that foot the consent of the king of england was enough to make it bear it is alleged that that prince consented to it only upon the hopes that his satisfying the king of france in a thing that he desired so passionately would move his most christian majesty to give him another recompense that he on the other side was as eager to obtain he did not like king jamess continuing at st germains thinking that place to lie too near versailles and upon a parallel case cromwell who was not short of him in politics used all his interest in his time to oblige his majesty to remove from his court not only the late king charles who after his fathers misfortune had fled to paris but likewise the queen his mother accordingly he obtaind his end with reference to king charles and even the duke of york his brother who had likewise fled thither but as to the queen he could never gain his point there notwithstanding that he wheedled cardinal mazarin with the proposal of a marriage between his own son and one of the cardinals nieces for that princess made a vigorous opposition against this ministers proposal of her removal from the court of france and would never consent to it notwithstanding the great advantages accruing to her upon that condition particularly a large pension from england  my lord portland gave the marshal some hint of his masters design with a good address the marshal who is not so much a statesman as a good servant to the king had nevertheless sense enough upon this occasion to give him some hopes of succeeding without going too far however people being always apt to flatter themselves my lord was persuaded that the king could not refuse what king william desired after the condescension in the affair of strasbourg and nothing was thought of upon both sides but the execution of what these two ministers should agree upon the princes of the empire were still displeased they could not forbear complaining that the article relating to strasbourg was contrary to the preliminaries of the peace they knew very well that the first thing demanded of monsieur cailleres before the commencement of the conferences with him was the restitution of lorrain strasbourg and luxembourg the emperors ministers answered to this that the kings conquest of barcelona had changed the face of affairs that he demanded an equivalent and that considering how things stood twas well for them that he was contented with so little they were glad they had this pretense to cover the advantage accruing to their master by that new proposal in fine they saw very well that after all europe had drained it self in carrying on the war the house of austria were the only gainers by it but the princes of the empire who did not approve of these reasons could not comply so easily with the proposal they solicited the emperor and the mediators to get that clause altered that seemed to be so disadvantageous to them his imperial majesty did not mind them for that in granting their request he should have acted contrary to his own interest the mediators gave no other excuse but that all europe stood equally in need of a peace and that the cession of all on this side of the rhine and stipulating a restitution of all on the other side was the best expedient both to put a speedy end to the present war and to prevent a future rupture  neither their answer nor that of the emperors gave em any satisfaction they fansyd the mediators were influenced by france at least they persuaded themselves that if the late king of sweden had been still alive he would never have tamely suffered things to pass so being thus prepossessed with the apprehension of the great prejudice accruing to them from the peace they did not comply very early while the respective parties were busid in managing their several pretensions the affairs of poland were brought to that confusion that twas thought they would never be adjusted without a civil war the cardinal primate sent a courier to france to know what was the reason that the prince of conti did not come to take the crown upon his head he represented that his interest suffered mightily by his apparent indifferency in lying quiet at pars or the court at a time when poland was in a combustion out of respect and love to him that the duke of saxony was not wanting in reaping a mighty advantage by it that he debauch d those of his party upon the plea that twould be folly to adhere any longer to a prince that deserted em in that manner that his presence in poland was desired beyond expression and that on the other hand the duke of saxony was so hated that upon the princes arrival every body would side with him out of spite to the other  the abbot of polignac gave the court to know as much by every courier he sent at last the king having called a council upon the matter resolved that the prince of conti should go immediately to that country and in regard he could not expect a good reception without carrying money with him his majesty gave him bills of exchange for  000000 besides  0000 louisdores for petty occasions the peace was then not made and twas possible it might fail by reason of the interest of the princes of the empire who still opposed it with great warmth and resolution upon this account twas questioned by many how the prince should get with safety into poland to go there incognito was at once dishonorable and dangerous and to do it by open force was impossible the enemies fleet being at sea which all the power of france could not cope with but notwithstanding the strength of their fleet the kng fitted out squadrons every day which not only got off clear but were continually annoying them by taking prizes and accordingly a squadron was ordered to transport the prince john bart having taken upon him to conduct the prince took care to make the squadron ready by orders from court twas fitted out at dunkirk and the allies having notice of it sent    ships to that road to hinder any thing to go in or come out this obstacle did not amuse john bart though another would have been much perplexed with it it is not known how the enemy had such an early intelligence of the design for the king kept it so secret that no body in france knew of it till within two days before the time of his departure however it seems it came by spies of which they had a great many every where especially at the seaports  but that trade was more hazardous than barts expedition though at the same time it was attended by a great deal of danger for one of these spy was taken up not long before in the same place where this squadron was fitted out and considering the risque he run it is not imaginable how little he got by it one couture a pariscouncellor a man of little practice and a narrow fortune being inveigled by a woman that either had debauched him or had been debauched by him went a strowling up and down the country with her there he tried several trades that did not agree very well with the bar but being bred to harangue and declaim he at last listed himself among a company of strowling actors which after a great many turnings and windings brought him to the french flanders there he acted his parts and coming afterward to dunkirk met there with a man that having known him at paris represented to him the scandalousness of his employment the counselloractor made answer that twas easy to talk of things but when a man had nothing he was obliged to do what he could thereupon his friend gave him to know that if he would trust him he would find him a better trade in which he might earn his bread with less labor the counselor being not oversatisfied with the trade he was then in took him at his word upon which his friend said they behooved to drink together before he could speak farther upon the matter having carried him to a tavern he acquainted him over a glass that he had several relations in holland who were great traders and were every day annoyed with the prizes made by the french ships that they would willingly give  000 livers a year to any man that would engage to give em timely notice what ships are fitting out from dunkirk and st maloes that if he would find a friend to reside in one of these places while himself continued in the other he would see that sum paid him and that there was no great difficulty or labor in the performance of what was desired it is possible he likewise set forth to him that in undertaking that office he would do a charitable action by preserving so many honest men from ruin however the counselor accepted the offer and settled one martin for his subdelegate at st maloes allowing him  00 livres a year himself continued at dunkirk waiting till he could find out another deputy for the same price that so he might go to paris and there enjoy the remaining  000 livres of his pension accordingly he found one in a little time but his other deputy mr martin being a man of no great head and his office requiring an infinity of sense and precaution he was soon suspected by the inhabitants of st maloes though he colored his residence in that place with a pretense of some small commerce and trade that he had taken up only for a feint yet they observing his diligence and curiosity in going every day to the haven to see what was done there immediately gave the court notice of him the court sent orders to have a watchful eye upon him at last their suspicion being still inflamed by his conduct they stopped his letters at the post house which were addressed to couture at one madam clercs in paris at the same time letters were sent to couture from his other correspondent at dunkirk both these were opened and afterward sealed so artificially that he could not discover it they observed that both the correspondents made mention of some naval preparations at these two places and were very particular in their accounts after that twas found that the use he made of their intelligence was to convey the same to holland this being sufficient evidence they were all three taken up poor s martin fearing to be broken on the wheel or at least hanged would not stay till he was examined but threw himself headlong over a rock upon which he was imprisoned coutures mother having married a councilbarrister for her second husband had so much interest at court as to get her sons punishment converted into perpetual imprisonment by which means the dunkirkdeputy got off at the same rate and so there was an end of the story  to return it is very probable the enemy discovered monsieur barts design by some such means however the  ships coming before dunkirk watched night and day for fear the man that had already tricked em so often should boast once more of playing them a new trick the day before the princes departure the king was two hours with him in private in the castle of marli and there being no witnesses of what past between em we can only make conjectures about it what can we imagine it to be unless we say that his majesty who is so well versed in the art of government gave him lessons how to behave upon his arrival in the kindgdom he was called to in case the subjects should prove as affectionate as they were represented to be as well as in case they should prove otherwise which the prince was very apprehensive of for all their intelligence from poland by any other hands than the cardinal primate and the abbot of polignac gave a contrary account of things to what these two ministers did all the merchants letters from dantzick and the other neighboring places spoke of nothing but of the great number of creatures retaining to the duke of saxny the letters that came to the marchioness of bethunes spoke to the same purpose but when any body asked her what they contained she spoke as dubiously as she could leaving them to guess more than she had a mind to tell those who were quicksighted knew the cause of her silence but they made no use of it knowing that one is never thanked for telling disagreeable news  all this did not hider the prince to set out he took with him no persons of note or distinction unless you put the chevaliers de lausun and sillri in that rank but the one being as poor as a rat let his family be what it will and the other being a cadet as well as he and one whose family has nothing but a chancellor for its greatest ornament i thought i might dispense with the giving em that title the latter assumed the name of count silleri at his departure either because he hoped the prince of conti whose domestic he was would raise him to a great fortune now he was called to a throne or because having declared his marriage with the daughter of an auditor of the accounts that brought him some money he had a mind to leave her a more honorable title than that of a chevaliers lady the eve before the princes departure he received the visits of all the court who came to take leave of him at night he supped with the prince of conde his fatherinlaw and his whole family after which a great many tears were shed as if they should never see him again perhaps they knew that he could not set that crown upon his head without coming to the point of the sword and consequently that he had many dangers to go through and in earnest that consideration is more than sufficient to alarm those who are concerned for a person so that if tears be allowable upon any occasion they are upon this the princess of conti appeared to be less moved than the rest or at least if she shed any tears they were not so bitter as they might have been though there was no body that was so nearly concerned for the prince as her self yet she thought it her duty to behave her self so as to seem worthy of the great fortune to which she aspired not that she did not love the prince very tenderly but besides this her ambition and the desire of being a queen that had so great a place in her soul she was not ill pleas d to see the prince go from court she knew too well that he was amorous to a foolish degree and fed her self with the hopes that the removal of his mistress from his eyes would unhinge his affection for her  the prince rid post to dunkirk his equipage being sent before with all possible expedition the coffer which contained the  0000 pistols that the king gave him happened to be broke underneath and the purse in which they were being turned upside down a great many of em were dropped about two are three leagues from paris by chance twas upon a market day that they were lost and the gonnesse bakers having found em no sooner understood whose they were than they delivered em up for one of the princes pages had come back to know if any body had found em it is alleged that the prince had purposely left   or  00 pistols out of the bag and put them in that sorry coffer in order to leave with those that found em an eternal memorial of his departure from france it is true he is likely enough to do such a thing for he is as generous a prince as any about the court and for that reason twas said of him that if he showed himself to be of the house of conde by his bravery he would not do it by his generosity he took nothing to himself and twas such a prince as he that the poles wanted in order to sink the memory of the avarice of their late king or rather to make em sensible how advantageous his earlier arrival at the throne had been to them for he would never have sold a palatinate or any other place his humor was too much a stranger to the sordid measures of their late king or at least if ever he should take up with them he must needs be very much altered bart had prepar d every thing for putting to sea and scarce allowed the prince a few hours sleep till he weighed anchor with a fair wind he passed by his enemies without being perceived and steered on his course without any opposition for they knew nothing of his passing till twas too late to pursue him  all the northern princes were mightily concerned about the transactions in poland for all of em had affairs to adjust with that crown however the king of denmark did not act up to the measures of the rest who earnestly desired that the duke of saxony should be preferred to this prince for he would never grant audience to a minister that the duke sent to solicit him to hinder the prince to enter the baltic he put him off with trifling amusements till the prince had past the sundt and then gave audience to the envoy after which he waited with patience and tranquillity till god should decide an affair of that consequence as he pleased some indeed allege that he offered underhand some ships to the prince of conti and that the prince only thanked him for his good will because he thought he had no occasion for em and that the success of his expedition depended rather upon the affection and good will of the poles than upon any succors he could receive from any other hand but the king his master after all the prince arrived before dantzick being encouraged to hope that the inhabitants of that city would open their gates to him this city was to him as twere the key of poland especially if he should be obliged to dispute his title to that crown upon the point of the sword twas by that place only that he could expect succors from france since these could not come otherwise than by sea but instead of answering his expectation the citizens sent deputies to entreat him not to come ashore in their territories by reason that in the present state of affairs they could not declare either for him or the duke of saxony without exposing themselves to great hazards the prince of conti did not construe their words literally but as he ought to have done he presently perceived that their words insinuated all the enmity to him that could be and that they had only disguised their real sentiments for fear of displeasing the king whose power they were too well acquainted with to draw it upon their own heads at the same time some french merchants that were settled there came on board his ship to offer him their service in what their power could reach and assured him that his sentiments of the matter were very just nay they gave him to know that the city had entered into a strict alliance with the duke of saxony by the mediation of the elector of brandenburg who had set it on foot as soon as he received advice of his election that if they might freely disclose their thoughts to him they would not advise him to go ashore any where without a strong french army to guard his person that they knew not what reports might have been spread abroad to persuade his highness to come so far but they were afraid he would only have the trouble of returning without effecting any thing that the poles who were formerly friends to the french began to take up the same passion against them that other nations had that the glory of the king had struck them with fear as well as the others that they were made to believe that the king aspired to an universal monarchy and that the fear of becoming his subjects scared them from preferring a prince of his blood to their throne  though these merchants had not given this account to the prince he had quickly found it out himself instead of that crowd of new subjects that the cardinal primate had made him to expect before his departure from france there came scarce any one to visit him on board most of those that came were only moved so to do by their curiosity so that excepting a very small number that offered to pay him the usual honors of sovereignty and treated him as king there was no body that did any thing like it but he would never suffer either these or his own retinue to do it for fear his reign should be shortlived he gave them to know that he was not so overfond of a crown as to purchase it at the expense of his honor that he only came thither in compliance with the cardinal primates request to succor their nation which as he alleged the duke of saxony meand to oppress by a boundless ambition that the cardinal had promised to draw together an army out of hand to enable him to satisfy his desire that when he should have done what he pretended to in serving them he would not then declin he title of their defender but as for that of king he would never accept of it till things were upon another foot than what they were at that time and indeed they could not be upon a worse foot than they were with reference to him the duke of saxony after his being proclaimed king by his own party had not only possessed himself of the city and castle of cracow but likewise of that of warsaw where the kings of poland used to reside he had got himself crowned in one of these two places partly by force and partly by good will while the cardinal primate protested equally against his coronation and his election  the prince of conti finding that the duke was thus master of the heart of the country and that dantzick was but too partial to him used all his efforts to gain the governor of mariembourg a place that was not far distant from the place where he was could he have mastered that and been succored by his party he would have made it a place of arms the governor of that place made as if he listened to his proposal in order to make him speak french but the prince being not in a humor to do it without seeing further into affairs gave him only conditional promises upon which the governor who had not yet made up matters with the duke of saxony endeavored to do it though without acquainting him that he did it because he could have no security from his rival the generals of the army of the crown and that of lithuania came likewise to feel the prince of contis pulse and to try if they could finger his bills of exchange they had hitherto pretended to entertain a correspondence with the abbot of polignac upon the magnificent promises he had made em that ambassador thought he might promise any thing so as to secure this crown without observing that he had to do with people as cunning as himself and even engaged underhand to the duke of saxony from whom they expected to draw more considerable sums than from him the prince of conti had no mind to bid so high as the ambassador because lying is not the character of a prince as it is of those ministers who commonly think the direct contrary of what they speak accordingly he replied that he was obliged to them for the tender of their service but if they pretended to be paid beforehand he willingly dispensed with it that he was ready to bargain with them about what he should give em provided they made his election good but if they meand only to take his money and afterward to excuse themselves upon the plea of the impossibility of making good their promises he would choose rather to keep his money than expose himself to future repentance for giving it away to no purpose these generals or rather their deputies hearing him speak in this fashion perceived quickly that he was too longheaded for them and having dropped all designs of pulling a feather from him did underhand advise the duke of saxony to endeavor by all possible means to seize upon his person to bring this about instead of declaring openly for the duke they made their address to the cardinal primate as if they had been troubled to quit an interest that they were joined to by inclination the cardinal suffered himself to be amused for some time by glittering hopes and even fed the prince with them he endeavored to persuade him that he would speedily send him an army capable to reduce the duke of saxony which should oblige the prince to wait the execution of his promises notwithstanding the inconveniences he strugled with upon the sea  this affair was so long in dependence that the peace after dwindling for some months was concluded before it came to be determined the princes of the empire were forced to submit to the pleasure of stronger powers the french recognisd the prince of orange as king of england and that prince coming then to the hague the plenipotentiaries of france began to pay him the honor and respect that was due to the dignity they had acknowledged to be his however it happened that monsieur harlai being accustomed to call him by another name than that of king used his wonted expression in a conference where he was present but being at the same time sensible of his fault he made the best reparation he could madam harlai the chancellors daughter having gone to meet her husband in holland and having the curiosity to see that prince whom all the french have a particular esteem for notwithstanding the harm he has done em this lady i say employed some body to desire audience of him in some place or other the new king would not give it her at his own apartments but sent her word to be at the princess of vaudemonts at a certain hour madam harlai had all the reason in the world to be satisfied with his civility and courtesy as for monsieur harlai he to act the part of a good courtier acquainted my lord albemarle his british majestys new favorite who began then to have as great an ascendant in the kings affection as ever my lord portland had he acquainted him i say that he desired his masters picture my lord albemarle promised to give it him but withal entreated him to have patience for some time because his master was upon his return to england and he was afraid he could not spare the time to let it be drawn whether that lord forgot his promise or whether the king of britain was so taken up with affairs of consequence that my lord could not have the opportunity of making good his promise whatever was in it four or five months passed and monsieur harlai had resolved not to think of it farther when he received information at paris that my lords trumpeter staid in his hall to speak with him at first he could not conjecture what should bring him so far from home for he was far from thinking that his master should have called to mind his request after letting so much time slip without sending to him but after all he found that his errand was to bring him the picture my lord had caused a magnificent frame to be made for it at paris because that sort of work is better done there than in england the trumpeter took care to let him know so much to show what pains his master took to content him monsieur harlai thought this an odd way of conveying a picture but foreigners have their peculiar customs as we have ours and so he was even obliged to take the complement together with the charges he gave the trumpeter a handsome present and that being all that this messenger wanted he returned forthwith to his own country  of all the kings plenipotentiaries at ryswick monsieur harlai as it is alleged bore the least figure as to sense but he bore the greatest on another score i mean his quality and the first places of the robe which for a long time have been filled by his ancestors upon this account he had had the whole or at least the greatest part of the honor of the treaty if the people had found any thing in it to their advantage but twas so far from that that all persons regreted secretly and even publicly all the restitutions that the king obliged himself to in that treaty as much as if they had been to part with their own estates it must be owned that this fancy was in some measure foolish for besides that his majesty knew a great deal better than they what was convenient for him and his kingdom according to all the measures of good sense they ought to have desired nothing more than an end of the war in order to prevent their being exposed to the evils they must of necessity undergo as long as it should continue but as people do not always act conformably to reason so they made with reluctance the very fireworks that they were commanded to make pursuant to the usual custom upon all such occasions insomuch that the commissaries of the wards were obliged to back their injunctions with the penalty of a large fine and without that they would never have agreed to it however even that did not scare em from censuring all that had been concluded upon to this purpose they handed about a pretty pleasant story which shewd how little they were satisfied with monsieur harlai that magistrate had a son that was as foppish as his father was grave for in earnest the father resembled the two courtiers of whom monsieur de la feuillade said that when his majesty had a mind to drink his liquor cool his cupbearers needed only to cool the bottles by placing em between these two this son i say was so far from resembling his father that he had always acted up to the character i here give him he was at ryswick when the affairs of that negotiation were brought to a conclusion but neither the solemnity of the place nor his fathers character could make him wiser than usually however monsieur harlai having sent him to the king with the news of the signing of the treaty he stayd so long by the way that the news were known at court thirty hours before his arrival this slowness did not become a young man especially one of so much fire who used always to walk like lightning upon which account the world was amused with it but at last they began to say that they ought not to think it strange since for certain the father was confounded with the son that it was the son that had made the treaty as appeared from his impatience in signing it notwithstanding the prejudice it did to the king and the state and that twas the father who brought the news to court which was equally manifest from the tediousness he showed upon the road for fear of wounding his gravity the principal foundation of this raillery was that the spaniards were so mortified by the taking of barcelona that they sought for a peace at any rate and that whatever proposal the french plenipotentiaries should have made after an action of that importance the spaniards would have agreed to it and consented that the king should retain luxemburg as an equivalent for that place if the plenipotentiaries had been so wise as to take the advantage of the consternation they were in  though the people by this conduct seemed to control the kings actions yet his majesty was not ill pleased to find em of that mind for as it was a mark of their folly so it showed their concern for his majestys interest whatever was in it they scarce had the sense to observe that neither monsieur harlai nor any of his colleagues had done any thing without the kings orders but we must not pretend that that sort of cattle are ever governed by reason capricio and humor is the ordinary standard and rule of their thoughts in effect those who but two months before cried out for a peace with all the passion imaginable had no sooner got it but they wished the war had continued their reason was this instead of lessening the prices of things which had been very dear for some time by reason of the preceding bad seasons they saw the markets still rising besides that the wrath of god was seen in the barrenness of the earth we may attribute this affliction to another cause occasioned by the war the king had been obliged to recoin the money twice that it might serve instead of an edict indeed he had got considerably by this project for he raised the louisdors to    livres and the silver crowns to   livres    sous though the one was not commonly worth above    livres and the other three now the king for some politic considerations keeping up the denomination of the money it came to pass that what they used to have at easy rates from foreign countries proved very dear by reason of the loss of the exchange which was a full sixth part  the prince of conti did not trouble his head with these matters he thought upon nothing but either seeing the effect of the cardinal primates promises or returning to see his mistress his eminence had retired to the castle of cowits where his partisans assembled several times to no purpose many of em complained that abbot polignac had fed em with the hopes of things that were not like to be put in execution he had gone so far as to promise that they should not want either the money or the troops of france for that being the only affair that he minded he wished that the king in like manner might have nothing else to mind the duke of saxony finding that they began to complain of that minister causd a body of german troops to enter the country this put those who were most exposed into a consternation and some of em making some advances toward the making of their peace with the duke the prince no sooner received the news but he resolved to return to france but at the same time to make the city of dantzick repent of their giving his rival the preference he ordered bart to seize some of their ships that lay just by him they had anchored in the road with a design to sail up to the port with their cargoes but bart obliging them to follow him carried em to copenhagen where the prince was forced to put in by stress of weather at the same time the king stopped all the dantzick ships in his harbors which makes it probable that the prince of contis orders to bart did not come so much from himself as from the king the prince who had been very uneasy in his voyage was more so when he came to copenhagen notwithstanding that the king of denmark showed a particular esteem for his person he set a part a great number of houses for the prince and his retinue and the wind continuing contrary for some days that little time seemed so long to that prince that i doubt if the six years that according to the english historians one of their kings spent in ireland before he could find a favorable minute to return to london i doubt i say whether these six years were longer to that king than those few days were to the prince the occasion of his uneasiness was that he was still in love and that all the comfort he had was to wait for the postdays that he might hear from the party he loved  the dantzickers made what reprisals they could they arrested the french merchants at dantzick and seized their effects but after all they knew very well that twas not proper for them to quarrel with a king that the greatest part of the forces of europe had in vain attempted to bring down and upon that view they had recourse to the king of denmarks mediation to procure the releasing of their ships the king made em stay some time before he granted their request but at last believing that the mortification he had given em was sufficient to make em remember it he accommodated the matter to their satisfaction abbot polignac was astonished at the princes return and the conduct of a great many who after siding with his party began to desert him at the same time notice was given to him from the duke of saxony that he ought to retire with expedition out of the country or if he did not that he could not answer for the security of his person the abbot did not think it his duty to wait for a second message but set out incognito without any retinue and ordered his equipage to make toward the sea in order to imbarque there as well as himself but they were robbed before they could reach the ships that stayed for em the abbot did not know whether the court which had given him no orders for his retreat would be pleased with it and therefore he stayed some time at hamburg to know the orders of the court he wrote to the marquess of torcy secretary of state for foreign affairs but received no answer and having complained of this to his friends in that country their answer was not very satisfactory they told him that the court was very angry with him and that the cardinal primae did not cease to do him disservices in earnest his eminence wrote a great many things to france to his prejudice he even insinuated that he had applied to his own use part of the money sent him on the prince of contis behalf it is believed that this accusation was false and that twas only the cardinals chagrin upon seeing himself abandoned that made him speak in that fashion it is true the abbot was poor and that some time before he was reduced to such straits that his family would have wanted the necessaries of life if he had not found friends to assist him the cardinal who knew his straits and likewise knew that some time after he had paid his debts probably grounded his charge upon that circumstance but let it be as it will though a man be never so innocent it is a great misfortune to lie under an accusation the court sent him orders to retire to an abbey he had in normandy whether it was that they credited the accusation or which is more likely that they meand to make him answerable for the event  the duke of saxony having thus unhinged his competitor thought he wanted nothing to complete his good fortune but the popes favor as soon as he was proclaimed king he had sent an envoy to solicit his holiness to favor his interest but as that court moves but slowly especially when there is any thing of religion in the case so his holiness would not grant audience to the envoy till he was fully assured that that duke had abjured lutheranism a certificate of the abjuration was brought to him but he suspected it mightily it came only from the hands of a bishop of his family who might be suspected to be gained by that prince because their common grandeur was concerned upon that occasion the duke having never entertained any correspondence with that court was not thoroughly versed in their politics and was so far from seeing through the true spring of his holinesss motions that he imagined the pope to be in the prince of contis interest accordingly as soon as the prince returned to france he sent a second envoy to the pope to represent to his holiness that he needed not to continue any longer in the interest of a prince who by his retreat had given sufficient evidence that he had dropped his pretensions to the crown in the mean time the pope was far from being biased that way had he been obliged to side with one or the other he had not scrupled to fall in with the duke he was an italian i e no great friend to frenchmen besides he was by birth a subject of the king of spain which quality did not allow him to depart from the sentiments of the house of austria however being head of the catholic church and upon that score obliged to observe measures on all hands he sent orders to his nuncio at cologn to go for that country he ordered him under the pretense of promoting the interest of religion to reconcile the cardinal primate and the duke the cardinal showed all along a violent resolution to raise a civil war rather than be without satisfaction for the affront offered him by the bishop of cujavia by crowning the duke he alleged and justly indeed that the right of coronation was lodged in the church of gnesne of which he was archbishop the pope had another nuncio already upon the spot who of his own head did not fail to anticipate the orders given to this for he knew very well that whatever he did for the interest of the house of austria would be approved by his holiness and accordingly had privately embarked in the dukes party  some time being spent in all these transactions the year came to an end which was the time alloted by his majesty for the conclusion of the marriage of the duke of burgundy to the princess of savoy every day he liked the proposal better and better and the young princess had such a winning way that he loved her as tenderly as if she had been his own daughter the duke was but weak for one of his age insomuch that though the ceremony was to be performed out of hand yet he was not to enjoy her till he passed    years and she    in former times when the marquess of louvois married his eldest daughter to the duke of rocheguyon the son of the duke of rochefoucaut the consummation of the marriage was not put so long off but the relations on both sides made a mutual compact that the newmarried couple should not see one another but once a week namely on thursdays and that they should live in celibacy without any mutual commerce for the rest of the week this made em always long for the arrival of the appointed day of meeting and inspired em with a mutual eagerness and if all married persons were confined to the some measures perhaps they would not be so soon weary of one another as we commonly find em however the king having regulated the matter as above preparations were made for celebrating the marriage which were expensive to an unparalled degree nay his majesty intimated that he would take it well if every body would act up to his abiity in honoring the festival twas not the literal performance of this desire that would have satisfied his majesty if that had only been required the nuptial ceremonies would have been a very mean thing for the charge of the war and of the taxes that still continued during its whole course had so impoverished the subjects that they could scarce be poorer than they were so that all the courtiers and even the military officers that happened to be then at court put another construction upon the matter they knew where the kings meaning lay and all of em being ready to do any thing to please his majesty straightened themselves to obtain that end the charge they were at was altogether extraordinary nay some of em bought clothes that were worth more money than the intrinsic value of their estates i do not speak by way of amplificacation but deliver a naked truth witness a great many land and seaofficers who laid out   or  00 crowns for one suit of clothes though at the same time a great part of em were not worth  0 crowrs a year of patrimonial estate herein lies the folly of the french and though i am a frenchman my self and perhaps as great a fool as others yet i cannot abstain from censuring our common folly  after the conclusion of the peace there was so great a confluence of foreigners at paris that in the suburbs of s germains only there was about    or  000 this multitude made the lodgings so excessive dear in that place that the houses which were let at   00 livres during the war were raised now to 00 crowns in a short time the numbe of these foreigners increased to above one half insomuch that in a little time after or about the beginning of the succeeding year they were computed to   000 in that very suburbs and as they had been informed that during the war france had not only been exhausted of men but also of treasure this being a report spread abroad on purpose to amuse them and make them believe that france would be very glad to truckle to the will of her enemies they were extremely surprised to find at their arrival every thing in a different disposition to what they were made believe while at home they saw that great town did not only abound in people as much as ever but that luxury and pleasue were arrived to such a degree in it that the meanest citizen was more splendid than the persons o quality in their country in effect the greater the miseies were in private families the more they endeavourd to blind the world with sumptuous appearances however these measures served only to augment em besides it must be owned that the most part of the women used this luxury at the expense o their honor few or none of them but had her gallant and none of these gallants was esteemd but in proportion to what he lavishd upon hi mistess as the war had raisd a vast number of people who applyd themselves to business by which they gamd a great deal of money so having come very easily by it they as freely lavished it a great many who had formerly been glad to have got shoes to their bare feet did now bestow coaches on their misses insomuch that in   or   years time the number of coaches was increased to above  000 gold and azure were to be seen in every family which extremely surprised these strangers who before their arrival had heard that all paris could not afford either silverspoon or fork and that the king had pillaged them of all to support the expenses of the war it is certain that the war had impoverished a great many but such were to be seen rather in the country than in paris on the contrary paris had never been either so rich or so magnificent there being   0000000 millions expended in it only by the parties that were formed there since the war without reckoning what others might have gained by a thousand different ways for while some got infinitely by the partisans in lending them money upon extravagant interest others applied themselves to the way of victualling or to some other thing so that it might be justly alleged as war had ruined some it had raised others so prodigiously that they were no more to be known for the same persons so different were they now from what they had been formerly there was such an infinite number of sharpers and such like scoundrels who had raised themselves from the very scum of the people to vast riches by sucking the blood of the poor people this was reckoned so good a trade that even some marquisses applied themselves to it thus you might have seen one embrace this trade without regarding what was said either of his own relations or his wifes who was either granddaughter or sister to a high president as for himself there was one of his name a lieutenant general in the kings army but as there is a difference betwixt relations the lieutenant general behaved like a man of quality and merit while he acted like a wretched miscreant or at least like one who thought it no crime to dishonor his name and family if the strangers abovementioned were amazed to find every thing at paris so different from the relation they had of em at home they were much more astonished to see the solemnity of the marriage of the duke of burgundy and the princess at versailles the ceremony was performed with all the splendour imaginable they gave a great many balls where all the persons of quality retaining to the court of both sexes were present all the ladies were clothed in black velvet set out with precious stones that cast the brightest luster imaginable the men were also adorned with diamonds as on such occasions the pickpockets of paris are very intentive upon their business so they came in whole swarms to keep holy day at versailles adorned as others were and abating for their countenances that are hardly well known in that place one would have thought they were all persons of the first rank the extraordinary crowd as one may easily imagine afforded them sufficient opportunity to make up with considerable advantage the expense of their ornaments a great many after their return home found at their leisure that the diamonds they had carried to the solemnity were gone the rogues had taken from some one from others two and so more or less and they might repute themselves happy who came off free even the duchess of burgundy did not escape the common fate of those who had suffered by these pickpockets they ventured to cut away a part of her gown where she had a large buckle of diamonds but what is surprising the chevalier of sully had the same fate and what he lost was by the hand of a person of the first quality he caught him in the fact and took the liberty to tell it to one of his friends his majesty overheard it and desired to be further informed of the matter but was extremely astonished when they whispered to him the name of this young pickpocket he forbid to challenge him upon it being willing to save his honor for the respect he had for his relations however his charity served to no purpose for not only all the court knew the secret but also all paris  upon the marriageday the new married couple were put to bed but the curtains being undrawn there were a great many witnesses of their actions only in order to see if they lay close to one another the king to give them a sufficient opportunity caused draw the curtains while the duke of beauvilliers and the other officers of the young prince stood just by to overhear what might pass but nothing having passed they soon undrew the curtains that young princess kept assemblies the same day and the following days her court was very throng and the ladies strove who should show her most respect there happened a difference betwixt the princess of harourt and the young duchess of sully daughter to the duke of coaislin she was niece to the duchesss lude lady of honor to the princess this relation came by her husband who was the duchess or brothers son she wanted her assistance in regard of her youth not being in condition to enter the lists with a princess whose only business had been since she was in the world to ingratiate her self with all in power from the highest to the lowest minister but instead of the assistance she expected from her the aunt advised her to yield to her adversary all the duchesses were highly incensed against the duchess of lude finding she had tarnishd their honor by so scandalous an advice in effect though such sort of disputes had often fallen out not only betwixt the princesses and the duchesses but even betwixt their husbands yet perhaps such another as this had never fallen out before the dukes and duchesses had always maintained their rank as if st louis had begot them the late duke of montauzier and the late duchess of nlles stretched the affair yet further the one against monsieur le grand a prince of the house of lorrain and the other against the duchess of bouillon though the duchess of noailles was only the daughter of a farmer of the revenues yet she was sensible that in france nobility came not by the wives but by the husbands she sheltered her self from any indignity by the character of her husband whom she took to be beyond reproach however it ordinarily falls out in a difference betwixt two parties that they upbraid one another even to the five hundredth generation the duchess of bouillon produced records by which she made it appear that anthony of noailles had been formerly master of the household to one of her husbands ancestors in fine this affair enraged the parties to that degree that they called one another all the ill names they could think on his majesty was at last obliged to impose silence by his authority he forbad them expressly to proceed farther without deciding any thing in the matter that caused their heats i do not know if the duchess of lude was afraid of these ill names in doing what she had done or if she thought because the king had given the preference to the dukes before the princes of the house of lorrain the last time he made a promotion of knights of the order that therefore it ought to be the same in regard of the women but it passed after the manner i have told you  though the peace had been made a pretty while yet none hitherto reaped the fruits of it the commerce was as dead as in the time of war whether it was attributed to the high value of the french coin that continued still at the same rate or that the king believed he could subsist without other nations while others must have recourse to him there was yet no advance made to make it flourish in the mean time there came some ships from england and holland to take in wine and paper at bourdeaux and rouen they bought along other merchandise to be sold there but the tariff not being yet regulated between all the parties and the treaty of ryswick having only mentioned that it should be put upon the same foot as it was in the years      and      which was not yet done this together with the loss of twenty in the hundred by the money obliged these ships to return without either selling or buying any thing in these ports about the same time the states general sent deputies to the king to demand the execution of that article they applied themselves to the marquess of torcy secretary for foreign affairs but monsieur ponchartrain having the charge of that commerce they were remitted to him for the execution of their demands these deputies were exceedingly well versed in affairs of that nature and the states having an entire confidence in them had given them a full power to act as commissaries in the regulation of the tariff monsieur pontchartrain heard them upon the matter but being judicious and politic he put them off with fair words until he had acquainted the king with the affair the commerce of holland was of far less advantage to france than that of england because they draw a great deal more money from the one than from the other in effect the hollanders import more merchandise into france than they export whereas england on the contrary exports more than they import so that the first carries out the coin and the other brings it in this made them resolve to keep up the tariff as high as possible in regard of the hollandtrade its imposts or customs while they designed to lower it in regard of the english while they expected the hollanders should come to paris to terminate that affair they resolved to send to london to regulate what regarded that nation ponchartrain pitched upon monsieur phelipeux dherbeaut his relation for that purpose he was first commissary of the marine under monsieur de maurepas who had left him the whole managment of it he had the character of commissarygeneral for regulating the commerce betwixt the two nations but though his commission was presently dispatched yet he stayed a long time after in the mean time the court named other commissaries to treat with the hollanders but as they had no design to terminate the affair to their satisfaction so it continues to this day at the same pass  while these matters were a transacting the king named ambassadors to go to all the foreign courts and instead of sending gentlemen of the law as had been always practiced in france he employed persons of quality or officers of the army he thought if they could join the knowledge of the cabinet to the experience they had acquired in warlike affairs they would be more accomplished for his service upon all occasions he chose the marquess of villars lieutenant general of the army for the court of vienna and the marquess of harcourt also a lieutenant general for his ambassador to spain who during the war had acquired a reputation equal to any and could he perform the same thing in his embassy which he had done at the head of a flying army no more could be expected of him but that being a hard task his friends could hardly hope for it he was going to a court where the very name of french is suspected much more at a time when he seemed very earnest to create all the obstacles imaginable to the emperors designs of bringing the succession of his catholic majesty to fall upon the king of the romans his eldest son or that failing upon the archduke his second son philip iv his present majestys father had left it by testament to the last though he was not born at that time but the spaniards showing no inclination to execute it his imperil majesty labored to engage them to favor the king of the romans he thought that being his eldest son he not only deserved better that dignity which was much more solid than that of emperor though not altogether so splendid but he expected also to secure the fortune of his son the better if he could unite these two qualities in one person the queen of spain being his sisterinlaw he did not doubt of her favoring his design and the count of harrach his ambassador at that court had a commission to propose it to her the queen joined issue with the ambassador in all his sentiments and his imperial majesty being hitherto so prosperous in his designs as to get the queens creatures into his catholic majestys council and she being very industrious to gain the other members they met often to consider how to behave in the scene they were to act the count of harrach insinuated to the queen and them that the best method they could fall upon in this juncture was to put the government of the frontiers into germanhands or into the hands of persons wellaffected to the emperor the prince of darmstadt who signalized himself in the defense of barcelona was proposed to be viceroy of catalonia don francisco de velasco having rendered himself unworthy of that command by suffering himself to be surpised in his camp the government of milan seemed too good to escape one of his imperial majestys creatures as did also the viceroyalty of navarre for the count of harrach supposed very reasonably that it was by attacking of one of these three places if not all the three at once that the king of france meant to make good his pretensions to the spanish succession immediately after the death of that monarch the queen and those of the kings council who were in her interest found it difficult to manage that point for though the spaniards were too wise to own their sentiments openly yet they had not the least inclination to own either the emperors eldest or youngest son for their sovereign they were also of the same opinion in regard of the dauphin and his sons though some of the french emissaries endeavored to insinuate to them secretly that if they would choose either the duke of anjou or the duke of berry they could form their tender years according to their own model insomuch that it would be impossible for them to perceive they had ever been born frenchmen and by these means they labored to extirpate the antipathy that was natural to the two nations but that being a hard point to manage they always rejected it with scorn they could never conceive why they would deprive the prince of bavaria of that succession for it was naturally his right after the renunciation his most christian majesty had made of it when he married the infanta of spain others wished since the king had no heirs begot of his own body the crown might fall to some grandee of spain they believed they should be more happy under such a person than under any foreign prince for such a one being trained up from his cradle in their customs and manners they could bear more easily with him than with any other for generally all men inherit the genius of the country where they are born and it is hard for them ever to change their natural inclination  such was the disposition of the affairs of that nation when the queen of spain made use of all her interest to have the prince of darmstadt made viceroy of catalonia prince vaudemont governor of milan and prince eugene of savoy viceroy of navarre for she not only looked upon them as wellaffected to the emperor but also very capable to defend against the french the places committed to their care they had distinguished themselves upon a thousand occasions and prince eugene was actually employed against the turks with whom the emperor was in continual war that barbarous nation owed its preservation only to the diversion was made upon the rhine when his imperial majesty was engaged against france but now the peace being concluded betwixt these two potentates the emperor thought of no less than swallowing up the turks in a campaign or two at most and dislodging em of all their possessions in europe but whether that prince meant to take his ease after so tedious a war or what is more likely that true policy obliged him to desire a peace there were already some proposals made that had a favorable hearing from both parties and perhaps without that prince eugene who about this time saw himself at the head of the emperors army would hardly accept of the office of viceroy of navarre but now finding himself obliged to put up the sword he was glad that by the emperors influence the queen of spain had that deference for him however her success in that was not so favorable as it was on the behalf of the princes of darmstadt and vaudmont for the services of the first at barcelona pleading highly in his favor she carried it for him without any opposition but she met with more difficulty in regard of the government of milan some would have it continued to the marquess of leganez who was there already or conferred upon some grandee of spain but that was far from the queens mind she meant rather to strip them of what they possessed than provide them with new governments the duke of medina celi one of the most considerable grandees of spain and most beloved of the people was viceroy of naples he had passed some years in that employ and places of that nature are usually triennial in spain yet she would gladly have it conferred upon one of her creatures but her friends thought it not convenient and rather advised her to the contrary to continue it to him and gave for their reason that she ought to be very cautious in bringing him to spain in the present posture of affairs which would not fail to awake the peoples affection for him and consequently to make some obstacles to the emperors designs  the reasons which obliged the emperor to strike up a peace with the port were these his power became formidable not only to the princes of the empire but even to his other allies besides knowing his pretensions to the succession of spain they not only opposed it privately but even avowedly the princes who granted him succors against the turks spoke of withdrawing them the new king of england before he was owned by france offered his mediation for agreeing the parties he had sent two ambassadors to the port on purpose to propose it to the grand seignior but they both died upon their way thither this appearing very extraordinary because the sultans interest seemed altogether opposite to his conduct and besides the death of these two persons affording matter of speculation upon a great many things some believed assuredly they had been poisoned this might have discouraged his britannick majesty from sending any more ambassadors into that country but considering that the turks their rejecting of the peace was only grounded upon the diversion was made in their favor and that possibly they would lay aside their obstinacy when convinced of their error he assumed his first resolution nor was he in the least deceived for the grand seignior accepted of his offer now with as much warmth as he had rejected it before with indifference he accepted of his mediation and the statesgenerals which was offered to him at the same time and being satisfied that in the peace they had made with france they had easily surmounted all the difficulties that commonly attend the preliminaries of treaties they meand to follow the same method in this the emperor understanding that the turks had accepted of the mediation that was offered em gave notice of it to the potentates who were interested with him in the war namely the republics of venice and poland and the great duke of muscovy they were mutually engaged in an offensive and defensive league so he being resolved to do nothing without their consent desired them to give in their pretensions in writing while the parties should have condescended upon the place of assembling for his own part he put in his which he did not expect would be granted because the jealousy the mediators as well as other princes had of his power obliged him to make an end of these differences he pretended that the turks by the teeaty that was on foot ought to be obliged to give him up belgrade and temeswaer with all the right of sovereignty that he possessed in transylvania at the bottom these people thought themselves very happy that the emperor would consent to a peace upon so reasonable terms but however barbarous they are they are truly politic and no sooner perceived that the mediators as well as they were glad to oblige him to lay down his arms but they refused to consent to these terms  the republics of venice and poland and the great duke of musvy fearing that prince would have made the peace without them sent ministers to vienna to pry into the affairs there the czar sent thither his own general while himself resolved to pass into holland and england to establish a more solid commerce in these countries than had hitherto been done he looked upon himself as one of the most powerful princes of christendom in regard of the vast extent of his dominions but being ignorant how to improve so great a power to the best advantage he was little more esteemed than the prince of courland he no sooner thought of his resolution then he put it in execution he took his road through the marquess of brandenburgs dominions who received him with all the respect due to his person from thence having passed into holland he continued there some time applying himself diligently to the knowledge of their commerce and policy in effect seeing their state much more flourishing than could have been thought in proportion to their extent he easily conceived it was only owing to their prudence and conduct and being thereby the more induced to imitate them he entered into a new treaty of commerce with them and bought some ships of them afterward he passed into england and having acquainted the king that he had affairs to propose to him his majesty appointed commissioners to hear them  while the new king triumphed after this manner either upon the account of the advantageous peace he gave to europe or the great confidence his allies had in him or the consideration they had for him insomuch that nothing could be enterprizd without his approbation the popes nuncio whom he had sent into poland after he had conferred with the ordinary nuncio at that court and been informed by him of the state of affairs in that country signified to his polish majesty that his holiness was not so averse to his election as he supposed that the main thing in question was whether his conversion had been sincere and provided that point was cleared the holy father would be fully satisfied god alone was capable to know it there being none besides who can search hearts however in all outward appearance this prince would have the world convinced he was a good catholic at least he performed all the duties of a true catholic and omitted nothing to confirm the people in the belief of his sincerity the nuncio being sensible of what considerable advantage the popes consent would be to him for gaining to him these persons that continued still in his enemys party upon a suspicion that his conversion was only feigned and being apprehensive that as soon as he were peaceably established on his throne he would return to his vomit i say the nuncio who understood how necessary his holiness was to him like a cunning politician meand to make the best use of this opportunity and therefore before he would assure him altogether of the apostolic favor he represented to him that it was impossible for him to persuade all europe of the sincerity of his conversion any other way than by testifying as a new convert the profound respect he had for his holiness that since all who professed that religion owed an entire obedience in holy matters to the apostolic see he wished his majesty would not only renounce certain privileges that the kings of poland pretended to as their right but also dismiss all the lutheran ministers that followed him without using that pretext for retaining them that he had a great many of that religion along with him he also proposed many other things of the like nature a plain evidence that the court of rome never neglects any advantage they can catch upon these conditions he offered to employ all his interest with the cardinal regent to pacify the commotions of the kingdom putting him in hopes that the respect he had for the person who sent him would oblige the cardinal to accept of the terms he designd to propose to him  the king of poland being sensible how capable the cardinals party was to annoy him besides that new commotions were arising in lithuania which was all up in arms to support two parties that made war against one another to wit prince sapieha general of the troops of that duchy and the sieur oginski great ensign of it a dignity of a distinguishing importance in that country i say the king of poland being afraid that this quarrel which seemed to proceed from jealousy was only a pretense to reverse his election promised to the nuncio all he desired however he desired to be excused from signing any thing touching the privileges he would have him to renounce until he were better informed in what they consisted and had the advice of the republic without whose approbation he could not handsomely conclude any matter of that importance the nuncio could not well disapprove of this objection that appeared so reasonable he went to lowits to confer with the cardinal primate whom he found so enraged against his polish majesty for protecting so avowedly the bishop of cujavia his mortal enemy that he almost despaired of ever succeeding in an affair he had promised so confidently to bring about but as the italians are cunning politicians qualified with a deal of patience he gained by degrees upon his eminences passion he gave him to know that the prince could not have acted other ways than he had done hitherto for as much as that bishop had been all along the soul of his party that he agreed with him in thinking that he had reason to resent the actions of that prelate who had incroachd upon his privileges that after all he ought to consider that it was not in his power to hinder what was done nor so much as revenge it by force that his party who fell off daily was in no capacity to enterprise any thing against his enemy who was supported by his polish majesty and his troops that france by whose means he had hoped to triumph over him never pretended to concern themselves any further in the quarrel having formerly declared so much to his holiness by their ambassador so he would find himself certainly mistaken if he said any stress upon them  the cardinal primate was much surpised to hear the nuncio speak after that manner not questioning in the least the truth of this declaration he sent immediately one of his creatures to his most christian majesty to assure him that his party was not yet reduced so very low but they were in a condition to foil their enemies if his majesty would give them a very small assistance the prince of conti who was no more in the humor to return to that country and indeed never was when left to his choice gave his majesty so very bad an impression of the sordid avarice of the poles that he was little less than enraged at the arrival of this new envoy he thought the cardinal primate asked him succors only to make his own terms the better so he sent back his envoy with letters signifying what he had already declared to the pope namely that he would concern himself no more in the matter his eminence was too happy in making use of the cardinal nuncio to interceed for him with his polish majesty there was a treaty made between the parties by which the cardinal primate promised on his own behalf and in behalf of his party to own that prince for their sovereign the king of poland for his part promised to give him some satisfaction upon the bishop of cujavias account by this treaty there was also an authentic provision made for the injury done to the cardinal primates dignity by the boldness of that prelate in proclaiming and crowning the king after his election it was also agreed upon by this treaty that the nation should never lay down their arms until they had obliged the turks to restore caminieck and podolia for it was alleged that if the late king of poland had been cordial in the war against the turks he might have recovered it but he who had saved christendom by the seasonable succors he brought to vienna which had he only delayed three days longer all had been lost without remedy became so lazy in what concerned the republic that one would have thought he had lost his senses however by this treaty they obliged the new king to carry on the siege at his own expenses and upon these conditions they condescended he should keep his troops in the country though formerly they murmured extremely for that these troops had entered the kingdom contrary to their laws and customs and even from that subject took occasion to exclaim highly against him as if he had entered the nation by force and meand to secure it by conquest rather than by lawful means  after the conclusion of this treaty the cardinal primate went from lowits to pay his homage to the king at warsaw his majesty sent the principal gentlemen of his court to meet him and honor his entry which had much more the air of a triumph than what was due to the merit of a criminal he was accompanied into the palace by a great many persons of quality who were overjoyed to see this reconciliation the king and he had a private interview for half an hour it was generally believed that the troubles of the kingdom were now at an end and in effect the queen of poland having lost all hopes of seeing her son upon the throne which till that time she never despaired of asked his majestys leave to pass some time at rome the king refused it before he advised with his council which was composed of the principal senators of the nation however they saw no inconveniency in granting it and gave her to know that she should not be hindered to depart when she thought fit accordingly she put her self in a readiness to be gone against the latter end of the year every person applauded that princesss conduct for after all she had done to hinder the election of his majesty as well as of the prince of conti she could hardly remain in the kingdom with any satisfaction nor could she handsomely pass into france where it was impossible for his most christian majesty to see her without indignation yet it was generally believed she would choose france for her retreat it being natural for people to love the place of their nativity for it was openly reported that she was treating with the duchess of portsmouth and her son the duke of richmond for the duchy of aubigny in berry which the late king charles ii bought for that duchess upon certain conditions not very acceptable to her but the king being sensible that if he did not tie her up to such terms a woman of her temper might be reduced to end her days in an hospital was therefore glad to do her this kindness against her inclination he had already a mistress of the same temper namely the duchess of cleaveland who had lavished away all that the king had given her however he bestowed large sums upon the duchess of portsmouth and such was his liberality that he had laid out above a million of money for china to her but though there be nothing harder than the substance it is made of she found out a way to melt it all at paris without suffering any other inconvenience by it than what ordinarily attends misery  however it was not altogether impossible to accommodate the difference betwixt the queen of poland and his most christian majesty if her plish majesty would condescend in some measure to imitate the count of bilk mentioned before she might have owned her self in the wrong and supplicated his majesty for the honor of his protection but she was too haughty to condescend to it insomuch that she was now wholly intent upon leaving speedily a place where her circumstances had suffered so sensible an alteration for during her husbands lifetime every one was glad to truckle to her in regard of the ascendant they knew she had over him now the scene was changed and so different from the former that every one was ready to impute to her what was blamed in her husband as if she had been the only person who prompted him  the king of poland being thus owned by the pope and wanting only now to be recognized by his most christian majesty in order to enjoy peaceably the dignity of a crown that had been so much disputed sent a person of quality to france to excuse the robbery committed upon the abbot of plignacs equipage and to establish a good correspondence with his majesty for though in appearance he had no need of him especially being so strictly joined in alliance with the emperor and all the princes his neighbors yet considering that kings have long arms especially the king who governs france at this time he would omit nothing that was due to policy the king received his envoy with all the marks of respect he could wish for and all parties forgeting the occasion of their differences a good intelligence and union was established betwixt the two nations though hardly to that degree it had been formerly in the mean time the king returned to the prince of conti the money he had expended in the pursuit of that crown which in all probability pleased him much more than if he had obtaind it not that he is covetous in any degree but continuing still amorous the satisfaction he enjoyed in seeing his mistress rendered him insensible of all other pleasures besides he was soon comforted for the loss of that dignity by the liberal share he had with the duke of vendome in the dauphins favor and the hopes he had of gaining his process before the court of parliament as he had done formerly  however there happened an accident to the duke that was like to deprive him both of that advantage and his life in his return from ant a house which king henry iv had given to the lady jane gabriell of whom he was descended he was like to be drowned in a postchaise for he was up to his chin in a little river which he was obliged to pass and it being the middle of winter the cold which he suffered was capable to do him all the mischief that could be expected from so cruel an accident but as he is a noble prince who delights to do good and has no enemies and besides had acquired a great deal of glory before barcelona so every one was overjoyed to see their fears end more happily than they expected it only cost him a fright however this general who by his conquest had gained the reputation of the greatest hero being subject to a great many infirmities as well as the ancient heros found himself so bad that he was obliged to apply himself to physicians he had contracted a disease that gave him more trouble than the taking of four barcelonas and his trouble was so much the greater that his malady was of an old standing and created him every moment insufferable pains he enjoyed no manner of rest and it was to be feared that if he neglected it any longer it might be passed all cure he resolved to put himself into the hands of a chemist physician named chambon this gentleman was nothing different from those of his kidney that is to say neither better nor worse than a quack who boast as highly as if they were many degrees above aesculapius but if he cured four persons he certainly killed a whole dozen and the cures he had performed were rather the product of chance than of skill he was much at one with dr carette who had but one remedy for all manner of diseases and yet would have mankind believe that he was the ablest physician in the universe be it as it will this new physician set himself up in form because he had cured some few persons in the world and amongst others a certain abbot of chaulieu who was a sort of intendant of the house of vendome this abbot was very desirous that the duke would make use of chambon to cure him however the duke withdrew in a short while and had no great reason to brag of his physicians remedies for chambon did nothing and at this time the duke finds himself in little better circumstances than when he first made use of him it may be rather said that he is still worse for the more inveterate these diseases are they are the more difficult to be cured yet some will have it that his grandfather found the means to be cured after forty years but that was scarce done by the skill of a chemist and its probable that if his grandson had copied him he had applied himself to some other person than his intendants favorite  the duke of savoy had no reason to complain of his daughters marriage but knowing that the king had no mind to have it consummated he entreated his majesty to consummate it to the end his daughters condition might be more secure he was afraid that the duke of burgundy might come to die by some mischance and so his daughter be returned upon his hand but that was far from his majestys inclination on the contrary it was well known if that had happened he would have married her to the duke of anjou and in view of that only he hindered all commerce betwixt them to the end that a dispensation might be the more easily obtained i cannot tell whether the king made his design known to him but it is certain that after the marquess of ferrette had spoke to him by his majestys command the duke was not only out of all hopes but showed no inclination to it however if he could not obtain that demand he succeeded in a short time after much better in another he made to his majesty he entreated him to banish madamoselle de soissons whose conduct was offensive to him out of his kingdom he also desired of him to cause shut up mademoiselle de carignan in a convent the last showed a great deal of complaisance to a married man who lived after a very indifferent manner with his own wife whether it was that he had inherited that of his father who had never been a good husband or that the affection he had for this princess made him peevish at the sight of all others it was much suspected that the king himself was the principal author of these demands to the end that these two persons might no more be seen at court nor in paris though they had the honor to be so nearly related to the duchess of burgundy yet their behavior was altogether unworthy of their great quality for besides their conduct that was not very regular they were both in extreme necessity and so far from being in circumstances to support a rank suitable to their birth that they had hardly wherewith to maintain sufficiently the condition of very ordinary persons besides the king was fain to supply them by his royal bounty without which they had often wanted the very necessaries of life the eldest was sent to brussels to keep company with her mother who resided there the other was shut up amongst the carmelites in the suburbs of st james with express order to the superior of the convent that she should be permitted to speak to none but certain ladies whose names were transmitted to him in writing mademoiselle de carignan might have easily avoided this indignity if she had had a mind she had been warned of it a long time before and the king himself sent her word that if she meant to please him she would take a maid of honor of his recommendation at that time he offered her apartments at versailles with sufficient maintenance for that lady of honor but she excused her self under pretense that she had one already and that she could not handsomely accept of another without exposing the first however sincere she might have been in her excuse yet in a thing capable of a double entendre people are more ready to take them in an ill sense every body believed that her excuse proceeded only from the great desire she had to continue her intrigue but the king having put an end to it after the manner above related her gallant was to look for his comfort where he could find it  in all appearance he could not be so easily comforted whether he thought that his honor was concerned or that he was really afflicted as he would have the world believe he displayed his wrath more than ever against his wife and though she was reputed a lady of entire virtue yet as it was generally believed he used often to lay hands upon her but till that time she concealed very industriously what just reason she had to exclaim against his conduct but after that and several other outrages it was no more in her power to dissemble her just resentment of them she complained of them to all her relations that they might the more readily approve of her intention to commence a process of separation of bodies against him for she had been of a long time separated in goods without which she and her two children had been reduced to the greatest indigence in effect this mans conduct was so mean that he went often not only without one penny of money but without clothes and hat no body could disapprove of her design which she put in execution a few days after and her husband who had retired from her some days before told his wifes friends that it was altogether needless for her to plead for a separation from him since for a long time he desired no better and would allow the sentence to pass whenever she thought convenient but there being many more people who delight in debauchery than in virtuous living this gentleman was nevertheless acceptable in certain companies even princes countenanced him as they had usually done and being one day at the duke of chartress table there was by chance some sauce dropped by one of the attendants upon his clothes and however plain and coarse these clothes were he was extremely vexed at the accident no wonder for he had got no other in his wardrobe for a change this he told the young prince betwixt jest and vexation the prince seemed not to regard it but talking with the company said that ordinarily misfortunes attended them who were least able to support them he entreated two or three persons of quality who were there to go keep him company the next day for in all appearance said he you will find him in bed while he sends his clothes to the scourers and at least that will be some comfort to him this poor husband was actually obliged to do what the duke said but the next day the young prince sent him four suits made by his own tailor to the end that if any such misfortune befell him another time it should never hinder him to appear as usually  about that time the king caused to arrest one of the ushers of his chamber one of the most visionary companions in the universe whom notwithstanding his majesty allowed to discourse with very often in regard he durst not let his folly appear before the king which he had not the wit to conceal in other company he had of a long time thought to cause hang all the seamen from the marshal destree and tourville to the very meanest he pretended they were all rogues upon certain memoirs which a commissary of the marines who was broke had given him he had importuned his majesty a thousand times upon it and represented to him that if he would examine the abuses which had crept into the several employments of these officers he might find a fair opportunity of raising justly a tax upon them to the tune of sixty millions it was about the middle of the war when he spoke after this manner to the king they had a deal of difficulty to raise money and therefore his majesty thought the advice was not to be despised and supposing there might be somewhat in it he sent him to monsieur pontchartrain but that highly displeased this extravagant gentleman who probably had a mind to regulate this affair himself with his majesty or perhaps designed to involve that minister in these pretended malversations for a fool is capable of any extravagancy however he was obliged to obey the king there was hardly a person to be found who thought himself more able and fit for business than this fool but monsieur pontchartrain being as prudent as he was rash knew presently how little ground this numskul had for what he advanced he acquainted the king with it his majesty was much of the same opinion yet this man who had the opportunity to speak to his majesty whenever he pleased could not be persuaded of his error but still presented new memorials to him by which he entreated him to appoint some other commissioners to hear him who might have more leisure to examine the matter than monsieur pontchartrain offering upon pain of death to make out what he advanced to be as clear as daylight this confidence of his together with some secret springs he set at work made the king resolve to give him a hearing he obtained also some acts of council by which he pretended to give a light to some obscure affairs from that time forward this rash numskul never saw any of the officers of the marine enter into the kings chamber but he told to such as were by him that these gentlemen were to be taxed in immense sums one in two millions some in more some in less and he though t himself already one of the first peers of the kingdom because he had asked of his majesty a share of what was to be recovered of these gentlemen by the tax and the king had granted it to him but himself had promised a share of it to such as were capable to ingratiate him with his majesty this must needs have been very disagreeable to the person concerned however this little gentleman forgot himself more and more daily even to that degree of impudence as to vaunt that notwithstanding all what monsieur pontchartrain was able to do he did not doubt in the least to succeed in his enterprise in fine that minister being no longer able to bear with his extravagancies made it his business to represent them to the king he had slighted them long before as well as the person who was guilty of them he thought him only unworthy to be regarded but every one told him that his interest was concerned more than he was aware of in making his majesty acquainted with the truth of the affair for he having the whole power of the seaaffairs it seemed as if he accused him underhand of conniving at these pretended abuses that he suffered in others so he was at last prevailed upon by these reasons and therefore made known to the king that this man was only an extravagant mad fool fitter to be sent to bedlam than countenanced by so great a king that his impudence or rather his madness appeared too evidently in daring to accuse two marshals of france together with the whole body of the seaofficers without any regard to so many persons amongst them equally considerable for their services and distinguished by their quality and very incapable of doing any thing against their duty who came daily to him to demand justice of that fool for his insolence and entreated him earnestly to represent it to his majesty he added that he hoped that his majesty would cause to examine once for all the accusations of that unaccountable fool to the end he might be confounded when it should be made manifest that the accusation was rather visionary than real  the king having heard this minister very attentively promised to do all he demanded without loosing any time accordingly he commanded the commissioners whom he had ordained to examine that affair to search narrowly into it the commissioners applied themselves presently to it and having discovered that all what he advanced was in effect nothing else but the imagination of his empty brain they gave his majesty a full account of it the king immediately forbid that man ever to trouble him any more with that affair but he not being wise enough to take the advantage of this advice would still insist as formerly and had almost said that all of them had conspired to save the guilty the king told him a second time that he commanded him absolutely never to speak to him of that affair though he was so good as to conceal what he had reason to believe of him this man thought at last his best way was to dissemble and obey his majesty in appearance but while he seemed to be silent he left no stone unturned to return to his former trade he brought over the knight of lorrain to his side in order to engage the duke of orleans in the affair and though such eternal protenss as this knight are little to be credited yet he made use of his interest with that prince to succeed in his design the duke spoke of it to his majesty who was exceedingly surprised that this little gentleman dared to fall upon these methods after he had expressly forbid him he told freely his sentiments of it to the duke and forbid him ever to concern himself with such affairs from that time the king resolved to get rid of him though it is always against his inclination when he falls upon such extreme measures with any who had the honor to be his domestic for no prince ever showed greater kindness to his servants however he suspended his resolution until he saw that it was impossible to make him prudent this little gentleman being severely checked by the knight of lorrain because he brought him into bad terms with the duke of orleans was still so impudent as to put up a petition in the duke of rochefoucauts name without ever acquainting him with it beforehand it is true he had been twice at the dukes lodgings after he had done it without having the opportunity of meeting with him he hoped that the duke who was in very good terms with his majesty would regard his visions as real truths and espouse his interest as his own this petition was presented to his majesty before the duke had time to return home and the king made mention of it to the duke he made him also the same compliment he had made formerly to his brother the duke of orleans to wit that he would not take it kindly if he harkend to that impertinent fool or ever spoke of his affairs to him the duke extremely surpised at this check which he had by no means deserved because the petition had been given in without his knowledge protested to the king that he was ignorant of what he meant and was so far from excusing his fault that he desired justice for what he had done the king promised to give him full satisfaction and resolved now more than ever to get rid of such a dangerous and meddling fool however as if this numskul had not already done enough toward his own ruin he wrote a letter in which he complained that the king himself opposed the service he intended to do him this letter was intercepted and brought to his majesty he found it too insolent to confine his punishment only to a banishment from his presence he caused him to be sent to the bastile where he was commanded in the kings name to lay down his charge he shifted the matter for a while but in the end it being insinuated to him that he must expect to continue prisoner there for life if he would not comply he chusd to do the last  the seaofficers were not the only persons who were accused unjustly there came about that time a certain abbot of quality from a foreign country of whom they took the liberty to say no better things for they accused him of having desired to speak with king william before the peace was signed and to persuade him that he ought not to think of making a peace with france for that france could not fail to be absolutely destroyed if the war was continued two years longer his family being one of the most considerable of all britain was extremely afflicted when they heard him talked of after that manner especially his eldest brother who was in the service and pretty well advanced he durst not show himself any more to the king fearing his majesty would make him answerable for the crime alledgd against his brother nevertheless his majesty after the example of the almighty had long before explained himself upon that head saying in presence of all the court that every one should bear his own crime and that relations were not to be answerable for the iniquities of their relations and in effect one of the musketeers having committed a horrid murder in the year      his majesty knew no sooner that his brother who was a captain of horse was so extremely afflicted at it that he designed to make his escape into the low countries than he advanced him in the lifeguards he could give no more evident proof to all the world that he never meant to make one answerable for anothers crime however this abbots brother being a man of singular honor though he was sensible of the kings justice yet he could not avoid gieving extremely at it and what added much to his grief was that he distrusted his brother altogether he knew very well that his little band never hindered him from doing many things which reflected mightily upon that habit he had occasioned a divorce betwixt a husband and a wife he carried on an amorous intrigue with a presidents wife which occasioned great wrangling betwixt them nor had the husband stopped his resentment there if his relations and friends had not convinced him that a great many chances attend our lives which it were better to conceal than declare these things he partly believed but it was not in his power to hinder himself from murmuring which did the abbot a great deal of injury who both by his quality and his brothers service pretended to have already a good abbey but now saw himself a thousand miles distant from it the king who desires that every one should mind his duty that is to say that a soldier be a man of courage that a judge be just and a churchman honest and pious no sooner knew that he made it his practice to debauch other mens wives instead of confirming them in virtue than he absolutely forbid father de la chaise who had put him down in his pocketbook in order to have a good benefice ever to propose him any more as a subject worthy of any dignity  the poor abbot who had more quality than riches was extremely vexed to see his hopes so frustrated by his own faults however knowing that there was mercy for all sins he put himself into a seminary whether he truly repented of what he had done or would make the world believe he did so by these means he meant to free his majesty of the bad impression he might have of his conduct and insinuate himself into his favor the king who is a very judicious prince and is seldom or never mistaken in his opinion of persons did not allow himself to be imposed upon by that change so very different from his former life for he preached fasted and catechized and in a word there was not one churchman not only in the seminaries but even within twenty leagues round it whose conduct was more exemplary than his father de la chaise was very desirous to oblige him but could never comprehend whence arose the kings aversion for him being naturally good and more inclined to judge well than ill of any person he took occasion to speak to his majesty of him and represented to him that the austerity of his life and his regular conduct did not only deserve an abbey but even a bishopric that the greatest sinners become ordinarily the greatest saints and if god almighty were like him they must blot out of the calendar a great many saints who after having committed very great crimes had showed the abbot the way he followed at present the king was nothing moved at his confessors discourse on the contrary he answered him that he might blot him out of the list of bishops as he had done a while ago out of the list of abbots for he never would honor him with that dignity  i do not know if ever this answer was made known to the abbot or if he was already weary of passing his days in a seminary and waiting so long time for a benefice of which he saw no appearance whatever was the matter he changed his residence very soon it is true it did not renew his intrigue with the presidents wife or with any other on the contrary he avoided all for a long time as if he meant to continue the life that he made so great a show of in the eyes of all france but whether he saw that they would eye him narrowly or that he intended to continue his course he passed into flanders where he applied himself to catechizing every day he also began to assist dying persons and the marquess of blanchford second son to the duke of crequi falling sick about that time it was he that exhorted him to prepare himself for the passage that appears so terrible especially to those of such a youthful age as he was of father de la chaise took occasion upon this also to speak to the king in favor of this abbot he told him that the abbot did not require his presence to oblige him to good actions and so he could not be reproached as a great many others might justly be with hypocrisy but the king nothing moved by this new attack answered that he could never persuade him but that the abbot was no good man that time would discover very soon which of them was most deceived but he did not believe it was himself father de la chaise replied that he was afraid his majesty offended god almighty in judging so badly of his neighbor but his majesty returned it smartly home in saying that he was afraid that he offended him more in desiring him to give a bishopric to a man whom he thought altogether unworthy of it i know not whether this answer came to the abbots ears but all of a sudden he left the great desire he had shown while in flanders to catechize men and without acquainting any person with his design went into holland to caress the women there at least he was seen doing it soon after his arrival however his going often to the house of one of the plenipotentiaries gave occasion to some people to say that this preacher was not only debauched but also a very dangerous mn in a word he was suspected to have given not only memoirs to that ambassador but also to have had a private interview with king william and revealed to him a great many secrets however all that was false nor had he any other design to go so often to that ambassadors than to pay his respects to a person who filled the presidents ladys room in his heart she was also somewhat more deserving than the other without doing her any injustice however as one lie generaly begets a great many amongst those who vent them the next day all paris would have it that the king had wrote to king william to entreat him to send him the abbot bound hand and foot they made it also known to the pretended criminal by a letter unsignd and the handwriting was altogether unknown to him but advised him if it came seasonably to his hand he would make it his business to save himself by flying to turkey rather than suffer himself to be taken  the poor abbot was much astonished at this accusation if they had accused him of being amorous he had been obliged to own it because it was true neither the seminary where he had been nor the mortifications which pere de la chaise had advanced so much in his favor to the king were capable to wean him from that unhappy passion to which to his great misfortune he was very subject in fine knowing himself not only innocent but also incapable of the crime laid to his charge he went to wait upon monsieur harlai in order to ask him if he had received the order of which they had given him advice secretly if so he came to put himself into his hands so that it would not be necessary to arrest him and if it was sent to any other person he came however to deliver himself prisoner to him that they might not be at the trouble to search for him he entreated him to acquaint the king with it that his majesty might be satisfied of his innocence until he could make it evident before any commissioners his majesty should be pleased to appoint monsieur harlai had heard somewhat of the matter before this obliged him to examine his conduct and to set some spies upon him in order to watch whither he went at some certain hours for he judged that it must needs be about that time that he was most busied about his treason if fame was to be believed but at last these spies reported to monsieur harlai that he was altogether took up about his mistress which justified him so much in his opinion that he gave him to know he wished with all his heart the prison he was engaged in might not prove more troublesome to him than what he came to look for at his house that it would not prove very hard for him to break his chains because he not only declared him free but also innocent of what was laid to his charge as far as consisted with his power however he believed that his heart was not so much upon the french as it had formerly been but as it is impossible to be always in love he was persuaded it might return to its former inclination when he thought least of it and by these means he might be at ease for he would secure him none would impute to him this as a great crime in effect this was the abbots crime and though he was sheltered in it from all he was threatened with nevertheless he was not so happy as to continue always in the good esteem of father de la chaise he durst not speak any more in his favor to his majesty considering he had set up a holland lady in the place of the presidents his majesty asked also that good father if he was now convinced and if he intended still to demand a bishopric for that abbot the jesuit was somewhat humbled at that reproach and all he could say for his justification was that he could not hinder himself from being imposed upon by the tricks of an hypocrite no more than any body else  but if his majesty was proof against the recommendations of his father confessor whose opinion in matters of that nature gains generally the kings consent the case was quite different with regard to another abbot whom this good father protected also i mean the abbot of coadlet whose sad adventure has no parallel in any ancient or modern history nor perhaps ever will have in those to come not but that they afford us examples enough of deposed bishops but as that is seldom done but by the authority of the church or upon the account of manifest heresy or for some other capital crime if i be not mistaken i may confidently say that the history i mean to insert here exceeds what can be said of these examples but be it as it will the abbot of coadlet a gentleman of britany though he had already a dignity in the chapter of vannes yet he thought it not amiss to ask some other little benefice by which means he might subsist the more conveniently and confined the utmost extent of his ambition to the having four or five thousand livres a year and to that end by the means of very good friends applied himself to father de la chaise upon whom he believed all these matters depended this good father told him that he did himself an injustice in restricting himself to so narrow bounds and that he ought to ask some better thing for he could hope to obtain it the abbot was overjoyed to hear him speak after that manner and as generally a good appetite increases by eating so this gentleman of a little abbot was now very desirous to become a fat bishop however he durst not mention it suddenly to pere de la chaise but the good father gave him to know that the dignity he enjoyed already in the cathedral rendered him worthy of the other especially when it was joined to all the other qualities requisite for a bishop so he got himself to be listed in the catalogue of the candidates for the episcopal dignity however he continued at paris until the king had filled up some vacant bishoprics which had pretenders enough for now the scene is altered from what it was formerly amongst those upon whom they conferred that dignity who said ingenuously nolo episcopari i will not be a bishop for nowadays they think at least if they do not say volo episcopari  i e i will be a bishop and no doubt they think it from their very heart because it is impossible to give an account of all the friends they employ or of all the springs they set at work in order to obtain the mitre  the abbot of coadlet who knew pretty well the secret how to come by it was not sufficiently satisfied to hear only father de la chaise for him though he was the best friend he could employ but he applied himself to others also who were capable to do him as considerable service as the former for he thought as in legal processes abundance of the law breaks not the law so in offers of this nature he could never make use of too many on his behalf however as there are many who ruin themselves in making use of the methods that others save themselves by so he found that what he took to be of greatest advantage proved most destructive and that to such a degree that it is impossible for him ever to retrieve it being informed that in the age we live in women are as serviceable as any thing else he made his address with his utmost application to marshal crequis lady who was his countrywoman that lady promised him her favor and was as good as her word but he having likewise heard that old women have not so much interest as young ones quickly abandoned her and took up with her daughterinlaw whom he took to be more capable to serve him he waited upon her punctually every day and in the holyweek he happening to be at her house had not the power to refuse to accept of a match at ombre that she proposed to him some say it was bassette but either of em is equally criminal before god unless it be that the one is a greater instrument of passion than the other however he considered that twas not a proper employment for one that pretended to a bishopric especially at such an unseasonable time and for that reason he carefully requested the lady and all her company that the doors might be kept very close lest any body should see him engaged in an exercise so inconsistent with his profession it is such a common thing at paris to see the gentlemen with the little band playing at all sorts of game that the very footmen who overheard his discourse looked upon him as a hypocrite but they were strangers to his pretensions and considered very little of what consequence it was to him to have it concealed from the king nor how necessary it was for him to have it kept secret least it might blow up his design  however that week having passed before the king heard any thing of these transactions he filled up the vacant benefices according to his usual custom upon easter day for he never names any body but at that time whether it be because it is a formality of a long standing or that the kings confessors have introduced it in order to have themselves courted the more during the interval but passing over that as a thing i have no mind to search into we must believe that this abbot was only known to the king upon the account of his brother who was lieuterant of the guards however seeing him first in the list of the candidates for bishoprics he asked his father confessor who this man was the good father meaning to do him a kindness had no mind to say any thing to his disadvantage but extolled him to the heavens for the best of men insomuch that his majesty believing him one of the best men and of the most exemplary life in his kingdom named him for the bishopric of poictiers this news was no sooner known at paris than every body was amazed for his name was never heard of out of his own provnce before though by what happnd to him in a short time after it was in every ones mouth every body who heard he was to have that bishopric believed he must be a person of extraordinary virtue in regard the king had chosen him to so good a benefice to the prejudice of a great many considerable persons who expected it but those who had played with him at the marchioness of crequis made no secret to tell others that he was not so wonderfully godly for he had employed one day in the holy week at game this news came the same day to the kings ears which made his majesty pass that night in a mortal anxiety fearing that god almighty would call him to an account for having named a person to a bishopric that was capable of so black an action  the next morning father de la chaise coming to him to have the list of those who were named to the benefices signed as soon as the king saw this abbots name underneath instead of signing he blotted it out the good father asked him what he did not understanding what he meant the king answered that there was a man in that list who did not merit to be there that he knew nothing of him when he had given him a bishopric nor he himself could not have known him when he propos d him as a fit person but that he had been since justly represented to him and that the oversight he had committed had almost thrown him into despair this reflected in some measure upon the good father who had told him wonders of this man the more to oblige those who had recommended him and perhaps he himself believed all was told him to the advantage of that person however the jesuit altogether amazed at these expressions made use of the authority he had over his conscience to oblige him to change his resolution though it was easy for him to judge by what the king had said that of necessity some people had given him a strange character of that poor abbot yet he said that we must not believe upon light grounds all that we hear of our neighbor that he had often recommended to him the reading of the little book of the imitation of jesus and there he might see a chapter done purposely upon that subject that lying abounded in a great measure amongst men as well as jealousy insomuch that his majestys bounty was sufficient to move all the malice of hell against him  the king having hearkened attentively to what he said replied that it was no lie they told him as he imagined that it was a thing happened lately in the presence of a great many that he also knew the witnesses insomuch that he had not the least ground to doubt of it the good father desired to know what the matter was the king made no secret of it adding moreover that if fame was to be credited that abbot was no less a lover of the sex than of game and in effect this was told the king with a great deal of assurance but whether he loved them or no for i know no body hates them it was certain that he gave no scandal to the world that way as his enemies alleged so the king was soon persuaded that he was imposed upon in that affair however father de la chaise seeing that the other was a weighty accusation and that the king kept close to it he thought of throwing some scruple into his mind he told him then that there was more of infirmity than of crime in what the abbot had done that it was certain it was rather out of complaisance than inclination or want of due respect to these holy days that he had handled the cards at that time that very few people knew of this his fault but now all france would begin to pry into it and even suspect an infinity of things as soon as his majesty should deprive him of what he had once conferred upon him that his majesty ought to be very cautions in giving that scandal to his people that certainly he must be answerable for it before god that a small reproof given in secret to that abbot would prevail more with him and oblige him to ask god pardon for what he had done and by this means all would be buried in oblivion that after all it ought not to be regarded as a heinous fault but in respect to the time it was committed for he was not the only ecclesiastic who a had passion for game since there were many bishops and abbots who made it their principal exercise though after all they were not deprived of their bishopric and abbots upon that account he owned freely to his majesty it were more decent for them not to do it and was of opinion that these things ought to be none of their diversions but in fine the spirit of mankind is weak and there being four and twenty hours in the day it is impossible to employ them all in exercises of piety and therefore they are allowed to refresh themselves with innocent recreations  the king had no great opinion of this morality he thought it too loose especially with regard to those men who were the subject of the discourse for he put a vast difference betwixt them and a courtier or a man of the sword whom he thought might be allowd such things but to believe that ecclesiastics ought to have the same extent of freedom was a thing with all due respect to his father confessor he could never be persuaded off so it being impossible to convince his majesty by this objection he was fain to have recourse to some other argument he insisted upon the scandal he was like to give but that gaining nothing upon him he prayd him to advise with heaven before he would determine absolutely the matter his majesty consented willingly for in that he demanded only what became a good christian and was conformable to the inclination of this prince so the king kneeling that very minute upon a cushion father de la chaise kneeled by him to make him say the prayers which he desired prayers being ended the good father asked him what return the lord made his majesty replied nothing of what you wished for and that he was as resolute as formerly to execute his design he added that he saw it very inconvenient not to do it for if he should make that abbot a bishop and if he should neglect his duty in his diocese god almighty would one day call him to an account for it that he had faults enough of his own to answer for without taking upon him those of other people and he believed him too good and too pious to advise him otherwise the good father was not yet put off with that answer he asked of the king as the last favor to suspend his resolution until he should return from mass whither he was just agoing he conjured him to invoke earnestly the holy ghost that he might enlighten him the king condescended very willingly but not having received the inspiration which the good father pretended he declared that he had blotted that abbot out of the list because he did not believe him so proper for a bishopric as he at first imagined the poor abbot of coadles heard of these news with all the surprisal and grief imaginable he retired into a seminary there to bury his vexation however the king calling to mind what father de la chaise had said to him and being desirous that he should be suspected of nothing but the truth declared at the same time before all the court that what that abbot had done in the holy week was the only cause of his misfortune that whatever else was said of him was false and that he was obliged to give that testimony in his favor  the king having showed himself so full of the fear of god in an affair of so great consequence showed himself equally full of justice in another affair that concerned a man of the same country which was as follows a counselor of the parliament of britany called montchamp having cudgelled the nephew of moreau the famous actress in the opera and who gave some ground to speak of her upon an account different from what she acted upon the theater the young man carried his complaint to his majesty the counselor expected that his interest in the parliament in whose assembly that affair was done would shelter him from all accidents he treated already that man very slightingly and meanly but the lady of that opera whom persons of the first quality adored having espoused her nephews quarrel obtained a private letter in his favor this letter enjoined the parliament expressly to do the plantiff so good and so ready justice that he should have no reason to complain of it montchamp understanding by these means that he had to do with a more powerful party than he thought of had recourse to such tricks as are usual among the people of his trade he made a diligent inquiry into the life not of the aunt for it had been no difficulty in the least to prove a great many things of her but of the nephew for he thought that if he could dsover any unwarrantable action in it as he hoped he might he could at least retard the process which his adversary had commenced against him however not trusting very much to these hopes he was fain to fall upon other measures to get rid of this unlucky hit and therefore entreated the marshal of crs lady who was his relation to cause an accommodation to be proposed to mr  this actress was no sooner applied to than she stood aloof the marshals lady threatened her with the discovery the counselor made in her nephews life on purpose to fright her but whether she was afraid of nothing from that faction or that she thought she had friends enough to protect her she carried her pretensions so high as to demand ten thousand crowns of the marshals lady for her nephews interest and damages as soon as the lady had acquainted her relations that there was no hopes of an accommodation for him he spoke very scornfully of such an exorbitant demand so applying himself altogether to a vigorous defense he would certainly have confounded the opposite party if the parliament had condescended to it he gave in a petition against the plaintiff showing that he had two wives he desired to have a decret passed against him but bringing no valid proof for his accusation the parliament durst not declare in his favor for fear of a reprimand from the court for the secret letter which they had received together with a letter from the attourneygeneral of the parliament of paris gave them to know that they must proceed justly if they meant not to have their sentence liable to a revisal above all they were afraid of the aunts friends suspecting very much that if they gave them the least ground of complaint they should have them more than her for their adversaries in fine montchamp failing in his expectation and not being able to produce any proof for what he alleged though he had employed some considerable persons in it sentence was pronounced upon the affair he was suspended for six months and having received a reprimand behind the bench he was condemned to pay the costs he had made an offer before of four thousand livres to his adversary but by the calculation made of the charges they did not amount to so much which was no small mortification for our actress mrau for had it depended upon her she had protested against the sentence but the gentlemen of the robe assured her she would fail in the attempt so that she was fain to condescend against her inclination  as britany furnishes us thus with an instance of violence committed upon the person of one of her public magistrates so paris produced somewhat like it in the son of one of here is but what is something more it was executed upon a person of quality the marquis of novion son to the late monsieur novion master of the rolls and brother to the present monsieur novion president of the sovereign court falling in love with a certain chanoinesse whose mother was of the same family with monsieur de caumartin he humourd her to that degree that he promised as is alleged to revenge her quarrel upon a gentleman of whom she complained heavily she was extremely vexed that this gentleman who called himself the knight of st geniers should have pressed her somewhat too hard to pay him some money that he alleged he had lent her he had been formerly her lover but whether she pretended that when once a man is in love with a woman he ought to give and not lend or that he had demanded his money after a rude manner she had told the marquess so often that this gentleman was troublesome to her that he was charged with what i am now to recount the knight of st geniers passing one day along a street that was pretty near his former mistrisss lodgings was attacked by five or six bravados of paris who are always at a short distance from one another when they design any thing and their valor consists only in that which has some relation to what monsieur de turenne was used to say namely that god almighty was always of the strongest side in effect their train obliges those who would have no regard for them upon the lay of man for man to show them some respect but whether it was upon that account or that the knight being one of maltha owned no enemy but a turk he had no inclination to meddle with this man but this pretended hero who had served his apprenticeship to slaughtering being the son of a butcher seeing the knight took no notice of some small indignities he had given him had a mind to know whether or no he had forgot his first trade though some time ago he had exchanged it for the rapier he meant therefore to slit his nose and performed it so dexterously that all the nose was left the poor knight hung by one small tendon and he had certainly cut it off quite had he not been hinderd by some people who interposed but he made his escape while the knights wound was a dressing the whole town was immediately alarmed at the boldness of this action it was no great difficulty for the knight to judge who had hatched this mischief and therefore as soon as the chyrurgion had dressed him he went immediately and made his complaint to the commissy the lieuenant criminal gave out a warrant against the bravado and some other certain gentlemen who accompanied him in the exploit but as to the marquess the chanoinesse and her mother whom the knight had likewise accused he had some more consideration for them for the respect he had for their relations obliged him to proceed very nicely against them he thought it sufficient to issue out a personal summons against the three the mother and the daughter made their compearance and were interrogated but the marquess of novion durst not show his countenance in regard his bully had been so foolish as to suffer himself to be apprehended but he retired to a friends house hoping that by his reputation in the robe he might save the guilty from a just punishment but his majesty being informed of the whole affair by one of the knights friends commanded the matter to be examined very strictly so that the marquess was fain to leave paris and save himself by flying to swisserland  it  happy for these women that they never had either seen or heard of this bully insomuch that he not being able to accuse them they were without any farther difficulty absolved from their personal summons however the bully was sentenced by the lieutenantcriminal to be hanged nor could he avoid giving of that sentence however desirous he was to oblige the marquisss family the marquisss friends advised the criminal to fear nothing for the parliament to whom he had appealed would infallibly clear him but the knight suspecting the matter prevented their threatenings and petitioned the king to give him other judges which he obtained the appeal instead of being brought before the parliament according to the usual custom was brought before the great council the measures of the marquisss friends and relations being by this means quite defeated they advised him to keep himself close where he was for seeing his affairs had taken so fatal a turn it was by no means safe for him to return into the kingdom but being colonel of the regiment of britany and all the world believing him guilty a great many people made interest to have his regiment monsieur de boveron the marquess of harcourt s father asked it for the marquess of sesane his eldest son of a second marriage for he had married for his second wife the marquis of genless widow who was the late marshal de faberts youngest daughter  the marquiss relations were sensible of what importance it was for them to weather this storm for if once the king disposed of his regiment it would not only prove a mortal stroke to his fortune that was already pretty low but the world would also look upon it as a sort of conviction against him they therefore supplicated his majesty that he would be pleased to delay that affair for some small time promising to oblige their kinsman to return quickly in order to clear himself of the crime laid to his charge and alleging he was reduced to mean circumstances upon which account it would be equally acceptable to take away his life as his regiment the king in consideration of their services granted their request and the marquis of sesane was obliged to provide for himself somewhere else if he meant to have a regiment however this made no stop in the appeal of the condemned criminal for the sentence being confirmed when he perceived that all their fine promises were not sufficient to save him from a rope he charged the marquis of novion with the crime at his death this sentence satisfied in some measure the knights revenge who always saw the marks of his affront when he looked into his glass for though his nose was stitched up yet the seam appearing was no small mortification to him so that he could never be at ease until he had the same satisfaction of others that he had already of the bully he prosecuted them very eagerly before the same tribunal however he could never have his revenge of them as he pretended for though he prevailed so far as to have the cause removed from before the parliament where the marquis had a great many friends and relations and generally all judges stick close by one another yet to this minute the affair remains undecided for they started so many difficulties that it is impossible for one of a more considerable interest than his to remove them besides to plead in criminal matters requires a more weighty purse than his and yet could easily exhaust it in the mean time another adventure happend to president novions nephew and however extraordinary the first appeared yet it bears no proportion with this i am about to mention now  this presidents wife was a gentlemans daughter whose office it was to give out the powder by which he had got immense sums of money she had a sister by her first marriage who was the widow of a certain man called ombreval advocategeneral of the court of aides by whom she had some children and amongst the rest a son of one or two and twenty years old he studied the law that he might succeed his father in his profession this young gentleman coming from the lawschool saw two jesuits passing along and at the same time a cart loaded with bundles of rods then he told his companions that these disples of st ignatius had often whippd him in the college and he had a good mind to be revenged of them now that he found his opportunity he meand to bang them like bridewelbirds and to that intent each of them might take a bundle of these rods from the cart and oblige these good fathes to ask them pardon for all the cruelty they had made them suffer before in all appearance he had only said this to divert himself but his companions understanding him literally the most foolish and most bold of em leaped upon the cat and in spite of the carman untied the bundles took up handfulls of the rods and like so many furies fell upon the poor jesuits who never dreamt of the like adventure there was no great matter of ceremony in the compliment they made them they told them only they had often obliged them to pull down their breeches against their inclination and now they meant to do the like to them that common justice required they should pay them presently for all the evil they had suffered by them and they would make them sensible by which means they intended to perform it this folly appeared so extravagant that the two jesuits could never understand what they meant but these furies made them to know very quickly by falling suddenly upon them that its altogether as dangerous to fall into the hands of scholars as into the hands of the most barbarous hangman upon earth some pulled off their cloaks others their gowns while another party untied their breeches another pulled up their shirts the young ombreval servd for executioner together with another of the same family who had consigned his money in order to be a councellor of parliament  all the people got to the windows upon the noise these poor jesuits made to call to the neighbors for assistance and among others a pretty young girl who was more zealous than the rest to hinder them from receiving any greater affront cried aloud that it deserved a severe punishment as in effect it did but perceiving she was not heard she went down stairs to see if her presence could have a greater influence than her words but alas her charity cost her very dear for these scholars who were far from having so much good nature as she seeing her espouse so earnestly the part of these good fathers that she reproached them for their injustice seized her also pulled up her peticoats behind and whipped her as they had done the jesuits after that she pleaded no more for them but as soon as she got out of their hands she run in and shut the doors and got up to her chamber in great confusion and vexation at her adventure the jesuits had reason to be no less vexed however though the same fate happened to them all they having been all three whipped in the open streets there was still this difference in the sequel that the adventure proved more fatal to the girl than to them the fraternity received them always with the same kindness into the convent they vowed also to revenge it in a little time or dye in the attempt whereas the girl was abandoned by her lover and swore he would not have her they had agreed upon their marriage and the articles had been already signed but he fearing that if he proceeded further he might be called all over the town the husband of the whipped girl could not endure to hear it spoken of they threatened to prosecute him if he did not make good his promise he answered he valued it not and that he would defend himself the best way he could and its probable his reasons might have prevaild for every one condemned the indiscretion of the girl to meddle where she was so little concerned  this action was too public and too bold not to spread in an instant over all paris monsieur d argenson had soon advice of it and it being his duty to find out criminals he sent so many of his spies abroad that he soon discovered young ombreval to be one of them he also knew that this gentleman began the fray and was one of the executioners through whose hands those jesuits had passed he likewise found out the others name who had executed the same office and caused them both to be taken up president novion was extremely offended at him as if he ought to have that deference for him as not to treat after that manner a person that concerned him so nearly but this vanity and haughtiness were very familiar to that family though it was of a far later standing than monsieur d argensons before st innocents shrine was altered which was but lately we had an epitaph extant that shows sufficiently they have neither so much nobility nor grandeur in their race as they would make the world believe it is far different from what we see at this time in the celestines where the duke of gevres one of that family would have us believe that he is lineally descended from st louis though the family be only come from a merchand one fourner who made his son an advocate and that son laid the foundation of the vast grandeur however it be president novion minding that less than the post he possessed thought himself far above monsieur d argenson and wrote to him very disrespectfully upon what he had done monsieur d argenson regarding his letter very little went on in his ordinary course so that the president was fain to take his nephew out of prison and his companion came out after the same manner both of them had a good many friends and the accusation they were charged with being destitute of proof sufficient to bring them to a trial they were very happily cleared of it this was all the jesuits had for their satisfaction and the poor whipped girl for here is besides the mortification of having missed of a husband together with the grief and indignity she received  in the mean time the new king of england sent a new ambassador to court namely the earl of portland his old favorite for the earl of albemarle only succeeded to him if i may say so for though he was his britannick majestys darling yet portland was in as good terms with his master as ever moreover he had this advantage over the other that besides the favor which was common to them both he was confided in this earl renewed that grandeur at our court which was to be seen in the time of the duke of buckingham when he came to demand in marriage for the king his master mary henrietta of france sister to louis xiii of glorious memory i mean by this that he came with such a stately and magnificent equipage that the like had not been seen of a long time with an ambassador he had a permission to bring over with him some frenchmen who had gone into england after the revocation of the edict of nants and who never durst have ventured to return afterward without a passport however degrez whom the court had employed to take up ministers and other persons of that religion looked upon this as a favorable opportunity for him and did not fail to make his advantage of it it being his ordinary custom to render every person suspected in order to make the best of his trade he upon a certain day took up one of the ambassadors ministers while he thought of going to see one of his friends who was an advocate it was very happy for this advocate that he had been all along a catholic for that quality and his wise conduct sheltered him from the evil designs of this kidnapper whose gain it was to cast every one in prison he told him freely his sentiments of such proceedings for he had no orders to do what he did then but it was his ordinary practice that he might be thought the more zealous though all his zeal consisted only in his interest the minister asked him what it was he accusd him of and why he made his prisoner after that manner he being the ambassador of englands domestic to whom only he was obliged to give an account of his conduct it was upon that score that the advocate exclaimed against degrez making him to know that the court would never approve of such proceedings degrez found himself obliged to answer all those demands which the advocate backed with all the arguments he could invent telling him that he engaged himself as well as the king in an unwarrantable action the wound that the war had given to france was still bleeding and degrez knowing that all this mischief was brought upon them by the ambassadors master he thought he was obliged to give him some reason for what he had done he told him that the minister had administered the sacrament to one of his religion and had sent for him to that end to the ambassadors house and that being forbid it was very warrantable for him to take him up as he did and thus he was not afraid to declare himself sacrilegious the better to color his design in effect it is true that was prohibited but it is as true that the minister was never guilty of it and therefore desired to see the person who accused him now degrez had brought a fellow along with him to the advocates door who had endeavored to impose upon the clergyman for this rascal had pretended to be a protestant and applied himself to the minister to procure him a passport for england the minister was in effect imposed upon he believed him in good earnest to be some poor man whom the zeal for his religion obliged to quit his country and friends but knowing that was not permitted he endeavored to comfort him without giving him any other relief but the rascally fellow had no mind to tell his master that answer or if he had degrez pleaded ignorance however the minister was so exceedingly vexed at this calumny that if his character had allowed him to meddle with any of them he had doubtless banged the villain to some purpose but that being impracticable he desired degrez to cause arrest him and told him if he refused it he must be answerable for it to my lord portland and that the king their master was capable to do himself justice and he might come to hear of it in a short time the advocate added that he might find it to his disadvantage these expressions put the little gentleman into a fright he went to monsieur dargenson to know of him how to behave in the matter his officers had always an eye upon the minister after that but monsieur dargenson found that the advocate had advised him well and commanded him to put his advice in execution in fine he was forced to send his man to prison and set the minister at liberty according to the order that monsieur dargenson had given him it is certain this false witness deserved to be hanged or at least to be sent to the galleys to teach all those of the like kidney prudence upon their own expenses but as the wickd find favor rather than honest men whose misfortune brings them into any inconveniency they delayed to proceed against him until my lord portland was gone and then they set him at liberty  all the court showed this ambassador singular marks of honor the daupine the duke of orleans and all the great lords of the court invited him to dinner while he for his part kept a very splendid table the count of auvergne youngest son to the duke of bouillon gave him the use of his lodgings while he stayed at paris and himself went in the mean time to holland to his wifes estate who died there about that time this ambassador had at his entry a hundred liverymen and six coaches three with eight horses and three with six and continued the same grandeur all the time he stayed at court he always made his visits with all that attendance to let the world see how little he resembled a great many of that quality who discharge three parts of their equipage the next day after their entry so that he spent almost a hundred thousand crowns in the two months that his embassy lasted  king james passed his time very indifferently all that while he heard from all hands the honor done to my lord portland which was such as perhaps was never shown before to any ambassador this made some people believe that there were some alliances on foot betwixt the two kings and the more because my lord portland had three or four private audiences of his majesty however while some french people suspected that they thought of dividing flanders between them two after the death of the king of spain whose health was very infirm it came to be known that these private audiences were upon a very different subject my lord portland insisted upon the removing of king james at a farther distance from the kings presence promising in his masters name to give him and the queen a pension sufficient to excuse his majesty from the expense he had been at upon that prince since he had made a sanctuary of his dominions but the king would never give ear to it which exceeded king jamess expectation who in case the king had abandoned him was resolved to retire to avignion for he began already to inform himself if he could live conveniently there for as the king was obliged in policy to make peace with his enemy though he had promised never to make it until he had restored him to his crown he was afraid that the same policy might also induce him to grant what was demanded  the king of spains malady increasing every moment insomuch that it was generally thought he had few days to live did not only move all the powers of europe to delay the reform of their troops after the peace but likewise retarded the evacuation of some places which his majesty was obliged to surrender however the marquis of harcourt received orders to go with all diigence to the court of madrid with this instruction that if he saw no probability as in effect there was none to bring the succession of his catholic majesty to fall upon one of the dauphines sons he should endeavor at least to hinder its coming to any of his imperial majestys children for it was to the emperor and his descendants that philip iv the present king of spains father had left it by his will and the emperr becoming already very powerful by his conquests in hungary he was thereby become so suspected to his majesty that he was resolved to have recourse to his arms rather than suffer it to fall into his hands and accordingly to fright the spaniards he caused to file off sixty thousand men to the frontiers of italy catalonia and navarre he was sensible that would add some weight to his ambassadors discourses and might also awaken the ambition of some grandee of the country  the marquess was no sooner arrived in spain than he applied himself to business he told those who were capable to act in concert with him in an affair of such importance that philip iv had gone beyond his power when he pretended to dispose of his crown at pleasure against the laws of nature that it belonged lawfully to his daughters children and not to his relations in the fourth degree who could pretend to no right of themselves that the dauphine had three sons and the duke of burgundys second brother was still as pliable as wax whom they could mould into any form they pleased and if they would fix their eye upon him they might easily breed him to their own customs that if this failed the prince of bavaria being grand son to a daughter of spain the king his master would rather approve of his election than of the emperors or of any of his children unless they had a mind to follow the example of the poles who to oblige strangers to agree among themselves had twice chosen a sovereign of their own country and this was all the king pretended to considering he could not expect to bring the crown of spain into his own family but the queen of spain having a watchful eye upon the conduct of this ambassador who made it his business to renverse her designs pried narrowly into his intrigues and removed the king her husband some distance from madrid under pretense that the air was prejudicial to his health she carried him to toledo and pretending it was only upon the account of his health would allow no body to follow him thither nay she left some ministers that she confided in at madrid in order to receive whatever any of the ambassadors had a mind to offer the marquis de harcourt saw clearly with what view the queen made this journey and that she intended to be so fully mistress of the king her husbands inclinations that she could obtain of him whatever she had a mind to he feared she might prevail with him to confirm philip ivs will and at the same time observed that the count de hrrach was no more to be seen at madrid and in all probability was gone to toledo upon this he went immediately thither also under pretense of having received a memorial which he forged from the king his master with positive orders to communicate it to his catholic majesty  the queen of spain who did not in the least expect it was extremely surpised to see him there and caused the king her husband to whom he presented his memorial to acquaint him that he had left the cardinal of corduba at madrid on purpose to whom he might have communicated his memorials as well as to him that his principal intention for coming thither was to recover his health and not to trouble himself with business and therefore he might apply himself to the cardinal in all affairs of state however considering that the memorial was not very long and that in all appearance it tended to his own advantage he thought he was obliged to answer it himself one thing to be considered is that the king of morocco had for a long time besieged the fortress of ceuta in barbary which belonged to his catholic majesty but could never take it nor was the king of spain in circumstances to raise the siege though he had attempted it several times in all appearance these  did not carry it on very vigorously whether they were ignorant how to carry it on or that they thought the conquest the more glorious after a siege of so many years his most christian majesty by this memorial offered to the king of spain if he pleased to send men of war and galleys to succor that place his catholic majesty had enough of his own for such an enterprise without being obliged to borrow of any other prince but he was so treacherously served by him whom he had entrusted with his orders that instead of executing them he deserted to the enemies nay he did much worse for not being satisfied to renounce his master only he renounced also jesus christ which was esteemed so great an encouragement for these infidels that after that they thought they had gained all such an accident in effect confounded all the governors his catholic majesty had upon that coast and this was the subject or rather the pretense of the french ambassadors memorial but whether his catholic majesty had no mind to accept of such suspected succors or that he thought he could do without them he thanked the ambassador for the proffer observing with him at the same time all the measures of civility that were proper for the occasion however he who had renounced his king and his faith beginning to be sensible of his fault and to repent of it confessed that he was a christian and abhorred his apostasy but the infidels who had made a great deal of noise of his change expecting to oblige him to return to them by the force of presents and promises endeavored to regain him but seeing him continue in his repentance and that there was no possibility of bringing him over again to them they threatened to treat him as they usually do apostates from their religion i mean they threatened to empale him after torturing but he expected no less and was fully resolved to undergo all being extreme glad to expiate by these torments the heinous crime he had committed against his god and his king so being no ways frightened by their menaces he submitted himself very freely to all the torments they could invent in ine in the middle of these dismal torments he joyfully confessed him whom he had denied upon which they put him at last to death least by his constancy some amongst them might be moved to acknowledge that he suffered for a good cause in regard he seemed so insensible of pain in his torments  after this answer the marquis of harcourt was obliged to return to madrid and endeavored by all means possible to gain the people by a very agreeable conduct his wife the marchioness came also from france to second him for having an infinite deal of wit she thought to infinuate her self by degrees into the queens affection and gain her confidence by the means of some proposals she believed would prove mightily to her advantage with regard to her person it was highly presumptuous in her to entertain that thought to be sure her majesty would be much upon her guard against her for besides her being the wife of a mnarch who is a capital enemy to france there was not the least appearance she would hearken to any thing that came from that nation the queen of spain notwithstanding her being a german began to conform her self to a court where trick and policy are in vogue as much as in any in the universe and therefore segnd presently to be exceedingly charmed with the  to the end she might the more easily know her secrets the marchioness told it to her husband meaning to persuade him to rejoice at it with her but the ambassador though he had always been a man more inclined to the sword than the court was yet cunning and advised her always to suspect so excessive civility he told her it was not natural for the king of spains wife to be so early in a good correspondence with the ambassador of frances lady that it looked like a trick among those who knew better than to judge of things by appearance and therefore all he recommended to her was to be prudent that she ought to hear the queen speak rather than speak her self and by these means she would certainly advance her affairs much better than by endeavoring to be the head of the conversation  while these intrigues proceeded after this manner the princess of conti the kings daughter had some thoughts of marrying mademoiselle de melan eldest daughter to the princess of epinoi to the marquess of la valiere her cousingerman she had a great respect for her and went very often to paris to see her and as for the marquis he was in very good terms with the dauphine she had it in her view at the same time to get him made duke and peer by obtaining from the king the title of his duchy of vaujour to her self in expectation of his succeeding to the propriety of it after her death this land pertaind for a long time to the house of bueil and while it continued in that family had only the title of marquisate but was erected into a duchy in avour of madam de la valiere who since made her self a ca ess monsieur colbrt who had the secret to get her into his interest while she was a favorite bought this land for her by which means he ingratiated himself both in the kings favor and here is it cost him only a hundred thousand crowns though there was as much wood upon it as would answer that money which he sold in a short time after the purchase however mademoiselle de melan flattered her self already with being a duchess very soon which was somewhat better than the imaginary principality her family flattered themselves with when the princess of conti came to know that his majesty had no inclination for that marriage this made her shift sides and seeing the duke of noailles was in great favor with the king she cast her eyes upon one of his daughters there was a whole regiment of them and though there had been three of them already married yet there remained still such a number of them that he was the person in all the court the best provided with means to make sonsinlaw besides they strove who should have them for his majesty had lately conferred a favor upon him that evinced sufficiently the esteem he had for him madam de minn had a nicce who was the only daughter of the count of aubig her brother governor of berry and knight of the kings order this young creature who was very lovely in her person was much more such by the favor and merit of her aunt who took particular care of her education for she thought that her father who loved his game and pleasures and by these means had ruined his affairs so that he was obligd to retire in order either to pick up what might pay his debts or to learn that he must die i say she thought that her father was in no capacity to do any thing for her and therefore by her care she made her a very wellaccomplishd young lady and this quality with all the others which she possessed in an eminent degree made her the desirable object of all the great men of the court who had any sons to marry but there were particularly two who had a great design upon her namely the duke of rochefoucaut who would have given her the prince of marsillac his grandson the other the duke of noailles who had his eldest son the count of again to marry either of these seemed very advantageous for her though the first appeared to be much more such than the last for in effect though the house of noailles be very good and ancient yet the family of rochefoucaut exceeds it at least in the opinion of a great many for all who pretend to know any thing of the grandeur of families make a great difference between them besides though the duke of noailles was captain of the lifeguards a very considerable post the duke of rochefoucaut had two others which were fully as considerable and both of them carry great titles which distinguish them from many others though in effect that of great marshal of the lodgings is small enough for its grandeur on the other hand there are a great many larger estates in his family than the duke of noailles can pretend to the estate of noailles that lies just by turenne is nothing in comparison of wertheux and of rochegyon that must of necessity fall one day to the prince of marsillac without reckoning a great many other lands which the duke of rochefoucaut and the duke of rocheguyon his father have so that every one believed that the prince of marsillac would carry the young lady when the king declared himself in favor of the count of again the king himself gave her a portion and not thinking it sufficient to give her eight hundred thousand livers he also conferred so many favors upon her husband that a great many princes and even princes of the blood would have been very glad to receive em he gave him the survivance of the government of roussillon which the duke of noailles had that of the government of berry which the count of aubignie had a hundred thousand livres in jewels to the young lady and in fine a great many other things that showed no less the magnificence of the king than the particular friendship he had for their relations and this demonstrated how much they were in the right who courted the alliance of the duke of noailles but the king as an additional superabounding favor gave the young count his shirt when he was ready to go to bed while the duchess of burgundy performed the same office to the young lady one would have thought that there remained nothing to be done after so many favors but his majesty who is an inexhaustible fountain of goodness gave each of them a pension of eight thousand livres a years and to complete the work said that provided the count were a good man he might assure himself he should never want for any thing  it being no mean thing to become a brotherinlaw to such a gentleman as this madam the princess of conti managed the match betwixt her cousin and his sister she secured to her his duchy by the contract of marriage and the affair being thus concluded the dauphine conceived so great a friendship for the new married gentleman that he could go no where without him he had him always by his side in his coach as if they had but one coach betwixt them both and leaned his head always to his as if he had been his mistress and in a sporting way called him violet a name that formerly was not much coveted being only proper for footmen or that sort of cattle but now became very fashionable amongst the courtiers the dauphine is naturally of a sweet temper and an enemy to all manner of constraint he is not capable of having any great inclination for women and though he may have loved one or two of them knowing that the fair sex requires complaisance he did not regard them so much upon the account of their easiness as of their virtue dumont one of his masters of the horse who was much in his favor brought them always to him by private stairs when he wanted them and sent them immediately back when he had done this prince chusd them ordinarily amongst the actresses of the opera or comedy upon which there happened to him a very pleasant rencounter that deserves some place in this work having caused dumont to speak to one of the actresses of the opera he agreed with her that she should come to meudon to the end he might introduce her to the dauphins closet by the private stairs they condescended upon the day and hour the actress though a person void of ceremony thought it not very decent to go thither alone and so brought one of her sisters along with her the dauphine had some person with him in his closet when they arrived which obliged dumont to tell them to wait in a place where he posted them near the closet at the same time he made it known to the dauphine by a sign that his fair lady was come to the end he might discharge his company the dauphine ordered him to go some where or other and in the mean time the dauphines company judging they where somewhat inconvenient to him took there leave dumont having left the private door half open the actresss sister hearing no noise in the room had the curiosity to look into it the dauphine who only waited for dumonts return to have her sister introduced having his eyes fixed by chance that way where the other was looking no sooner saw a womans coiffe at the door but taking her to be the person he had a mind to he desired her to come in she thought it good manners to obey though it was none of her he meant but whether his eyes were somewhat dim that day or that he was in such haste that he had no time to consider her aright he gave her the same usage he designed for her sister after which having no further inclination for the ladys conversation he sent her away immediately she told her sister nothing of this adventure the actress still waited for dumont and longed much for his coming in fine he returned by the private stairs and told her he was a going to speak to the dauphin in order to bring her in the dauphine told him the he had had all the conversation with her he intended and desired him to give her five hundred louis dores and send her home dumont who had seen her very impatient to enter knew nothing of what he meant by that and entreated the dauphine to explain himself in fine he came to know what passed but not knowing with whom he went and told the actress that if her appetite was so very good it was not the same with the dauphines she was extremely surpised at his complement but understood by it that her sister had deceived her and was so extremely vexed at it that she would never be reconciled with her till she condescended to divide the five hundred louis dores with her which the dauphine had sent to her  the furious war which the king had maintained against so many potentates had encouraged some of the new converts to profess their former religion notwithstanding the prohibition to the contrary his majesty caused to take up a great many of them in the neighborhood of orange as they were returning thence from sermon some of them were treated very severely while others got off for a month or twos imprisonment the king set also guards upon all the avenues of that town to hinder them from returning thither any more but not being entirely satisfied with this precaution he made very strict edicts against all such who should dare in prejudice of the prohibition to venture to go thither again but this was not the only disobedience that appeared in a short space of time for not one of them went to mass and his majesty being informed of it from all parts and finding it a matter that ought to be remedied if he meant to prevent some dangerous accidents deliberated with his council how he ought to proceed against these obstinate people they were all at a loss how to advise him upon that occasion insomuch that the affair remained undecided and the king wrote to the most part of the bishops and intendants to have their judgment in writing these differed in their sentiments from one another some advised him to make use only of exhortations in order to make them obedient others were for a severe usage those who were of this last sentiment were so much the more warm in it because they imagined though unjustly that the king of england had used these means with regard to the catholics of ireland who not willing to submit to the present government were fain to look for a sanctuary in france to shelter themselves from the punishment that was due to their rebellion these people of all ages and conditions coming over in whole troops to france never failed to spread abroad that they had been obliged to quit their country in order to avoid the violence that was done to their consciences the king gave them five hundred pistols in charity which was thought but a small mite for so great a king however he appointed some ladies of the court to raise an offering for them amongst the persons of quality the curats of paris followed that example and caused also an offering to be made in their parishes to supply their necessity but their being a great many monks and priests amongst these refugees the archbishop of paris would have them to say their masses in nore dame by way of preference to all the french priests who used to celebrate em there he did them also particular acts of charity for being extraordinary pious he omitted nothing that was in his power for their relief  in the mean time the earl of jersey brother in law to the earl of portland was named by the king of england to succeed this last in france the king had no mind to speak to my lord portland of any thing that passed in ireland least he might thence take occasion to speak to him of the protestants in france he made him a present of his picture richly set with diamonds according to the ordinary practice of this court with a regard to all ambassadors  but there was this difference made betwixt him and others that the diamonds upon the present made to him were three times more rich than they upon any others the king probably meant that his present should bear some proportion to the expenses he had been at or perhaps knowing he was in good terms with his master he was glad to have his favor upon occasion some few days before his departure the king made a review of his household and king james was there as was also this lord who perhaps had forborne coming if he had known that the other was to be there the prince of wales came thither also and had particular orders from the king his father to join conversation with that lords son to whom he had caused to insinuate before that he never pretended to make him answerable for what his master had done against him this young prince being only a child was hardly capable of such an entertainment but he had placed such persons about him as were able to inform him and even continue the discourse if necessary i do not know what he meant by it however my lord portland knowing the young princes design sent to tell his son to avoid him and himself shunned all those of king jamess court the review being over he left france in a few days after leaving a great esteem for him amongst all the courtiers however before he went he was to see all the kings houses in the neighborhood of paris and found them of a far different magnificence from his majestys houses in holland and england he went to chantilly in his road whither the prince of conde went a purpose to entertain him and thus here turned home extremely satisfied with the honor done him every where and gave an account to his master of all that passed in his embassy this prince was not ill pleased at the news of the king of spains sickness for it being upon that account that france continued still armed he likewise kept up his troops so as that the english could not find fault with it he knew his greatness and safety consisted in the number of his troops and having enemies both within and without his kingdom there was nothing more capable to gain him respect than to have always a good army at his command  this prince having made it to appear upon all occasions that he had an infinite deal of sense was not in the least mistaken upon this occasion for finding it his interest upon two accounts to keep france continually in arms both as it was a means to exhaust his forces and as it would prove always a good pretense for him to keep up his own army he advised to have it ratified at the diet of ratisbon that the princes of the empire should always keep up a hundred and twenty thousand men in arms in the time of peace for he was sensible the more they had the more france would be obliged to have on that side and there being but a small distance betwixt england and france he would by those means be always upon his guard it was also believed that in policy he asked of the king to remove king james and his wife at a distance from him though he doubted the king would never consent to it but it would be such a pretense for him to show the parliament that having a considerable enemy so nigh him prudence would oblige him to keep himself always in a condition to resist him in case of necessity  but whether he meant to enlarge upon that or that in effect king james who had attempted several times to remount his throne by fomenting insurrections in england began to attempt the same again or whatever else was in it he caused a great many persons to be taken up and among others the earl of clancarty as if he had meant to raise new troubles the earl had been captain of the guards to king james and had passed once more before into that country in order to do him service but he had no such design at this time he had only went thither under the benefit of the peace though the new king had excluded him from it as he had done a great many others who had continued after a certain time in the service of his enemy however this earl being a person of quality his imprisonment made no little noise for instead of sending him to the tower they put him up in newgate this was by no means disagreeable to the king for the more the prisoner was a man of quality the greater impression his return into the country made upon the minds of the people for they knew he was guilty the last time he came into the kingdom because he had made his escape out of the tower for at that time he proposed to a lady of quality who came to see him to allow him to make his escape under her petticoats this lady being as large as he was little condescended very willingly at the peril of whatever could happen for besides the apprehension she was under of being caught in the commission of a flaming crime and being kept prisoner her self she allowed his approaches to a place with which the ladies hardly suffer such near communication at least without some scruple whatever was in it he played his game so well that he made his escape without being discovered and from that time kept always about king james till the time of his being retaken that i mentioned but now  it was a long time before the english could be sensible of any pretense their king had to keep any troops on foot in the present posture of the affairs of europe in general or of their own in particular on the other hard it was given out a pretty while before that his christian majesty was to have a camp near campiegne where the duke of burgundy was to command and though it was said publicly it was designed only to let him see something in warlike affairs and to accustom him by degrees to such great things as were due to his birth yet it bred some jealousy so that the english continued still quiet but the natural restlessness of that nation never allows them to be long at ease in fine they complained that being exhausted by the war it was impossible for them to continue the same expenses in the time of peace the king of england thinking to satisfy them in some degree made a reform of some regiments and of others he sent some into holland and some into ireland believing that these being once out of their sight they would be apt to forget them but they still insisted upon their former complaints and to speak the truth they had good politic reasons to do what they did not only with regard to themselves but also with regard to all europe  in the mean time the encampment which the king intended was put off to september to the end that the people in the neighborhood might have opportunity to make their harvest and gather in all their corn so in this interval of time there fell out some remarkable things at court one of the most considerable which perhaps has no parallel in this age was as follows monsieur de pelletier who had been controler general of the finances and whom the king had made an officer of state quitted a hundred thousand livers a year which he possessed by the kings liberality to be freed from all manner of business and have time to mind his salvation his majesty had a mind to allow him some pension and was so much the more earnest to do it because he could never sufficiently admire such a resolution but after all his remonstrances he only prevailed so far as to oblige him to accept of twenty thousand livers a year to maintain a table for his family his place in the post house which was valued at two and thirty thousand livers a year was given to monsieur pomponne who however pious he was thought to be thought such a post not inconsistent with his devotion monsieur pelletier retired immediately to his castle of vlle neuf within three or four leagues of paris and discarded the most part of his domestics his brother who was intendant of the finances being angry that he had not named him to his majesty for comptrouler general of the finances when he quited it was exceedingly vexed because he had not acquainted him with his intention in order to fall upon measures to make some advantage of his spoil  moreover he went the next day to versailles and told the king without waiting in the least for what his majesty had a mind to say upon the subject that though it was generally said in the world that the younger ought to follow the example of the elder yet he would take care not to imitate his brother that in effect he was so far from believing that his majestys service could in the ast hurt his salvation that on the contrary there was nothing more useful either for this world or the world to come so that his majesty might when he thought fit load him with more business without giving him the least disturbance that he would always continue in his ordinary road without ever thinking of shuting himself up either in a cloister or a country house  he was easily believed without swearing for every body was sensible how little inclination he had to quit the world besides the world knew that he was not a man who troubled himself very much with business he never loved to overcharge himself for of whatever consequence the affair was his buildings and garden were first looked after not but that he had a great deal of sense and in that even exceeded his eldest brother but being of their judgment who believe that charity begins as home he never cared to belly a maxim which time and custom had so well established in the world  while both the court and king admired monsieur pelletiers conduct there fell out an accident betwixt two courtiers at marli that had proved of a more troublesome consequence if it had not been moderated by the bystanders the matter was this the count of auvergne was playing at omber with some other lords and monsieur de lausun lookig over them began to utter a great many silly expressions which vexed the count insomuch that he threw down his cards the gamsters asked him what he meant the count answered that it was impossible to play while he heard monsieur lausuns edious discourse and as for him he could not have the complaisance to relish it monsieur lausun being always sensible of the honor he had in marrying henry iv his grandchild and upon that account respecting very little such digrities which had no better foundation than the counts was something moved at these words and mde him a harsh answer the gentlemen who were present asked them what they meant by quarrelling in that place and being friends to both parties presently put a stop to the quarrel  about the same time two more considerable persons happened to quarrel i mean the prince of conti and the chevalier of vendome grand prior of france they were also playing at omher and the grand prior having called gano at the third lift and gaining codille the prince of conti told the person who had made him gano that he was too simple to believe him he being a man that took his advantage where he could find it and that he had never seen him play after any other manner the grand prior took notice of that word and said it was very reproachful under a dubious sense the prince of conti took no notice of what he had answered whether he meant to show himself somewhat wiser than the other or that he thought the terms he made use of obliged him to make that answer but after the game was ended the chevalier of vendome went to paris and returned the next day to versailles with a long rapier by his side the courtiers asked one another whom he had a design upon in carrying that rapier no body dreamt of what had passed the night before betwixt him and the prince of conti and the rather because there were hardly two persons less capable of counteracting the kings orders however the grand prior having posted himself where the prince was to pass along no sooner saw him than he drew upon him telling him he must needs remember what he had said the night before and as these things were not to be suffered by people of their circumstances so he had a mind to see him with sword in hand the grand prior meant by these words to put himself in competition with him which displeased the prince exceedingly insomuch that he told him he had forgot himself to speak to him after that manner the duke of bourbon was coming along in the mean time and the prince of conti calling him told him that he was equally concerned with him in the affair the chevalier having said that there was no difference betwixt him and the princes of the blood so he desired to know his opinion of it and if he thought fit to suffer it the duke acquainted the dauphin with it and the dauphin immediately informed the king upon which his majesty gave orders to mr pontchartrain to send the grand prior to the bastille the grand prior desired to be admitted to the king to acquaint him with his reasons but his majesty had no mind to hear him and ordered his vshers to shut the chamber door against him insomuch that this prince was at last obliged to obey and went of his own accord to prison  at that time there was no governor of the bastille for mr de besmax who had been governor forty years at least was dead six or seven months and his majesty had not yet named any for that government not but that there were persons enough who solicited for it for the vast riches which the late governor had made by it was a sufficient motive for a great many the governor of pignerl being at that time without employ that place being given up by the peace solicited earnestly for it he had also a great many competitors for even the duke of mine had a mind to it for that castle being joined to the arsenal he would have been very glad to unite the chrge of it to that of great master of the artillery as it was in the time of the duke of sliy the marquis of sanveri under governor of the young princes and the late governor s son in law had also an eye upon it but upon condition that he should not be obliged to reside there and might have a fixed sallary as other governments had but this was quite contrary to his father in law his practice who always thought the advantage he made by the prisoners more preferable a thousand times than what the king had given other governors but whether his son in law considered that these profits were much sunk by the peace or that  to keep also the post he was in he insisted  the same thing the king had a great inclination  him but was desirous to have the  reside ther so the gentleman dropped his pretensions as soon as he knew his majestys intention m  captain of the guards put also in for  without doubt had carried it had it depended  the prisoners to choose a governor for themselves he was in effect of a more generous family  the gentleman who possessed it last nor did  degenerate from the virtue of his  he was nephew to mr de pontchar  in sufficient circumstances to relieve th  ffect was very charitable ever since  ed into the ministry this minister  that it was very proper for his nephew ho was very sickly and upon that account ready to lay down his charge not being capable to serve the two ast campaigns and therefore he supported his pretentions but mr barbesieux proposed to the king mr de cinqmars governor of the islands of st honorat and st marguerite and his majesty seeming to have some inclination for him desired barbesieux to write to him that he might have that government instead of his own if he inclined to change  st mars was very old and having passed his younger days in the service of the prince of conde he had made a prodigious fortune for he was chosen by the king to guard mr fonqet and mr lansun so that by these means he was become extremely rich and besides he was far from being covetous as mr besmaux was upon that account he returned answer to the marquis of barbesieux that he had no inclination to change if his majesty pleased to continue him where he was but this minister being very desirous to have that government in the hands of a person devoted to his family as mr st mars ought to be because he was obliged to his father for his fortune had no mind to be satisfied with this answer but wrote again to him upon the same subject setting forth that he neglected his own good fortune and besides might have the advantage to be near his family which he ought to regard as a singular happiness having been absent from it for many years mr st mars was born in the neighborhood of paris moreover he was married to madam frenoys sister which had contributed above all to his establishment this was therefore the way to attack him upon his weak side however it be he took this letter to be a kind of command and therefore made answer that he would obey it as soon as mr saumery knew this he asked that government of the king which his majesty granted to him but in a few days after he broke a company that had been raised on purpose for mr cinqmars when he guarded mr fouquet and which he had ever since along with him in the islands of st honorat and st marguerite the captain had a sallary of two thousand crowns besides his profits so that mr saumery lost all on a sudden the half of the gratification he thought to receive in the mean time the chevalier of vendome was come to the bastille whither very few lords went to see him for fear of displeasing his majesty who had so resented his conduct some were also unwilling to go fearing the prince of contis displeasure and in effect the prince checked mr d alegre for having gone thither mr d alegre answered that he did not believe that his highness would have took it ill but since he knew his mind he would for the future avoid displeasing him the prince accepted of his excuse and the marshals of catinat and tourville having also gone thither they thought to make the same apology but the prince saying nothing to them it passed over in silence  the duke of vendome was at anet when his brother was commanded to prison but as soon as he heard it he took post to be informed by him of the affair and after he had learned it he thought the best way to obtain his freedom was by the interest of the same person who had got him confined he therefore went immediately to wait upon the prince of conti to that purpose and this being all the satisfaction the prince demanded he went himself to the king to ask the grand priors liberty the king made him answer that if he was satisfied yet himself was not so that eight or ten days were gone before his majesty would pardon that prince at last his majesty was prevailed upon by the solicitations of the prince of conti and the duke of vendome the duke himself carried the order for his liberty and brought him along with him to a certain place where four or five persons were drunk in solemnizing their joy for the grand priors liberty  in the mean time the marquis and marchioness of monthevreuil sent also one of their sons into that prison not because he intended to fight like the grand prior but rather upon the account of a report was spread abroad of his being married at rochelle whither they had sent to apprehend him they resolved to send him to the american islands in order to make him forget his amors the king was preparing a fleet to be sent into these countries and de gennes captain of a man of war a man very well known amongst the sea officers was to command it it was thought the court designed to seize an island in those parts the inhabitants of which had driven the spaniards from the greatest part of it insomuch that they were forced to retire to a small corner of it it was thither that the father and mother intended to send their son in order to do penance for his too warm amors as if love had been a capital crime but this fleet giving some occasion of jealousy to the english and hollanders his majesty was fain to desist though it was already pretty well advanced and that excused the chvalier of moutcheuruil from the voyage who was made lieutenant of a ship and doubtless had quickly been made captain if his prudence had been equal to his courage but he made a very insolent answer to monsieur de maurepas when he asked him concerning some things he was accused of having taken out of one of the ships which the marquis of nesmond had taken so that his relations did not judge it convenient to continue him any longer in the sea service for having once failed in his respect to mr de maurepas there was no probability that he would ever pardon him  the duke of rochefoucaut after the marriage of the count of again had not only reformed his table and retiue that were both very magnificent but under some special pretext retired to liancourt a place belonging to one of his sons at ten or twelve leagues distance from paris however having staid  weeks there he returned to court the king suspected that he was somewhat out of humor at the match he had experience enough to know that his favors conferred to the preudice of another gave as much jealousy as a mistrisss favor to the prejudice of a rival yet he took no notice of it to him but he loved his person and received him as affectionately as he had used to do in the mean time the duke of lerraine sent monsieur de couvonges to versailles to demand in his name mademoielle in marriage the king expected always both before the peace and since it was made that this princess should have no other husband but the king of the romans nor was there any princess in europe had more pretentions to that happiness than she but the empress had so very little inclination for france that though mademoiselle had been the kings own daughter instead of being the duke of orleanss she would have preferred the meanest princess in germany to her but the queen of poland the duke of lorrains mother when she perceived the design of the french was extremely vexed at it in regard of her sons interest for being a princess of extraordinary wit she knew that the situation of that young princes estate would oblige him to prefer an alliance with france to any other and therefore she thought of making mademoiselle her daughter in law however she was willing to have the emperors consent to it who insinuated often to her that he would gladly bestow the archduchesse his eldest daughter upon the duke but the emperor was prevailed upon by her reasons and the king accepted of monsieur de couvongess offer in the name of his master having named mr pntchartrain and some other considerable persons of his council todraw up the articles of marriage which both parties soon agreed upon however there arose a difficulty that retarded the affair for some time for the duke of orleans had no other male children than the duke of chartres and that duke had only daughters this they had not foreseen in the beginning but the court thought fit to find some expedient for it before they would proceed any further the difficulty consisted mainly in this point that if the duke of chartres came to die without male issue then mademoiselle might have right to divide the succession of the duchess her mother with her brothers daughters moreover that succession was very considerable for besides ready money plate and jewels and a vast quantity of furniture which she had already inherited by the death of her brother the elector palatin they had also adjudgd to her two hundred thousand livers of rent until they had regulated the share she ought to have in the succession of that elector but they would have mademoiselle renounce her succession in case her brother came to die without male issue which monsieur de couvonges had no mind to do without express orders the duke of lorraines council found that clause too severe however this prince being still very young and of a very exemplary piety in which he resembled his mother very much who died soon after the marriage had been resolved upon he thought that upon all accounts it was his advantage as indeed it was to have a princess of france for a wife and therefore sacrificed all other considerations to that policy and consented to renounce all he could pretend to by the dutchesses succession in case the duke of chartres dyed without heirs upon condition of having four hundred thousand livers paid to him  in this manner the marriage of the duke with mademoiselle was agreed upon and they delayed only the final conclusion of it till the end of the camp that was to be made in honor of the duke of burgundy they brought thither a great many more troops than they had at first thought upon which created some mistrust in the neighboring potentates they were sensible that the king had filed off a great many troops to the frontiers of spain nor were they ignorant of what was commonly reported of his catholic majestys health and therefore were afraid that this camp and all these troops were designed to make a sudden irruption into his territories if by chance he came to die which in effect appeared very probable by all the accounts we ad of him however the king had at last evacuted all the places he was to give up by the yreaty of ryswick and as it must needs take up a great deal of time to retake them the spaniards and their allies had always this comfort that they could dispute every inch of ground if they came to be attacked the king named mareshal de boufflers to command this camp under the duke of burgund and as the king was very sensible that he was a person very apt to ruin himself in order to maintain the dignity which the king conferred upon him as preferable to all others his majesty made him a present of fifty thousand crowns before he marched though the camp was to continue only the wks so that this sum appeared pretty reaonable for so short a time but this mareshal who affected always to be expensive and even in his first employments would fain appear somewhat like turenne in regarding nothing but his glory and having no manner of value for money made such a prodigious expense in that camp that twice so large a sum hardly excused him he had five tables morning and evening all equally served the most rare and nice things in the kingdom were there in abundance nor was there ever seen better or more delicate cheer he had above a hundred head cooks besides those who served under them and those who wrought in the morning took their rest in the afternoon he had an infinite number of carriages in the field to bring his provisions he had two carriages for ice only which was brought from paris every day and had fresh horses laid always half way for them because it was impossible for the same horses to bring it all the way without bursting and all his other carriages he had in the field were served after the same manner he had ourveyors not only at paris but also in all the great towns within twenty or five and twenty leagues of the camp every table had two stewars and the chief overseer of his officers was a person who had served formerly the archbishop of paris for he was perhaps the only man in the nation who understood these affairs best being always obeyed at first word so that all was done with such an extraordinary sumptuous splendor that it is impossible to describe it right  this camp ruined the officers entirely who had suffered extremely before by the expenses they were obliged to be at during the war however not one of them minded any thing but how to please the king neither more nor less than if he had been a deity there was never any thing to be seen so splendid and magnificent as all  officers from the highest to the lowest all the troops and foot soldiers were new clothed and that cost some regiments above five and twenty thousand crowns but while they impoverished themselves paris was enriched by it for  twenty days before the camp was formed there was nothing to be seen at the merchants doors but large bales which were carried away every moment it is altogether impossible to tell how much provisions were carried from that  to that camp and in all probability it had been sufficient to have starved the city if the merchants had not been very provident before hand and as strangers are always curious there was not hardly one of them who went not to see the camp opportunities of that nature falling out but very seldom so that propely speaking it was only one continued procession from paris to compiegne where it was impossible to find lodging for money and all innkeepers were expressly forbid to receive any body whether they meant to save their lodgings for the people of the court or that they had no mind to  that town with a number of unknown people and by that means prevent all dangerous accidents  the  the camp was to continue being quite  the king returned to versailles with all the court having first bestowed considerable largesses upon all the troops the great magnificence that appeared here undeceived the strangers of the opinion they had brought with them from their own country to wit that france had been exhausted both of men and money they had already seen the contrary at the duke of burgundys marriage by the great confluence of people they found at paris but what they had seen upon this occasion having quite disabused them they began to look upon the king as another croesus whose riches were inexhaustible  but if this prince was so rich as there was no reason to doubt of it his people were in extreme poverty insomuch that they wanted a great many things to supply their necessities but as soon as the king had made the peace he thought of contributing to their ease he made diverse edicts in favor of the country people whose lands were altogether waste for want of means to cultivate em he also provided by an act of council that there should be no order to sell the lands of those who carried arms the preceding years he allowed them some time for the payment of their debts but all this being only paper twas impossible for any body to relieve their necessity without money and a great many people thought that it had been of far greater advantage to the kingdom if his majesty instead of spending his money so lavishly upon that camp had dealt it amongst his people in order to buy them cattle all the country was quite out of cattle and by lending the people some money whereby they might furnish themselves with some he had restored a great many to life who were ready to perish upon the want they had suffered for a long time not but that the king had relieved his people in some manner in taking off the capitation he had also sunk a great many other taxes which were raised during the war but the subsidies were agumented by a third besides the corn that had continued dear for a long time became daily dearer which occasioned new desolation in a great many families and the poor gentry was most of all to be pitied especially those who had children for after the peace they knew not how to bestow them because by the reform which was made of the troops they sent home all the lieutenants as useless members nor did they continue the pay of a reform to any but to captains and lieutenants who had served at least ten years insomuch that those who served under that time were in the most deplorable condition imaginable  the marquis of dangeau great master of the order of st lazarus made at that time an establishment that evinced sufficiently how much good he would have done if it had been in his power he had established companies of cadets that had been very useful for poor gentlemen as well as for those they received amongst them for though these companies had been instituted in all appearance only in consideration of them yet of late they have received all sorts of people even such persons as could have no other communication with them but with regard to the liveries they had carried formerly in effect you might have seen footboys amongst them and many others who were so far from being the children of fathers who lived nobly who only ought to be admitted there that they were only of the um of the people but it was not with regard to that alone that affairs took another turn some while ago in the kingdom the world was astohd to  that the same nobility who were formerly reputed the support of the state was now  ino so great contempt under the ministry of the maquis of louvois that very odious lis were psted up against them they were  with the greatest indignity imaginable  forsooth that one man who had  nobility of anjou though he was rather  up his liquor than to command them  himself to be surprised and thus made them answerable for his fault insomuch  there was nothing to be seen but libels posted up in every corner against them as if the igrn of one commander was sufficent to make as many criminals as there were gentlemen and ever since they were obliged to mixthemselves amongst the burgesses to go upon the arier ban and besides serving upon their own expenses according to the ordinary custom they had the additional mortification to serve amongst a scum that was unworthy to have any room in their company however the marquis of dangeau who had not always been very rich and consequently knew what satisfaction twas for a man of quality who was not in circumstances to educate his children according to their ranks to have them otherwise provided for resolved to establish a fond out of a certain share of the revenues of the grandmastership for the education of some children of quality he proposed the thing to the king and his majesty left the disposal of it to his own choice upon which he took eight children out of the principal families of the kingdom viz of the house of montmorency of the house of crequi of the house of ailly of maille etc he hired a house for them near charonne and gave them masters of all sorts with boys to serve them the abbot of dangeau his brother being willing to contribute to so excellent an institution took upon himself the charge of overseeing them there was non more capable of the employ he being very learned and it was long of himself that the king had not conferred a bishopric and considerable abbeys upon him but his majesty knowing he loved his pleasure too much he thought it sufficient to secure him from starving  about that time the duke of chaulnes fell sick and languishd some time before he died he possessed a great many considerable employments both within and without the kingdom and by these means made himself both friends and enemies a certain gentleman who had always appeared to be of the number of the last thought it now his duty to endeavor a reconciliation with him before he expired i mean the cardinal destrees who was at rome while the duke was ambassador extraordinary at that court from the king the cardinal was reputed a man of parts and upon that account was ambitious to have the preference over all which was the cause of their difference but the respect shown to the duke at the court of rome gave him some ombrage so that their misunderstanding was no secret any any where and no consideration obliged the cardinal to observe any measures in it however whether he thought himself in the wrong or that he had a mind to appear a good christian he came at that time to ask his pardon the duke was extremely surpised when they told him the cardinal was come to wait on him it was no more seasonable for him to think upon any resentment though perhaps he had been very capable of it at another time therefore he desired he might come in and there they were reconciled to one another in a few days after the duke died and left the chancellor his testamentary executor the dceasd had married the widow of the marquis of st maigrin lieutenant of the light horse they had been married a long time without having any issue so that in order to make his urt the better to monsieur colbert when he married his eldest daughter to the duke of che his cousin german he instituted the  should be begotten of that marriage for s her he only reserved for himself the  undred thousand livers of which he lt twenty thousand crowns to the chancell and the rest to some of his domestics at the time o his death he was governor of  he had formerly been governor of brittany but this last government was thought very proper for the count of thoulouse the kings natural son therefore his majesty got him to resign it in his favor and the king gave him that of guyenne in exchange  the government of guyenne was not long vacant after his death which fell out very conveniently for the duke of chartres to whom the king had promised it when that duke married the count of thoulouses sister the king had given the survivance of it to the duke of chevreuse but that duke had already a hundred thousand livers in rent and besides the duke of chaulnes his lands produced no less so that all of a sudden two hundred thousand livers a year fell into the family so that he was already become so rich that that government would prove rather superfluous than useful to him but quietist as he was he loved riches nothing the less however i believe they did wrong him in reputing him a sectrian at last he made so much interest to have the survivance of that government that it was easy to perceive molinoss suspected disciples are not indifferent of matters yet be how it will the archbishop of cambray was nothing like him he suffered his exile very peaceably and without making the least noise bore the imprisonment of his good friend madam guyon she was brought from the convent about easter time in order to be sent to the bastille where she was left for four or five months to examine her conscience and then she was interrogated though it is impossible to know upon what for that sort of things are always very secret but according to what one can judge it was upon some things contained in a book published by the archbishop of meaux against the archbishop of cambray in which she was made mention of that book contained very extraodinary matters against her it charged her with a great many revelations and miracles in a word it endeavored by rendering her ridiculous to make the blow fall upon the archbishop of cambray her good friend however the bishop of meaux his principal adversary could not obtain his being declared a heretic pursuant to his allegations the court of rome whose business it is to give sentence upon that head was very reserved upon the point whether it was that they saw no occasion for such a declaration or that by drilling on the affair they thought to appear more mysterious the court espoused the bishop of meauxs interest very much and after having removed the archbishop of cambray from the duke of burgundys presence did likewise remove his nephew that princes subpreceptor together with some other persons who were suspected of adhering to his sentiments two of his waiting gentlemen were among the number of those who were disgraced though the occasion of it might seem foreign enough to their profession in fine to cut off all hopes of ever returning to be about his person others were put in their places who perhaps are no better men than they for we must know that those who were removed were persons of exemplary piety insomuch that all the kingdom over there were none to be found that lived a more christian life however their enemies employed all their art to ruin them whether it was that they really thought them tainted with that doctrine or that they only covered their private views with that pretense so it was that new faces started up all of a sudden about the young prince this was not at all agreeable to the prince at least it seemed so the bishop of cambray who wrote from time to time to the pope according as the diverse charges were laid against him having at that time sent his holiness a letter which was mightily cried up the young prince declared openly that he would be glad to see it but besides that there were but very few copies of it to be seen in the kingdom grievous punishments being inflicted upon those who dispersed them nobody durst offer to satisfy his desire for fear of displeasing the king from thence the a b of cambrays friends took occasion to censure his enemies they published that it was always allowable for any man to make his defenses and their offering in this manner to hinder them spoke their unjustice the vulgar people who commonly take upon them to decide every thing though without forming any judgment of the affair presently applauded these complaints without considering that in religious matters there are some things better concealed than known that heresies are sooner propagated by reading than by conversation so that all writings though never so little suspected cannot be too cautiously prohibited but notwithstanding all the prohibitions against the bringing in of these letters two bags were brought not only into the kingdom but even into the gates of paris monsieur dargenson smelt the matter and understood that they were brought into town in coaches and in effect two hackneycoaches were sent to take them up at the houses where they were lodged without knowing what they were but before they entered the town care was taken to examine them and as soon as monsieur dargenson found what they were he burnt them one after another in his closet but after all such was the curiosity of some that though every one detested quietism as it was represented by the bishop of cambrays enemies yet all that could escape that marshals view were sold at four louis dors the piece  the duke destrees governor of the isle of france followed monsieur dchaulnes very speedily though there was a great deal of difference between their ages the one being but fifty years old and the other seventy the d of d estrees died after being cut of the stone and the fault was not so much laid upon the surgeon as upon an accident that he could not foresee he had delayed the performing of the operation till the great heat was over but the heat returning unexpectedly with much thunder his wound which had formerly been in a good condition gave over suppurating and so he tipd off in a minute he left the affairs of his family in great disorder his son had married for his first wife the daughter of monsieur de lionne secretary of state by whom he had a son and some daughters and for his second a daughter of the marquis de vaubrun lieutenant of the kings armies this last did not know where to recover her dowry and by consequence had been at a loss where to secure her jointure if the bishop of laon her husbands brother had not engaged in the contract of marriage for two hundred thousand livers to the children that he should have by her the king to whom the duke had recommended his family before he was cut gave his government to his eldest son the other depended solely upon his succession to his mother who could not but be very rich tho she had lost something by her husband for her mother was still alive as well as her mothers father who was worth two millions of money now he having only two heiresses namely the marchioness of malevrier and her self the half of it was one day to be hes it is true the duchess had a brother who pursuant to the preference of males was entitled to the better half of the succession but e being set apart for the church by reason of his dcripitness and being already possessed of benefices s reckoned that he ought never to marry and i  there was no great appearance or it though we every day meet with things more extraordinary than that but the thing that troubled her most was that he loved money so that tho he did not marry it was to be feared he might not grant her his share of his grandfathers estate he had but lately given a signal instance of his love for money by maintaining a lawsuit for a small living that he had procured from him whose natural right it was to grant it the dean of nants possessed it formerly and he having resigned it to one of his friends abbot vaubrun pretended that his resignation could not be valid for that he had not lived upon it a competent space of time for being admitted in the court of rome however the contrary seemed to appear by the will of the deceased but he affirmed that to be a fraud and said that the curae was cheated in the mean time he had a permission to raise monitory letters in order to find a discovery by those that had assisted to keep the body a long time after his death that they might favor his party however fearing lest those who were concerned might be pretty nimble he obtained a decree in justice that the body should be uninterrd pretending that by viewing it it were easy to discover the cheat the judges granted him his demand and so the poor body was pulled out of the coffin half rotten in fine though it cast a very nauseous smell so that it was impossible to approach it by a hundred paces yet he caused it to be viewed by the physicians and surgeons in order to have their opinion of it he put em upon an odd sort of business but thinking they were very well accustomed to these sort of perfumes he did not regard it so much the physicians and surgeons turned over and over the dead body and having given a doubtful account of it it was interred again in a more stinking condition than it had been when it was taken up the abbot vaubrun seeing that by their judgment he was like to be cast and condemned to pay the charges obtained another judgment that the same body might be viewed by other more skilful persons and thus it was taken up a second time and these skilful gentlemen having been more favorable to him than the former he in the end gained the suit  in the mean time the abbot of rochefoucaut coming to die the abbot verthuel his brother asked two good abbeys which he had possessed but his majesty refused him however having always a great esteem for the duke of rochefoucaut brother to the two abbots though he had absented from coming to court for six weeks after the count of ayens marriage he condescended to give him a reason for that refusal because as his majesty alleged he had not found the abbot vertheuels conduct regular enough to oblige him to bestow upon him goods of the church which perhaps he might employ to an other use than they were designed for his majesty added that to show that he was very willing to oblige him when it did not interfere with his conscience he restored the abbeys possessed by the deceased upon the old abbot de la rochefoucaut his uncle the old abbot dreamed nothing of such a windfall he had retired into his own country a long while before without thinking of ever returning to court but fortune pursuing him as far as his retreat his only care then was to return thanks to his majesty and to send to rome for his bulls  the princess of epinois and the duchess of richelieu died soon after the one three days after the other the former died in less than an hours sickness the latter had been long troubled with a tedious distemper the princess depinois was walking out of the marquis of barbesieux his house when she was seized of a sudden with a violent pain presently she stopped and took hold of a windowshutter to keep her from falling but in that minute she lost her senses and being carried home died in the space of a quarter of an hour she was one of the greatest players at lansquenette at marli and many imputed this accident to her considerable losses which hadmade so great an alteration in her blood that it had been a miracle if some troublesome thing or other had not come upon her mr pelletier intendant of the finances to whom it is said she was married in the way of conscience was mightily afflicted at her death however that did not keep him from going to versailles to council the first time he appeared every body condold his loss because all the world knew how far he was concerned nay the king himself knew it and one time when the princess had lost a great sum at marli and paid it next day to the great surprizal of a great many who thought she was not in a condition to raise it so soon his majesty did not stand to ask mr pelletier if twas not he that had lent it her upon that mr pelletier owned that she had had recourse to him to save her honor i know not whether his majesty did not carry his curiosity further and asked him if he was not married to her that being above my knowledge i shall know nothing of it for fear of incurring the imputation of a lie that lady had two sons and two daughters by her husband the daughters were still unmarried twas the eldest of em that the princess of conty the kings daughter would have married to the marquis de valliere as for the sons the younger died a natural death and the elder had married a daughter of the prince de la isle bonne of the house of lorain  the duchess of richelieu left behind her a son and some daughters the birth of that son had extinguished all the hopes of the marquis of richlieu the dukes nephew who was entitled to the succession in case of no male issue he being a little upon the fret and nothing being more capable to disturb ones conduct than poverty his wife and he did not agree very well notwithstanding he had run away with her and she deserved a more honorable usage in fine whether this misunderstanding increased every day or that his poverty obliged him to avoid the charges that attend people of their quality they parted in the beginning of the year school and she went to england to her mother but it being impossible that so pretty a creature as she should not have many admirers her husband was quickly sensible that in striving to be rid of one evil he had brought another upon himself that was equally unsupportable he was seized with a deep jealousy and being upon that score restless both night and day he set all springs at work to oblige his lady to return out of that country she thinking she could not be better than with her mother would not listen to any proposal he could make a wife seldom gives ear to the voice of a husband at a distance especially a husband that gives her no relief in time of need so he was obliged to fall upon other measures in the mean time the duke of orleanss daughter was married to the duke of lorain by way of proxy the king sent the young princess some presents upon which she left the court immediately and after staying but    hours as paris set out immediately to bar pursuant to the duke the bridegrooms orders who was to meet her there the castle of bar was fitted up for her reception when the duke went to his estate he found all his houses out of order for the kings intendants in that country had minded themselves more than any thing else and had scarce taken care to make the necessary reparations the duke did not go at first to nancy because the kings troops were there demolishing the fortifications so he stopped four or five leagues on the other side of it whither he who commanded the kings troops sent him a captain with some soldiers for his guard but that prince refused em thinking it more convenient to employ the militia of his country accordingly the inhabitants of nancy and the other towns provided some companies of horse and foot till such time as his regular troops should be in readiness for which he had given out commissions in fine the duke came to his capital city when the kings troops marched out as soon as the duke heard the news that the young princess was upon her journey to lorrain he came to bar and in the mean time the inhabitants of nancy made preparations for her entry in proportion to their ability for besides the oppression they had lain under for the fifty or sixty years that their country was covered with foreign troops they began to feel the terrible effects of a famine which was general not only over that country but all the adjacent states so that their neighbors were almost in the same condition in some places indeed the season seemed to promise plenty but when they came to thresh the corn it did not yield the half of what it used to do nay france it self which used to furnish others with corn was first sensible of the want of it and such disorders happened upon the marching of the troops that the judges of the police were obliged to defend the bakers with the strong hand for the poor people were like to fall upon em and rob em so great was their misery in the streets of paris there was nothing to be seen but troops of beggars which were yet more numerous in the country mr d argenson was so watchful in the city that they durst not harass the people there as they did elsewhere though after all some of these hungry wretches paid a visit to the bakers that were coming from gonnesse and one of em gave a baker a wound with his knife because he would not sell his bread at what price he pleased  as every body thinks of nothing but getting so this dearth put a great many usurers upon raising the price of bread yet higher it being reported that the farmers general were the people that laid up magazines of corn in order to make up the loss they had sustained upon the taxes for that the wine was quite lost that year the first president gave em to know that if it was true they not only run the risque of being pillaged but ruined to boot for he was a man that would not pardon such things and the interest of the state and country was sufficient to draw such threats from him in good earnest though this was a sufficient cause of fear to those who were conscious of their own guilt yet some were so covetous that they would venture all rather than miss such an opportunity of getting money there was one miotte that had farmed the estate of meudon from the d of orleans and upon that score thought himself proof against any thing that might happen this man bought up corn every where and made vast magazines in the castle of montereau fautyonne mr dargenson and the chief president being informed of it the former took him up and the latter passed a decree against him insomuch that if he had not found friends to dissuade the president from seizing upon his person he had gone near to have been hanged but the court it self inspected the matter and it being tried before the council he was cleared for a fine of  000 livers and the confiscation of some part of the corn some other usurers had much the same usage for the judges could not deal more severely with them without making it known that miottes friends were the occasion of the favor shown him however mr dargenson concerted measures for preventing the like for the future and sent commissaries with persons that he could confide in all over the country for there was no doing of it without ranging the country  the misery of the people filled both paris and the country with robbers and the inhabitants were scarce safe in their houses they durst not stir abroad nor travel either early or late because the poor wretches were so desperate as to be capable of any thing but mr dargenson took the alarm upon this as well as all other disorders while mr de la reinie his predecessor minded nothing but the peaceable enjoyment of the fruit of his labors he had but a son and a daughter with a vast estate for being all a long very cunning he had laid up an infinity of money he was somewhat dissatisfied with his son who had been at rome a long while and minded nothing but the pictures and other curiosities of the city without regarding his fathers example who had raised himself to the highest post of the law though he begun with the lowest so that magistrate careing only for his daughter resolved to marry her as honorable as he could there was enough that offered to be suitors but one machaut a master of requests carried his suit so far that after some dispute articles were mutually signed after that the lover came to pay his respects to his mistress whom he had never seen but she being not handsome he liked her so ill that he told her father that the only way to make him miserable was to oblige him to finish what he had begun her father was a little nettled at the compliment however he endeavored to get off as honorably as he could he did not ask him the cause of the breach but suspecting what it was he agreed to what he desired because he would not give his daughter to a man that did not love her  the d of loraine having stayed some days at bar with his spouse carried her to nancy where she met with some magnificence notwithstanding the public calamity but being bred up at the proudest court in the world she minded that far less than the love of that people for their sovereign they showed it in all their actions and what animated em very much was the exemplary piety of that young prince who upon that score might be called the prodigy of the age he would see neither play nor opera nor allow of em about his court he looked upon those diversions not only as unworthy of a christian but contrary to the duty of so holy a profession he was the son of a father and mother that in their time were patterns of virtue and twas plain that he endeavored to make the best use of the lessons they had given him the bishop of osnabrug the dukes brother arrived at that time at the court of lorrain upon his return from his bishopric which he had obtained about five or six months before by the recommendt on of the emperor his uncle he is a handsome prince and one that knows his perfections very well a brother of the elector of hannovers was formerly possessed of that bishopric which pursuant to the treaty of munster ought to be filled by a protestant and a roman catholic by turns  as soon as the d of lorrain had taken possession of his countries he gave advice of it to all the princes of europe puruant to the usual custom he likewise notified his marriage in the same manner and in the mean time endeavored by his good conduct to repair the disorders that the war had occasioned in so long a space of time  in the mean time the p of cony gain s suit before the high court of parliament as well as before the court of requests this solacd him entirely upon the loss of the crown oland though there was a great deal of difference between the one and the other the new k of poland did not  his crown in tranquillity some of his subjects charging him with a great many things were so bold as to send a fresh message to versailles praying the king to assist em with men and money for the recovery of their liberty which as they alleged was overrun by his usurpation they accused him of sacrificing the nation to his private interests but his majesty would not meddle in the matter  the emperor as well as the d of lorain had formed a design to procure repose to his people as soon as possibly he could this he could not effect without making peace with the turks which at last he consented to though they were sensible they were upon the brink of ruin he accepted the mediation of the k of england and the states general and the turks having done the same an interview was agreed upon at carlowitz in order to adjust the difference between the two emperors in the mean time he gave notice of all to his allies to the end that they having jointly carried on so successful a war might mutually concur in procuring a peace equally advantageous to the one as well as to the other  at that time the k of england went to germany in order to come nearer the place where the conferences were held he stoped at the court of hannover which occasioned as much uneasiness to france as france occasioned to the allies by the camp they had formed in the mean time ambassadors repaired from all quarter to carlowitz his britannick majesty desired this peace very passionately in order to give some jealousy to france and to see the emperors growing power at a stand for he wished rather that the emperor should stand in need of his help than he of the emperors but the year was over before that great work was concluded as well as before the k of the romans his marriage with the princess of hannover was completed it is true that marriage was concluded upon above two months before but the young princess being thn in italy along with her mother who was gone to see the duchess of modena her eldest daughter it was put off till the beginning of the year      to conclude it is not doubted but these two things will quickly be adjusted which time will ew to all who have the happiness to live
