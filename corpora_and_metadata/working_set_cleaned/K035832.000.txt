old gentleman  say here is to you   plun to rifleman why lord i tell you they knows no more about the respect due to us gentlemen soldiers  why damme they thinks us fit for nothing but a catonine tails and to be hired out and shot at for fivepence a day   rif why that is true as you say plunder but then who have we to thank for it  our superiors  merit is not rewarded  come my lads here is confusion to the first inventor of jumping over heads for my part i say little but if i had been rewarded as i ought for my behavior in that there scrimmage  why now i suppose you have heard of poor old blenheim   live heard of him  he is one of the disgraces of his country there is no general to whom i would pay more respect descended from an ancient family he inherired only a brown musket and after having distinguished himself in most of the great duke of marlboroughs wars with a bravery the admiration of every one is at the age of sixtyfive nobly rewarded by a brevet for chelsea hospital whither i am told he is now on his way and where his wife a washerwoman and his daughter a seamstress are waiting his arrival   plun poor old blenheim  why do you think if as how i had been a general and blenheim had served under me that i would have broke his poor old heart by putting a parcel of boys before him because one was my lord this things footman and the other carried my lady that things lap dog    thick why to be sure there must be something wrong going on but for my part if they did not tax dogs and horses and servants and enclose commons they might do what they pleased for ought i cared what do you say old pedagogue   birch why squire i say what i have said a hundred times that your great people should all be sent to school   lat why to be sure if they would sue out a writ of discretion and join issue with common sense they would be more likely to get a favorable verdict from their country  ent i right master barber   hone why i will tell you what  i thinks if as why i may speak the truth that we are all of us shaved too close   plun you think old periwig  for me if i was commanding officer about and concerning the affairs of this nation every rank and file should be made either colonel or general   live come come you are too violent those at the head of affairs know when and how to manage matters a devilish deal better than you can dictate to them   plun manage matters why i tell you their promotions are interest their maneuvers ignorance and their camps parties of pleasure   blen ha ha ha   live you seem my old friend to find something pleasant in our conversation   blen pleasant  pardon me sir not very pleasant but light and airy as may be expected at your time of life  you seem to govern the nation over your bottle and to amend the state and legislature at every bumper you contend that others are neglected that you are neglected yourselves this is a partial evil not to be lamented and if you are soldiers you ought to be ashamed of such paltry considerations   live in your days my friend this might be good doctrine for aught i know but now the case is altered and every man thinks only of his own interest   blen so much the worse and if the case is altered you are properly requited neglect ought to be your portion   live how is this do you insult us in return for our hospitality   blen far from it i deal with you as a friend and pay you with honest truth for the shelter you afford me   live there is something like wisdom in your remarks old gentleman but mixed i think with rather too much spleen this public spirit which you require is certainly a virtue but by no means a duty   blen in your station it is a duty  the very foundation of every military virtue  whoever dedicates himself to the service of his country should consider his country unable to requite his services for in fact that which he devotes to the public good is above all price  no more of these complaints then  it is unavoidable in counties like ours that bravery must sometimes fall into neglect otherwise there would be no subordination for how could you reward as you ought an english army unless every one could command in chief   live and pray who are you that talk to us in that style   blen blenheim   all blenheim    blen blenheim  that poor old chelsea pensioner for whom but now you seemed to have so much compassion   live and can you who have been treated so ungratefully inculcate the principles of public virtue and disinterested love of our country   blen from whom then do you expect to hear your duty  from these gentlemen who never saw fire but in the corner of a chimney it is true i have been wronged neglected taken up imprisoned accused of violating the kings rights in the very moment i protected them and that by the very man whose life i saved in battle he who is possessed of a considerable place in the revenues while i am grovelling in this abject condition but what signifies all this the actions of my life may be effaced from the memory of a court but the memory of mankind will be more retentive and if it should not i have the conscious remembrance and that is sufficient   thick a queer old codger this  come my honest fellows i believe the skittle pins wait for us good bye old rugged and tough well come and smoke a pipe with you at chelsea   plund come lively let us go and see what recruits we can pick up

you want money   blen no young man i thank thee i have wherewithal to conduct me to my last retreat   live what a retreat for such merit  it makes me look with horror on my country and blush for every drop of blood i have spilt in her cause   blen for shame distinguish better my wrongs    live are a scandal to the nation and by heaven i would strangle the villain   blen my poor lad thy compassion is folly when thou shall have strangled all the world will it give me the use of this arm or make me a day younger   live no  but it would teach such miscreants how to use others   blen and by what title do you pretend to execute my revenge  have i transferred to you a right i do not myself possess  no my good young man  if i would have revenged myself half a regiment would have deserted under my command but i am resigned to my fate imitate my example and allow me to be a judge of what is right and honorable   live at least point me out your enemies that i may hate them   blen nay let your children hate them let them imbibe from their very infancy a detestation for them   live they shall  who are they   blen the enemies of my country  air if deep thy poignard thou would drench in blood to venge old blenheims woes my enemies boy are the french and all who are my countrys foes shall i receive an added day of life when crimes your name shall brand no never let detraction say that virtue armed a murderers hand of anger then no single breath respire for my poor sake  but since you have spirit to encounter death die for your country and your prince  lively and plunder plun come sergeant the men are all expecting you there are a fine parcel of raw country fellows and one animating speech at the drum head makes them our own my boy   live plunder can we spare one of the men to conduct old blenheim to chelsea   plun fire old blenheim we have no time to consider about invalids   live come plunder thou art an honest fellow thy fortune has a similitude to mine the only difference is thou ranst away and took up a musket after ruining a poor old mother whilst i entered in the guards after being turned out of doors by a rich old father   plun well lad what of this

have some reason to believe i am not altogether disagreeable to her   plun and do you expect governor lively will ever consent that his son should marry the daughter of an old chelsea pensioner   live if he does not i will discard him as he has me and choose the old chelsea pensioner as the best father of the two  but however i am not without hopes  thou know what a perfect veneration my father has for every military relict and i think if i was to throw myself at his feet plead blenheims cause and my own at the same time i could get the old invalid a good employ myself reinstated into his favor and thee a commission  come along  i will first to my duty  that discharged i will fly to comfort my nancy and then to throw myself at the feet of my father   jews row chelsea with a poor looking

recommendation to me   est no i warrant you you cannot get your fine sergeant out of your head  one would imagine your mothers example was enough to frighten you from ever thinking of a red coat   nan i am sure mother i have heard you say a hundred times that with all your troubles you could live the same life over again for the love of my father   est so i could child so i could and be happy enough in the main i can safely swear in all our marches dustings and famishings abed early abed late i never was the woman that said a crossgrained word to him   nan what makes you so averse then to

yesterday to have his shoe heeltapped for it is tore out already though he has had it but five months however that is not very mavelous the contractors give the poor pensioners bad beer or any thing now adays a fault somewhere to be sure there is i wish it could be enquired out  but as i was a saying pensioner malplaquet knows the goodlooking young sergeant that comes after you  you knows who i mean he that makes me prick my fingers with my awl so often for vexation and he says that he is the only child of governor lively now governor lively is the gentleman that was the cause how and consarning your fathers being taken up for a smugger   est and what a barbarous villain he must be when all the world knows your father lost the use of his arm by saving the old rogues life at the

laps sharp as a pairingknife   est neighbor lapstone suppose you was to go toward battersea bridge and try to meet my old man while i carry this ironing home  as to thee daughter i shall never consent to make thee unhappy and i trust thou have duty enough never to make me so or thy poor father and as to the rest if thou refusest our good neighbor here only because he is poor i can tell thee wench as there is no station ever so high but has its bitters so there is no station ever so low but has its weets  air the worlds a strange world child it must be confessed we all of distress have our share but since i must struggle to live with the rest by my troth it is no great matter where we all must put up with what fortune has sent be therefore ones lot poor or rich so there is but a portion of ease and content by my troth it is no great matter which ii a livings a living and so there is an end if one honestly gets just enough and something to spare for the wants of a friend by my troth

four places  they are to make a retreat in cornwall embark a large body of troops upon the coast of ireland throw succors into portsmouth harbor and take a diversion upon the thames   blen indeed   laps nay more  they are to set fire to all the shipping in the river knock down the tower and surprise the lord mayor as he goes a swanhopping   blen why indeed this business is enough to surprise any body  but still i think you and i can do but little service we are too old   laps old  why lord love you i am but sixty one  to be sure they scratched me off the list for malicious men upon the church

around still spreading desolation yet there is hopes of peace awhile the billows raging may sky and sea confound yet winds and waves asswaging storms at last will cease but man thus overtaken a tempest in his mind his warring passions shaken are reeds as in the wind rare is the eloquence that has the charm to rule that pestilence or quell the storm  lapstone alone laps in cod i believe he is right  if i get wounded with my pairing knife or my awl i have no occasion for a surgeon to cure me i cannot say so much for a bayonet or a firelock  no i am determined  i will visit no redevouses but houses of call nor think about quarters except to cobble em  air twere better i took your advice my good neighbor my conduct henceforward i will mend with joy and content to my last will i labor still striving to make a good end and then as to love i will never think of a woman i will not i swear it by goles but like methodist preachers on kennington common i will live by mending of soles ii many battles i will fight  over a pot of good porter whole armies i will kill  in my stall to no soul  of a shoe will i ever give quarter and what hides will i pierce  with my awl and then as to love etc  enter governor and lively gov i hope he will not know me in this disguise i should fain hear his story without discovering myself it will be told with more ingenuity and i shall hear it with less confusion  for thee frederick thou have so pleased me that if this appears as thou have related it i will forgive thee every thing   live sir your eagerness ever to do justice prompted what i have done in the relation of which you will find i have been faithful   gov but how came your intimacy with the daughter   live passing frequently sir this way i continually noticed her at some industrious employment i enquired who she was got introduced and loved her but though her person and conversation won my very soul yet these were nothing in my esteem compared with the unparalleled affection for her father  air twas not her eyes though orient mines can boast no gem so bright that glows her lips where the deep ruby shines her cheeks that shame the blushing rose nor yet her form minervas mien her bosom white as venus dove that made her my affections queen but twas alone her filial love ii the ruby lip the brilliant eye the rosy cheek the graceful form in turn for commendation vie and justly the fired lover charm but transient these  the charm for life which reason never shall disapprove while truly shall ensure a wife faithful and kind is filial love but here he comes i have brought this gentleman to share with me the pleasure of your conversation   governor lively and blenheim blen i longed to see you sir  you are allied to a worthy young man  but i am afraid that by visiting me you will involve yourself in a danger you are not aware of  in the ruin of a man proscribed  if a real criminal is punished he will soon be forgotten but if a man of blameless integrity is injured he will be persecuted with unrelenting hatred for the very mention of his name is a satire on the times and his existence is to the conscience of his enemies an unceasing remembrancer of guilt   gov i fear your words have too much truth in them and yet in the course of human contingencies it must happen that men of worth will occasionally be plunged in misfortune   live but ought that consideration to check the noble ardour of a soldier the poorest pensioner in this charity has his moments of exultation when he recollects he has fought bravely   blen true a love of glory is a noble passion  but do you think the pleasure that springs from conquest has a sincere and lasting charm in it  alas when a deluge of human blood bids the tears of natural affection flow in rivers round the land can the mind in that situation taste of joy   live never  yet surely when this blood is spilt in their defense of whom nature intended us the guardians though our sensibility may be shocked our honor can never be stained  in my mind defense and reprisals are the only justifiable measures in war while ambition is but another name for massacre   blen you have distinguished right  but in your pursuits after fame you will have a worse enemy to guard against than ambition  envy  which when you have done your duty will make even accidents a ground of impeachment against you  have you done all that was possible  you ought to have done better  the charge is aggravated and the good you have done dwindles into nothing  your downfall is effected and some worthless wretch is sure to rise upon your ruins   gov this is indeed a melancholy truth   blen but it is a truth that springs from error more than injustice i teach it to this young man that he may rise superior to it  that he may consult his own heart and in that manly selfconference enquire  were i reduced to the condition of old blenheim would my innocence make even affliction smile if you hesitate a moment to say yes to this question pass your life in obscurity for you have not the materials for a public character  air let your courage boy be true to ye hard and painful is the soldiers duty it is not alone to bravely dare to fear a stranger each threatening danger that whistles through the dusky air where thundering jar conflicting arms all the alarms and dreadful havoc of the war your duty done and home returning with selfcommended ardour burning if this right pride foes should deride and from your merit turn aside though than the war the conflicts more severe this is the trial you must learn to bear  governor lively gov what injustice have i been guilty of to this man i would have discovered myself and remedied all but that i wish to come provided with the means i have thought what employ to procure him and mean to supply myself with the necessary instruments before i acquaint him with his good fortune   live yonder comes his wife and daughter sir   gov you tell me the old woman dont know who i am i suppose she will abuse me liberally i will humor it  and as to the daughter i mean to make a trial of her   live dear sir    gov nay i must insist upon your duty that you will not interfere assisting the father is one thing but consenting to my sons marriage with the daughter is another her birth to be sure is as good as yours and fortune i do not regard but    live my life on it then you will find that a prince might accept her alliance without a blush  but they are here   governor lively esther nancy est nay come along child i am not afraid to speak to him not i   nan my anxiety makes me break through every decorum pray tell me  what of my father   est ay let us know something about my old man they tells me sir you are come to right him i am sure it is high time do you know this governor sir   gov a little   est is not he a sad old villain   nan hush mother consider this gentlemans his relation   est what of that what of that the truths the truth   gov aye aye dont mince the matter speak what you think of him i assure you nobody would be so likely to blame him for doing wrong as i should   est wrong sir you shall judge yourself whether he has done wrong or no after all poor blenheims sufferings i am sure i shall never forget when his dear arm was shot through and through at fontenoy i was waiting with some other gentlemens wives upon a baggagewaggon and when he was brought home says he wife this is a smart wound but i am glad i received it for it saved my captains life and dont you think after this that he must be the cruellest hardhearted old rogue    gov oh certainly i never met with such an infamous piece of business in my life but now what plan would you have me pursue to make him do justice   est why sir if you will be so good i would have you go to him tell him what a villain he is and that if he ever expects to sleep quietly in his bed he will come here directly and reward my poor husband for all he has undergone   gov you may depend upon me  he shall be righted and i dont doubt but there are many years of happiness yet in store for you   est why most of my family lived to a good round age and for my part i am brave and hearty   gov so you seem   est air why thanks be praised i am pretty free from sickness though i am old indeed an asthmy teazes me now i have got a cold the gout too plays me tricks then i have the rheumaticks and a sort of a wheezing that is sometimes teazing in the morning do you see but it is over soon for by that time it is noon the deuce a thing ails me  governor lively nancy gov poor woman she is very sincere at least   nan i hope you will have the goodness to pardon her sir her anxiety for my father outweighs every other consideration   gov your father has been illtreated matters have been falsely represented to me and he has severely suffered for it i mean to atone for my error but i hear it is expected that i shall countenance an extravagant passion which it seems my only son has thought proper to entertain for you   nan sir my fathers lessons and example has fortified me against the severest strokes of fortune his happiness therefore accomplished i shall resign myself to whatever may
