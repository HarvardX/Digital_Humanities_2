commenced against him  a plain and succinct narrative of the disturbances for notes referred to in the text by letters a b c etc see the appendix the late riots and popular tumults which have happened in the metropolis and its environs sufficiently at the instant of their existence excited the apprehensions of all ranks of people to awaken curiosity and make a clear and succinct narrative worthy the acceptance of the public to render the whole affair as intelligible as possible it has been judged necessary to trace the alleged cause of discontent the act for the relief of the papists to its source the original motion for the bill which afterward passed into a law was made in the house of commons by sir george savile the object of it was to repeal an act of the  0th and   th of william the third the esverity of this act may be gathered from the repealing act an abstract of which is prefixed and from the following observations of the members who introduced and supported the bill  sir george savile stated that one of his principle views in proposing this repeal was to vindicate the honor and assert the principles of the protestant religion to which all persecution was or ought to be totally averse that this pure religion ought not to have had an existence if persecution had been lawful that it ill became us to practice that with which we reproached others that he did not meddle with the vast body of that penal code but selected that act on which he found most of the prosecutions had been formed and which gave the greatest scope to the base views of interested relations and unprincipled informers the act had not it is true been regularly put in execution but sometimes it had and he understood that several papists lived in great terror and some under actual contribution he stated the peaceable behavior of this part of his majestys subjects and mentioned the loyal and excellent address they had lately presented to the throne in which they not only expressed their obedience to the government under which they lived but their attachment to the constitution as a guard and security however he proposed that a sufficient test vide abstract of the act page   might be formed by which they should bind themselves to the support of the civil government as by law established  the motion was seconded by mr dunning who with great ability entered into a legal discussion of the principles the objects and the past operations of the bill which was moved to be repealed some of the severities by him complained of were the following  for priests or jesuits to teach or officiate in the services of their church were acts of felony in foreigners and high treason in the natives of this kingdom the forfeiture of estates to the next protestant heir the power given to a son or other nearest relation to take possession during the life of the proprietor and the depriving of papists from acquiring any legal property by purchase were he said exceedingly oppressive particularly the last clause which had a far greater latitude than was understood for it applied to all legal property acquired by other means than that of descent he declaimed upon the horrid nature of that law which deprived a priest of liberty only for officiating in the duties of his religion and begged to remind the house that even when the proposed repealing act had passed the priests would not be at liberty to exercise their functions but would still under the restriction of former laws be liable to a years imprisonment and the punishment of a heavy sine he observed that at the instigation of the most abandoned of mankind common informers the magisterial and judicial powers were of necessity bound to enforce all the shameful penalties of the act others of these penalties held out the most powerful temptations for the commission of acts of depravity at the very thought of which our nature recoils with horror they seem calculated to loosen all bands of society to dissolve all civil moral and religious obligations and duties to poison the sources of domestic felicity and to annihilate every principle of honor the encouragement given to children to lay their hands upon the estates of their parents and the restitution which debars men from the honest acquisition of property need he said in times like these of philosophical liberty only be mentioned to excite the utmost indignation of that house a  the motion was received with universal approbation and a bill was accordingly brought in and passed without a single negative  the indulgencies granted by this act to the papists such as not only the free exercise of their religion in licensed chapels equal to the presbyterians and all other dissenters and sectaries but toleration likewise to e ect schools for the education of youth in the romish tenets greatly alarmed many people some on religious and others on political principles the resistance made to a similar act in favor of the catholics in scotland b contributed to spread the alarm and bills were dispersed and advertisements inserted in the newspapers inviting those who wished well to the cause to unite under the title of the protestant association and lord george gordon who had been so active at the head of the malcontents in scotland was chosen president little notice was taken of these societies and the president whose eccentric and desultory character c and speeches in the house of commons were frequently the subjects of ridicule tended rather both in and out of parliament to place those objects which as it has proved well deserved the most serious attention in a ludicrous than a serious point of view he has the manners and air of a modern puritan his figure is meagre his hair strait and his dress plain the style of the advertisements published in the name of the associating committee but which were signed only by him have the appearance of private addresses to the public and are such as might rather have been expected from the famous william prynne than from a noble commoner in this philosophic age the following is one of these advertisements which at the same time that it affords a specimen of the spirit and style in which these invitations were written will show by what means the attention of the people was engaged and their minds were incited to a consideration of the tendency of the repealing act and which only became serious in the opinion of the liberal from the encouragement and protection it gave the papists in the erecting of schools  protestant association this is to give notice that in compliance with a petition addressed to the president the committee have resolved that there shall be another general meeting of the protestants before the london petition is presented to the house of commons  the petition will not be presented this week but will be kept till toward the close of this session of parliament to give time for similar petitions from other parts of england wales and scotland to be presented before it  all the true friends of great britain and of civil and religious liberty are exhorted to unite in support of the protestant interest before it is too late for unanimity and firmness in that glorious cause can alone protect us from the dangerous confederacy of popish powers if we unite like one man for the honor of god and the liberties of the people we may yet experience the blessing of divine providence on this kingdom and love and confidence may again be restored amongst brethren but if we continue obstinate in errors and spread idolatry and corruption through the land we have nothing to expect but division among the people distraction in the senate and discontent in our camps with all the other calamities attendant on those nations whom god has delivered over to arbitrary power and despotism  g gordon president welbeckstreet london may    those of london and its environs who wish the repeal of the late popish bill are desired to sign the protestant petition which they may have access to at the presidents house in welbeckstreet every day before four oclock    the reader will easily perceive what were the leading features in the character of a man who could write the above address the following one which was the means of calling that mob together whose depredations are the subject of the ensuing pages may not be thought less interesting or less singular  protestant association whereas no hall in london can contain forty thousand men  resolved that this association do meet on friday next in st georges fields at ten oclock in the morning to consider of the most prudent and respectful manner of attending their petition which will be presented the same day to the house of commons  resolved for the sake of good order and regularity that this association on coming to the ground do separate themselves into four distinct divisions viz the london division the westminster division the southwark division and the scotch division  resolved that the london division do take place upon the right of the ground toward southwark the westminster division second the southwark division third and the scotch division upon the left all wearing blue cockades in their hats to distinguish themselves from the papists and those who approve of the late act in favor of popery  resolved that the magistrates of london westminster and southwark are requested to attend that their presence may overawe and control any riotous or evilminded persons who may wish to disturb the legal and peaceable deportment of his majestys protestant subjects  by order of the association g gordon president london may    lord george had frequently spoken in terms which seemed intended to intimidate the house of commons and in order to show that he was more in earnest and had more power than they believed he took every method to incite the public attention a report was circulated that he had asserted he would not present the petition unless he was attended by forty thousand another account says  0000 of the associators at the least every one who wished well to the cause was desired to appear with a blue cockade in his hat the associators separated themselves into four grand divisions as requested in the advertisement the london the westminster the southwark and the scotch and flags were provided for each  accordingly on friday june the  d at ten in the forenoon an immense concourse assembled at the place appointed some with serious intentions some with wicked and others out of curiosity and notwithstanding the intense heat which was that day very remarkable kept parading the fields with their flags singing hymns marshalling themselves in ranks and waiting for their leader about eleven oclock lord george arrived among them and gave directions in what manner he would have them proceed and about twelve that the whole city might be convinced how serious the people were in their demands one numerous party was ordered to go round over london bridge another over blackfriars and a third to follow him over westminster a huge roll of parchment or rather several rolls in one too almost as much as a man could carry containing the names of those who had signed the petition was borne before them they proceeded with great decorum and decency on their route and the whole body was assembled about half past two before both houses of parliament on which occasion they gave a general shout  but however peaceable and well disposed some of them might be it was very evident from the habit and appearance of numbers amongst them that order and regularity were not long to be expected from such an assembly on the contrary they soon began to exercise the most arbitrary and dictatorial power over both lords and commons they obliged almost all the members to put blue cockades in their hats and call out no popery some they compelled to take oaths to vote for the repeal of the obnoxious act and others they insulted in the most indecent and violent manner they took possession of all the avenues from the outer door to the very door of the house of commons which they twice attempted to force open the like attempt was made at the house of lords but by the exertion of the doorkeepers and the care of sir francis molyneux it did not succeed the archbishop of york was one of the first they attacked as soon as his coach was known coming down parliamentstreet he was saluted with hisses groans and hootings and when he got out of his carriage to avoid greater mischief was obliged to say which he did in a pitiable and enfeebled voice no popery no popery the lord president of the council lord bathurst they pushed about in the rudest manner and kicked violently on the legs lord mansfield had the glasses of his carriage broken the pannels beat in and narrowly escaped with life the duke of northumberland was exceedingly ill treated and had his pocket picked of his watch the bishop of litchfield had his gown torn the wheels of the bishop of lincolns carriage were taken off and his lordship might be said to escape personal injury almost by miracle d  the lords townshend and hillsborough came together the latter who was known by the mob was most grossly insulted and had not some of them been partial to lord townshend would in all probability have been much more so as it was they were both much husseled and pushed about and sent into the house without their bags and with their hair hanging loose on their shoulders the coach of lord stormont was broken to pieces and himself in the hands of the mob for near half an hour during which time they took the most insolent liberties with him and pelted him with mud he was rescued at last by a gentleman who harangued the mob and prevailed on them to desist lords ashburnham and boston were treated not only with most unwarrantable indignity but with a merciless and unmanly severity particularly lord boston who was so long in their power that it was thought necessary by the peers to go as a body and endeavor by their presence to extricate him but were prevented by the entrance of his lordship out of breath and in great disorder with his coat all powdered and his hair disheveled the front glass of lord trenthams vis a vis was broken and himself insulted and detained a considerable time lord willough by de broke lord st john lord dudley and many others were personally ill treated and wellbore ellis esquire was obliged to take refuge in the guildhall of westminster whither he was pursued the windows of which were broke the doors forced and justice addington with all the constables expelled mr ellis escaped at the utmost hazard and after exceedingly severe and rough treatment  the behavior of lord george gordon was such as might be expected he came several times to the top of the gallery stairs whence he harangued the people and let them know the bad success their petition was like to meet with he told them first that it was proposed to take it into consideration on tuesday in a committee of the house but that he did not like delays for the parliament might be prorogued by that time  he came once more and said he saw little reason to hope redress from the decisions of parliament  that they should meet again  that they ought not to despair but to put their trust in providence  he came a third time and said gentlemen the alarm has gone forth for many miles round the city you have got a very good prince who as soon as he shall hear the alarm has seized such a number of men will no doubt send down private orders to his ministers to enforce the prayer of your petition  when the mob was raging and roaring in the lobby general conway sat himself down by lord george and addressed him to the following purpose my lord i am a military man and i shall think it my duty to protect the freedom of debate in this house by my sword you see my lord the members of this house are this day all in arms do not imagine that we will be overpowered or intimidated by a rude undisciplined unprincipled rabble there is only one entry into the house of commons and that is a narrow one reflect that men of honor may defend this pass  and that certainly many lives will be lost before we will suffer ourselves to be overawed by your adherents i wish in one word my lord to know whether it is your intention to bring those men whose wild uproar now strikes our ears within the walls of this house soon after general conway had done speaking with lord george colonel gordon a near relation of his lordships went up to him and accosted him in the following manner my lord george do you intend to bring your rascally adherents into the house of commons if you do  the first man of them that enters i will plunge my sword not into his but into your body  lord george it is said was very much dismayed by what had fallen from general conway and his kinsman colonel gordon and it was in consequence of what they had threatened that he came to the top of the gallery stairs and desired the populace to be quiet and to trust to the goodness of their cause and to his majestys clemency and justice  while his lordship was making his second speech one of his relations general grant came behind him and by a gentle violence endeavored to draw him back into the house and said to him o lord george lord george for gods sake lord george do not lead these poor people into any danger  his lordship however made the general no answer but continued his harangue  you see said he in this effort to persuade me from my duty before your eyes an instance of the difficulties i have to encounter with from such wise men of this world as my honorable friend behind my back  alderman sawbridge and others endeavored to persuade the people to clear the lobby but to no purpose and about nine oclock different members conjured them in the most earnest and pathetic manner to disperse informing them at the same time of their danger and of the resolution that was taken to send for the guards the young gentleman the assistant to the chaplain of the house of commons addressed them but gained nothing except curses and you be damned lord george gordon forever soon after this a party of horse and foot guards arrived justice addington was at the head of the horse and was received with a volley of hisses but on his assuring the people that his disposition toward them was perfectly peaceable and that he would order the soldiers away if they would give their honor to disperse he gained their good will accordingly the cavalry galloped off and upwards of six hundred of the petitioners after giving the magistrate three cheers departed from thence  the greatest part of the day the attention of the house of commons had been taken up in debates concerning the mob when they had obtained some degree of order lord george introduced his business with informing them that he had before him a petition vide note f signed by near one hundred and twenty thousand of his majestys protestant subjects praying a repeal of the act passed the last session in favor of the roman catholics and moved to have the said petition brought up  mr alderman bull seconded the motion and leave was accordingly given  having brought up the petition his lordship then moved to have it taken into immediate consideration and was again seconded by mr alderman bull  after some debate the house divided and there appeared six for the petition and one hundred and ninetytwo against it soon after this the house adjourned and the mob having dispersed from the avenues of both houses the guards were ordered home  but though order and tranquillity were reestablished in this part of the town it was far otherwise elsewhere the mob had paraded off in different divisions from palace yard and whether instigated by religious phrenzy or designing men time alone can discover as a prelude to the horrid devastations which were to follow went some of them to the romish chapel in dukestreet lincolns innfields and others to that in warwickstreet goldensquare both of which they in a great measure demolished the military were sent for with the utmost expedition to both places but could not arrive time enough at either to prevent the mischiefs those who had the command of the military were very cautious of proceeding to extremities much scuffling ensued and some few were slightly wounded with the bayonets thirteen of the rioters were taken and the mob for that night dispersed without any farther mischief  the conclusion of this evenings disturbance may be said to be only the beginning of those dreadful scenes of desolation which have since ensued and which when the perpetrators are long sunk into oblivion shall be recorded as some of the most unparalleled and daring outrages history can furnish  the riots which were so alarming on friday evening partly subsided on the saturday and the peaceable part of the inhabitants imagined it was nothing more than the intemperate fury of a few misguided zealots assisted by those miscreants who always mingle with the mob whose trade is plunder and who are therefore continually active in all scenes where tumult and anarchy prevail but this was by no means the case for on sunday in the afternoon the rioters assembled in large bodies and attacked the chapels and dwellinghouses of the catholics in and about moorfields they stripped their houses of furniture and their chapels not only of the ornaments and insignia of religion but tore up the altars pulpits pews and benches and made huge fires of them leaving nothing but the bare walls and in many places not even them they publicly avowed their intention to root out popery to release those who had been confined in newgate for their proceedings at the sardinian and warwick street chapels on friday to pull down the houses of the justices who committed them and the persons who gave evidence against them likewise  on monday the mobs collected again and became more formidable they began to put their threats in execution in different quarters of the town some paraded with the relics of havoc which they collected in moorfields as far as lord george gordons house in welbeckstreet and afterward burnt them in the adjacent fields another party went to virginialane wapping and a third to nghtingalelane fast smithfield where they severally destroyed the catholic chapels and committed other outrages they seemed to have been marshalled out and different bodies dispatched on these infernal errands mr rainsforth tallowchandler of stanhopestreet claremarket and mr maberly of little queen street lincolns innfields who had appeared as evidences on the examination of those who had been committed had each of them their houses shops etc stripped or as they wantonly termed it gutted and the contents committed to the flames sir george saviles house in leicesterfields underwent the same fate his crime was preparing and bringing the bill into parliament in favor of the catholics happily for sir george he had prudently removed his plate and some of the most valuable of his furniture and other effects in a private manner  this day also which was held as the anniversary of the kings birthday a proclamation was issued promising a reward of five hundred pounds to those who would make discovery of the person or persons concerned in demolishing and setting fire to the sardinian and bavarian chapels the persons formerly apprehended too were reexamined and some were discharged while others were ordered to newgate whither they were escorted by a party of the guards whom on their return the mob had the insolence to pelt one of the soldiers who had been hurt by a stone turned and presented his piece but the commanding officer humanely ordered him not to fire and the soldiers were obliged to make a hasty retreat  all ranks of people began to be exceedingly terrified at the lawless proceedings of this day and numbers put blue cockades in their hats although it might now be said to be the ensign of rebellion on purpose to avoid personal injury and insult  we now come to that period of desolation and destruction when every man began to tremble not only for the safety of the city but for the constitution for the kingdom for property liberty and life for every thing that is dear to society or to englishmen  on tuesday all the military in town were ordered on duty at the tower both houses of parliament st jamess st georges fields etc during the day notwithstanding every precaution lord sandwich was wounded in attempting to go down to the parliament house to attend his duty his carriage demolished and himself rescued by the military with difficulty the house of lord north was attacked and only preserved by the exertion of a party of light horse who rode over and wounded with their swords several of the assailants  about six in the evening one party went to the house of justice hyde near leicester fields which they destroyed in less than an hour another shortly after paraded through long acre down holborn etc till they came to newgate and publicly declared they would go and release the onfined rioters when they arrived at the doors of the prison they demanded of mr akerman the keeper to have their comrades immediately delivered up to them and upon his persisting to do his duty by refusing they began some to break the windows some to batter the doors and entrances into the cells with pickaxes and sledgehammers others with ladders to climb the vast walls while others collected firebrands and whatever combustibles they could find and flung into his dwelling house what contributed more than any thing to the spreading of the flames was the great quantity of household furniture belonging to mr akerman which they threw out of the windows piled up against the doors and set fire to the force of which presently communicated to the house from the house to the chapel and from thence by the assistance of the mob all through the prison a party of constables nearly to the amount of a hundred came to the assistance of the keeper these the mob made a lane for and suffered to pass till they were entirely encircled when they attacked them with great fury broke their staffs and converted them into brands which they hurled about wherever the fire which was spreading very fast had not caught it is almost incredible to think that it were possible to destroy a building of such amazing strength and extent with so much swiftness as they accomplished this as soon as the flames had destroyed mr akermans house which was part of newgate and were communicated to the wards and cells all the prisoners to the amount of three hundred among whom were four under sentence of death and ordered for execution on the thursday following were released the activity of the mob was in this instance as well as every other amazing they dragged out the prisoners many of them by the hair of the head by the legs or arms or whatever part they could lay hold of they broke open the doors of the different entrances as easily as if they had all their lives been acquainted with the intricacies of the place to let the confined escape great numbers were let out at the door that leads to the sessions house and so well planned were all the maneuvers of these desperate ruffians that they had placed sentinels at the avenues to prevent any of the prisoners from being conveyed to other jails thus was the strongest and most durable prison in england that had been newly erected and was not yet finished and in the building of which the nation had expended immense sums demolished the bare walls excepted which were too thick and strong to yield to the force of sire in the space of a few hours  even this was but a moiety of the mischief of this terrible night not satiated with the destruction of this great building a party was sent among the catholics in devonshirestreet red lionsquare another to the house of justice cox in great queen street which was soon destroyed a third broke open the doors of the new prison clerkenwell and turned out all the confined a fourth destroyed the furniture and effects writings etc of sir john fielding and a fifth desperate and infernal gang went to the elegant house of lord mansfield in bloomsburysquare which they with the most unrelenting fury set fire to and consumed the loss here was immense both to lord mansfield as an individual and to the public a most valuable collection of pictures some of the scarcest manuscripts said to be in the possession of any private person in the world with all his lordships notes on great law cases and the constitution of england were all sacrificed by madmen and villains and lord and lady mansfield were with difficulty preserved from their rage by making their escape through a back door a few minutes before these miscreants broke in and took possession of the house the military was sent for but arrived too late they were obliged however to fire in their own defense and six men and a woman were killed and several wounded not contented with the havoc and destruction they had been guilty of in bloomsbury they went from thence to his lordships country seat at caen wood which would certainly have shared the same fate had not they been repelled by a party of horse which had been sent thither for the preservation of this delightful place the inhabitants were obliged this night to illuminate their windows  it is impossible to give any adequate description of the events of wednesday notice was sent round to the public prisons of the kings bench fleet etc by the mob at what time they would come and burn them down the same kind of infernal humanity was exercised toward mr langdale a distiller in holborn and several other romish individuals three boys went through the streets and in particular down holborn in the middle of the day with iron bars got from the railing before lord mansfields house extorting money at every shop huzzaing and shouting no popery and though numbers were passing and repassing the inhabitants durst not refuse them money nor durst any body attempt to secure them to have them punished small parties of the like daring nature were formed in other parts and the whole city was laid under contribution one man in particular was mounted on horseback and refused to take any thing but gold two men in the broad day not contented with the former mischief got into mr mabberlys house in queen street and staid for upwards of an hour knocking down the wainscoting and every bit of wood work they could with safety to themselves and though a great many peaceable well dressed people looked on no one molested them in the afternoon all the shops were shut and bits of blue silk by way of flags hung out at most houses with the words no popery chalked on the doors and window shutters by way of deprecating the fury of the insurgents from which no person thought himself secure  as soon as the day was drawing toward a close one of the most awful and dreadful spectacles this country ever beheld was exhibited the mob had not only declared their resolution of firing the prisons and some private houses but had avowed their intention to destroy the bank grays inn temple lincolns inn the grand arsenal at woolwich and royal palaces a universal stupor had seized the minds of men they looked at one another and waited with a resigned consternation for the events which were to follow government indeed had exerted itself to the utmost as far as their power under the direction of the civil magistrate would extend now however it was become necessary to make use of the royal prerogative and give discretionary powers to the military nothing could convey a more awful idea of the mischief which was dreaded than the strong guard which was placed in the royal exchange for the protection of the bank as nothing perhaps could have equalled the national desolation had the diabolical purposes of the insurgents upon this place succeeded besides this soldiers were distributed at guildhall in the inns of court in almost every place tenable as a fortification and in some private houses and the cannon was disposed to the best advantage in the park  with minds thus predisposed to terror by so many objects of devastation and in a city which but a few days before enjoyed the most perfect tranquillity let those who were not spectators judge what the inhabitants felt when they beheld at the same instant the flames ascending and rolling in vast and voluminous clouds from the kings bench and fleet prisons from new bridewell from the toll gates on blackfriars bridge from houses in every quarter of the town and particularly from the bottom and middle of holborn where the conflagration was horrible beyond description the houses that were first set on fire at this last mentioned place both belonged to mr langdale an eminent distiller and contained immense quantities of spirituous liquors it is easy to conceive what fury these would add to the flames but to form an adequate idea of the distress of the neighboring inhabitants or indeed of the inhabitants in every part of the city is not so easy men women and children were running up and down with beds glasses bundles or whatever they wished most to preserve in streets where there were no fires numbers were removing their goods and effects at midnight the tremendous roar of the insatiate and innumerable fiends who were the authors of these horrible scenes was heard at one instant and at the next the dreadful report of soldiers muskets as if firing in platoons and at various places in short every thing which could impress the mind with ideas of universal anarchy and approaching desolation seemed to be accumulating sleep and rest were things not thought of the streets were swarming with people and uproar confusion and terror reigned in every part  it is hardly possible to collect in one point of view the havoc of this night had half the mischief the mob had threatened been effected nothing less than national bankruptcy and destruction could have ensued that they were prevented at those places on the safety of which the very existence of the empire might be said to depend was owing not to their want of will but power and to the exertion of government they made two attempts upon the bank but were so much intimidated by the strength with which they beheld it guarded that their attacks were but feebly conducted they were led on to the first by a brewers servant on horseback who had decorated his horse with the chains of newgate but were repulsed at the first fire from the military and their second succeeded no better they made an effort to break into the pay office likewise and met the same fate several of them fell in these skirmishes and many more were wounded as the importance of these places made it necessary to show but little lenity  the regulars and militia had poured in so fast in consequence of the expresses dispatched for that purpose that the citizens on thursday began to recover from a consternation in which many of them especially those whose duty it was to have taken the most active part possible had been disgracefully stupefied they were however so thoroughly alarmed and so much affected by the depredations they beheld on every side that the shops were universally shut from tyburn to whitechapel and no business of any kind except at the bank was transacted and here the run instead of being greater than ordinary was near  0000l less a proof that the arrival of the troops had quieted their fears  it is impossible to ascertain the number of unhappy and deluded wretches who lost their lives on the last dreadful night but it is a consolation that very few innocent people or people of credit a bankers clerk excepted were among the killed the escape of one young lad though perhaps he might not deserve so good a fate merits from its singularity a place in this narration while the fleet prison was burning the mob had the audacity notwithstanding the presence of the military to cut the ppes from and toss into the flames a large engine which had been brought to play upon the contiguous buildings the soldiers were thereupon ordered to disperse them among others there were four people seated upon the roof of the markethouse who refused to obey the military and who were therefore ordered to fire the discharge of the muskets came from three directions in the front and at each side so that it seemed impossible for any one to escape and for a considerable time they all four lay dead as was supposed at length however one of them was observed to raise his head a little and instantly clap it down and lay still again he repeated this maneuver two or three times till at last he ventured to slide down and ran away with great celerity he was by far the genteelest in appearance of the four the three were shot dead at the instant and two were on one side of him and one on the other one of the dead was a chimneysweeper about sixteen years old and had forty guineas in his pockets  the tollgates at black friars appear to have been burnt for the sake of the plunder there were some lives lost there too and one man who was shot ran thirty or forty yards before he dropped as appears by the blood which may be traced in plashes on the pavement  but powder and ball do not seem to have been so fatal to them as their own inordinate appetites numbers it is said and at various places died with inebriation especially at the distilleries of the unfortunate mr langdale from whose vessels the liquor ran down the middle of the street was taken up by pailfuls and held to the mouths of the besotted multitude many of whom killed themselves with drinking nonrectified spirits and were burnt or buried in the ruins eight or nine of these miserable wretches have been found and dragged out i the same scenes of beastly drunkenness happened in many other places at mr coxs at lord mansfields where an illlooking fellow about nineteen that was wounded and had his hair clotted with blood was too drunk at one oclock the next day to be made sensible at newgate likewise many of them had made so free with the liquor that they could not get away and were burnt in the cells in the streets men were lying upon bulks and stalls and at the doors of empty houses drunk to a state of insensibility and to a contempt of danger boys and women were in the same condition and many of the latter with infants in their arms  there were six and thirty k fires all blazing at one time and all to be seen from one spot made from the furniture of the inhabitants and the wrecks of their houses in and about the neighborhood of queen street and little russel street bloomsbury a person who stood and beheld this scene with horror said to the officer who was there with a party of soldiers that he thought a deal of the mischief might be prevented as the perpetrators appeared chiefly to be boys this discourse was overheard by another person a well dressed decentlooking man who damned the speakers blood and bade him get home to bed  but though sentinels were posted at every avenue and every shop was shut though the whole city had the appearance of a place that every moment expected to be stormed and was so well defended that nothing less than a regular army could have endangered it yet the inhabitants could by no means persuade themselves they were entirely secure not only were their doors all scrawled with chalk intimating that they were no papists and their windows decorated with blue flags or ribbands but the very jews in houndsditch and dukes place were so terrified that they followed the general example and unintentionally gave an air of ridicule to what they understood in a very serious light by writing on their shutters this house is a true protestant  the military were exceedingly active all the day and secured great numbers of the disorderly fifty were taken in the cells of newgate attempting to rekindle the fire in those few parts which on account of the vast extent of the building had not been totally destroyed it is remarkable that several of the prisoners who had been released by the mob had so great an affection for those scenes to which they had been long accustomed that they could not forbear loitering about the cells and coming to view them and were accordingly retaken many others were found sauntering near their old haunts in cloth fair black boy alley gravel lane etc by the thieftakers and recommitted by the magistrates every hour brought intelligence of the apprehending of some of the insurgents as all suspicious persons were examined and all hackneycoaches stages and other vehicles searched an attack was this day made upon the marshalsea prison by the rioters but they were repelled  no sooner were the distressed citizens relieved in part from one fear than they were invaded by another they beheld as before related the royal exchange the bank the inns of court every place in the possession of an armed force their lives and property were the moment before at the mercy of a lawless and unprincipled rabble their rights their liberties the constitution of england objects of still greater consequence dearer even than life and property were now at the disposal of the court in such colors however did the unusual objects which every where met their eyes paint things to their imaginations they saw soldiers without the least ceremony stop whoever they pleased and no one durst resist they were sensible of the necessity and propriety of such measures yet sighed at that necessity and trembled for their freedom those virtuous citizens who held their country and their laws superior to every thing who reflected on and rejoiced at the blessings of liberty and groaned at the appearance only of despotism had their terrors greatly increased at a report which every where prevailed that martial law was proclaimed the following was the occasion of the report  london by the king a proclamation george r  whereas a great number of disorderly persons have assembled themselves together in a riotous and tumultuous manner and have been guilty of many acts of treason and rebellion having made an assault on the goal of newgate set loose the prisoners confined therein and set fire to and destroyed the said prison and whereas houses are now pulling down in several parts of our cities of london and westminster and liberties thereof and fires kindled for consuming the materials and furniture of the same whereby it is become absolutely necessary to use the most effectual means to quiet such disturbances to preserve the lives and properties of individuals and to restore the peace of the country we therefore taking the same into our most serious consideration have thought fit by and with the advice of our privy council to issue this our royal proclamation hereby strictly charging and exhorting all our loving subjects to preserve the peace and to keep themselves their servants and apprentices quietly within their respective dwellings to the end that all well disposed persons may avoid those mischiefs which the continuance of such riotous proceedings may bring upon the guilty and as it is necessary from the circumstances beforementioned to employ the military force with which we are by law entrusted for the immediate suppression of such rebellious and traitorous attempts now making against the peace and dignity of our crown and the safety of the lives and properties of our subjects we have therefore issued the most direct and effectual orders to all our officers by an immediate exertion of their utmost force to repress the same of which all persons are to take notice  given at our court at st jamess the seventh day of june one thousand seven hundred and eighty in the twentieth year of our reign god save the king convinced as they were that it was unavoidable there was not a word in the latter part of the above proclamation that did not carry a wound to the heart of every thinking and virtuous englishman martial law was not it is true immediately and rigorously enforced they did not hang delinquents in the streets without form or process though even this was reported a man was said to be hanging upon a lamp iron in cheapside on thursday in the afternoon and six more the same account added were to suffer the following morning at whitehall  but they had discretionary powers to bayonet or shoot no abuse of these assumed and delegated powers had been exhibited but the possibility of abuse the being but an hour under the control of a military force was humiliating derogatory and alarming l  while an exact state of the fears of all good patriots is related it is but justice to give government praise for the proper use they made of the power they were thus obliged to usurp no part of their conduct reflects greater honor on them than the publication of the following handbill if it were done by their direction which was generally understood numerous copies of them were given away on thursday and the whole tenor of it sufficiently justifies what has been asserted and what most assuredly was severely felt and seriously thought upon viz that the constitution was endangered  whereas some illdesigning and malicious persons have published for the purpose of disquieting the minds of his majestys faithful subjects that it is intended to try the prisoners now in custody by martial law notice is given by authority that no such purpose or intention has ever been in the contemplation of government but that the said prisoners will be tried by the due course of law as expeditiously as may be  this account of the public attention to their rights is necessarily a part of the narrative and is besides due to those who in times of tumult and disorder like these spoken of had fortitude and virtue enough not to be so embarrassed as to forget that which constitutes the greatest bessing upon earth it affords this instructive lesson likewise that it is the duty of good citizens who have a real and not merely a verbal love for their country and freedom to think seriously of establishing that kind of police which shall enable them to defend themselves without the aid of powers which may sometimes be turned to their destruction  another very proper handbill was circulated and which it is probable was done by the protestant association the following is a copy  it is earnestly requested of all peaceable and welldisposed persons as well protestants associated as others that they will abstain from wearing blue cockades as these ensigns are now assumed by a set of miscreants whose purpose it is to burn this city and plunder its inhabitants and who wish by distributing amongst betterdisposed persons and prevailing on them to wear these marks and distinctions to screen themselves from the detestation and punishment due to their enormous crimes  and it is farther recommended to all tradesmen and masters of families not to employ or retain in their service any persons who distinguish themselves by wearing blue cockades  it is now time to relate another part of the business which has claimed the attention of some politicians who pretend to see farther into latent causes than the bulk of the people  the mischief which had been perpetrated and that which was evidently intended were of so black an aspect and involved so entirely the destruction of the empire that the most dispassionate and those who were least liable to be perverted by idle conjecture could not help sometimes thinking they saw a wicked head directing the violent and rude hands of the mob the universal destruction of the prisons was a vast project but such a one as was not altogether improbable to be a favorite scheme with a lawless rabble history furnishes examples of the like but no history can parallel the depth of their schemes upon the bank the treasury and the demolition of the waterworks thereby to prevent the extinguishing any conflagration they had begun and that these schemes were not the chimeras of fear were evident a strong guard was sent to the new river head and continued there on constant duty exclusive of these the grand arsenal at woolwich the mansion house the inns of court and many other places of the greatest national concern were devoted and there was scarce a person on the thursday but was unanimous in supposing the desolation of the city and country was intended another handbill besides those already inserted was distributed which perhaps might take its rise from the general opinion but which however tended to give that opinion strength it was as follows  no french rioters this is to give notice that it now appears that the horrible riots which have been committed in this city have been promoted by french money and to call upon all honest men to stand forth against rioters who under the cloak of religion are wantonly destroying our property and endeavoring to overset our happy constitution if the french are suffered by these means to prevail popery will certainly be introduced which we have no reason to fear from a british parliament  still farther to confirm these conjectures the newspapers of friday gave accounts of louisdors being found upon some of the rioters who had been killed or taken and what at last entirely gave it credit was the apprehending examination and commitment of lord george gordon he was conducted to the tower on friday evening under a remarkably strong guard said to be far the most numerous that ever escorted a state prisoner a large party of infantry was in the front his lordship followed in a coach in which were two officers two soldiers rode behind the coach which was immediately followed by general carpenters regiment of dragoons after this came a colonels guard of the foot guards and a strong party of militia marched on each side of the carriage  this transaction rung through london and so entirely was he deemed the original author and promoter of the riots that few were found to pity him a thousand surmises were circulated such as whether religion avarice or ambition was the motive that had prompted him in the action whether france m or any foreign powers had been abettors and others of the like nature equally at present vague and indeterminate this much however ought in justice to lord george to be observed that it is apparent from what has hitherto transpired that he has been actuated rather by a wrong head than a wicked heart no better account of the whole affair for the present than the following which is copied from the public prints can be procured  the circumstance that first induced the members of administration to turn their thoughts toward taking the noble patron of the protestant rioters into custody is said to be this  lord george in the heat of his too successful enthusiasm wrote a letter which he sent for insertion to the conductor of a morning publication addressed to his religious associates wherein he recommended them to nourish the noble spirit that had so laudably taken possession of them and told them that he did not in the smallest degree doubt that an unlimited compliance with all their requisitions would be the undoubted consequence of their perseverance he at the same time indeed annexed a kind of exhortation for the preservation of peace and good order but as this concluding suggestion was too repugnant to the general tenor of the epistle and also far too faintly urged to produce an adequate effect the printer very judiciously deemed it the best step he could take for the welfare and quiet of his country to send the copy of this letter to government which he accordingly did in a note addressed to lord hillsborough his lordship immediately on the receipt of the letter caused a council to be convened before whom he produced it the unanimous opinion they held upon it was that it was of a very inflammatory tendency and that the author was undoubtedly amenable to the laws as the promoter of a traitorous and unconstitutional sedition as a farther sanction however for the measures they intended to adopt toward him an order was immediately issued to the post office enjoining all letters franked g gordon to whatever quarter they might be addressed to be from that time detained and transmitted to the office of one of the secretaries of state in consequence of this mandate several letters written by the deluded young nobleman were stopped and afterward laid before the cabinet most of these were directed to scotland and were replete with observations equally subversive of order religion and liberty he gave a faithful narrative of the transactions which had taken place in the metropolis and instead of accompanying the relation with those expressions of horror and disapprobation which must have actuated every good and welldisposed citizen he seemed rather to exult in the event as nothing pervaded these epistles but rapturous encomiums on the glorious cause and extravagant panegyrics on the noble spirit displayed by his brethren in the defense of it the uniform tendency of all these different letters sufficiently determined the cabinet as to the propriety and indeed necessity of making the author of them prisoner and orders were immediately given for that purpose he was first brought before the council assembled at st jamess where he was examined concerning the purport of his various epistles and particularly interrogated as to the nature of his own designs and motives in writing them he disclaimed all intentions of violating the public peace and expressed the warmest attachment for the love of his country but at the same time vindicated his adherence to the cause he was concerned in with astonishing ability and resolution to the question however which was frequently and forcibly put by different members of the cabinet how he could so far forget his dignity as an immediate descendant of one of the first families of his country and also a legislator of england as to unite with a set of the lowest men in the kingdom and to be instrumental in producing the shocking disorders and irreparable injuries which had taken place he only severally replied that he had not foreseen those effects in all the degrees to which they had extended that he did not mean them and was sorry for them but against this i was urged why did he in all his letters convey an implied approbation of these disturbances if such was his disposition of mind as he there represented his lordship made no good answer to this observation after he had undergone an examination of upwards of an hour at st jamess he was taken to the horse guards where lord amherst sat in his capacity of commander in chief and proceeded to a farther scrutiny into this dark and diabolical business here more testimony appeared several persons were brought who swore to certain expressions of a most inflammatory tendency indeed which had been used by his lordship on the day when the petition was originally presented to the house of commons his haranguing the mob from the lobby of the house was dwelt upon and his expressions with respect to mr burke particularly sworn to his preparations for an immediate departure into scotland as soon as ever the possibility of farther mischief was precluded by the interposition of the military was also proved as a collateral corroboration of the nature of his views and about eight oclock his examination finally closed with a full conviction on the minds of the auditors that his lordship had been principally instrumental in convening the riotous multitude which had for six several days and nights infested the streets of the metropolis and that he had been by his speeches etc abetting in producing the great and irreparable mischief to his majestys loyal and faithful subjects which had subsequently arisen  what his lordship may have to urge in exculpation of this dreadful charge on the day of trial has not yet transpired but it is hoped for his own sake and for the sake of the honorable family he sprung from that he will be able to make some defense against an imputation of so black and infamous a dye  on the thursday previous to the commitment of lord george both houses of parliament had adjourned tothe monday sennight alleging that most truly constitutional reason that it was impossible to transact parliamentary business while the military power superceded the civil  it now remains to collect such circumstances which either escaped notice in the haste with which this account was obliged to be drawn up or which could not without injuring the narrative have been inserted in any other place and which may serve to corroborate what has been before asserted relative to the audacity and wickedness of the rioters the account shall then be closed with an abstract or summary of the mischiefs committed that is of the principal of them a detail of the lesser outrages frauds and impositions perpetrated at such a time and in so extensive a place is impossible to procure and would be tedious to read as well as relate  on wednesday evening the rev b allen was robbed in the street opposite mr langdales distillery holbornbridge between eight and nine oclock by a gang of pickpockets some of whom forcibly held him whilst his pockets were picked of a gold french made watch seals etc a purse with two guineas and a half his keys and other articles  his pockets were turned inside out a person decently dressed held his cane and returned it very civilly when the affair was over  three or four several times during the general conflagration at mr langdales etc a single fellow with a blue cockade and a bludgeon demanded money for the gang threatening those who made the least hesitation in bedfordrow and the adjacent streets and so terrified were the inhabitants his demands were complied with but a stronger proof still of the infatuation of the mob who concluded they had effected the total subversion of order was the following on saturday when every place was guarded and all things peaceably settled in their former channel a man had the temerity to demand money in the middle of the day in holborn he however was presently secured  in the beginning of the week the following inflammatory and execrable handbill was given away at a house in fleet street where a paper call the scourge of an infamous and libelous tendency had been published  england in blood on thursday morning the  th inst at nine oclock will be published in one sheet and a half folio price only three pence by c thompson no     fleet street  the thunderer  addressed to lord george gordon and the glorious protestant association showing the necessity of their persevering and being united as one man against the infernal designs of the ministry to overturn the religious and civil liberties of this country in order to introduce popery and slavery  in this paper will be given a full account of the bloody tyrannies persecutions plots and inhuman butcheries exercised on the professors of the protestant religion in england by the sea of rome together with the names of the martyrs and their sufferings highly necessary to be read at this important moment by every englishman who loves his god and his country  to which will be added some reasons why the few misguided people now in confinement for destroying the rmh chapels should not suffer and the dreadful consequences of an attempt to bring them to punishment  and on saturday mr moore and two boys were apprehended and committee o separate prisons on suspicion of writing vending etc the bill and the paper advertied in it  the same day mr fisher secretary to the protestant association was taken to the ower examined by the privy council and honorably dismissed  many families in every part of the metropolis left town during the insurrection at which time five guineas were refused for a chaise to go ten miles  it would be wrong to forget the armed associations who turned out on thursday though some have accused them of being very quiet and peaceable till the danger was all over  no private man has suffered to so great an amount as mr langdale who has been so often mentioned not only his furniture houses and the utensils of his distillery but an immense quantity of spirits were destroyed his loss according to the account of one of his head clerks is upwards of an hundred thousand pounds n  during the first days of the commotion parties of soldiers were continually dispatched to the aid of the civil magistrates but these seem strangely to have neglected their duty the officers could not act of themselves and the soldiers after being for some time tame spectators might be said to become accomplices instead of dispersing they shook hands drank and shouted with the mob were asked if they would fight against their countrymen and encourage popery to which the poor fellows with a deal of honest simplicity answered in the negative  in consequence of the complaint made by lord viscount beauchamp against the lord mayor for inactivity during the late riots and particularly during the time of the fire in moorfields the lord mayor was ordered to attend a meeting of the privy council on friday evening mr foley member of parliament who happened to be present also at the said fire and observed the conduct of the lord mayor was ordered to give evidence upon this occasion after lord beauchamp had again stated his complaint mr foley was asked whether the lord mayor had attempted to quell the riot disperse the rioters etc to which mr y fool answered that in his opinion his lordship appeared more like a spectator than a magistrate the lord mayor in his defense said the rioters were so violent and such was his temerit he thought death would be his potion o  on saturday the court of aldermen met at guildhall when the lord mayor gave the court an account of his examination before the privy council and said with much apparent satisfaction that he had got very well off he seemed to have no pain at declaring he thought fear a very sufficient excuse for his want of activity  the following is a summary of the proceedings of the rioters friday june   the petition of the protestant associators delivered accompanied by upwards of  0000 persons  lords and commons insulted and maltreated particularly lord boston and the bishop of lincoln  the masshouses

in broadstreet mollyner in the poultry and a house in houndsditch were all stripped of their furniture etc which was burnt as were also the watch houses in kentstreet and near st georges church  thursday   some disturbances happened in the borough in the forenoon which were quelled by the military but we do not hear that any property was destroyed and in the afternoon by the arrival of a large number of troops both horse and foot which were stationed in different parts of both cities the public tranquillity was once more happily and we trust effectually restored  anecdotes of the life of lord george gordon in justice to the author it is mentioned that these anecdotes are by another person  lord george gordon is third son to the late duke of gordon he was born in london about the year      or      and entered at an early age into the navy he rose to the rank of lieutenant and there owing to some disgust or disappointment he gave up his commission his enemies take occasion to say that he retired because lord sandwich would not grant a very imprudent request which he made for a ship on the moment of his having procured a seat in the house they say that he threatened the first lord of the admiralty to throw himself into the arms of the opposition if he did not comply with his demand and on his lordships refusal that he actually did take a decided part against ministers and by that means quarrelled with the duke his brother his friends give a very different account of this business they say that from his earliest years he expressed a very zealous if not a violent attachment to the constitution of this country and though of an amorous complexion that he paid his court to her as his darling mistress  having while a midshipman been in america he had conceived a very particular affection for the inhabitants and when the ruinous measures were pursuing in parliament which terminated in the dismemberment of the empire he took a decided part against ministers from conviction and not from disappointment having done this and thereby had a temporary disagreement with the duke his brother he had no reason to believe that lord sandwich would permit him to rise in the way of his profession and he left a service in which in the present day of degeneracy and corruption men rise by interest and not by merit  no man had juster pretensions to independance though few perhaps in the house were poorer than lord george gordon he has preserved through life the most guarded and decent economy and with an income of between   and  00l a year has maintained his integrity firm and inviolate notwithstanding the attacks which ministers have from time to time made upon it one of their practices his lordship with indignant spirit published in the house lord north he said had been guilty of an infamous attempt to bribe him with a place of a  000l a year to give up his seat in parliament this charge the minister received with a distorted face he denied that he had been guilty of an infamous attempt but he never intended to disprove the charge this story is differently told it is said that the duke his brother made application to the minister for his place and there were several interviews between them on the subject the place was promised to his lordship with the condition of his giving up his seat and on this ground the treaty was broke off  the part that his lordship has taken in regard to the protestant association is too recent in the minds of men to require recapitulation he did not take an active part in opposition to the bill in favor of the papists at the time of its passing because as his lordship says he had not then become a speaker we are well assured that his lordship had no idea of producing the dreadful consequences that ensued from assembling the association he was well convinced at the same time that unless the petition of the protestants was strengthened by an association there was no reason to apprehend that any regard would be paid to it the measures which he advised and adopted were founded on his knowledge of the venality of parliament and his worst enemies must acknowledge that he has acted openly and heartily throughout the whole business he gave the house to understand that   0000 men had determined to have the act repealed nay he even proceeded so fairly as to move in his place that  00000 stand of arms firelocks bayonets and accoutrements might be transmitted to scotland to enable them to put themselves in array and accomplish their purpose the noble lord has through life maintained the character of a facetious companion he possesses a great fund of wit and humor and his temper is withal so sweetened with the quality of good nature that he has never been known to sacrifice it at the shrine of satire for the whole of this season no man has been more universally attended to in the house than his lordship and he has said some of the severest and at the same time the wittiest things against both sides of the house that have been uttered in st stephens since the day of the celebrated charles townshend and should his lordship fall a sacrifice to his zeal on the present occasion no man ever received a greater share of public respect than his lordship will no doubt meet with  appendix note a mr thurloe the present lord chancellor spoke to the bill the purport of his speech was that though he did not mean to oppose it he would recommend caution he desired they would consider what principles the act of william and mary had been formed upon and thought the repeal of the penalties against popish priests exercising their function deserved consideration  the bishop of peterborough in the upper house observed that the bill ought to have been introduced at an earlier part of the session by which means the disposition of the nation toward it might have been known and that it was not only worthy their lordships attention to look into the real security of the constitution but to prevent alarms of imaginary danger with which ignorance and malice heretofore had kindled and might again kindle flames which the authority of the law might find it difficult to extinguish  note b though this pamphlet neither does nor was intended to contain particulars of the scotch riots yet one of the incendiary letters is so curious on account of the art with which it is drawn up and the specimen of economy it exhibits that it is thought worthy to be presented to the reader it is as follows  men and brethren whoever shall find this letter will take it as a warning to meet at leith wynd on wednesday next in the evening to pull down that pillar of popery a popish chapel lately erected there  edin jan         a protestant p s please to eaod this carefully keep it clean and drop it somewheoe else for king and country unity     the superscription on the back was to every protestant into whose hands this lette shall come greeting  note c it was this character which gave him a privilege to use language in the house of commons which the most violent seldom ventured to imitate  will any gentleman said he in opposition to the address of      answer that the people shall pay more taxes without a revolt at home i mention the possibility of a revolt at home because our constituents have borne much already they have been patient and long suffeing a popish chapel they have had a successful example in their fellow subjects of america who have revolted from the expensive government of england to the protection of a wise and virtuous congress yet i see no prospect of a real change for i do not hear that the people are about to choose a congress or to proclaim a protector when the people show an inclination to demand redress i will accompany them with the greatest pleasure i am afraid i speak too loud so as to give an appearance of passion to what i assure the house are my most deliberate sentiments  vide parliamentary debates  note d the bishop is brother to the lord chancellor mr atkinson an attorney of westminster gave him shelter in his house from the fury of the mob and he escaped after changing his dress over the tops of houses the rage of the rioters was in this as in many other instances unaccountable as mr thurloe was not a bishop therefore had no seat in parliament when tho act passed and his brother was one of those few who rather discouraged than promoted its passing  note e some accounts say it was colonel hlroyd but it is right to inform the reader that as no strangers were admitted into the gallery of the house of commons on that day nothing respecting such conversations can be ascertained these anecdotes have been related and are not at all improbable  note f the petition of the protestant association to the honorable the commons of great britain in parliament assembled the humble petition of his majestys loyal protestant subjects of the cities of london and westminster shows that your petitioners sensible of the many blessings which as protestants and britons they enjoy cannot but be alarmed at an act passed in the   th year of the reign of his present majesty repealing certain penalties and disabilities imposed on the papists by a statute enacted in the   th and   th years of william iii for further preventing the growth of popery  that it is with the deepest concern they petition the house against a law which has lately received the royal assent but as this act is so suddenly introduced and so hastily passed before the sense of the nation at large could be obtained or any opposition formed against it they are encouraged to hope that this application will not prove too late for redress  that notwithstanding the late act might be intended to repeal only detached parts of a single statute your petitioners conceive that it is an absolute repeal of the most essential clauses in that statute and will operate virtually to render those acts against the papists that are yet unrepealed of no effect  that your petitioners apprehend that the papists construe the late indulgence of parliament to be a toleration of popery as appears by the mass houses and schools which they are opening throughout the kingdom and by their printing popish books and publicly exposing them to sale  that popish bishops priests jesuits and schoolmasters now openly exercise their functions whereby the people especially the rising generation are in danger of being led into superstition idolatry and rebellion  that papists can now purchase what lands tenements or hereditaments they please and inherit the same that they will thereby influence our elections in future parliaments and that this must tend to the destruction of our happy constitution  that as papists can now by legal authority confess the ecclesiastical or spiritual jurisdiction of the pope and see of rome which our laws before the passing of the late act have constantly disavowed your petitioners are very much alarmed lest they should be involved in the guilt of perjury when called to declare upon oath that no foreign prince person prelate state or potentate has any jurisdiction or authority ecclesiastical or spiritual in this realm  that popery is in is nature intolerant in a protestant country seditious and in this kingdom disaffected to the present reigning family and therefore to encourage it tends to the subversion of the state to dethrone the king and to set aside the succession of the illustrious house of hanover to the crown of this kingdom  that as england and scotland are united your petitioners cannot but think it a hardship upon the people of england to have popery cuntenanced among them by law when their brethren in scotland have been officially assured that no law shall be made to favor popery in that country and your petitioners presume that their peaceable deportment and the constitutional steps they have taken to obtain redress will met with the approbation of this honorable house  that your petitioners do not desire to persecute the papists but to preserve themselves and their posterity from a repetition of those rebellious and bloody sens which popery under pretense of promoting the interest of the church has exhibited in these kingdoms  wherefore to preserve the succession of the illustrious house of hanover in the protestant line and to secure our civil and religious liberties against the encroachments of popery to the latest posterity your petitioners humbly pray that leave may be given to bring in a bill to repeal the act lately passed in favor of the papists  and your petitioners as in duty bound shall ever pray note g the following handbill was distributed on the  th of june in palace yard when the mob was assembled before the parliament house it is scarcely necessary to observe that at such a time and in such a place it was inflammatory and wicked  true protestants no turncoats or six plain reasons given why protestants of all denominations should oppose the growth and establishment of popery with the greatest vigor and without delay earnestly addressed to every man in his senses ezra ix        because one of the principal tenets of popery is to destroy all heretics off the face of the earth    because the papists are taught to believe and esteem every one a heretic who does not belong to the church of rome    because the doctrines of popery are inconsistent with reason and diametrically opposite to common sense witness the doctrine of transubstantiation    because popery encourages persecution and countenances murder witness the martyrs in bloody queen marys reign and the inquisition in spain and portugal in the present day    because the doctrines of popery are not according to godliness as they allow pardons for sins past present and to come to be bought or purchased with money so that any one may commit the greatest crimes with impunity if he does but pay the popish priest a few guineas for his absolution    because popery in the general leads to the grossest idolatry and superstition as it enjoins the worshipping of angels relies etc and bowing down to and adoration of the host a consecrated wafer something like what children call a jack in the box  how far the foregoing reasons may be allowed as inpeable objections to the reception or encouragement of popery let common sense reason and true piety determine  a caution to the unwary it is well known that several popish priests since the repeal of the act against popery have made it a practice to travel through the different counties of england and wales to mke proselytes especially among the poor the method they use is when they meet with any persons who are in such low circumstances as to be unable to pay for their childrens education abroad and hardly able to maintain them at home they readily offer and frequently with success as it is no small temptation to such persons and in such circumstances to take and clothe and educate their children at their own expense by which means such children are naturally brought up in the roman catholic faith and the parents themselves lured by pecuniary gifts are too often induced to embrace the same for the sake of obtaining the mammon of unrighteousness  forewarned  forearmed  w  note h the total return said to have been given in to lord amherst on the   th of june is as follows killed by guards and association   0  by light horse   0  died in the hospitals         prisoners under cure      total killed and wounded       but enquiry has been made and we are informed that the account was fabricated to serve some purpose that his lordship had received no such account and that an exact statement like the above was hardly possible to procure not to mention that many have died in hospitals and other places since the above was published  note i and many more since the first edition of this pamphlet eleven were discovered on one day one of whom had a gin bottle in his pocket  note k a reputable tradesman in the neighborhood cited gave the author this intelligence the fires were made smaller and more numerous on account of the narrowness of the streets which would otherwise have been totally destroyed but as many who read the first edition expressed a doubt about the authenticity of the information enquiry was made on the spot and it is probable that the person who related it was deceived in the number  note l lord mansfield has given the doctrine of military interference an explanation as unexpected as it is new he has considered them not as soldiers but citizens amenable to the civil magistrate for their conduct and having a right to act in all cases of tumult like passengers or other persons the public seem unhappily to have acquiesced and taken his lordships word for demonstration the doctrine is specious and its novelty joined to his lordships reputation have given it the force of truth but if it is constitutional the difference between the government of england and a military one is imperceptible a soldier who is merely passing is in a very different legal situation to a soldier under arms called forth to act offensively and defensively it would seem strange to hang that man for murder who only obeyed the word of command if lord mansfields assertion is true all the soldier who have been active in suppressing the riots are liable to be tried for their lives  note m it has been related with great confidence that an officer in the service of congress who was a prisoner at charles town said that the congress had much difficulty to persuade the americans to continue the war another year and that they were at last only prevailed upon in consequence of being assured that the cities of london and westminster would be burnt and destroyed this summer lord mansfield and others supposed to have the best information have said many things in parliament too by which it appears government is of opinion that something besides religion has been the occasion of the disturbances  note n various accounts have been given of the sum total of mr langdales loss in parliament fifty sixty and ninety thousand have been severally mentioned the account inserted in the text was taken as affirmed from the mouth of one of his servants  note o this is a newspaper anecdote but what mr burke pleaded in his lordships behalf in the house of commons was far more severe than any thing his enemies have related or invented that is supposing his lordship possessed of delicacy and feeling which however are things by no means positively ascertained a daily paper gives mr burkes sentiments in the following words  all men he said were not made alike the lord mayor he supposed was of a timid nature and without natural courage and capacity that sit some men to act a wise and decided part in trying situations neither had he made up he presumed the disadvantages of his natural infirmity and timidity by study and culture as he never dreamt in his younger days of filling so important a station as that of lord mayor of the city of london it was probable he had neglected to acquire those talents that might be requisite in certain emergencies to discharge the duties of it for these reasons he hoped they would have mercy on the poor lord mayor in consideration of his natural weakness and total want of education  the author is exceedingly obliged to the gentleman who has taken the trouble in so candid a manner to correct an error into which he had unintentionally fallen truth without prejudice or partiality has been preserved as far as it was possible with the utmost assiduity to procure it amidst that hurry and confusion and that variety of reports which at the moment the pamphlet was written prevailed the london association deserves every acknowledgement every praise not only that the author but that the kingdom can bestow the liberty of printing the following letter it is presumed the author of it will forgive if not approve and the original mistake is left as in the first edition that those who have not read that edition may perceive the whole affair as the following letter does the writer of it great honor in several respects his name and address should have been inserted as on the card he enclosed but that it was not known whether the insertion would have been agreeable to his inclinations to william vincent sir it was not till this morning that a publication under your name fell into my hand a narrative of the late riots which is penned with a candor and impartiality that assure me you would be desirous to correct any assertion to the disadvantage of others into which you have been misled either by ignorant or prejudiced misinformation  in the  d page of your pamphlet is the following paragraph it would be wrong to forget the armed associations who turned out on thursday though some have accused them of being very quiet and peaceable till the danger was all over  in the foregoing paragraph it is easy to distinguish between two distinct particulars in the first sentence you seem to express some favorable sentiments of your own toward the behavior of the armed associations and in the second relate only the remarks which others made on their conduct at the late interesting crisis  as a volunteer in the london military association of foot i think it incumbent on me to inform you that on the wednesday afternoon we made a tender of our services to the lord mayor of london before the hour of seven the same evening we were under arms and continued so all night in the same duty with the regulars first protecting the mansion house then marching to such other parts of the city as were actually attacked before four in the morning we had secured the rioters in the house of mr donovan in broad street and saved the house of his neighbor mr gorman from the ruin to which it had been devoted though not without the painful necessity of committing some execution on those who were not by repeated entreaties to be persuaded to desist and disband  very little enquiry would fully assure you that the services of the armed associations were vigorously exerted and unremittedly continued from the moment the civil magistrate could be depended on not to suffer them to stand the defenseless victims of that outrage and abuse which they had with indignation seen the military exposed to in the preceding stages of the late horrid scenes of brutality and confusion  the regulars were not permitted to do any actual service till the wednesday evening and from that very hour the london military associations kept even pace with them in every endeavor for the preservation of the dearest interests of the community from the ruin with which they were threatened  i am sir your humble servant a volunteer in the london military association of foot tuesday morning june       0 i send my name and place of address enclosed that you may if you please enquire of my reputation for veracity as an anonymous contradiction of certain facts with the assertion of others could not have a just claim to attention    advertisement great care has been taken relative to the authenticity of facts some have unavoidably been selected from the public papers but such as nobody contradicts some the author can attest and others were collected from spectators of undoubted veracity  a strong and lasting impression was fixed upon the mind of the narraor by being present at many of those scenes of horror he has undertaken to describe an effort has been made to convey them as they were universally felt but that is next to impossible  a person who in the midst of uproar and distraction composes a narrative and gives it in the form of a small pamphlet cannot be supposed to write for same but he may be strongly affected by private and public distress he may sigh with a weak and sickly mother driven from her habitation at midnight with all her little ones terrified and crying around her he may groan for a mad misguided multitude tossing the brands of destruction on the head of innocence and exposing themselves to present or to future death he may weep over the ruins of a city and at the desolation of its innocent inhabitants  the subject is worthy the talents of the ablest historian the dignity and case of one is little expected in this kind of publication  if the author has communicated ideas so as to impress a faint image of that horror and detestation which every good citizen experienced who was present at the perpetration of these lawless acts he has effected more than he hoped such hope is now only inspired by the favorable reception the public gave to the first edition  finis
