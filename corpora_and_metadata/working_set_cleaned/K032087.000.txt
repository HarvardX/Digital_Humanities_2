seventy four select cases with the manner of cure and the preparation of the remedies in the following diseases  i the schirrus cancer and ulcers of the breast and womb ii scrophulous swellings and ulcers about the neck and other parts commonly called the kings evil iii the specks and opacity of the cornea of the eye in which sight has been restored by internal medicines only iv old ulcers of

celsus london printed for f newbery at the corner of st pauls churchyard in ludgate street  mdcclxxix  price one shilling and sixpence  the preface the following collection of cases is the practical part of a considerable work written on glandular affections in general in which their causes will be explained and a new theory drawn from the latest anatomical discoveries in the lymphatic system as numbers are daily suffering under these ravaging complaints humanity dictated to me the necessity of the present publication and it is hoped this attempt to alleviate human misery will be received with candor  the names of the generality of patients have not been introduced but several of distinction may be referred to should it be esteemed necessary  it would be highly unbecoming the dignity of the profession not to have a tender concern for the reputation of others the candid therefore will perfectly conceive my motive for concealing the practitioners who unsuccessfully attended the subsequent cases previous to my being consulted  harley street cavendish square may  0      introduction the uncertainty of curing ulcerated legs by rest salivation etc and the frequent relapses of patients discharged from hospitals induced me near twenty years ago to search for remedies more adequate to the nature of the complaint the cause of ulcers i conceived to be owing to some scorbutic or other taint in the habit in which the lymphatic system was principally affected an internal alterative treatment was adopted success in many instances was the consequence and the improvements were made public in the year      a treatise on the method of curing ulcerated legs without rest proved by a variety of cases the doctrines see sharps surgery that old ulcers were difficult of cure that it would be dangerous to attempt the healing them as it might endanger the patients life or produce a diarrhoea fever or asthma were refuted by undeniable facts  the seat of the ulcer is commonly in the adipose membrane which is sometimes thickened and very frequently callous i discovered in the cure that these hardened parts became soft and pliant and from hence some hopes were entertained that a similar practice might remove glandular complaints a trial proved the conjecture not ill founded for a considerable number of indurated breasts which an extensive employment in midwifery furnished were in general cured by gentle alteratives numbers of patients in disorders of this nature presented themselves as advice and remedies were given for many years without any gratuity afterward an hospital was opened to which the poor might daily apply with no other recommendations than distress and sickness there were seldom less than four or five hundred patients under cure in diseases of the eyes schrophulous cancerous ulcerous and other indispositions the experience obtained from this great variety of cases enabled me to comprehend a more beneficial treatment than the common which was acknowledged defective by that excellent surgeon the late mr samuel sharp improvements were gradually made from a more minute knowledge of the complaints and some dreadful affections formerly thought incurable were conquered by the gentlest means the disorders incident to the breasts after delivery could in general be prevented chiefly by a partial abstinence from liquids or if tumors or inflammation happened remedies more efficacious than shaking the breasts embrocations of oil brandy and vinegar plasters of diachilon or treacle on brown paper etc could be administered with a certainty of advantage in every case a treatise has been written on these subjects and the curative intentions fully explained a treatise on the diseases of the breasts and methods of managing women during childbed etc etc the confidence of several persons of rank the public protection and the pleasure which reiterated success produced excited fresh ardor in the pursuit of new enquiries  the usual methods of managing distempers of the eyes seemed to be exceedingly defective and in many instances cruel these subjects next engaged my attention the ancient and modern treatment was examined and in a publication censured or praised in proportion as it experimentally appeared to have had merits or defects a treatise on the ancient and modern methods of curing diseases of the eyes with new improvements  external applications to the eyes particularly poultices were in general condemned with the reasons assigned the inflammatory indispositions were reduced under four heads st ives makes a number of useless distinctions new methods of cure were recommended and illustrated by proofs of persons relieved the manner of extracting the cataract was successfully improved and many patients were restored to sight  to demonstrate that it is on facts alone that these assertions are made the following collection of cases now make their appearance as an addition to the former upwards of sixty cases have already been published in the treatises  in order to extend and confirm the utility of the improvements and render them more beneficially useful to society  the principal remedies used in the cures were cinnabar antimonii cinnabar factitium aethiops mineralis sulphur antominii precipitatum aquila alba nitrum purissimum aethiops antimonialis camphora spt salis ammoniac ether nitri the caput mortuum of spirits of nitre calx antimonii unguentum saturninum the aethiops mineralis should be prepared by rubbing a considerable time without any heat  the aquila alba is the calomel ten or twelve times sublimed by which its purgative and drastic qualities are destroyed a quarter or half a grain joined with an equal quantity of sulphur antimonii precipitatum when well rubbed for a long time together and formed into a pill with confectio damocrat is called pilula rubra  the nitre should be rendered perfectly pure by fusing in a crucible and rechristallisation when mixed with equal parts of aethiops min and a small portion of cinnabar antimon by a long trituration the composition is called pulvis mineralis  camphorated julap has been often prescribed with the other remedies as a resolvent and corrector  the aquila alba is given in the dose of a quarter or half a grain formed into a pill with sugar and a mucilage of gum arabic this is named pilula alba  the calx antimonii and the aethiops antimonialis are given in general to persons who have a dry skin  the spiritus salis ammoniaci is sometimes added to the solutions of simple nitre and is called mistura nitrosa volatilis the ether nitri is given to patients exceedingly nervous or who have hectical symptoms it acts by allaying irritation without producing the ill qualities of opiates and is prepared from one part of pure strong spirit of nitre and two of alcohol without heat in a long necked cucurbit with a head tubes and receivers proper for conveying the white fumes and is called essentia volatilis  the caput mortuum of spirits of nitre is what remains after the distillation according to the method of glauber and is called sal neutralis the difference is very considerable between this salt and that prepared in the common manner   the success in the cures will greatly depend on the purity of the remedies an unadulterated nitre is rarely to be obtained as what is sold commonly contains a portion of sea salt and is united sometimes with a worse ingredient  crude antimony is often impure the argentum vivum even when it passes through leather is frequently adulterated with poisonous ingredients therefore that used in the following cases has always been revived from cinnabar the aqulla alba at present is not commonly prepared the calomel however which it is hoped will not be substituted for it will not answer the purposes intended  the sal neutralis is seldom to be had genuine the medicine in the shops nearest to it is the sal popolychrestum the goodness of the calx antimonii and the aethiops antimonialis will greatly depend on the purity of the articles which compose them the factitious and the antimonial cinnabar is frequently adulterated with red lead and if taken inwardly or received as a fumigation must do infinite mischief  every one accustomed to the study and practice of chemistry will see the necessity of insisting on exactness to be observed in the preparations a number of experiments on these preparations with the manner of detection if they should be sophisticated may be the subject of a future essay  which when properly administered produce little or no sensible operation at first small doses should be prescribed which may be gradually increased as the constitution becomes more habituated to them  a collection of cases in the schirrus cancerous ulcer and other disorders of the breasts case i mrs a  at lady t  aged between  0 and  0 had been afflicted with a hardness of the breast which drew in the nipple the pains had been exquisite on change of weather for between four or five years at no time was the breast easy and the motion of the arm was impaired application had been made to several practitioners some of the first eminence were consulted but not the least advantage obtained and the patient became exceedingly reduced from the tortures and anxiety of mind not having the least prospect of being cured or even relieved she was recommended to me by an apothecary near grosvenor square and took the pilula rubra and the pulvis mineralis in about six months the cure was perfectly accomplished it is now three years since the patient enjoys a good state of health and has had no return of the disorder this cure is known to several persons of rank  case ii mrs formerly servant to  m esquire aged  0 had three large stony hardnesses in the left breast which had been very painful between four and five years so as often to prevent her rest she had repeatedly consulted a skilful court surgeon had taken several remedies without relief she was ordered the pilula rubra and the solutio nitri three times a day in nine months during which time the pains decreased and the swellings gradually resolved she was cured and remains well  case iii mrs m well known to several families of fashion aged betweeen  0 and  0 had been for above two years laboring under great pains in the breast the veins of which were tumid and tortuous and there were several hardened swellings detached from each other the patient was of a remarkable delicate constitution exceedingly nervous and irritable and had undergone repeated bleedings by the advice of an eminent city surgeon without any benefit she took the pilula rubra three times a day and a solution of nitre and in about six weeks all the swellings were resolved and the veins of the breasts reduced to their natural size this patient contrary to my advice neglected taking her remedies and was attacked with a disorder in the womb and afterward the breast became painful the veins swelled again but on returning to the medicines a cure has been obtained  case iv mrs c aged    old street had a schirrus or hard swelling of the whole breast for six years and for above two years before she applied had been in constant and violent pains there were four foul livid ulcers which discharged a very offensive acrimonious humor the veins of the breast were enlarged and she was in such tortures as to be deprived of rest night and day an eminent hospital surgeon had advised her to have her breast cut off and declared it to be impossible to cure her she took the pilula rubra ter de die and solutio nitri the hardened parts gradually resolved the breast which was before fixed became moveable the ulcers healed and the cure was accomplished in between two and three months this person has remained ever since in good health and has not had the least symptom of a complaint in the breast though it is between six and seven years  case v a very respectable baronet recommended mrs e  of hertfordshire for advice in a large hard swelling in the whole breast which was greatly distended immovable and as hard as a stone besides this there were five large ulcers discharging an exceedingly offensive matter excrescences were likewise forming and sloughing away continually this disorder had been bad nine months the pains were acute and the matter discharged was so corrosive as to erode the adjacent parts neither ease nor rest could be obtained even by the use of opiates the arm on the diseased side was with difficulty moved especially in elevating it toward the head the pilula rubra and the pulvis mineralis were given to which was added sal neutralis the external parts were anointed with oleum camphoratum and the cure was effected in a few months above a year and a half has elapsed since without any return of the complaint  case vi mrs d  aged    formerly belonging to the household of her late royal highness the princess dowager of wales had a swelling and hardness in her right breast for twelve years from a blow which not increasing was not much attended too about two years ago an ulcer was formed surrounding the nipple which discharged a great quantity of acrimonious serum the hardness much increased in size was very painful and it was with difficulty her right arm could be lifted toward the head by bleeding occasionally the use of the pulvis mineralis and pilula rubra the swelling has been considerably reduced the use of the arm recovered the ulcer has not become larger and though the perfect cure of this case cannot be expected yet life may be rendered tolerably comfortable for a number of years in a disorder that rough methods might have put a period to  i sincerely believe that if these remedies of the alterative kind were always used on the first appearance of any hardness or swelling in the breasts or womb that either their increase would be prevented or a perfect cure would commonly be effected complaints in the breast are evident but those of the womb are often misunderstood by physicians and treated very improperly owing to a want of practical skill in midwifery the bark and acids frequently do irreparable mischief if given in the schirrus or ulcer as likewise the use of hemlock opiates salt water baths injections etc etc many melancholy instances of this nature have happened which were they published would strike minds susceptible of feeling with horror  case vii a lady near  0 years of age had for a considerable time a large hardened swelling in the right breast supposed originally to have arisen from an accidental blow it had not been much noticed for some years as it had not occasioned pain about the time the menses were partially suppressed a pain was felt the swelling gradually increased and soon occupied and hardened the whole breast the nipple was drawn in and an ulcer formed with a large excrescence like a mulberry near it this case was cured by the pilul rub and pulv mineralis in less than four months the breast became soft the excrescence dropped off and the ulcer healed the external application used was the ung saturninum to the sore half a pound of a well prepared white lead boiled gently for an hour in one pound and a half of hogs lard  and the oleum camphoratum where the skin was not broken this lady has remained perfectly well since the cure which is now above five years and has been advised to take the remedies one month or six weeks in spring and autumn by way of prevention because there has been an hereditary cancerous and schrophulous complaint in the family  case viii mrs b  in oxfordroad had suffered under a painful hardness of the left breast for above five years which extended toward the axilla and greatly incommoded the use of her arm the pilula rubra and the solutio nitrosa were taken internally four times in the day and the oleum camphoratum was used externally this case was cured in between three and four months  case ix mrs f  milbank westminster had her whole breast exceedingly swelled and indurated adhering so firmly to the pectoral muscle as to be immovable there were likewise some glandular swellings in the armpit the patient was of a delicate constitution very nervous and her apprehensions had been so greatly alarmed from the misery she had undergone and the fruitless endeavors that had been used to relieve her that her anxiety of mind joined with the disorder had brought on a universal relaxation of the habit she looked pale and hectical was afflicted with a cough and shortness of breath fever and night sweats she took the pilula rubra ter de die and the pulvis mineralis mixed in water immediately after each pill a light diet was recommended and an abstinence from all acids which last circumstance should be observed always when alteratives are given in one month the constitution was considerably amended though little impression had been made on the tumor except that it was not so painful by a perseverance in the remedies and gradually increasing the doses in two months after the breast was perfectly cured the medicines were directed to be continued for six weeks more good health was restored and no return of any of the symptoms have since appeared six years have elapsed since this cure  case x mrs d  high holborn had a violent inflammation and hardened tumor of the breast her child in sucking had torn off the nipple the pains were exquisite the hardnesses were numerous small and detached from each other this case was not of the cancerous kind a distinction should be made between indurations arising in childbed and those of the cancerous kind these last seldom make their appearance before the age of    and  scarce happen to breeding women  but equally distressing to the patient who had no rest the pilula rubra was given and the solutio nitrosa in one month the cure was accomplished the patient suckled her infant during the cure with the other breast the diseased part became as soft as ever and a flow of good milk continued till she weaned her child  case xi mrs h  near charlotte street bloomsbury    0 had a large induration of the left breast extending to the axilla attended with violent pain and inflammation bleeding was ordered the pilula rubra the camphorated julap with solutio nitrosa were taken externally a poultice was applied with the oleum camphoratum this case was cured in less than a fortnight and the infant sucked without any disadvantage during the taking of the medicines  case xii mrs s  west street st anns had been laboring under a diseased breast between two and three months abscesses had repeatedly formed and broken the matter was discharged but still they were succeeded by other tumors several hard swellings were in different parts of the breast and the exquisite pains had greatly emaciated and relaxed the whole habit the pilula rubra the solutio nitrosa with the camphorated julap cured this case in the course of three weeks  case xiii mrs f  in king street st anns had been delivered between two and three months on receiving cold the left breast swelled became hard and scarce moveable through excessive distension the shooting acute pains attending it were intolerable shaking the parts fomentations poultices of lilly root ointments and diachilon plasters had been administered but the complaint increased and the patient was truly miserable not having the least ease night or day bleeding was at first prescribed the pilula rubra and the solutio nitrosa were given in large doses the inflammation soon subsided the hardness dispersed and the breast became perfectly soft in about four weeks  case xiv mrs g  paternoster row between  0 and  0 had a diseased breast near two years there were at least eight or nine different swellings hard painful and the surface of the breast was inflamed in several parts swellings which had formed matter had broken into many fistulous ulcers discharging an acrimonious serum some of these had healed and formed fissures the pains and the constant misery of the patient were almost inexpressible various remedies in the forms of poultices plasters liniments etc etc had been used without success bleeding was ordered the pilula rubra and solutio nitrosa in about fourteen days the patient was considerably relieved the breast was much relaxed and the cure was finished in about ten weeks after  case xv mrs c  woodstock street marybone had suffered great misery for near two years from a disease of the right breast at first there were several hardnesses which broke into ulcers and being deep seated were very tedious in coming to suppuration the swellings in different parts had broken and discharged matter thirteen or fourteen times occasioning the most exquisite tortures which greatly reduced the patient she could not lift her arm to her head application had been made to a physician of eminence and a surgeon for relief the common poultices were directed and laxative physic but neither ease nor the prevention of fresh formations of matter succeeded their use the pilula rubra with the calx antimonii and the solutio nitrosa were prescribed ease was soon obtained the hardnesses seemed to be resolving and in nine weeks this case which had been so truly distressing was cured  case xvi mrs w recommended by lady h  near berkley square being in the sixth month of her pregnancy was attacked with a violent inflammation and sharp pain of the breast succeeded by a hardness which resisted pressure an abscess near the nipple had also been formed and discharged a great quantity of matter the hardness however still remaining attended with exquisite pain notwithstanding the patients situation i prescribed the pilula rubra quater de die with the solutio nitrosa and in about three weeks a perfect cure was effected she has since had two children and the breast remains well this case amongst many others might be adduced as proofs of the safety of these alterative remedies and the mildness of their operation  case xvii i was recommended by her grace the duchess of  to mrs p  who had a cancerous complaint in her breast she had been for near two years under the care of a surgeon who asserted with confidence that she would certainly be cured he applied caustics to some hardened tumors under the arm as likewise to the breast and it was reported that he had given some preparations of arsenic this last circumstance however can scarce be credited we should hope it not true the ulcer where the caustics had been applied was at least an inch and half deep and four or five inches long discharging a most offensive matter she was in exquisite tortures day and night at first sight of the case i pronounced it incurable to the noble friends of the patient and all that could be attempted was a mitigation of the symptoms the ulcerated parts were dressed with the ung saturninum with camphor the pulvis mineralis was given in small doses and considerable ease was procured the putridity of the discharge however and the other miserable circumstances of the cases brought on hectical symptoms a difficulty of breathing every day increased and the patient died most probably a victim to the pretended knowledge and cruel practices of her surgeon  case xviii mrs m  in the year      perceived a drawing in of the nipple without any hardness of the right breast an eminent surgeon in town advised an issue afterward was prescribed the aethiop vegetabil and mercurial pills the disorder after this did not increase till toward the year      hemlock was then ordered by a very learned physician the breast swelled and was hard under the arm were likewise tumors in may      a caustic was applied under the specious name of a plaster to draw the cancer out the caustic was continued weekly and a poultice used till the whole schirrus was sphacelated and removed which happened july the  th it was afterward dressed with turners cerate healed and continued well for two years though little indurations about the size of pease appeared on the remaining part of the breast from the latter end of      until the spring of      the patient had considerable pains the part where the caustic had been fixed broke out again the swelling in the axilla was enlarged and pressing on the great vessels occasioned a considerable swelling in the arm the surgeon mentioned in the last case was consulted who promised confidently a cure and boldly applied caustics to the tumors in the axilla this produced a large ulcer brought on great pain in the parts accompanied with a cough afterward by his utmost efforts the sore could not be healed on june the   th i first inspected the diseased parts and acquainted a relation of the patients that little success could be expected as violent methods had been used an attempt however was made the pilula rubra and the pulvis mineralis with the calx antimonii and a pectoral mixture were given with great success for in about three months the ulcers both in the axilla and breast were nearly healed and the lady went into the country happy beyond expression in lest than a twelvemonth however the ulcers broke out again and the patient languished for two or three months and died perhaps if no remedies whatever had been used the advice of the first surgeon consulted attended to this lady might probably have been living now  case xix lady  had for one year and a half a tumor in the left breast which was not very painful but a great part was indurated this lady was advised to apply to a gentleman who endeavors to persuade the world that he can safely extract cancerous tumors with a plaster though in the present case there was no sore nor any pressing symptoms the operator rashly applied his caustics with the most confint promises of success and repeated them for four or five months the patient suffering the whole time the most shocking tortures the malady increased which is most commonly the case where violent methods are adopted a large cancerous ulcer surrounded with considerable spongy excrescences appeared which from time to time were destroyed by the caustics but returned soon again the disease extended itself to the other breast hemlock opiates powdered corns of a horse carrot poultices had been administered without success upon my being consulted an opinion was delivered that the cure could not under such circumstances be expected and mitigating the symptoms would be doubtful this judgment was pronounced from experience in a multiplicity of cases where such barbarous treatment had precluded every hope of relief the patient however wished for some trial to be made the pilula rubra and the pulvis mineralis were given and the inflammation which had chiefly arisen from the caustic salts subsided the progress of the disorder was prevented from ing its dreadful ravages on the other breast but no other advantage was obtained except that the pain was in some measure abated sloughs succeeded sloughs and occasioned a most offensive stench the acrid discharge was considerable the patient became hectical opiates could not produce relief and thus lingering under the most distressing and accumulated miseries shocking indeed to the spectators but inexpressibly so to the worthy lady who languished under them she died about two months after  from experience it may be asserted from the circumstances of the foregoing case the lady might have lived years and even though she might not have been cured by bleeding the alterative remedies occasionally a proper diet and mild applications to the part the complaint might have occasioned little trouble and perhaps not increased many too many similar examples have occurred of life being shortened and the most inexpressible miseries created by the cruel application of caustics as well as an unfeeling use of the knife there are many instances of cancers in which it would be fruitless to attempt the cure the physician is then the true friend who advises the patient to do little or nothing and submits the case chiefly to nature  case xx a maiden lady aged    about eight years ago applied for advice in an induration of the right breast the nipple was inverted and discharged an acrimonious serum attended with considerable pain there were likewise glandular swellings in the axilla the hardness was of such a nature that there were not the least hopes of resolving it the amputation of the breast had been recommended by a surgeon which had it been performed would have been exceedingly cruel and probably fatal as no prospects of success could have been entertained owing to the axillary affection the pulvis mineralis alone was ordered ter de die and was continued for six weeks at a time spring and autumn a regular diet was observed wine acids and salt meats were abstained from a quarter of a pint of warm water was taken every day before meat the disorder by this means did not increase for three years about which time the part excoriated afterward became ulcerous and a considerable slough was thrown off an ulcer has continued ever since which is not painful except at changes of weather in the winter season the pilula rubra was used for one month but as no advantage was obtained it was discontinued this lady visits her friends and suffers little or no inconvenience from her cancerous complaint nor is she even suspected by any of her most intimate acquaintances to labor under any such indisposition many similar cases to this have come under my inspection  case xxi mrs p  aged    had been mother of six children after the delivery of the two last she had each time a fever from cold which occasioned a great hardness of the left breast that continued nearly in one state for nine years in the year      the breast was painful and rather increated in size for above three months this alteration succeeded a violent inflammatory fever from this time until jan      there were shooting pains when the menses ceasing to appear some eruptions discharging a sharp watery humor were discovered the advice of an eminent physician was taken salts and manna tinctura senae and hemlock pills were ordered and persisted in for seven months but the disease grew considerably worse in the latter end of july and all august the salt water was drank which greatly relaxed the stomach and intestines and answered no good purpose on october        she applied to me for relief the breast was then as large as a childs head two years old excessive hard inflamed uneven in its surface extending to the axilla where likewise were some indurations and the arm on that side was considerably swelled on the lower part of the breast was a cancerous ulcer some part of which was soft and fungous there were many fissures from which issued a very acrid discharge the pains were so acute and distressing that no rest could be obtained a continual crying was heard like to a person in labor bleeding was first prescribed the pilula rubra the pulvis mineralis and the solution of camphor with the essentia volatilis were administered to the wound was applied the ng saturninum to the surrounding enlarged and distended parts the oleum camphoratum in fourteen days the breast was greatly relaxed the pains were considerably diminished and rest at night was attained before the remedies had been taken four days the plan was persevered in about three months after the ulcer was healed and the indurated parts were perfectly resolved the remedies however were continued ten weeks more when the cure was accomplished  case xxii a lady of rank between  0 and  0 had a large hardness of the cancerous kind in the left breast a great part of the induration was extremely hard and on the lower part was a very livid appearance with little fissures the whole breast was diseased inflamed and extended so as to affect the edge of the right breast and there was a large tumor toward the axilla the pains had become exceedingly troublesome the swellings had increased rapidly and were very alarming this was a case in which no cure could be expected an alleviation of the misery alone could be attempted the opinion i gave to several ladies of quality friends to the afflicted patient and the noble lord her sons was that a cure was impossible but that some hopes were entertained that the inflammation swellings and pains in a great measure could be removed the pilula rubra was administered with the pulvis mineralis ter de die in about three weeks the inflammation entirely subsided and all the swelling except that very hardened part in a great degree resolved the breast was relaxed and the pains nearly abated the pill was then inreased in its dose and the powder this course was continued for between two and three months and the patient was very easy the livid part at this time as had been prognosticated broke and formed an ulcer this was succeeded by a sphacelus of the stony induration which was thrown off gradually and with proper assistance gently removed the discharge was now exceedingly offensive from the putridity of the parts sloughing away the carrot poultice was applied but answered no good purpose whatever in this manner the whole of the diseased part came away and there was an ulcer in which me hand might be buried the remedies were continued the ulcer became clean and not offensive and little or no pain was experienced the discharge from this large ulcer was very considerable which would have been much larger had not the medicines fortunately resolved a very considerable part of the tumor the patient gradually became weaker and the medicines were then discontinued oedematous swellings of the legs afterward made their appearance probably owing to the universal relaxation of the habit and with very little or no pain the patient languished for same time and died  case xxiii mrs b  aged  0 was recommended for relief by a lady of fashion having several hardened swellings in her left breast the right breast had been taken off by the knife about one year and a half before at st georges hospital the wound afterward healed but the disorder being transferred to the other sound breast which is no uncommon thing where the amputation is performed caused great pain and inflammation the pilula rubra was given four times in the day and the pulvis mineralis with the sal neutralis in about two months the swellings considerably diminished the stony hardnesses detached from each other were much softened and the pains entirely abated the remedies during between three or four months in the summer whilst i went to france and holland were persisted in and on my return i found the whole of the swellings dispersed and the breast appeared quite sound this person then went and officiated as cook in a family which was her former employment and remained well for above a year but on receiving a violent cold the swellings in the breast appeared again without any ulcer she neglected applying for some time and from appearances there was no reason to hope that the remedies could again succeed the trial confirmed the opinion for no impression whatever could be made afterward on the disease the patient became hectical suffered very little pain indeed and in about ten months after died  case xxiv a noble lady recommended a poor woman aged    mother of eleven children who had suffered considerable time from an ulcer and schirrus of the breast the pains were exceedingly distressing and the discharge so acrid as to corrode the adjacent parts the saturnine ointment was applied externally and the pilula rubra with the pulvis mineralis were taken in a little more than three months the ulcer was healed and the schirrus part perfectly softened the remedies were continued longer to confirm the cure and there has been no return since which is near two years  cases in complaints of the womb rectum etc case xxv mrs s  fleet street had an ulcer of the womb with a considerabla large schirrus of nine years duration the discharge was purulent and offensive the pains at times excruciating similar to those of hard labor the os uteri uterine complaints cannot be comprehended but by those who are skilfully versed in the theory and practice of midwifery was rough uneven and rather open the ascertaining this fact occasioned the most inexpressible uneasiness the pilula rubra and the pulvis mineralis were prescribed the essentia vol with the camphorated julap were given to alleviate the pain as well as to promote the resolution of the schirrus these medicines were continued near four months during which time the schirrus part was softened and the ulcer healed the patient soon after proved pregnant went her full time was safely delivered and recovered contrary to my expectation in the usual time whoever considers the structure of the uterus and the consequences of the least injury in delivering preternatural births will not be surprised at the doubts i entertained on this occasion  this patient has had one child since and remains in perfect good health it may be remarked that though a schirrus of that part rarely happens to persons between twenty and thirty yet many cases have occurred of this nature  case xxv the following case has made its appearance before though with great reluctance of the author in a letter addressed to dr hunter on the dangerous tendency of medical vanity occasioned by the death of the late lady holland the republication was never intended but a report having been for some years industriously circulated that the lady mentioned in that epistle died miserably of the disorder pronounced by me to be perfectly cured in vindication of the truth and lest such a story should preclude all hopes of relief to patients in similar circumstances it may be necessary to declare that the lady who is now living in the neighborhood of missenden bucks has enjoyed the most perfect health since the cure  case xxvi in the year      m s a lady in the country perceived some small eruptions in several parts of the skin dr bates a physician esteemed in the neighborhood prescribed a lotion afterward by the advice of mr edmonds a skilful surgeon at wendover a quicksilver girdle was worn a considerable time and the eruptions disappeared  in the year      an acrimony in the skin was again very troublesome on using any considerable exercise various medicines were administered but without any benefit and the lady was advised to go to brighthelmstone to use the warm bath and drink sea water these methods produced a great relaxation without curing the eruptions and probably laid the foundation of these complaints which afterward became so dangerous and alarming for a pain was soon felt near the neck of the bladder succeeded by a swelling which frequently suppressed the urine  from this time the symptoms became more violent the pain in the tumor was so exquisite that the lady was frequently deprived of rest dr bates prescribed the common uterine remedies thinking as i have been informed by the family the case to be an ulcer of the bladder or a schirrus of the uterus  these complaints gradually increased for two or three years and the lady finding no relief from any remedy which was prescribed by the medical gentlemen of the county in which she resided it was thought necessary to consult another physician dr smith a gentleman of distinguished reputation and one of the professors of the university of oxford was accordingly consulted  at this time the lady was incapable of using any exercise without pain the urine was sometimes suppressed at others it issued involuntarily commonly occasioning great uneasiness there was a sanious discharge which was considerable dr smith prescribed as follows   emuls commun sine sacch ppt iss  sperm caet in muc g

family according to the candid advice of dr smith carefully removed the lady to london to mrs biltons in tavistock street the great reputation which dr hunter had acquired from his extensive practice in feminine diseases induced her friends to consult him in a case which had such affinity with that branch of practice for which he had been so distinguished  when consulted he declared the case to be

john fothergill   xi      we now find that the hemlock that fashionable and destructive drug is administered but without the least advantage it however enables us to draw this conclusion that the case was treated as a cancer soon after the lady had taken the hemlock a giddiness of the head was complained of and a loss of memory was the consequence which continued a considerable time  these last prescriptions were persisted in till the  th of december during which time the symptoms became more violent the lady continued in extreme misery and her memory became so much impaired that she could scarce recollect any transaction one minute past this last complaint i must attribute to the hemlock because i have known several instances where this noxious drug has produced similar effects and one in particular where it brought on comatose symptoms and incontestibly proved fatal i could here animadvert on the impropriety of the foregoing prescriptions but it is sufficient at this time to observe that they were not successful  on the  th of december in consultation with dr fothergill was prescribed   julep e creta cu dimid sacch iss amyl vulg ss  aq cin ten i  tinct theb gutt ij f

concluded very dangerous induced the physicians heartily to acknowledge the impossibility of relieving the lady dr hunter declared to capt s the brother of the patient in the presence of many other friends and relations that the disorder was absolutely incurable on being questioned by a lady present who had a sincere affection for the patient how long it was thought m s would live it was answered that it would be impossible to determine but dr hunter expressed in a pathetic manner that he was sensibly affected on the reflection that she would suffer extreme misery before her departure it was then advised that m s should be removed with all possible care into the country  the last prescription is as follows  persistat in usu haust anodyn praescript si alvus adstricta fuerit mane capt aq purg jessopens dict vj vel viij vel q s ad alvum semel quotidie submovendum  w h j f the initials of william hunter john fothergill           the foregoing prescriptions were certainly inadequate to the cure of such an obstinate disease but as it is the common mode of practice a deviation from it perhaps would have been considered erroneous as being contrary to the rules of art established maxims however unsuccessful are seldom relinquished though the preservation of life is frequently dependant on it  the lady had a schirrus of the uterus which produced an inexpressible and constant pain there was a continual sanious discharge of that complexion and fetor which characterise a cancerous ulcer the patient was under the disagreeable necessity of lying in bed for the evacuation of the urine and feces and both were attended with great pain and a considerable quantity of purulent matter consequently there was an ulcer in the rectum these symptoms after the administration of the opiates and cretaceous medicines were accompanied with costiveness the most excruciating pains cold shiverings nausea and sometimes vomitings loss of memory and a countenance which seemed to foretell a total dissolution so emaciated and exhausted was the patient that nature seemed too weak to assist the operation of any medicine a great part of the surface of the body was covered with scorbutic eruptions and the least motion even from the bed to a sopha occasioned the most painful sensations at this time lord le despenser did me the honor to recommend me in consequence of my success in a case which his lordship was acquainted with at the request of the brother captain s i visited the lady on the   th of december      i examined minutely every circumstance and endeavored to gain a clear information of what had been already attempted by the gentlemen who had been consulted and committed the whole immediately to paper which was just as i have related it  a consideration of this complicated case disposed me however to believe there yet remained some hopes of effecting a cure i resolved therefore to administer some remedies which experience gave me reason to think were more adequate to the cure of such inveterate complaints than those which had been already prescribed i began with the pilula rubra and pulvis mineralis in very small doses and forbad the use of opiates as their bad effects in weakening greatly overbalance the little temporary relief they give  these remedies produced such excellent effects that the costiveness was removed and all the symptoms were alleviated in a fortnight the patient was then removed into the country and recovered daily in about one month she could sit up three or four hours though in the most inclement part of the winter in about four months more by continuing the remedies the lady recovered her memory perfectly and every discharge had a more favorable appearance the eruptions entirely disappeared she recovered her appetite and natural rest which for some years before she had been deprived of by a perseverance in the same medicines and by gradually increasing their doses a perfect cure was at last accomplished  the lady continues in perfect health and rides on horseback without the least inconvenience in complaints of the breast and womb all rough astringents are commonly injurious especially if they be of the schirrus kind the giving bark elixir of vitriol tincture of roses etc etc which is a common practice frequently does irreparable mischief in those floodings that are the forerunners of cancerous complaints and happen between the ages of    and  0 some observations will hereafter appear in a regular treatise on these subjects as proofs of what is now advanced   case xxvii mrs b  was recommended by a surgeon who had a large induration ulcer and distension of the womb violent floodings had repeatedly distressed the patient great pains and bearing down had rendered her truly miserable various medicines amongst the rest injections had been prescribed by practitioners of eminence nothing certainly can be more irrational than the use of injections in uterine complaints though the most approved authors and practitioners recommended them the os uteri or mouth of the womb when the uterus is in an unimpregnated state will scarce admit a hogs bristle how then is the pipe of a syringe to be introduced or supposing the introduction of a pipe possible what vacity is there in the uterus capable of receiving an injection if the parts should be cancerous and ulcerated an aperture is sometimes discoverable and in that case every hard substance would irritate therefore could the pipe be conducted through the aperture which every manmidwife knows to be next to impracticable such a substance would only injure the parts and increase the patients misery and if any sharp or corrosive matter is injected it bids fair to hasten death hence may be seen the necessity of examining into the merits and defects of the common modes of practice and to depart from them when they are demonstrably proved to have their origin in ignorance for every one who has a precise idea of the anatomy of the uterus must be struck with conviction of the impropriety of administering injections in the schirrus or ulcers of the womb unless merely for cleansing the vagina  both as physicians and menmidwives but no relief whatever had been obtained hemlock had likewise been administered the pilula rubra and the pulvis mineralis were prescribed the enlarged uterus which was distended above the os pubis was reduced within the pelvis in the course of three months the os tincae which was uneven and ulcerated and the surrounding parts enlarged so as to prevent the free discharge of urine were perfectly cured in less than five months the patient has had not the least return it being now near three years since the cure  case xxviii mrs k  castle street leicester fields received a hurt in lyingin which occasioned an ulcer of the uterus the os tincea was opened considerably rugged at its edge the discharge was great offensive and when dried on the linen had a darkish hue toward the edges of the stains the patient was palid and nearly exhausted by the violence of the pain she suffered the pulvis mineralis and the essentia volatilis joined with camphor were given and the cure was effected in a few weeks the patient is now living and has had no return of the complaint since the cure which is about four years and a half  case xxix mrs b  berwick street aged    had been afflicted with great pains in her back loins thighs with a bearing down a suppression of urine and contractions of the uterus for near one year various medicines had been given according to the opinions of the different practitioners to whom she applied remedies for the stone gravel lumbago had been recommended burnt sponge millepedes cathartics soap pills spiritus nitri dulcis etc etc opiates and hemlock had been administered without any advantage this last remedy nearly deprived her of her senses whoever would wish to know the direful effects of hemlock may read the second letter to dr hunter where reasons are given why this destructive poisonous drug should never be administered see likewise de haens epistle de cicuta where it is proved that storck had been guilty of the most flagrant impositions in recommending that deleterious remedy for out of the    persons said to be cured by hemlock  0 died miserably and the remaining six were incurable on examination it was found that the case had been misunderstood for all the symptoms had arisen from a schirrus of the womb which pressed on the neck of the bladder there was likewise an ulcer the discharge issuing being extremely offensive thin and such as ever comes from cancerous ulcers of these parts easier to be conceived by the experienced in midwifery than described the patient was exceedingly exhausted palid and scarce able to take food the pilula rubra was given in the dose of a quarter of a grain and eight grains of the pulvis mineralis with the essentia volatilis occasionally these agreeing in a week the doses were increased and the patient was rather easier the continuance of the remedies with occasionally a few grains of the sal neutralis effected the cure in about five months  case xxx a lady of fashion naturally of a delicate constitution above  0 who formerly had several hard labors and particularly with her last child in      had been suffering for near fourteen years with a complaint in the rectum in the early months of pregnancy the piles were continually troublesome and for fourteen years after the last delivery on every evacuation of the feces was a quantity of blood discharged when the disorder was first discovered a very eminent surgeon and a manmidwife injudiciously advised turpentine glisters to be injected certainly no practitioner who understood the anatomical structure of the intestines or who reflected on their irritability would have advised such a violent heating remedy to such nervous parts already in a state of inflammation  which greatly irritated the inflamed part and after this a purulent matter as well as blood was discharged which proved exceedingly relaxing the practitioners consulted finding the rectum ulcerated and after exerting their utmost efforts to remove the complaint persuaded the patient as is too common that the discharge was healthful and carried off other bodily disorders upon examination afterward it was declared by a very eminent surgeon that there was a large fungus in the intestine but that no operation could prove useful depending on the opinions given and the reputation of the practitioners consulted the misery was bore with the greatest fortitude there not appearing the least hopes of relief having seen the successful treatment of m s mentioned case xxvi this lady was induced to apply to me sept        the countenance was very pale the whole body was exceedingly relaxed with a great languor of spirits and a hectical look twice in a day was discharged a cupful of blood and fetid matter the opinion i gave to the friends was that the rectum was ulcerated that it would be impossible to determine whether relief could be obtained upon the whole that any success was doubtful a trial was made ten grains of the pulvis mineralis were at first given which agreed perfectly well and every week the dose was increased until twentyfive grains were taken four times a day for six weeks nourishing diet rather of the animal gelatinous kind was recommended in about two months the discharge had considerably diminished the patient continued the powders with one grain of the calx antimonii and had the inexpressible pleasure of finding the ulcer healed both discharges had ceased in nine months this lady has remained perfectly well ever since which is now above four years but has taken occasionally the sal neutralis and the pulvis mineralis since the cure by her own desire  case xxxi mrs c had for above one year and a half suffered extreme misery from a schirrus and ulcer of the uterus the first practitioners in london had been consulted and after trying various remedies as opiates laxatives hemlock etc gave up the case as lost the pains were acute and deprived the patient of rest the schirrus was large pressing both on the rectum and neck of the bladder occasioning a difficulty in the expulsion of urine and the feces a fetid purulent and acrimonious matter was discharged in great quantities very offensive and evidently of the cancerous kind sometimes the pains were equal to the strongest labor pains the whole body was greatly emaciated and the patient had not been able to sit up for many months the pilula rubra and the pulvis mineralis with one grain of the calx antimonia were given three times in the day and the use of opiates entirely left off in the course of six weeks during which time the symptoms daily decreased the patient could sit up the remedies were continued for about three months more and all the complaints were nearly removed about this time i went abroad was gone for near three months and on my return found that no one complaint remained except some little discharge and weakness the medicines were still continued with the julep e camphor and there was every reason to conclude the patient nearly cured some time after however came on a violent diarrhoea which proved fatal  when an ulcer accompanies a swelling and hardness of the womb the prospects of cure are doubtful in many such instances the remedies however have afforded a very comfortable relief for years and kept the patients from those intolerable pains which must strike every humane spectator with horror when the common modes of treatment are alone pursued  it is reasonable to conclude that what gives such extraordinary relief in desperate cases and which in some instances has proved a positive cure would in general prevent these complaints at a certain time of life or when the disorders first make their appearance  practitioners in general and all authors either ancient or modern have considered these uterine complaints incurable upon this principle when the disorder is discovered they often persuade the suffering patient that nothing more than the administration of palliatives can be done i have often been called in after much mischief has been done by improper practices where there remained not the least probability of affording relief nay sometimes but a few hours before death and then it has been with exultation reported but with what degree of candor or humanity let the world judge that the patient has died under my care  case xxxii mr c  at st jamess palace had been a long time afflicted with a large spongy excrescence almost surrounding the sphincter any a very considerable discharge issued from the rectum exceedingly acrimonious which inflamed the skin wherever it came in contact several parts were likewise coroded and formed a number of small ulcers not only in the perineum but likewise in the posterior part above the anus causing most exquisite torture night and day when the faeces were evacuated a prolapsus or falling down of the intestine happened he had applied for relief to the most able practitioners laxatives had been administered lotions unguents etc without any advantage the misery he experienced was inexpressible he took a solution of pure nitre joined with the mercurius corrosivus sublimatus in very small doses the sal neutralis was likewise occasionally given with the aethiops mineralis externally as a palliative was applied with a feather litharg aur ij aceti distillati olei amygdalini aa j m f liniraentum by these means ease was soon procured in the course of six weeks the excrescences had dropped off the ulcers were healed the discharge from the rectum ceased and the absolute cure was effected many instances have occurred where the excrescences about the anus the fistula etc have been cured by the above means  case xxxiii h f  esquire a married gentleman had an obstruction in the urethra arising from excrescences and a schirrus of the prostrate gland bougies had been used a considerable time without removing the complaint the patient was frequently under the necessity of having the urine drawn off by means of a catheter the most exquisite pain accompanied the discharge of urine which issued in drops and from the contracting and expulsive efforts of the bladder joined with the resistance near its neck the most inexpressible misery was experienced and this happened very often for there seemed almost a constant irritation of the parts all diuretics and emollients had exasperated the symptoms by promoting the secretion of urine in a disorder which resisted powerfully its evacuation a costiveness prevailed and most cathartics irritated solid meat was sure to cause pain a milk diet had been persisted in by the advice of a physician and the solvent medicines had been administered under the care of a reputable surgeon but without success on passing a small bougie i perceived a slight resistance as nigh as could be conjectured within half an inch of the prostrate grand on pushing on the bougie another powerful resistance was felt near the last mentioned part concluding that the first opposition was from an excrescence and the last from an induration and enlargment of the prostrate gland whoever perfectly comprehends the anatomical situation of the parts affected it is hoped will not condemn this conclusion it must be confessed the case did not admit of demonstration some hopes were suggested that what had so effectually removed other glandular complaints might prove beneficial in this the pilula rubra was given at first in the dose of half a grain four times in the day and persisted in for near three weeks without any advantage except that the urine was discharged with rather more ease and the inclination to evacuate it was more distant in point of time a solution of camphor with the essentia volatilis and the eighth of a grain of a well prepared mercurius corrsivus sublimatus were administered after each pill which last was given in the dose of a grain a mercurial ointment charged with camphor was rubbed into the perineum and a fumigation of cinnabar was used every night previous to anointing the effects were beyond expectation for in three weeks after the urine was discharged with ease small sloughs passed daily through the urethra rather fibrous putrid and scarce more tenacious than coagulated blood the remedies except the ointment were continued for three months and a perfect cure was the consequence  case xxxiv the lady of a member of the house of commons aged    had an enlargement and induration of the womb with a discharge which indicated an ulceration of the part this complaint had been of two years standing and the patient previous to that time had been attacked with frequent and immoderate floodings a court physician not a practiser in midwifery ordered the most astringent remedies as the bark elixir of vitriol tincture of roses etc these injudicious methods of treatment by checking the efforts of nature to relieve herself most probably produced the schirrus of the womb light cooling regimen and remedies will often effect a cure when astringents are ineffectual and injurious in some instances it is best to leave such cases to nature  for great pain succeeded  after the patient had suffered inexpressible tortures and was in the last stage of the disorder pale emaciated feeble and hectical i was consulted and declared the case to be incurable i attempted an alleviation of the symptoms and in great measure succeeded by giving the essentia volatilis and the pulvis mineralis in small doses ter de die in a few weeks however pains came on with contractions of the womb similar to those of labor great quantities of coagulated masses of the polypous kind were expelled which had most probably been detained in the uterus ever since the floodings when those very powerful astringents had been used for vitriolic acids have frequently this property in a few days the discharge became exceedingly putrid and the disorder put a period to the patients existence  schrophulous cases commonly called the kings evil case xxxv miss d  chancery lane about the age of    had many swellings and some of them ulcerated about the neck of the schrophulous kind which threatened suffocation accompanied with a cough several skilful practitioners had been consulted and the cutting them out had been advised but this proposal alarmed the friends and the patient to such a degree that it was determined rather life should be lost than such a disagreeable operation should be performed in a part always exposed to the view this case was perfectly cured by the pilula rubra and the pulvis mineralis with the aethiop antimon in about four months an oleous mixture being taken at first to allay the cough the patient has had no return of the complaint it is now above six years since the cure  case xxxvi mr s  aged    had perceived swellings and an induration first under the chin for above ten years three years after the first tumors appeared both the maxillary glands tumified and became hard harrowgate water was prescribed without any effect fresh swellings arose till at last the whole throat toward the chin and ears was one continued swelling so as to disfigure the face exceedingly the wind pipe and oesophagus were greatly compressed daily threatening suffocation in this situation of the patient i undertook the cure and commenced with bleeding a gentle cathartic and ordered the pilula rubra and the pulvis mineralis four times in the day the swellings in a few months were greatly diminished and by a continuance of the remedies and increasing the dose of the pill to two grains in about fifteen months the cure was effected  this patient has been cured three years and not the least return of the disorder has happened such complaints in general prove fatal instances of which must have occured in all our hospitals one remarkable case of this nature i remember happened which proved fatal in the year      to a young man a patient to mr cowell surgeon of st thomass hospital whose morbid parts were publicly inspected afterward in the theater and it appeared that besides the compression of the asperia arteria the oesophagus was entirely obstructed so that no food whatever could pass  case xxxvii mrs i  harley street had for between four and five years been afflicted with a swelling and stiffness of the knee in which there were five or six foul ulcers on inspection the case evidently appeared schrophulous the pilula rubra was given and this obstinate disease was cured in about four months the patient now remains in perfect health  case xxxviii mr f  had been afflicted with a disorder many years about the fingers and metacarpal bones many parts were ulcerated and could not be healed a skilful surgeon had advised the cutting off of the hand for various remedies had been used without advantage as the millepedes burnt sponge hemlock etc etc  this patient took the pilula rubra and the pulvis mineralis and was perfectly cured in about ten months by which means the hand was saved  case xxxix mrs t  at lady f  aged    after a cold in her   th year a swelling appeared under the lower jaw about the size of a hazle nut this was succeeded by several tumors about the neck some suppurated and discharged matter others were opened the disorder increasing and the patient having had what is called the best advice from a celebrated court surgeon without any advantage despaired of ever receiving relief the swellings increased and at last seemed to unite forming one hard stony tumor from the chin toward the ear the tip of which it pressed out considerably the patients mouth was drawn aside and occasioned a disagreeable and distressing appearance to the face bleeding was first prescribed the pilula rubra and the pulvis mineralis with the aethiop antim were taken four times in the day in fourteen months during which time the tumor had been gradually diminishing the cure was effected and the face which before was greatly disfigured was reduced to its natural form one of the salivary glands remained a little swelled but as many similar instances have happened where it has been of no consequence any farther attempts were thought unnecessary  case xl a young gentleman aged  0 son to an officer in the army came under my care august      he had been inoculated about five years before for the small pox i have seen several instances where inoculation has produced the kings evil therefore we should be very cautious what subject we take the matter from  under the care of a reputable surgeon soon after there appeared several glandular swellings about the neck and throat some came to suppuration and were opened by a skilful court surgeon who advised the use of salt water this was complied with for a considerable time but fresh swellings came before those which were opened or had broken healed the neck was covered with scars and swellings were continually succeeding each other in both eyes there were specks in the cornea in one sight was greatly impeded in the other except a glimmering it was lost the eyes were likewise inflamed bleeding was first prescribed the pilula rubra and the pulvis mineralis with the aethiop ant and the decoctum nitrosum were given by these means the specks and blindness were removed fresh swellings were prevented those whether hard or ulcerated were cured in the course of about eighteen months and the patient who is now at a public school in town remains perfectly well  case xli mr h  st martins lane in december      applied for advice in a noli me tangere which had been bad about two years he had caught cold and a soreness was perceived on the lower part and side of the nose with inflammation and a dark red appearance it was first washed with a solution of nitre afterward a surgeon recommended some mercurial pills but no success attending the use of the remedies he applied to a physician of an hospital who ordered the hemlock in pills gradually increasing the dose till sixteen were taken in twenty four hours for a length of time by which his memory was affected two consultations of physicians and surgeons were had and it was concluded on to give him a solution of mercury with the sarsaparella decoction this was persevered in for near five months but the disorder grew worse and had spread itself all over the internal surface of the nose a part of the cheek near the left ala of the nose was likewise hardened in several little swellings about the size of gray pease of a very dark red color which afterward became ulcerous despairing of obtaining any relief from the regular practitioners he unhappily was induced to apply to one of those pretenders to the cure of cancers who uses causticts under the name of plaster this person boldly applied a caustic twice and destroyed the left ala and some part of the nose and would have repeated it but the patient had already suffered so much by this cruel treatment that no persuasion could prevail on him to undergo a third trial in this situation he applied to me he was ordered a simple soliation of pure nitre with camphor in which was dissolved some mercurius corrosivus sublimatus so that he took the eighth of a grain three times in the day of this last mentioned preparation preceded by a red pill of one grain a fumigation of cinnab fact and aethiop min p e was used to the parts every other evening for three weeks and then omitted by these means in about nine months the ulcer in the nose was healed and all the parts which had been saved from the ravages of the caustics became sound the ulcers in the cheek likewise were cicatrised and considering the circumstances the face did not appear much disfigured  case xlii j  b  servant to a baronet had for a long time labored under a complaint in the lower and external part of the thigh a very large painful swelling and stiffness in the knee the tumor of the first suppurated and broke the matter was very deep lying between the muscles of the thigh there was a considerable sinus and the external opening being small might have been properly termed a fistula hectical symptoms were likewise evident this patient had been for relief at an hospital but obtained none the pilula rubra was given and the pulvis mineralis the opening was enlarged and by a long continuance in the remedies the stiffness and swelling in the knee were removed the ulcer in the thigh by compress and common dressings was entirely healed this patient is at this time in perfect health  case xliii mr t wych street had lost the use of his leg by a large swelling in the middle and outward part of the thigh he could not without great torture put his foot to the ground he had rather swelled lips and other evident marks of a schrophulous habit the swelling increased suppurated and was opened discharging a great quantity of matter he was ordered the pilula rubra and the pulvis mineralis the abscess was treated in the common manner after it had been open some time a considerable exfoliation of the thigh bone worked its way through to the mouth of the wound which was carefully extracted the remedies were continued and in a few weeks after the perfect use of the leg was restored and the scrophulous swellings in the lips subsided  case xliv a child in a family of fashion between three and four years old had several eruptions in the face at first red and inflamed then a serum was discharged and the skin scaled off the lips were swelled and the glands about the neck were in a tumified state the aethiops mineralis and the sal nitr had been given for some time when this disagreeable disorder appearing so disgusting in parts most exposed to view was in a few months entirely removed some time after the child lost the use of one leg there was an exquisite pain in the hip thigh and inner part of the loins on inspection from all the circumstances i was persuaded that it was the commencement of that shocking disorder well known by surgeons under the name of a psoas case in this disease abscesses deeply seated repeatedly form about the upper part of the thigh in various parts push out their matter externally and in a number of years after giving th patient inexpressible misery prove fatal in general  something decisive was necessary bleeding was first prescribed the pilula alba ad gr ss was given every night a solution of the nitre with the sal neutralis was taken four times in the day and a pediluvium every night was used the effects were excellent for in about three weeks the child was restored to a perfect and free use of the limb and has remained well ever since  case xlv mr townley aged    at no    suffolk mews middlesex hospital had been afflicted three years with a disorder in his knee he had applied to a public charity for above seven months without any relief and had been deprived of getting his livelihood by his business there was a very large swelling and contraction of the part so that he could not bring his heel to the ground he took the pilula alba every other night and was perfectly restored to the use of his limb in less than two months in this case i must confess i had not the least prospect of success and had even told the patient as much when on his just going out of my house almost in a state of despondency i came to a sudden determination of trying the pilula alba having formerly experienced its use in small doses in a diseased ankle joint  case xlvi a gentlewoman in the early part of life had accidentally let a small pin drop into her ear from which issued a few drops of blood little or no pain succeeded but some time after a discharge of a very fetid matter was perceived and a deafness on that side there was no secretion of wax she was advised very properly by an eminent surgeon not to suffer the use of injections or any other applications as in so delicate an organ that fine membrane the tympanum might be probably destroyed as likewise the little bones malleus incus and stapes  which form part of the mechanical structure of this curious organ satisfied with this opinion nothing was attempted for years but the discharge continued and was at times very offensive this lady had a fever in august      of the putrid kind with ulcerations in the throat for which i was consulted it terminated happily by the use of the common anteseptic remedies as bark elixir of vitriol vinegar drinks etc etc after recovery the discharge from the ear was remarkably more offensive than before this circumstance was communicated to me a fumigation of cinnabar factitium and aethiops mineralis p e was used by means of a proper tube every other evening to the part internally twice in the day was taken the pulvis mineralis to which was added a larger portion of the aethiops and some aethiop antim this plan was continued for near three months during which time the discharge gradually decreased and entirely lost its offensive smell the powders were then directed without the fumigation the ulcer was soon after entirely healed the wax was secreted and the hearing perfectly restored no return of this complaint has since happened  some other instances of the same sort have occurred where the fumigation has been very efficacious as it commonly is in foul ulcers unattended with inflammation  cases in specks and blindness cured by internal medicines only case xlvii mr whittaker no   mercer street long acre was seized on august        with a violent inflammation and pain of the left eye conserve of roses was applied at first and a purge taken then a lotion was used of the vitriolic kind until the  0th when the pain and inflammation continuing he was advised to apply alum powdered with the yolk of an egg and on the following day he found he had totally lost his sight what made his misfortune truly melancholy was he had lost his other eye in his infancy on the   th in the morning he was led to me the cornea was opake and of a pale bluish color nor could he perceive the least glimmering of light bleeding was first ordered to twenty ounces the pilula alba was given every night ad gr ss and a cupful of the solutio nitrosa half an ounce of pure nitre to a quart of water was taken every hour in the daytime in three days there appeared to the patient some little light and though the cornea did not seem to have the least transparentcy in any part yet the remedies were continued but as the inflammation had subsided the doses of nitre were only given every three hours no application whatever was used outwardly for the objections to external applications see the treatise on the principal diseases of the eyes numbers have been blinded by poultices etc etc  and the patient who is now living had the inexpressible pleasure of being perfectly restored to sight in three weeks  case xlviii miss g  richmond applied the   th of april      for relief in a disorder of the eyes the case was the cataracts in both eyes one confirmed the other incipient the sight was greatly impeded and threatened a total loss of vision the pulvis

formerly cured of the same disorder vide treatise on the diseases of the eyes st anns soho had been blind for above   months occasioned by a number of irregular specks on the transparent cornea which prevented the rays of light forming a point in the chrystalline lens as likewise an inflammation so violent that the lids were enlarged thickened and had almost lost their muscular motion the lips of the child were swelled and puffed up the certain marks of a scrophulous affection this child was restored to sight and the scrophulous symptoms were entirely removed in less than four months by the pulvis mineralis  case l a child four years old daughter of mrs williams recommended by the overseers of st giless in the year      had lost her sight one year from an inflammation in cutting her teeth when the child was but eighteen months old an inflammation of the eyes proved very troublesome for which a physician reputedly skilful in the cure of childrens diseases was consulted but no benefit was received from his prescription a very eminent practitioner was consulted in the present instance who ordered a fomentation of white rose leaves to be used two hours in the day and a powder to be blowed into the eyes this plan was continued three months and a lotion was used six leeches were applied to the inner angles of the eye and repeated twice but no relief was obtained application was then made to a celebrated foreigner who ordered an issue in the arm and an ounce of magnesia to be taken in a week a physician at an hospital ordered a blister and an emetic finding no good effects from his prescription he declared the disorder to be the kings evil and that no relief could be expected until the girl reached her fourteenth year when i first saw the child she had been blind above nine months the cornea of both eyes was opake but there was no discharge the pulvis mineralis was given for six weeks every two hours in the daytime without any apparent benefit on the  th week the cornea seemed to be nearly transparent but the child could not bear any light without exquisite tortures the same remedies were continued one week longer perceiving then that nothing could impede the rays of light in passing through the cornea and that the chrystalline lens was perfectly clear i concluded that extreme relaxation alone prevented the patient from being susceptible of external objects the bark in substance was prescribed which had excellent effects for in nine days the sight of both eyes was perfectly restored  case li mrs p  a lady from guernsey aged between  0 and  0 had been long afflicted with an inflammation of the eyes with specks on the cornea which greatly impeded vision and was the cause of the eyes being covered to prevent the agonies which the light produced this case was cured in about three weeks by the pulvis mineralis though it had been troublesome many years  case lii miss w in the city aged four years and a half had scrophulous swellings on the lips with a violent inflammation of both eyes and specks on the cornea the rays of light were broken so that they could not form in the chrystalline lens and strike on the retina any figure of the external objects which presented themselves the light always caused misery if strong there were crusty eruptions behind the ears about the upper lip and nose this child was restored to perfect sight the swellings in the lips were perfectly resolved and the eruptions removed in the course of three months by the pilula alb ad gr ss twice in the week and the pulvis mineralis four times in the day  case liii miss r  at  w  esquire wimpole street had suffered for a long time under a complaint in the eyes one eye was blind from an opacity of the cornea in the other the sight was imperfect owing to two small specks in the immediate direction of the pupil the light occasioned great distress therefore the eyes had been long covered by a green shade the pilula alba was given in the dose of gr ss every night and the pulvis mineralis ad ss quater de die in six weeks this young lady was perfectly restored to sight and has continued without the least indisposition of the eyes ever since  case live a child of j egleton servant to a merchant in the city had been deprived of sight by an opacity of the cornea and specks they were entirely removed by the pulvis mineralis taken four times in the day  case lv mrs p  argyle street in      had an incipient cataract of both eyes which occasioned a great defect in vision every thing appeared in a cloud there was evidently an affection of the christalline humor this patient was perfectly restored in a few weeks by the pilula alba and solutio nitrosa  case lvi mr roberts st jamess street was suddenly struck blind on eastereve      and went under the care of an eminent oculist for some time but received no benefit the case was the gutta serena for the coats and humors of the eye were perfectly sound there was a palsy of the retina the contraction and dilatation of the pupil was destroyed the pilula alba and the solutio nitrosa perfectly restored this patient to sight in about two months he is well known to several inhabitants in holborn and some years after the cure i was present when he read in a book with a very small print  case lvii the servant of a foreign ambassador in      applied with a disease in the cornea and inflammation which greatly impeded his sight various methods had been used to remove the complaint without any advantage the pilula alba ad gr ss omne nocte and the solutio nitrosa taken six times in the day perfectly restored the sight and radically cured the inflammation  case lviii a child about three years old had an inflammation of the eye for above nine months which prevented her bearing the light several practitioners had been consulted lotions purges and various remedies had been administered the last person consulted had bound up the eye for six weeks after applying some liquid daily after this the inflammation became very violent and according to description was what is known by the name chemosis the lid was affected and the cheek swelled the eye was then poulticed with white bread and milk and the sight was entirely lost the part was in the greatest agony when i first saw the case the distention was so great that i expected nothing but the bursting of the eye with the loss of the humors no time was to be lost and though it was evening at least eight ounces of blood were immediately taken away from the arm this saved the eye the pulvis mineralis was given to gr xv every two hours the sal neutralis was likewise occasionally united with it and the methods succeeded for in about three weeks the inflammation was perfectly cured the opake cornea of a bluish color when first i saw it had become quite transparent sight was restored and in one week after no shade whatever was necessary to enable the eye to bear the strongest light  case lix mr l  in the city had been many months afflicted with a disorder in the eyes the sight of one was entirely destroyed by a large opacity so confirmed as to be incurable a large speck covered the other in the direction of the pupil with the inflammation called chemosis a very eminent surgeon had attended him and had ordered the calomel in the dose of two or three grains every night a powerful cathartic every other morning and a poultice had been applied no ill success can induce some to depart from this practice there methods are too violent for parts already irritated see the objections in the treatise on the disorders of the eyes this common rough treatment greatly relaxed the patient but produced no good effects in the cure of the disease i ordered him after bleeding ten grains of the aethiops mineralis joined with some camphor and confect damocr three times in the day and a solution of nitre with the sal neutralis after each bolus in one week the inflammation had subsided and in a fortnight after he was restored to the sight of the left eye he was afterward directed to continue these remedies for a few weeks longer with the addition of the pilula rubra  case lx a young gentleman had been two years and half suffering great misery from a violent disorder in the left eye the whole cornea was opake and of a bluish color the conjunctive membrane exceedingly inflamed and thickened the lid of the eye and the lips were considerably swelled there were likewise several little ulcerations behind the ear a surgeon of great merit high in the public estimation had attended the case for a long time he had ordered calomel in the dose of two grains at night cathartics and a poultice of linseed and fomentations sometimes the disorder was better but on any slight cold broke out again the pilula alba ad gr ss was given twice in the week the nitre was ordered in the dose of twentyfive grains four times in the day the inflammation soon subsided and the eye was restored to sight in about six weeks on leaving off the remedies too soon a slight relapse happened two or three times within the year but by having recourse to the nitrous medicine joined with the sal polychrestum the cloudy appearance has been removed  case lxi a girl at battersea sent by the lady at richmond mentioned in case xlvi had been many years distressed with scrophulous tumors and inflammation and specks in both eyes so as to deprive her of sight some of the swellings had broken and discharged an acrimonious matter but could not be healed the pilula rubra and the solutio nitrosa with a laxative occasionally removed both these complaints in the course of foul months  case lxii a yound gentleman of fashion had been many years troubled with an inflammation in the eyes occasioning a sharp discharge and such irritation that any strong light of the chandeliers in the night excited the most disagreeable sensations and could scarce be endured this was caused by an affection of the conjunctive membrane which lines the lid but it communicated its effects to that part of the membrane which forms what is called though improperly tunica albuginea or vulgarly the white of the eye this white appearance arises from the cornea opaca for the conjunctive membrane itself is almost transparent the vessels in this last part destined in a natural and healthful state to carry lymph were all filled with red particles and consequently in a state of distension on examination it appeared that several of the eyelashes which were inverted long and bristly occasioned all these symptoms these were carefully extracted by forceps with a very small point and the symptoms were in a few days removed a lotion with a small portion of the saccharum saturni was ordered this operation was four times repeated and there has not appeared the least complaint in the eyes since   case lxiii a young lady had an excrescence which was ulcerated in the cornea of the right eye the vessels of the conjunctiva were much distended and red the whole of the transparent cornea was covered there are many instances of inflammations of the eyelids happening from the eyelashes growing in an improper direction and the patient suffered extreme pain owing entirely to inflammation the removal of which was the only object in view for the restoration of sight was impossible the pulvis mineralis was given in considerable doses four times in the day in fourteen days the inflammation subsided and the excrescence which made a very disagreeable appearance in the form of a cone pushing itself beyond the lids gradually wasted in about four weeks after it was removed without any external application  case lxiv a watchman in westminster in the depth of winter caught a violent cold which produced an inflammation and opacity of the cornea the sight of the other eye had been lost many years before and from the present misfortune he was quite blind he took after bleeding the solutio nitrosa four times in the day and the pilula alba every other night he was restored to sight in less than a month the inhabitants during his cure humanely contributed to his support  case lxv a child of mr c  spital fields had inflammatory eruptions on the face scrophulous swellings in the neck and both eyes were blinded by specks and inflammation in the cornea the eyelids and lips were much tumified the pain was inexpressible bleeding was first prescribed and the pulvis mineralis was taken four times a day in the dose of gr xxv the pilula alba gr ss was given every other night and a nitrous decoction was used as common drink in six weeks the child was restored to sight and the swellings reduced  cases of old ulcers in the legs cured in persons advanced in years case lxvi mrs b  marybone aged    had been for between thirty and forty years experiencing great misery from an ulcer of the leg situated a little above the ancle it was not large but the surrounding parts were callous itched intolerably the discharge was acrimonious there were several scorbutic eruptions in different parts the pains were acute and almost constant various had been the means used to cure or to relieve this complaint sometimes by rest and medicine it had been healed but as is common on exercise soon broke out again for several years the patient had been advised to bear patiently the painful disorder under the specious pretense of its being necessary as a drain for all bad humors to cure a person so far advanced in years might make the disorder fly to the head and destroy the senses or bring on a fever or a cough which would prove fatal by such artifices which are too commonly practiced when surgeons cannot cure an ulcer was the patient persuaded to suffer inexpressible misery for so many years the pulvis mineralis was given three times in the day to the wound was applied the saturnine ointment and proper dressings in six weeks an evident alteration for the better was produced the itching being allayed and the eruptions cured the pilula rubra was then taken as the callosity was stubborn the ulcer still discharging an acrid matter a fumigation was used every other night by these means the cure was effected and the patient remains in perfect health using as much exercise as that advanced age will admit  case lxviii the lady of  l  esquire aged    had been lame for fifteen years from a number of ulcers in her leg sometimes they were rather better at other times worse according to the changes of the seasons different practitioners had been consulted rest purges and various means had been prescribed by some of the first practitioners in town after many fruitless attempts agreeable to the common modes of practice to cure this case it was gravely asserted that it would be the ladys death if the wounds were healed when first i inspected the case there were at least forty ulcers in different parts of the leg foul offensive to the smell discharging a very acrid matter there were swellings and inflammation and the pain was exquisite constantly depriving the patient of rest at first the pulvis mineralis was given three times in the day and proper dressings were applied which in the course of a few weeks produced very favorable appearances the plan was continued but the disorder seemed to be at a stand neither growing better or worse the pulvis mineralis was then omitted and the pilula rubra three times in the day given and in about three months all the ulcers were healed when this cure was accomplished it was maliciously insinuated that perhaps sudden death would be the consequence it is now four years since the cure has been confirmed no relapse has happened neither diarrhoea fever or asthma have attacked the patient but on the contrary she has better health than had been experienced for years if these methods had been discovered and applied at first fifteen years of inexpressible torture most probably might have been prevented  case lxix mr n  aged    formerly in the service of her late royal highness the princess dowager of wales had been a long time suffering from a disease in his leg he was of a remarkable full habit very corpulent and his leg which was swelled to an enormous size was almost one continued ulcer livid in color and resembling the bark of an elm tree being full of innumerable fissures from which issued a very great quantity of acrid serum continual acute pains itching and irritation made him extremely miserable for no rest could be procured he had been treated in the usual manner the common modes of treating ulcers may be seen in the treatise on that subject with the objections  by a very eminent court surgeon for nine months but received no alleviation from his misery when i first saw him he was exactly in the situation described he was ordered the solutio nitrosa with the vinum antimoniale and the pilula rubra three times in the day the disorder proved obstinate but the cure was effected by a perseverance in the above remedies with proper dressings in eight months it is now near four years since the cure the patient remains in perfect health walks many miles every day and has better spirits than he had experienced before for many years  case lxx a lady of rank recommended a poor woman who had ulcers about the eighth of an inch in diameter in her leg from the knee to the foot the limb was exceedingly swelled had a livid appearance in many parts the smell was extremely offensive there were scaly scorbutic eruptions all over her body and the misery she suffered from pain was inexpressible she had applied to an hospital and no relief had been obtained but a proposition had been made to amputate the limb as the only means of a cure the solutio nitrosa with merc corros sublimat were given in this case after a gentle laxative the sal neutralis was administered occasionally and the medicines were continued for two months during which time the disease had been mending and the cure was accomplished the ulcers were all healed the leg was reduced to its natural size and the scaly eruptions had entirely disappeared  case lxxi mrs b  aged  0 for near twenty years had been tormented with an ulcer which had been often healed and as often became bad again it was situated above the ancle on the inside was not large but exceedingly painful as is often the case in very small deep ulcers a great hardness surrounded the sore for a considerable space there were likewise several scorbutic eruptions which itched much and were very troublesome the pulvis mineralis was given and for about two months seemed to have excellent effects for the eruptions and irritation were cured and the callosity greatly resolved but the ulcer did not heal the bark and elix vitriol acid was taken for some time at first the ulcer seemed to be forming granulations and in a disposition to incarn but a second disappointment happened the pilula rubra was then given without any other medicine four times in the day and a perfect cure was in about nine weeks after effected this lady remained well for four years but having a scarlet fever a superficial sore was produced the pilula rubra was given and a cure was soon the consequence  case lxxii mr b  st pauls churchyard who had suffered much misery from the gout above twenty years had the additional mortification to be afflicted with a small ulcer near the ancle i was consulted and was dubious whether it would be proper in a gouty patient to attempt any method of cure and only then recommended a palliative dressing in about six months the ulcer had so spread itself as to cover half the foot and surrounded the greatest part of the ancle half a pint of a very sharp humor at least was discharged in a day the pain was exquisite had reduced the patient exceedingly and he seemed to be in an alarming situation i ordered the pilula alba to be taken every other night ad gr ss and the part was dressed with ung album the ulcer was better a sit of the gout came on the discharge and irritation increased the gout seemed to have no connection with the ulcerous indisposition nor the ulcer with the gout for the discharge though considerably increased did not in the least alleviate the pain the stomach was attacked with the gout a draught was prescribed of the camphor tinctura stomach and tinct sacra which removed it to the extremities the knee ancles and hands were affected when the fit was over the pill which had been omitted during the paroxysm was returned to and the sore parts were soon perfectly healed there has been discovered a safe and agreeable external application for the gout which with certainty gives immediate ease in the most violent pains and draws the disorder from the nobler parts toward the extremities the gouty matter is attracted destroyed and carried off by gentle perspiration and urine in a few days some extraordinary facts of this sort will be made public this last patient who is near  0 is one who has experienced the happy effects and can now walk better than he has been able to do for ten years  a spirituous tincture of hiera picra in the dose of a tea spoonful in a little water every day one hour before dinner has been recommended and fifteen grains of the aethiops mineral every other night by this simple method and a proper diet has the gout and rheumatism in some instances though inveterate and even in the stomach been radically cured a striking proof of this sort has happened to a member of the house of commons who has had no return of this disorder for above three years and has enjoyed a perfect and uninterrupted state of good health  case lxxii mrs c  aged between  0 and  0 of very full corpulent habit had been many years distressed with an ulcer of the leg near the ancle no advice or remedies had cured the case and the old story of the danger attending a cure when it was found impossible by the common means was strongly inculcated the patient under these apprehensions raised by a practitioner in whom she had the utmost confidence supported with great fortitude a miserable life for such a length of time every dishonorable artifice was used to prevent my being consulted but the lady mentioned case lxviii having been cured was the means of my being called the cure was undertaken the pilula rubra and the pulvis mineralis removed this disorder in about ten weeks the lady remains in perfect health since the cure which is now above three years  case lxxiii mrs g  doctors commons of a full habit had seven ulcers in her leg four were situated immediately below the knee the others about the ancle and a little below the calf this lady had been at different times under the care of seven surgeons and some of great eminence in the city but no relief was the consequence every method proved fruitless the pilula rubra and the pulvis mineralis perfectly cured this case in about nine weeks after it had been declared by many practitioners incurable this lady has been cured above a year and half and remains perfectly well  case lxxiv mr b  had for ten years a foul ulcer on the inside of the right leg the veins of which were all enlarged he had been under the care of several eminent surgeons and had at different times by rest etc received a temporary cure but on using exercise it broke out again the pilula alba and the solutio nitrosa cured this case in four months during which time the patient used exercise and has remained well ever since which is now near five years  amongst the variety of cases which have occurred i have found two instances which i could not cure of persons whose customary drink had been cider  it is now sincerely hoped that mankind will be no longer persuaded that it would be injurious to cure old ulcers so erroneously considered a drain for peccant humors it is highly probable in these complaints that some part of a scorbutic or putrid acrimony issuing from the sore is daily absorbed and conveyed to the blood and other juices by the lymphatic vessels and the whole habit is by these means contaminated a bad constitution is the general cause of the ulcer this afterward becomes the cause of a worse constitution and while this reciprocal action is in force the ulcer will be in no disposition to heal whatever can gradually and imperceptibly restore the fluids to a mild balsamic state and regulate the secretions and excretions will be found beneficial in removing these scorbutic distempers so predominant in this country it may be a matter perhaps worthy the consideration of the surgeons of hospitals whether such rational methods of cure should not be embraced which would save those public charities a large annual expense experience confirms that ninety five at least out of a hundred may be radically cured as outpatients at the same time obtain their livelihood by industry a moderate exercise is so far from retarding the cure that it facilitates it and renders the afflicted less liable to a relapse  the conclusion some may possibly imagine that the common unsuccessful modes of treatment have been too freely censured but let it be considered that until erroneous systems are exploded no new discoveries however important can be established  it gives me inexpressible pleasure to find that several eminent practitioners and some at the public hospitals have adopted these new modes of treatment and have heartily acknowledged that considerable success has attended their endeavors the opposition the modes have experienced from others may have arisen from their being strongly prepossessed in favor of the practice they have been accustomed to the facts here produced it is presumed will convince them of their errors and be the best answer to whatever may have been advanced against the doctrines  though the hasty adoption of novelties has frequently been productive of evils in the healing art yet an inflexible adherence to erroneous maxims has proved a check to philosophical enquiry a bar to every useful improvement the cases here related the result of many years application are respectfully submitted to the public consideration and particularly to the unprejudiced and learned practitioners in medicine who will best determine whether they merit attention the curative methods are still it is presumed capable of much improvement and the same disposition which gave rise to the discoveries shall not be wanting to prosecute so desirable a purpose  the ulcerated legs the opacity of the cornea partially or totally impeding vision scorbutic and schrophulous cases are proved in general to be curable it could be ardently wished that the same might be asserted with equal confidence in confirmed cancerous diseases these ravaging complaints however if not too far advanced can frequently be removed when poisonous remedies have been administered or other violent practices adopted little success can be expected and often the cure is as impossible as in the aneurism of the aorta the barbarous use of escharotics and the unfeeling and improper use of the knife have been condemned in all ages by every physician of integrity and experience as they have hastened the progress of the cancer and the dissolution of the patient  finis
