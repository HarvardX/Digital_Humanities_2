a school for greybeards or the mourning bride a comedy in five acts as performed at the theater royal drury lane  by mrs cowley  london printed for g g j and j robinson paternosterrow  mdcclxxxvi  price one shilling and sixpence  an address i offer the following comedy to the public under a circumstance which has given my mind the most exquisite uneasiness on the morning after the first representation it was observed by the papers that there had been persons present at the theater the preceding evening who went there determined to disapprove at all events from such a determination it is hard indeed to escape and the opposition intended was justified it seems by the indecency of some of the expressions  from such a charge i feel it impossible to defend myself for against an imputation like this even vindication becomes disgraceful  as i was not at the theater i should have had some difficulty in understanding at what passages the objections were levelled had not one of the papers recorded them with many cruel remarks the particulars which were thus pointed out will i trust be a sufficient apology for themselves in the following pages they are all restored that the public at large may have the power to adjudge me as well as that small part of it confined within the walls of a theater  these passages have not been restored from any pertinacious opinion of their beauty  for other expressions might have conveyed my intention as well but had i allowed one line to stand as altered for the stage what might not that reprobated line have been supposed to express i shrink from the idea and therefore most solemnly aver that the comedy as now printed contains every word which was opposed the first night from the suspicion of indelicacy hoping their obvious meaning only will be attended to without the coarse ingenuity of strained explanations which have been made by persons who seem desirous to surround my task of dramatic writing with as many difficulties as possible  a celebrated critic more attended to for the discrimination and learning which appear in his strictures than for their lenity in his observations on the greybeards has the following  when mrs cowley gets possession of the spirit and turn of a character she speaks the language of that character better than any of her dramatic cotemporaries  this i confess i hold to be very high praise and it is to this very praise which my cotemporaries resolve i shall have no claim they will allow me indeed to draw strong character but it must be without speaking its language i may give vulgar o low bred persons but they must converse in a style of elegance i may design the coariest manners or the most disgusting folly but its expressions must not deviate from the line of politeness surely it would be as just to exact from the artists who are painting the gallery of shakespeare that they should complete their designs without the use of light and shade  it cannot be the poets mind which the public desire to trace in dramatic representation but the mind of the characters and the truth of their coloring yet in my case it seems resolved that the point to be considered is not whether that dotard or that pretender or that coquet would so have given their feelings but whether mrs cowley ought so to have expressed herself  this is a criterion which happily no author is subjected to but those of the drama the novelist may use the boldest tints  seizing nature for her guide she may dart through every rank of society drag forth not only the accomplished but the ignorant the coarse and the vulgarrich display them in their strongest colors and snatch immortality both for them and for herself i on the contrary feel encompassed with chains when i write which check me in my happiest flights and force me continually to reflect not whether this is just but whether this is safe  these are vain regrets which i hope my readers will pardon me for having a moment indulged i now hasten to that part of the comedy which will be found in the following sheets as altered for the second representation  the idea of the business which concerns antonia henry and gasper was presented to me in an obsolete comedy the work of a poet of the drama once highly celebrated i say the idea for when it is known that in the original the scene lay amongst traders in the city of london  and those traders of the lowest and most detestable manners it will be conceived at once that in removing it to portugal and fixing the characters amongst the nobility it was hardly possible to carry with me more than the idea the circumstance which most particularly interested me and fixed itself in my mind was that of snatching a young woman from a hateful marriage the moment before that marrige became valid  that is to say after the ceremony this very circumstance to which the comedy owes its existence was that which some of the audience found discordant to their feelings an event which had in the last century been stamped with the highest applause though surrounded by many repulsive circumstances was found in this to be illconceived i did not however dispute the decision of my critics  and the marriage has been in course dissolved  the manner in which the comedy has since been received gives room to suppose that the alteration is approved it has struggled with many oppressive circumstances the chasm in the performance occasioned by the repeated illness of mr parsons was sufficient to have sunk it  but neither that nor the sterile month of december always against the theaters has prevented its being distinguished by many brilliant and crowded nights i now resign it to the closet where without the aid of fine acting or the fascinations of beauty and deriving all its little force from the pen which composed it it hopes still to amuse  the innocent flame of seraphinas coquetry may still shed rays of delight on her readers and the affecting situation of antonia interest

he so what that don henry who was obliged to fly for having fought a duel   jaquez the same hang me if i would be playing at hideandseek in foreign lands for drawing a little blood i would go boldly

pedrillo truly sir i cannot discover i have questioned and cross questioned him to no purpose  he is as dexterous at shifting an answer as though he was fosterbrother to a lawyer   jaquez but he says

henry this hour will be to him the heaviest of his life  he enters welcome sir the friend of don henry cannot find a house in portugal where he would be more joyfully received   henry what sir dare you thus receive the friend of a banished man  of a man who were he seen in lisbon would have his head claimed the next hour by the executioner if thus you can receive his friend how will you receive himself  throwing open his cloak   sebas in my arms and in my heart i re  no i do not rejoice oh don henry what imprudence how dare you venture hither before your pardon has been obtained   henry could you suppose the intelligence of antonias marriage would suffer me to rest in any other spot that the proud sun visits had i been beneath the zone from whence he pours his broadest rays or in the dusky regions of cimmeria such intelligence must have impelled me hither   sebas and to what purpose surely this is a sort of quixotism that must end like the sublime knights contention with the windmills   henry i care not how it ends the displeasure of my sovereign and my heart torn by the ingratitude of the woman on whom it doats  the sooner the end approaches the better   sebas i am not now to learn how hard it is to stem the torrent of your passions  yet if you would be patient all might be well  at least i trust so though my visit to england at that period prevented my knowing precisely the ground of your quarrel   henry quarrel  with contempt do you then suspect it was a fray in which i fought or that my sword is drawn in tavern brawls or to support the insolence or perfidy of an abandoned wanton duels of that sort a soldier stoops not to   sebas pray then inform    henry i fought to punish the slanderer of him who taught me how to fight  the brave dalmeida that once conquering hero   sebas i knew him well   henry twas he first placed a sword upon my youthful thigh and drawing forth the burnished blade never my henry said the hoary general  never be its luster stained except to serve your king or vindicate your friend these are the outlines of a soldiers duty  would you be a perfect soldier labor to be an exemplary man with that sword  i thank it  holding his sword and bending over it i punished his traducer   sebas surely you cannot doubt of pardon   henry but whilst i wait for pardon in another kingdom my antonias lost  oh   sebas is she not already lost   henry no she is not  and by heaven she shall not she is my contracted wife  no power on earth can make her anothers whilst i live   sebas all this my friend only proves the bitter excess of your disappointment  have you any settled scheme   henry i have  at madrid it chanced that don julio nephew to old gasper my rival conceived a warm attachment for me  from him i learnt the news of this abhorred marriage  the agonies it threw me in he compassionated and formed a scheme which wears a face of success   sebas alas  it is  well but pray go on   henry learning that my person was unknown to don gasper whose retired life throws him out of all public circles julio conceived the resolution to make me pass for himself   sebas you to pass for don gaspers nephew  well   henry with this view he pretended an ardent desire to visit portugal his father has in course written to don gasper we both arrived last night and julio has given me the letter which will fix me in the house of my rival to prevent by whatever means that may offer themselves the design upon my honor  the robbery of my wife   sebas my dear unhappy henry summon your fortitude whilst i tell you that don julios friendship united with your own temerity cannot save your honor  if your honor is to be wounded by   shaking his head   henry what is that oh speak sebastian  my apprehensions choke me   sebas i cannot give found to words so cruel  but fly and save that life which if you are discovered here must be forfeited   henry hah  i understand you  she is married she is married antonia is anothers oh sebastian  let me breathe  throwing himself on sebastian   sebas courage man if you would but swear a little now and give all the sex black brown and yellow to the devil i should have some hopes of

she is now in the house of your rival according to the custom of our country she this morning went there attended by her bridemaids and in the evening old gasper receives her vows   henry they are mine  in the face of heaven and before witnesses they are mine  if she has given them to another they cannot be valid but by my assent i will fly instantly to the house     going sebas nay suffer me to attend you for though i have dear and tender cares of my own i shall scarcely be awake to them whilst my friend is in such danger   don henry oh sebastian the bliss or misery of all my years to

mother gad it will look odd to see such a strapper as you call her mother   octavio shall it be mamma sir   don gasp no madam  that is grave and comely madam has a distant sound in it  you shall call her madam but instead of coming dutifully to congratulate me sir why did you not dutifully marry yourself   octavio faith sir of all the duties fate has imposed upon a man i think that the hardest   don gasp it is an imposition that some hundred dozen of your greatgrandsires as wise and as witty as your worship have submitted to   octavio it is devilish strange that it was necessary for so many great men to play the fool to bring me into existence   don gasp there is don alexis dalva has been half mad to give you his daughter  ever since your return from italy   octavio ay had i had the grace to humor him sir how happy for your fair antonia she might have become at the same moment a virgin bride and a grandmamma  drawling   don gasp pshaw  nonsense   octavio however sir let her not despair  she may hope for the honor of being a grandmother yet i refused the daughter of don alexis without having seen her but now that i have seen her i think i could venture to exchange my dear prized liberty for captivity with her   don gasp say you so my boy its the happiest news that i have heard but where could you see her for don alexis is so nicely jealous that if his stone walls had eyes he would never suffer either his wise or daughter to unveil before them   octavio i saw her at church with her father the sermon was on christian charity and to show how well she could illustrate the doctrine she lifted her veil on that side next me  for she saw me hungering and thirsting for a view   don gasp memorandum  my wife never goes to church   octavio you shock me sir  what is my dear

not made an old ass of myself by marrying a girl   don gasp never mind that if your girl does not transform your assships ears to horns   don alexis ay that is a blessed fear to be goaded with in the last stage of ones mortal journey i wish the day i left my bed to marry i had been confined in it with a gout an asthma and a dropsy oons man there is no end of your plagues from this moment   don gasp pray keep your temper now  keep your temper it is a very bad one but pray keep it however   don alexis why you would find it easier to spin cables out of cobwebs or to pierce through the earth and swim out at the antipodes than to manage a young rantipole wife and so your servant  i give ye joy  much good may it do you   going don gasp stay stay a moment man and tell me which is the greatest torment a young wife or daughter   don alexis oh lord why a daughter is a seventh day ague and a wife is a frenzy fever   don gasp well come i will recommend ye a physician for your ague

her own or her neighbors   lady the brides pensiveness infects us sir mirth seems to be impertinent   antonia oh pardon me were my spirits obedient to my wishes your reproach would have been undeserved but though we can determine how to act i find we cannot determine how to feel   don gasp feel feel when i was a youngster women had no such word in their vocabulary cannot you leave your feelings alone never mind em and then like neglected guests they will be in no hurry to repeat their visits i have not regarded my feelings many years and now they have learnt manners and dont interrupt me   don henry  aside not one chance look this way and yet i can forgive the sweet averted eye because it speaks disgust to all around her   antonia you know the cause i have for sorrow and

day to be married   donna clara truly i think so signor or i am not a bridemaid but how far faithless i know not  for i returned from arragon last night after more than a years absence we met but an hour since in the church nor have we yet had time for conversation   don henry then i entreat you let this discovery rest with yourself  it is of the last importance to me that i should not be known to don gasper and at present i would be equally concealed from antonia   donna clara you must give me reasons for this request for i am not certain that i ought not instantly to betray you it is true you have been her lover but she is now to be the wife of don gasper  her duties to him will be of the most sacred sort and she must fulfill them scrupulously   don henry think me not a seducer i have loved antonia for her purity and virtue and to destroy her honor would be to trample on my own oh clara few have loved as i do my passion is mingled with the tender protecting affection of a brother and violation is impossible   donna clara pray then tell me    don henry you shall know all  and should antonias marriage be voluntary i will take no revenge but to leave her  but if as her melancholy allows me to hope she has been deceived into it there is not a power on earth that can divide us   donna clara if your design is not contrary to rectitude be assured i shall not oppose it follow me to a more distant room  a new secret is almost as delightful as a new lover exeunt   end of the first act act ii an apartment at don alexiss enter seraphina pulling in alexis seraphina come along my charming husband bless me what eloquence and fire considering you are fiftynine i protest a man thirty years younger could hardly have found such a variety of things to have said on so trivial a subject one might mistake you for an english senator instead of a portugueze privy counselor you can say so much upon nothing   alex nothing what is it nothing that whenever i go out of the door your head is directly out of the window  like the sign of queen jezebel it is known to all the impudent young facehunters in lisbon who saunter about my gates like wolves before a sheepfold  do you call that nothing   seraph oh no heaven forbid i should be so ungrateful toward the grand pleasure of my life nothing it is every thing  my happiness i wait for sunset every day with impatience because it is known that i then mount my throne  that is i enter my balcony and see new prostrate subjects adoring and deifying me   alex zounds what a vile custom it was to build houses with windows i will have them all blocked up skylights are the only things for a christian country  windows and balconies  they are fit only for turkish baths and public brothels   seraph listen deary and i will bless ye with a secret blind your windows and nail your doors but if your honor  curtseying has no better security than these you will be soon in the herd whose ideal ornaments  touching his forehead are so terrific to you   alex the devils in it if stone walls will not keep ye what stronger security could my honor have   seraph my honor rely on that and i swear to you by every thing sacred that no vestals life shall be more blameless it is due to my own feelings to be chaste  i dont condescend to think of yours in the affair the respect i bear myself makes me necessarily preserve my purity  but if i am suspected watched and haunted i know not but such torment may weary me out of principles which i have hitherto cherished as my life   alex if all this is true what the devil makes ye so fond of admiration   seraph i cannot tell what devil makes me so fond of admiration but i know i love admiration and i will have it till he whom you represent says no   alex whom i represent who is that   seraph mercy who can it be but old shrivelled greypated time to his negative i shall yield  but with a very ill will i assure you if the passion we have for admiration is wrong let nature look to it  twas she impressed it on our hearts and it is her law that to tyrannize over the peace of man is to woman consummation of happiness   alex and yet you every one of ye pretend to be tenderhearted and compassionate and all that   seraph why to say truth one is a sort of a paradox at a tale of woe i melt like niobe and am agonizd at distress if i cannot relieve it  yet a lovers misery is delightful i would not abate a man who adored me a single sigh and should have no rest at night if i thought he was sleeping quietly   alex lord have mercy  muttering to himself   seraph now i hope you feel yourself very much honored that i take you so far into my confidence  if you have a grain of sense you will be charmed with it   alex i dont know what the devil to make of ye sometimes i think one thing and sometimes another   enter a servant serve don octavio sir  exit   alex better he than caesar i will wait upon him directly  well i am in the way at last to have one plague less however don octavio is come to offer himself to viola  pray step and send her here to receive him for i am obliged to go instantly to council i shall but just speak to octavio and send him up  charge her to receive him well  she shall be married in less than a week  exit   seraph i shall give his daughter no such charge poor girl how can she receive octavio well with her heart devoted to sebastian i wonder what sort of a thing this signor is  some wred privy counselor like himself i suppose  very odd now that those ancients should take it into their venerable noddles that a youthful bride is a proper appendage to their dignity or to fancy that it requires no more talents to please a pretty wife than to govern a stupid nation lord if my deary would but speak the truth now and warn his wise brethren  heyday is this the octavio handsome i vow young bold he a privy counselor mercy how could i slander him so  enter octav welcome don octavio for i am informed that here you must have welcome the man i saw at church i protest   octav that cruel must checks the transport your welcome gave me may i not hope that without a must you would have given me welcome   seraph oh yes pray hope it for as i think the season of hoping the most delightful in our lives i should be sorry to shorten yours   octav if you mean to shorten my hope by disappointment it is kind to protract it but there is a way of ending hope enchanting viola without giving despair   seraph viola did he call me   octav oh permit me to believe that the honor your father allows me of telling you i adore you is not

gaspers enter don henry hastily followed by don sebastian henry oh it is too much   sebas too much ay so it is that they should be all so blind to your starts your angry blushes and your ill concealed confusion i drew you from the company the moment dinner ended lest when they had done eating they should begin to observe do you reflect that don philip has only to betray you to the minister to get rid of his rival for ever   henry it is more than i can bear  the old dotards fondness which i dare not yet oppose distracts me oh that i could speak to her alone  it is plain amidst all the bridal gaiety her heart is not at ease   sebas your wish is half answered for here comes her half  the worst half indeed by forty years   henry half thou a lover and able to speak thus to a lover speak of them as one   sebas forgive me for faith i am so much a lover at this moment that i scarcely know what i am saying in a word i am summoned by my mistresss maid who has some new information  in an hour

don gasp oh i fear no turns she is virtuous and modest and you know a modest woman is above all price  but perhaps you do not know that for the observation is made in a book not much read now a days  but what do you think helped me to get her   henry ay sir what did  i long to be informed wine perhaps will make him communicative  aside  a splendid jointure probably   don gasp jointure she minds a jointure no more than a jointed doll  guess again   henry i am not fortunate in guessing   don gasp then i will tell ye  half a sheet of paper got her ay you may well stare twas but half a sheet of paper  in which i procured it to be said that one don henry whom she loved was shrouded and buried  that got her my boy  slapping him on the shoulder  there is a contriving uncle for you   henry is it possible   don gasp possible why i did it  i did it and where is the harm a banished man is a dead man in the eye of the law and a dead man can be no husband he fought a duel and was forced to fly   henry and how sir could you take advantage    don gasp why those young rascals take every advantage over us with nature to back em and we have a right to make reprisals when we can by the help of art   henry and so the lady believed your intelligence   don gasp yes yes she believed  and swoond  and raved  and took to her bed faith the doctor gave her up but i still determined when it came to the last gasp to tell her the truth rather than have her death to answer for  but it never came to that   henry no no female grief though sometimes obstinate is seldom fatal why my dear uncle you are a perfect machiavel at a plot i shall try if i cannot outplot you though  aside it will be amusing to see antonias astonishment when she finds her henry is still living  ha ha  but then she will be yours ha ha ha   don gasp yes then she will be mine  she will be mine ha ha ha you must know the chit had no fortune though of a noble family  was pestered with youthful profligate lovers and at length to get rid of them agreed to give herself to me  there is a stroke of prudence in a girl   henry  aside oh twas more  i feel it was a stroke of love to me but what will don henry say to this pretty jest which you and i find so laughable   don gasp what care i what a man says a thousand miles off   henry but if he obtains his pardon he will return and then    don gasp pardon oh you dont know how deep i am  i leave no loopholes for my schemes to drop through hark in your ear  but be secret  i have bought his pardon   henry how sir  bought his pardon   don gasp hush that is all under the rose  you understand me  it cost me a good lump of moidores   henry you astonish me  strange kindness to a man whom you could rob of his wife   don gasp kindness  tut i got his pardon for myself that nobody else should have it  so that if he gets any one to ask for it it will be answered the pardon has been already granted  but for want of my appearance he is defunct depend on it  ay as much out of the world as though the sexton had covered him with greensod   henry and are you actually in possession of his pardon   don gasp as good  the money is paid and i shall receive it from the broadseal office tomorrow   henry what a discovery is here  aside   don alexis enters pulling in octavio alex come in here come into this room my dear octavio so here is the young bridegroom now

and twas worth while to come post from madrid on purpose  you will not cut capers at so wise a wedding every day i can tell you   gasp come come a truce to your sneers dont you think he resembles his poor dear mother   alex not a bit   gasp no the eyes are the very same   alex eyes  why here is were blue and his are black   gasp that is nothing  they have just the same look with em   alex yes i grant ye as to the look his look as much like eyes as here is did then she was round favored   gasp what signifies that  a long face and a short face may have the same air   alex but his hair is dark and here is was light   gasp oons how you talk  why all hair must be light or dark or some color come along nephew  when people get old they grow so obstinate there is no convincing them of any thing come along  come along  exit with don henry   alex dont take him to your antonia lest she should have the odd notion that he is a fitter bridegroom for her than you are  bawling after him well my dear boy i am come on purpose to ask how you managed today with my daughter the young slut is so mealymouthed i could get nothing out of her was she kind  did she show a proper sense of the favor   octav sense of the favor sir she permitted me to implore the favor of being allowed to hope   alex well well that is the point i would come to  hang phrases was you contented with your reception  was she no more than decently coy   octav she was all goodness sir why what an old fellows this  aside   alex all goodness  well that is in generals tell me  come now tell me honestly did she let you kiss her   octav heavens i dared not let such a thought exist had any man but her father asked me    alex you would have said yes  you would i know you would boasted of the sweetness of her lip and of the pressure of her white hand but i  i must know nothing  i am an old father   octav  aside what can be the meaning of all this is it his suspicion or his folly   alex come why will not you tell me now  tell me at once   octav what shall i tell you sir   alex what  why that she treated ye kindly  that you liked her pouting lips and that    octav believe me sir i dared not attempt such a liberty   alex no why had you not my permission   octav i did not so consider it sir but if you will lay your commands on the lady when i have the honor to wait on her again    alex ay that i will never fear me but pray where is the foundation of your great content if nothing kind past i fear the slut has deceived him  aside   octav kind she was all angelic sweetness sir   alex pho dont tell me of angelic sweetness a young fellow should be content with nothing less than mortal sweetness when with a blooming girl   octav she had the condescension to promise    alex what  what   octav that when you should order her to bestow her hand on me she would obey you without reluctance   alex she promised that did she   octav she did and my delighted soul has dwelt on the sound from that moment   alex well well come again this evening and your soul shall have something else besides sound to dwell upon or i will understand why   octav good sir you would be very convenient i perceive but it unfortunately happens that i choose the sweet trouble of getting over my love difficulties myself   alex oh to be sure  above being obliged i see but i tell you these young baggages have all their arts to make a man half mad and i know em  i will manage her my little octy never fear sound indeed   octav allow me sir with all humility to request that you will give yourself no trouble in the business gods death if i dont take care i shall not have the pleasure of running down my own game if you wish to make a soninlaw of me sir you must permit me to travel the road of love in my own manner  no bearing him exit   alex zounds what a heat youre in why so you may travel the road of love in your own manner  i only mean humbly to open the turnpike gates for ye  see what one gets by ones good nature  exit   scene don gaspers garden enter henry don henry  looking as though uncertain surely it is herself  yes it is antonia like the soft lilly pressed by the dewy robe of night she

the treasures of remembrance live on my henrys image   clara come come that is a sort of image worship we dont allow it would be more catholic to live in lonely shades with himself  this soft recess would be at least more poetical my dear with a handsome young man in it even though he should be uncivilly asleep  pointing to henry   ant  not regarding her oh i will call back each sacred hour which blessed our wedded souls trace each fond scene that chastend love made pure and in the dear review forget that i am a wretch   cla ay do forget it pray and look behind those shrubs  there is a youth

immortal to stand thus and gaze on him   clara one might almost fancy it don henry himself only unhappily it is not the custom for people to leave their family mansions in the churchyard to repose on violets for their mistresses to gaze on them   ant the resemblance is stronger now he sleeps when awake this stranger has a scorn  a severity in his eye  something that made me fear but henrys eye talked only love oh i have seen a volume in a single glance  one look has said what eloquence and learning might try to imitate in vain  sings sweet rosy sleep oh do not fly bind thy soft fillet on his eye that over each grace my own may rove and feast my hapless joyless love for when he lifts those shading lids his chilling glance such bliss forbids  then rosy sleep oh do not fly but bind thy

enjoy it too   alexis there is my ring i pant for the hour of its being restored as much as a girl does to unburthen her first love secret   henry i too pant for the hour for if i mistake not i shall mean time make such a use of your great grandfathers seal ring as must make that and every future hour blissful to me exit   alexis what can he mean to do with it that seal ring make all his future hours blissful may be there is some concealed witchcraft in it and he has had wit enough to find it out or if rightly turned it may make a man invisible or something of that sort  there have been such

formal allowed courtship intolerable to her if you persist in countenancing my addresses she will hate me but if you order her to see me no more and allow me to steal her out of a window or over the garden wall she will be the happiest bride in portugal   alex do you say so oh a perverse baggage  but i will fit her will not love ye merely because i order her to do it that she had from her mother   octav you must conceal your knowledge of that   alex pho do you imagine i dont see your whole drift now if you was to continue talking a lapland winter you could not make the hint clearer gad she is coming and my wife with her so do you hear you signor don octavio  speaking loud you are  i say you are  you shall know what you are another time for the present that is your way sir that your way out

lesson  to viola   alex so mistress  i have dispatched your lover   viola have you sir   alex a young rakeshame your not liking him proves you have your fathers penetration notwithstanding his modest front there is not such a desperate fellow this side the ganges no nor tother side the black sea   seraph my sweet love are you speaking of don octavio   alex yes i am take care you give him no encouragement do you hear girl no whisperings from your balcony no private correspondences no billets dropped by your officious maid on pretense they are meant for some carottypated country cousin   viola dear sir   alex no pencild assignations on the back of your fan or cards in lemon juice  to be called on detection secret orders to your perfumer for pearl powder and bloom of circassia   seraph how can you put such things in the girls head deary   alex  aside that her fingers may put them in practice to be sure but you are not up to me there deary  aside   viola but a few minutes since you were fearful sir that he was not received with sufficient favor   alex that was  that  well no matter that was perhaps to try how far things had gone   seraph oh i beg your pardon the curtain rises and we see the sun now i understand your policy  how admirable you middleaged gentlemen are so deep that it is difficult to sift ye   alex ay and when we are sifted    seraph you are found to be chaff poor dear don octavio send him a garland of willows viola   viola rather of myrtles  he is too handsome for willows   alex handsome is he that handsome does  remember that   viola why sir he does handsomely he has traveled handsomely has a handsome estate has brought home a handsome character and now wishes for a handsome wife   alex ay but he must go further a field to catch her though he will find neither wives nor widgeons in my orchard   seraph no our widgeons are all within doors   viola unfortunate that i am just made up my mind to dismiss sebastian nay absolutely to dislike him and now    alex and now why now you must make up your mind the other way perhaps in my present humor of the two fools i like sebastian best   viola but that humor must change for i can never think of those two young men as you do my dear father   alex thoughts are free daughter gad i could hug her  aside   seraph you see your father generously leaves your thoughts unshackled my dear he only

aside you dont know what you are talking of   seraph i do indeed  perfectly in short viola he is so amiable so captivating and loves you with such unbounded fondness that if you marry any other your misery ought to equal your ingratitude   alex gad she speaks with an air of too much conviction  this must be managed more nicely to your chamber hussy and try to forget octavio    pushing off viola seraph and remember your sebastian let him be present to you waking and sleeping let him    alex zounds let him alone  driving her off on the other side you may be doing mischief all this while i dare not let her into my plot lest her perverseness or her folly should mar it and yet i think  no hang it i will not  i will not the only plot that ever had a woman in it came to nothing i will conduct

i was only going to say that henry would not have been so unkindly silent   gasp was that all indeed my little tony but twas wrong to think upon a young man never let your thoughts run upon a young man whether in a grave or a garret   ant never sir be assured neither in one place or the other will my thoughts ever seek a lover but why did you not speak   gasp faith you prattled love so prettily i could have heard your little tongue run for ever but how came you out so late and with these jewels and parcels   ant sir  i was  why sir    rachel alas sir we thought the city was in arms and packed up our things to secure em lord sir we were so scared about plots and robberies and    ant yes sir terrified to death   gasp oh it is all quelled now  it is all over my pretty chuck as soon as i appeared amongst em and threatened em and harangued em on their duty they were as silent as the soft tread of a thief on a dark staircase i am resolved she shall not know what a gull i was  aside come now let us in and join our tender hearts in one   ant pardon me sir day is on the point of breaking  dear welcome day and i am resolved to pass it unbound by any vows but those of love   gasp how   ant in this one point sir i must govern or here i vow most solemnly never to be yours   gasp oh its a rash vow  a most unjustifiable vow   rach not so rash a vow as that you want her to make   gasp what is that minx   rach why sir with submission i say its most rash and unjustifiable for eighteen to rise out of bed and go to church to vow to love sixtyfive  and i will maintain it   gasp but the vow was made hussy and all vows must be kept  religiously kept and therefore though it goes against me even this last shall be kept so come in my little tony and learn of your nown hubby never to break a vow    all go in henry that secures me her delicacy is safe from insult and when i see her next it shall be with powers to suppress his audacious fancied rights and close the necessity for these degrading acts for ever exit   scene changes to don alexis s garden he enters leading in octavio alex gad i am glad i found ye  twas devilish lucky viola is certainly somewhere in the garden  both my wife and carlota assured me that she was   octav and the ladder of ropes is suspended from the place you pointed out   alex exactly there  i helped to fix it myself  it is very secure   octav the dear little madcap must have her way but it is strange she prefers scaling a wall at midnight to walking quietly through the gate in the sunshine hist  i hear the tread of gentle feet   alex then i am off if she should find us together the perverse baggage would suspect our intelligence and that would spoil all  so i am off  lowering his voice exit   octav in a few hours expect us at your feet asking pardon and blessing  a pause charming viola appear i hear you not yet by the soft influence about me i am sure you are near what delightful faculty is this which allows us to be conscious of the presence of the object we adore without the vulgar intervention of the senses  it must be the privilege of purest love   seraph  entering the privilege of fancy  all mere fancy though you would exalt it into a faculty   octav hah my charmer  catching her in his arms faculties and fancies are now equally nothing  all lost in transport at finding thee in my arms   seraph i protest i begin to believe you very dangerous i insist on your quitting me this instant  breaking from him heavens what a situation in the arms of a man  alone  in a garden at two oclock in the morning  aside   octav what do think of sweet angel   seraph that the sooner we are out of this place the better   octav  aside suppose i secure her mine i almost fear some new caprice  and if i mistake not her little heart flutters at this moment in unison with my own dear bewitching woman let me once more taste    seraph hold sir or by all that is good   breaking from him i never knew till now what resistance meant  aside   octav by heavens i will not lose this charming moment   seraph then you lose me for ever  make your election   octav this moment is presented to us by love  let us prove ourselves worthy of the boon   seraph how by disgracing love   octav well argue that point hereafter but now    seraph hold sir  i am neither blind to your intention nor to my own danger  but know you are meditating an irremediable crime   octav how irremediable love itself shall remedy the crimes it makes   seraph hah you know not what you speak of nor can i explain myself  but let us fly   octav then we will fly my little trembler and hymen shall    seraph yet stay  i cannot go with you alone  you must consent that a lady accompanies us   octav who   seraph no matter you must promise me without asking questions to conduct her safely to don sebastian and then to conduct me in safety to your fathers   octav to my ghostly father you mean  to a priest   seraph no to don gasper  on those terms i scale the wall with you and on no other   octav it is odd and mysterious but i will scale walls with you on any terms where is the lady   seraph we shall find her in the next walk  oh no she is hastening hither  enter viola veiled come fair damsel this is the valourous knight who is to conduct us through all the intervening dragons and giants to the quiet and sober pale of matrimony  where we shall grow good and stupid  drawling and recollect the kind action of this night with matronly thankfulness and decency   octav  aside it is a vile thought and sticks most indigestibly why must love be thus shackled i feel i shall repent and leap the pale  but i am fairly caught now and must submit come my little fawns take each an arm  egad let us make haste or some unlucky ideas which are growing rather ponderous will prevent my flight over the wall   seraph i will be hanged if it is not the idea of matrimony you find so heavy  but be of good comfort signor and make speed  your fate has prepared a consolation you little expect exeunt   scene don gaspers he enters gasp well day at last is broad awake and the vile night which cloaks so many schemes and villainous plots against the peace of wary husbands is passed away  and all has gone well yes all has gone well except with my poor aching bones and sleepless eyes spent all these hours upon a mat at antonias chamber door  dared not leave it truly she is a treasure but if to secure it i must fag out the remnant of my life in these alarms and fears and misgivings  well well it is too late now to think about that my hour is come  dolefully   enter a servant serve don octavio and a lady sir exit   octavio enters leading seraphina veiled octav permit me sir to ask your protection for this lady for a few hours  if you knew her you would think she had a right to claim it   gasp to claim it  why who is she   octav that i am forbid to tell  do you release me from my promise madam   seraph no certainly  and yet if i did it were much the same thing for you do not know me   gasp not know the lady   seraph believe me he does not and yet if you ask him he will swear he does   octav surely though you are veiled i can swear you are the same sweet melting creature who in a certain garden    seraph found herself in your arms and afterward leapt the wall with you  that you may safely swear   octav yet i know you not  ha ha ha permit me  apart  perhaps you will deny being her whom i am to marry to day   seraph oh no  i swear i will marry you to day if don alexis gives consent   octav we have more than his consent  his ardent wishes   seraph yet i shall not be yours   octav why what a sweet enigmatical charmer you are   seraph  to don gasper if i mistake not sir this house has a mistress  may i be permitted to wait on donna antonia   gasp madam  ma  octavio  whispers   octav oh yes of rank and reputation  but a little capricious   gasp pardon me madam i will wait on you to antonias apartment  i shall not care to leave them together though  aside   exit leading seraphina octav what can she mean with her riddlemerees i am perplexed  sebastian enters with viola hah don sebastian what the weighty ceremony so

i want to guess how it is   sebas if you love as i do you will feel as i do  blessed   octav i fear all you married rogues are so many decoy ducks you look up with envy and cry quake quake to your fellows at large and when you have coaxd us into the snare clap your wings and exult   viola  running to sebastian oh i hear my fathers voice  i would not have him see you at this instant  apart pardon my freedom don octavio but it will be infinitely kind if you will both leave me   sebas those fears are idle my charmer  the moment must arrive   viola nay do not stay to argue but oblige me   octav what sir so much of a husband in half an hour as to dispute a command i will take him to task madam and give him a lesson on obedience exeunt   alexis  without octavio and a lady veiled
