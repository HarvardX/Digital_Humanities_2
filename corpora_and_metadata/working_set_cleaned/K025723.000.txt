an inquiry into the origin of episcopacy in a discourse preached in june    0  by a dignitary of the church of england  printed by simmons and co canterbury       advertisement the author would feel himself much honored and obliged by any remarks addressed to his printer from those learned churchmen to whose consideration these sheets at present not intended for the public eye are respectfully submitted  hebrews   th chap   th verse obey them that have the rule over you and submit yourselves for they watch for your souls as they that must give an account in examining a religion which pretends to come from god one of the first things which forces itself upon our attention is the influence of its doctrines and precepts upon human felicity if the natural tendency of these be to regulate the passions and to promote the general happiness of mankind a strong presumption arises that its pretensions to a divine origin may be well founded but if a religion obviously tends to lessen human happiness or to disturb the peace of society we may without further examination conclude with certainty that it comes not from that great and beneficent being who far from delighting in the misery of his creatures would have all to be pious and virtuous only that all may be finally and completely happy in those realms where death has no dominion  viewed in this light christianity is eminently distinguished above every other religious institution which has hitherto prevailed in the world it teaches in perfection the duties of man to man it affords divine aids to human weakness and encourages the practice of what it shows to be good by motives the most engaging and the most exalted  christian religion exhorts us to be mindful of whatsoever things are true honest just pure lovely or of good report  to forgive our enemies to love our neighbors as ourselves to do good as we have opportunity to every individual of the human race and as much as lies in us to live peaceably with all men  in society only are these duties practicable and without government and subordination society could not subsist therefore the divine author and finisher of our faith in order to give efficacy to his other commands enforced obedience to the civil magistrate by an injunction of the gospel requiring his followers to render unto caesar the things that were caesars as well as unto god the things that were gods  the same course of salutary instruction was faithfully pursued by the apostles and others the first preachers of christianity who earnestly exhorted their converts to render to all their dues tribute to whom tribute was due custom to whom custom fear to whom fear honor to whom honor to submit themselves to every ordinance of man for the lords sake whether to the king as supreme or to magistrates as unto them who are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and for the praise of them that do well  to these precepts of civil obedience no objection of importance has ever been made they are on the contrary applauded both by the believer and by the unbeliever  by him who reverenceth the gospel as the power of god unto salvation  and by him who considers it as a cunningly devised fable calculated merely to erect a dominion over the consciences of men  but the precept of my text has frequently been viewed in a light less favorable it certainly supposes an authority different from that of the civil magistrate whose duty is to watch not for the souls but for the lives and properties of his subjects and to that authority st paul here enjoineth an obedience which the children of this world are little willing to pay  it would be idle to reason in support of spiritual authority with such as doubt or deny the divine origin of the gospel for these men must be convinced that they have souls before they can be persuaded to enquire who are appointed to watch for them to whom on that account their obedience is due or what is the nature and extent of the obedience required  they are not however all infidels who deny the reality of spiritual powers  for many sincere believers in christianity contend that under the gospel dispensation there is nothing which bears the smallest resemblance to an exclusive priesthood that the authority which is supposed in my text either ceased with the apostles or that if it still continues in the church it can be conferred on one class of christians only by the election of others and that therefore we are bound to obey it no farther than is necessary to preserve decency and order in the conduct of public worship  that our blessed lord gave to none of his immediate followers authority or jurisdiction of such a nature as to interfere with the rights of the rulers of the earth is indeed an undoubted truth  for all such authority was disclaimed by himself my kingdom said he to pilate is not of this world  and upon being asked by a certain person to decide a question of property between him and his brother his reply was man  who made me a judge or a divider over you but when it is considered that christ came into the world to turn men from darkness unto light and from the power of satan unto god that he gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify to himself a peculiar people zealous of good works  and that of these works very many are such as unregenerate humanity cannot perform and that the doctrines which he revealed are such as human reason could never have discovered it will be seen how necessary it was that when he ascended into heaven he should substitute some authority on earth to illustrate the revelation which he had given and to enforce obedience to the laws which he had enacted  there is nothing more strictly required of christians than that they should live together in unity professing the same faith joining in the same worship and practicing the same virtues on the same principles now as men have different passions prejudices and pursuits such unity would be impossible were they not linked together in one society under the government of persons authorized to watch over the faith to prescribe the forms of public worship and to inculcate the necessity and explain the nature and extent of the several virtues  in the scriptures of the new testament the society of christians is on account of its unity and organization compared to the human body for as we have many members in one body and all members have not the same office so we being many are one body in christ and every one members one of another  romans xii     this society of believers in our common deliverer is called the church the kingdom of god  and the kingdom of heaven and its affairs like the affairs of every other kingdom are administered by proper officers in subordination to the one lord who when he ascended on high and led captivity captive gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ that henceforth we should be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part makes increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love  ephesians iv                 now  of this society as of a philosophical sect it is not left to every mans choice as a thing indifferent whether or not he will become a member all who embrace the faith of the redeemer of the world are required to be baptized under the pain of forfeiting the benefits of redemption st mark xvi     st john iii   but one great purpose proposed by the institution of baptism was the initiation of persons into the church of christ for by one spirit says st paul   cor xii             are we all baptized into one body whether we be jews or gentiles whether we be bond or free  of baptism whatever be the importance it is evident that to receive it is not like moral justice or the veneration of the supreme being a duty resulting from the nature of the relations of man and that all its efficacy which in scripture is said to be nothing less than the remission of sins acts ii    and xxii    is derived from positive institution and can accompany the external rite only when that rite is administered in the manner prescribed and by the persons authorized to administer it  that all christians in common are not vested with this authority is plain from the commission which after his resurrection the blessed jesus gave to his apostles we are assured that the number of his followers was then five hundred at least but it was only to the eleven disciples that he came and spoke saying all power is given unto me in heaven and earth go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost  st matthew xxviii             now there is no reason to suppose that there were not many of the five hundred well qualified to instruct either a jew or a gentile in the doctrines of the the gospel and it is certain that any one of them could have washed his converts with water in the name of the holy trinity as well as st peter or st john but then such an unauthorized washing would not have been christian baptism or of equal validity with it any more than the opinion of a lawyer at the bar is the judgment of a court of justice or of equal obligation it is the commission of the sovereign which gives force to the judgment of the court as it is the commission of christ which gives validity to baptism  the same things hold true of the lords supper which if it be not administered by persons having authority for such celebration cannot be deemed a sacrament of christs institution these two rites are the external badges of our profession  by the one we are incorporated into that society of which god our savior is the head and sovereign  of the other with all its advantages we have a right to partake whilst we continue members of that society but if by an open and scandalous disregard to the precepts of the gospel we should prove ourselves despisers of its privileges the same persons who are authorized to admit us into christs church are likewise vested with authority to cast us out of it for to them were given the keys of the kingdom of heaven with an assurance that whatsoever they should bind on earth should be bound in heaven and whatsoever they should loose on earth should be loosed in heaven st matthew xvi    and xviii    and i will give you the keys of the gate of this court or kingdom the church of which every one of you is to be the steward as the keys of the court were given to eliakim isa xxii    in token of his being a steward of the house to admit and exclude whom he pleased that is both power and ensign of power apoc iii   to exercise censures and by them to exclude men in case of their impenitence either by laying some restraint on them in the church or to turn them out of the gates of this city and upon repentance to receive them into the church again and what you do here as you ought to do shall be valid in heaven hammonds paraphrase   now as baptism is to be administered so long as there shall be persons to be enlisted under the banner of christ and as the lords supper is to be celebrated so long as it shall be the duty of soldiers to adhere to to the standard of their leader and their head and as it is to be feared that there never will come a time when all the servants of christ shall walk worthy of the vocation wherewith they are called  it follows undeniably that this power of the keys see this matter treated in a very masterly manner by archbishop potter in his discourse of church government  a book which i beg leave to recommend earnestly to every member of the church of england and especially to the younger part of my brethren the clergy which was originally vested in the apostles must continue in the church through all ages even unto the end of the world but we have seen that it was not at first entrusted to all the disciples in common as one of the privileges inseparable from their profession and as no body of men can possibly transfer an authority of which they themselves were never possessed it is certain that even now it cannot by the election of one class of christians be delegated to another but must by some mode of succession be derived from the apostles who were sent by christ as he was sent by his father  to argue from the origin of civil to that of ecclesiastical government although perhaps not very uncommon is yet extremely fallacious  of the various nations of the world as particular forms of government may be devised on earth though government itself is from above many of the sovereigns may indeed derive their authority from the suffrages of their subjects because in a state of nature every man has an inherent and undoubted right to defend his life liberty and property and what he possesses in his own person he may for the good of society transfer to another but no man is by nature or can make himself a member of the christian church and therefore authority to govern that society can be derived only from him by whom it was founded and who died that he might gather together in one all the children of god  against such reasoning as this it has been sometimes urged that it appears inconsistent with the wisdom and goodness of god to make institutions which like baptism and the lords supper are generally necessary to the salvation of all christians depend upon the authority and commission of a particular order because by such an economy an intolerable domination would be established over the souls of men and the purpose for which the son of god died might in some degree be defeated by the caprice of an ignorant and arbitrary priesthood  but this objection is either of no weight or it militates with equal force against all religion natural as well as revealed although in conformity with the usual mode of expression i have distinguished between natural and revealed religion i do not imagine that there ever was or could have been a consistent scheme of religion excogitated by the mere strength of human genius the authors who detail to us systems of what is called the religion of nature borrow sometimes without adverting to it their principles from the holy scriptures and then not unfrequently turn against revelation those arms with which it has furnished them  in vigor of intellect plato and cicero were surely not inferior to mr woolaston and yet it is certain that in their writings are not to be found so many truths and so few mistakes relating to the supreme being as he has exhibited in one small volume  whence then had the author of the religion of nature delineated this superiority over the greatest men of antiquity  undoubtedly from his knowledge of those truths which are recorded in the old and new testaments and of which the philosophers of athens and rome knew nothing except what had come down to them from the primeval times through the precarious conveyance of oral tradition  when a proposition is once known to be true it requires no extraordinary strength of mind to understand the grounds of its truth he must be a very weak man who could not be made to understand the demonstration of the pythagorean theorem and yet i hope there is not one of my readers who does not think himself indebted to the sage who made the discovery  the case is similar with respect to religion its doctrines and precepts are now known and of these doctrines many are of such a nature that a wellcultivated mind comprehends without difficulty the reasons upon which they rest concerning others we may well be contented with the plain though narrow view of them which is laid before us in the sacred writings  for prying into those mysteries like gazing on the sun begins in pain and ends in blindness  the fitness of the precepts of revelation for such a creature is easily discerned but it does not therefore follow that the system could have been excogitated by human reason any more than that every man of ordinary capacity is equal to pythagoras  and even against the wisdom of providence in the government of the world  in every thing relating both to their temporal and their spiritual interests mankind are all subjected to mutual dependence the rich depend upon the poor and the poor upon the rich an infant neglected from the birth would barely cry and cease to live nor is it very easily to be conceived how in the more rigid climates a fullgrown man could without assistance provide even the necessaries of mere animal life of religion it is certain that in such a situation nothing could be known for there is not the smallest reason to imagine that any individual of the human race  an aristotle  a bacon  or a newton  had he been left alone from his infancy without culture and without education could ever by the native vigor of his own mind have discovered the existence of a god or that such speculations as might be supposed to lead to that discovery would have employed any portion of his time or his thoughts  even in society it would be impossible for any man without the assistance of others to understand in the present age the very first principles of christianity for the scriptures in which alone those principles can be found are written in languages which are now no where vernacular in the fidelity of translators therefore every illiterate disciple of jesus must confide for the truth of those doctrines which constitute the foundation of all his hopes and as no man ever pretended that the christian sacraments are more necessary to salvation than the christian faith where is the impropriety or inconsistency of those persons receiving the sacraments of baptism and the lords supper by the ministration of others who by such ministration must of necessity receive the truths of the gospel  having thus shown that there is in the church a standing order of men to whom in the affairs of religion the great body of christians ought or are bound to pay obedience it remains to be enquired who they are that among the various pretenders have the best claim to this spiritual authority  one party maintains that originally the officers of the church were all presbyters of one order and vested with equal powers whilst others and the church of england especially hold that christ and his apostles appointed diverse orders of ministers in the church that of these orders the highst alone was vested with authority to ordain others and that therefore obedience as to those who watch for our souls can be due only to such as are episcopally ordained  this is the famous question concerning the apostolic model of church government which has almost from the beginning of the reformation been agitated between us and the dissenters of the presbyterian sect  the plea urged in behalf of the presbyterians is that the titles bishop and presbyter being in the new testament indifferently given to the same persons cannot be the titles of distinct ecclesiastical officers which appears it is said still more evident from the ordination of timothy who although the first bishop of ephesus was vested with his episcopal character by the imposition of the hands of the presbytery  that one and the same man is in the new testament sometimes called a bishop and sometimes a presbyter cannot perhaps be denied but although every apostolic bishop was therefore undoubtedly a presbyter  it does not follow that every presbyter was likewise a bishop in the old testament aaron and his sons are without any discrimination of order frequently styled priests  as in the new testament both st peter and st john call themselves presbyters   pet v      john      john   and st paul upon one occasion denominates himself a deacon coloss         see the original yet i believe no man ever supposed that those apostles were such ecclesiastical officers as modern presbyterian ministers or deacons and it is universally known that in the jewish priesthood there were different orders and that aaron was of an order superior to his sons  this being the case the presbyters by the laying on of whose hands timothy was made a bishop may have been of the same order with st peter and st john and if so his consecration was undoubtedly episcopal we are at all events certain that it was not in the modern sense of the word presbyterian for the gift which in the first epistle is said to have been given to him by prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery is in the second said to have been in him by the putting on of the hands of st paul persons who are inclined to rest in the scund of words and names and to suppose that the members of the presbytery whose hands were lain upon timothy were of the same rank and order with modern presbyters would perhaps do well to consider the import of the prep sitions  and  in the first epistle st paul exhorts his son in the truth not to neglect the gift that was given to him by prophecy  in the second he says wherefore i put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of god which is in thee   but every lexicon informs us that  with the genitive case answers to the latin preposition per and denotes the instrumental cause whereas  with the same case answers nearly to una or una cum and denotes only consent and concurrence the inference is obvious  that st paul was the only ordainer but by the confession of all parties st paul was a bishop in the highest sense in which that word is taken and the powers of the episcopate not being parcelled out among various partners of whom each possesses only a share the imposition of his hands was sufficient for every purpose which could have been effected by the hands of the whole college of apostles  it appears therefore that from the promiscuous use of the titles bishop and presbyter nothing can with certainty be concluded on either side of this celebrated question but if instead of resting in single words which are always more or less ambiguous we attend to some important facts recorded in the new testament i think we shall discover in them sufficient evidence that the government of the primitive church was prelatical and not administered by a college of elders an our adversaries are wont to affirm  during our saviors stay upon earth we know that he had under him two distinct orders of ministers the twelve and the seventy and after his ascension immediately before which he had enlarged the powers of the eleven we read of apostles presbyters and deacons that the presbyters were superior to the deacons and the apostles superior to both is universally acknowledged but it has been said that in scripture we find no intimation that the apostolic order was designed for continuance  a quaker says the same thing of water baptism and i know not by what text of scripture or by what mode of argument those who upon this plea reject the apostolic order of christian ministers could overthrow the principles upon which the disciples of george fox reject the use of that rite instituted for the initiation of mankind into the christian church  they were the eleven alone to whom our savior said go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost  teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i have commanded you matthew xxviii        0 and therefore although we frequently find presbyters and deacons administering the sacrament of baptism we must conclude that as a judge administers justice by authority derived from his sovereign so those inferior officers of the church administered baptism by authority derived from the apostles indeed had they pretended to act by any other authority it is not easy to conceive how their baptism could have been the baptism of christ for it was not with the external washing by whomsoever performed but with the eleven and their successors that christ promised to be always even unto the end of the world  that the eleven did not consider this promise or the commission with which it was given as terminating with their lives is evident from their admitting others into their own order for which they had competent authority as having been sent by christ as he was sent by his father st john xx     when st paul to magnify his office and to procure to it from the galatians that reverence which it appears they had withdrawn from him and paid to others whose doctrine was probably more palatable styleth himself an apostle not of men neither by man but by jesus christ and god the father he must have known some who derived their apostolic mission from men otherwise he could have claimed no particular respect from what was in his own apostleship no particular distinction at that very early period therefore there must have been in the church secondary apostles if i may so denominate them upon whom by imposition of hands this ceremony of imposition of hands in ordination at which some moderns take great ossence is confirmed from the practice of the apostles and apostolical men thus ordaining deacons acts vi    pastors or teachers of the the words acts xiii    and elders whether bishops or presbyters in every city acts xiv    this practice they certainly derived from the jews who created governors of criminal causes or ruling elders and masters doctors and rabins to be teachers of the law i e to labor in the word and doctrine by imposition of hands as moses did to joshua numb xxvii    deuteronomy xxxiv   and as maimonides says he did when he assumed the seventy to assist him st cyprian in the third century speaks of imposition of hands as that which was to be observed and held from divine tradition and apostolical observation in the collation to the episcopal office and the apostolical constitutions give us this as an ordinance of st john the apostle who doubtless when upon his return from patmos to ephesus he regulated the churches and constituted bishops did it according to the rites of the jews and practice of the other apostles  whence we conclude that the laying on of hands is no dental but a necessary rite of the due ordination of bishops presbyters and deacons whitby on   timothy iv    thus st paul received an outward commission to preach the gospel and was ordained by the imposition of hands acts xiii         and although he was before chosen by christ to his office and thence entitles himself at large the apostle of jesus christ yet being separated by the command of the holy ghost but at the same time by laying on of hands he then styles himself in consideration of the work to which he was especially separated and ordained the apostle of the gentiles  or by some other signisicant ceremony the eleven had conferred that authority which was given to them by their divine master such were matthias and barnabas such likewise were timothy titus and many others whose names are mentioned in the new testament  that matthias and barnabas were of the apostolic order has i believe never been denied and that timothy and titus were superior to modern presbyters is equally evident timothy was by st paul empowered to preside over the presbyters of ephesus to receive accusations against them to exhort to charge and even to rebuke them and titus was by the same apostle left in crete for the express purpose of setting things in order and ordaining presbyters in every city now to exhort to charge and with authority to rebuke ones equal is surely incongruous and altogether inconsistent with that parity of order and office for which our adversaries so strenuosly plead  even the commission given to titus seems by much too extensive for a presbyterian minister who after having ordained in one city could not have proceeded to ordain in another without the consent and assistance of his brother and fellow laborer in a word no man i think who without prejudice reads the epistles of st paul and the apocalypse of st john can seriously believe that timothy titus epaphroditus sosthenes silas and the seven angels it is known to every one that in the old testament the title of angel is sometimes given to the jewish high priest and particularly by the prophet malachi who calls him messenger  of the lord of hosts and that the angels of the churches mentioned by st john were christian high priests or bishops presiding over more than one congregation is affirmed by all the ancient writers and hardly will be denied by any man who shall take the trouble to compare scripture with scripture we are told acts xix  0 and  0 that in the space of two years all they who dwelt in asia heard from st paul the word of the lord jesus both jews and greeks and that the word of god grew mightily and prevailed but with what truth or propriety could this have been said if at the time of st johns writing the apocalypse all the christans of the proconsular asia were comprised in seven congregations which could assemble each with its proper pastor in one place to perform the duties of public worship of the seven churches in asia were mere presbyters or that the church was in those days governed by a college of elders  if from the inspired penmen of the new testament we proceed to examine the succeeding writers of the christian church we shall find such multiplied and concurring evidence of the divine institution of episcopacy as it is impossible to resist without denying the truth of all ancient history and even shaking the pillars of revelation itself for in the noble army of martyrs the witnesses of the episcopal government of the church are earlier and more numerous by far than those who testify that the gospel of st matthew was written by that apostle or that the book of the apocalypse is canonical scripture  but it may be said that although the government of the church as settled by the apostles should be granted to have been prelatical there is nothing in the new testament or in the nature of the thing to make us imagine a different constitution absolutely unlawful the form of civil government established by god himself over the children of israel was certainly monarchical and the same constitution obtained at first in every nation under heaven of which history gives any account yet no man in the present age supposes a republican or an aristocratical government inconsistent with the order of providence and why then should it be deemed contrary to the spirit of christianity to vary the external polity of the church in conformity to the manners or prejudices or civil constitutions of the different nations in which it is placed  this reasoning would be conclusive were not the polity of the church the authority of her ministers and the validity of the christian sacraments inseparably united  to persons who consider the religion of our adorable redeemer as a mere republication of what is called the religion of nature nothing to be sure can appear more trifling or more justly ridiculous than disputes about the external government of the church in the opinion of such men it must be a matter of perfect indifference whether she be governed by bishops by presbyters or by the people at large for the only thing in which they can be interested is the truth of the doctrines taught which rests not upon the authority of the teacher but upon deductions of reason and the declarations of scripture if indeed to the scripture these persons allow any deference to be due  those however who consider christianity as an instituted religion who believe that christ jesus came into the world to save sinners and to restore to them that forfeited inheritance which by no human means they could ever have regained persons who consider baptism and the lords supper as of vast importance in the great scheme of universal redemption and who are convinced that those ordinances derive their importance wholly from positive institution cannot think it a matter of indifference whether the hand from which they receive them be the hand of an administrator who derives his authority from christ or of one who derives it from the people  validity or invalidity is then the grand question and until the argument is wound up to this pitch little good can be done  now it being certain that from the days of the apostles to those of calvin no man was authorized to minister in holy things but by ordination from the hands of a bishop should it be granted in defiance of all antiquity and as i think in contradiction to the clearest evidence of scripture that in the church there were at first but two permanent orders of ministers of which the highest were called bishops or presbyters indifferently and the other deacons i see no advantage which from such a concession could redound to the presbyterian cause according to this supposition the apostolical presbyters must have been invested as it is contended they were with all the powers of modern bishops  with the power of preaching of administering the sacraments and of sending laborers into christs vineyard but it is notorious that at the reformation and in every prior period of the church of which history makes mention there were three orders of ministers of which the second was authorized to preach the gospel and to administer the sacraments but not to send laborers into christs vineyard which was the prerogative of the highest alone that second order being therefore upon this supposition unknown in the apostolic age must have been introduced into the church by no competent authority but it is from it that the presbyterians derive their mission which therefore upon their own principles must be totally void hence it follows that should the episcopal church be granted to have deviated from the apostolic model which if any credit be due to the obvious sense of scripture and the unanimous verdict of antiquity she has not done still she is corrupted only in one part whereas the presbyterian sect rests wholly upon a human foundation  see this argument stated more fully and maintained against much ingenious sophistry in dr wellss controversial letters with the dissenters and it being equally certain that the presbyterians derive their orders from no such source it is surely not without reason that we doubt whether the ordinances dispensed in their assemblies be the ordinances of the church of christ or that we consider the frequenters of such assemblies especially here in england as guilty of disobedience to those to whom by every law divine as well as human they are in conscience bound to submit themselves as to rulers who have authority to watch for their souls  unimportant as this controversy has often been represented it appears to me of much greater moment than many of those which make a mighty noise among the cold and philosophical christians of the present day  in all churches with which i am acquainted are to be found speculative opinions under which denomination i do not by any means include the doctrines of our lords essential divinity and the expiatory nature of his sacrifice upon the cross concerning which i may affirm that although they have been often canvassed with much bitterness of contention and have sometimes produced all the evils of schism a layman who is not obliged to subscribe the public confession of faith needs give himself very little trouble to examine whether they be true or false but a defect in the of mission the ministers of the gospel invalidates the sacraments affects the purity of all public worship and is therefore a matter which deserves to be investigated by every man who is sincerely a christian  that it is particularly worthy of investigation at present when the church of england is assaulted on every side sometimes by clamorous invective and sometimes by insidious stratagem none of the children of that church can possibly doubt her faith which we have every reason to believe to be the faith which was once delivered to the saints is undermined by sophistry and vilified by ridicule against her constitution a thousand artful cavils have been raised as if it were unfriendly to civil and religious liberty and we have repeatedly been given to understand by men who agree in nothing but opposition to us that it would be expedient for the legislature to abolish her hierarchy and to establish in its stead the ecclesiastical government which prevails among the presbyterians or independents or any other novel sect which fancy fertile of innovations might readily suggest  the faith has found many and able defenders who with the sword of the spirit which is the word of god have completely routed that confederate host which with the spirit of gebal and ammon and amalek of old has lately appeared in arms against the divinity of our lord and savior and the redemption of the world but the constitution of the church whether it be thought that the subject is of little importance whilst her faith is at stake or for some other reason  such as the dread of the popular cry of high church on this part of my subject i beg leave to refer the reader to the excellent charge delivered to the clergy of the diocese of st davids in the course of the summer    0 by their illustrious diocesan or priestcraft has not for many years attracted from those faithful soldiers of christ the attention to which in my opinion it is justly entitled it seemed therefore that i could not employ myself with greater propriety than by showing as fully as the time usually allotted to these exercises could permit that our ecclesiastical constitution has its foundation in the holy scriptures and in the universal practice of the primitive church and that although our bishops derive many civil immunities much of their worldly dignity and perhaps their whole revenues from the munificence of the state  the authority to which in my text obedience is required flows to them from another source  the supreme powers in this kingdom have in general approved themselves the nursing fathers of our religious establishment and we may appeal to the history of england for proof that the members of that establishment have in return been remarkable for their loyalty and attachment to the constitution of their country whilst the sectaries when they prevailed against the church prevailed likewise against the state and trampled at once upon the mitre and the crown  this constitutional loyalty let it be our care always to maintain and to inculcate upon those among whom we labor in the word and doctrine from us it is due not merely by ties of allegiance but as a debt of gratitude to that government by which we are protected and to a sovereign who shines conspicuous among the rulers of the earth for his piety and for every personal and royal virtue and who is by inclination as well as by title a defender of the faith but whilst we acknowledge with all thankfulness that we are indebted for our establishment to the laws of man let us never forget that the authority by which we minister in holy things comes to us with the episcopal order from christ and his apostles and that it is our bounden duty to support that authority and that order against the attacks of these who like wild boars out of the wood wasted our vineyard in the last century who in their zeal for a purer and more thorough reformation broke down the carved work of the church with axes and hammers and who have lately given pretty clear intimations of their readiness if they be not restrained within the limits of toleration to work the same work again  to a toleration as surely as persecution is the mark of the beast so is toleration the seal of the living god this then is our present boast and it is also our great protection our national church under a toleration and a test bids fair to promote the progress of true religion useful learning and legal liberty to the latest times  but from what is said in this discourse of the law of toleration let me not be understood as if i could suppose or would insinuate that this law has altered the nature of schism which is a separation from a church not because it is established but because it is scriptural in its doctrine  and apostolical in its government  an episcopal society not sect of christians requiring assent only to the doctrines of the gospel as taught in the three venerable creeds used in our liturgy  the act of toleration has not by taking away all civil punishment from the offender altered the nature of the offense and rendered it an harmless thing or an empty name by no means schism or a causeless separation from the episcopal church of christ remains what it was  a crime deserving condign censure but of this separation whether with or without cause there is no absolutely adequate judge but that power who can distinguish between a well and an ill informed conscience very justly therefore do we remit this question to a higher tribunal but this lenity rather aggravates than mitigates the guilt of schism wherever it shall be found hereafter to exist schism let it then be remembered is no less a crime now than it was when civil authority blindly interfered to vindicate the honor of religion from this unhappy scandal of their worship christians of every denomination have an indisputable right not only by the laws of england but by the great original law of the creator who has constituted mens minds in such a manner as that on questions complicated and involved uniformity of opinion is sometimes hardly to be expected and who has at the same time made it the duty of every man after having been at the utmost pains to procure the best information to regulate his conduct by his own conviction of truth and rectitude  but if an established religion be necessary to the tranquillity of a state which has been repeatedly proved by arguments that have not yet been overthrown and if that religion which is established has likewise the best evidence of being true which if i mistake not is happily the case in england it is surely the duty of those who are the clergy of the establishment to point out its various excellencies and it is as plainly the duty of those who are its legal guardians to prevent its avowed enemies from intruding into stations whence they might be able to assail it with weapons very different from the sword of the spirit  in all our contests however with such as oppose themselves let scripture history and reason be our only arms for by these alone can our fortress be honorably defended and it stands in need of no other defense  let us never in our eagerness to support the cause of truth injure the equally important cause of universal tender heaven directed charity toward all the descendants of adam let us remember that the most vigorous mind is perhaps not completely fortified against the power of prejudice and that if others differ from us every man in the course of his life has differed from himself  let us therefore extend to sectaries and dissenters of every denomination those indulgences which when they were triumphant and the church was in the dust we did not enjoy and whilst duty requires us to expose their errors and to repel their encroachments let our conduct convince such of them as are open to conviction that we can love the men whose principles we disapprove  finis
