likes peace and quietness a little too much for that   ican why then if i do scold you it is all because i cannot bear to see an upstart creature come from nobody knows where    guil why for the matter of that jeannotte everybody says she must be a gentlewoman by distraction   ican everybody says yes everybody says a fine pack of nonsense about her education and her manners and her beauty i should be sorry indeed if she was the only beauty in the village bridling   guil icod i dont know whether she is handsome or ugly you always takes care that i shall not look at her enough for that   ican yes indeed you thinks it is very easy to blind me i suppose you dont intend to look at her neither when you go to call her home   guil why if you are afraid of it you had better go and call her

out of season when deaf and blind to reason of truth we have no belief with rage we are overflowing not why or whether knowing and the heart goes throb with grief ii but when the fit is over and kindness from the lover does every doubt destroy away fly thoughts alarming each object appears charming and the heart goes throb with joy  scene iii guillot guil ay it is all very well but i know in half an hours time twill be just as bad again lord lord what a fine life i am likely to lead with her to be sure she is the best girl in the world if she was not so confounded jealous icod i dont know what it is for i am not so handsome as i knows of and then she talks of loving me so plaguely hang me if one might not as well be hated as scolded from morning till night if i could but hit of a way to cure her of it i was thinking that suppose i made love to adelaide out of a joke but then lord she would never listen to me what put it in my head was there is a mad comical sort of a young gentleman has been plaguing me these two days to sell him the stock that father left me because he wants to turn shepherd and i have heard them say that money is no bad thing to go a courting with well we shall see but here comes the gentleman of the gentlefolks i will be gone   scene iv guillot la piere la p here stop young man i want to speak to you you are going to call the shepherdess ent you   guil no sir our jeannottes gone   la p i am damned sorry for that i wanted to see her and pray has this blazing star been long upon your meridian   guil star sir   la p damme there is no lowering ones self to the comprehension of these brutes to speak in your language then has this young woman been long in these parts   guil i believe it is about two years sir   la p and she really is as divinely handsome as she is reported to be   guil why as to that i cannot say   la p i cannot say the clown you must show her to me i am in love with her by reputation   guil icod it is my belief she has another guess sort of a reputation than that though   la p that what my friend i dont understand you   guil why then to fall in love with such folks as you and i   la p that is pleasant by heaven my friend you are deceived i believe there is some little distance between you and i   guil it is my opinion there is saving respect for you have got a master and i am master for myself no offense i hope   la p no friend your ignorance is your protection what i suppose you take me for one of the followers of the old people if so i must tell you that i have the honor to be in some sort a companion of the abbe de la mouche famous for his elegance and taste for his amors for his poetry and for his new constructed comb for the eyebrows   guil ho ho ho lord that must be a comical thing ho ho ho   la p ho ho ho the natural the abbe i say being on a visit at their house came with them this way partly in search after their son who we understand has taken the road to france and partly like me out of curiosity to see this wonderful creature whose praises they have done nothing but din in our ears ever since they saw her   guil ah likely enough   la p this sir is the way i happened to be in company with the marquis and his lady who are by all that is whimsical the most fantastical the most contrary and the most ridiculous couple that ever yoked together in the shackles of matrimony and as if they were not absurd enough of themselves they have brought with them that walking tombstone count triste who has cried a whole fortnight for the death of a wife that any other man would have given half his estate to get rid of and who like other tombstones is continually telling the world of beauties and virtues that the deceased never possessed but here comes the marquis and his lady   guil and uncle along with them icod i will get out of the way or i shall have it for not going after adelaide going   la p but hear me young man i want you i tell you to introduce me to this fine creature   guil me sir   la p yes  you will tell her that i am as you see a genteel young fellow and that    air guil i guesses in part what it is you would be at make me what your master makes you but i am none of your panders i answer you flat so you see my good friend it will not do every man to his trade  did i flatter and prate and make speeches and conge and bow twould be just all as one with that fine powdered pate as to set you to work at the plow ii besides and moreover i told you before it is another guess sort of a she a sensible one who would set little store by two such poor ninnies as we you thought that a clown would not dare to say nay but you have not found me such an elf so if to the young woman you have ought for to say you are likely to tell her yourself  scene v marquis marchioness and blaise marque dont tell me i will never be comforted he is dead nay i am sure you know it and conceal it from me   marq zounds my dear you will not hear reason for my part so far from thinking as you do i look upon this little exploit as a smart spirited thing what the devil a young fellow with good clothes on his back and money in his pocket lost or dead  a pack of nonsense   marque why should he fly from us then  from me in particular  so indulgent a mother   marq oh my dear boys when they come to be toward twenty think of something else besides indulgent mothers take my word for it he is after some wench   marque oh the very thoughts of it would make me die with confusion   marq why what the devil would you always tie him to your apronstring no no i hope my boy has too much of my blood in him for that   marquis yonder comes the abbe   marq damn the coxcomb what did you bring him with you for fire and water are not more opposite than him and me i am a roman of the time of the commonwealth and he is an italian of the present age a fellow all pomatum and pulvilio we should have been here three hours sooner if i could have got him away from his damned toilet   marquis dear marquis dont talk such stuff now   marq nay only let me draw his picture a little after combing his eyebrows and laying his rouge he threw himself into an arm chair took three sorts of snuff out of the same snuff box sneezed into a white silk handkerchief wiped his mouth with a pink one got up looked in the glass bridled whirled about upon his heel and then answered the salutation of good morrow which i had given before all this ceremony began   marquis heavens how can you   marq this done i had a second impertinence to go through he made me listen to the contents of his whole pate folio such a cargo of sonnets epigrams lampoons and pasquinades enough to furnish out a balladsinging savoyard at a dutch fair however you was determined to bring your abbe and i have brought my count we travel in a great style we have each of us a fool   marquis yours is a fool indeed with his odious grief for his wife who was neither amiable nor handsome and who never loved him   marq oh damme i would have him twas impossible to come all this way without some amusement what with your lamentations for your son his superficial cry and the abbes supercilious laugh you make a devilish good trio but here comes the abbe   marquis marchioness blaise abbe abbe my dear marchioness i have a million of pardons to entreat of you but it was impossible to quit the carriage till i had adjusted myself a little my rouge was so rubbed about my face that my cheeks were as sallow as the countess of hypocondrias and my forehead and nose as red as the marquis of burgundys who lives upon swallowing pint bumpers besides i was struck on the way by the most beautiful idea for a pastoral poem   marquis my dear abbe i am so unhappy about my son i have no leisure to reflect on any thing else   abbe dont make yourself uneasy madam the moment we get among the polite circles at paris i shall circulate a little poetical hue and cry through the hands of the most distinguished characters and your lost sheep will be instantly found i dare swear but you promised to introduce me to this shepherdess   marq introduce you what the devil should she introduce you for to frighten her why what with your little black cloak your feathers in your hat and your wings at your ears she will take you for some strange bird of prey going to fly away with one of her lambs zounds if cato and caesar could give a look at rome in its present state    abbe they would find it filled sir with men of elegance politeness and taste   marq foppery luxury and effeminacy would any body believe this osier twig was the produce of the same clime where grew so many sturdy oaks how manners change those were the times when a veteran pinned against a tree would destroy you fourteen or sixteen of his enemies with his own proper hand but now damme if i should not like to see what a figure you would cut pinned against a tree  air how unlike to these fops were our fathers of old brave manly heroic intrepid and bold who had spirits like fire and of health such a stock that their pulse struck the seconds as true as a clock without bridle or saddle whod mount on a nag and killed before sunrise a boar or a stag who hunger provoked by the keen wholesome air would eat you for breakfast a pound of a bear but a fine mincing modern comes into the room a lump of pulvilio a walking perfume in his tricks and his shape a direct human ape who ogles and flushes and simpers and blushes and patches and paints and expires and faints and stammers and trips takes snuff bites his lips lisps coughs and lolls but to cut the thing short our men now at court are nothing but so many sixpenny dolls  abbe savage and barbarous the ancients are only fit to be made subjects of my satires and odes a delightful people to copy after to be sure   marq they were the only people to copy after they were manly and brave friendly and generous they were strangers to luxury their meals were frugal and what nature required and their dress was made for use and not for ornament   abbe their meals why the best cook they ever had was not capable of making a sauce robert i ridiculed them for it in my little impromptu written at the bottom of corregios picture where ajax invites agamemnon to dinner upon a boiled bull and as to the rest they had neither spoons nor forks nor table cloths nor napkins they eat with their fingers like their forefather adam and wiped them upon their beards like methusalem   marq very well mr fop   abbe no no marquis our buildings our ornaments our dress our eating are so many refinements that do honor to the present age and horridly expose the ignorance of our ancestors   marq all this may be true in the language of foppery but in the language of common sense in your buildings and ornaments you have exchanged solid for superficial your dress has metamorphosed the human species into apes and monkeys and as to your repasts you have inverted the seasons to procure eatables without their natural flavor and all your improvements have only taught you to have peace and strawberries at christmas and melons and pineapples in despite of nature   abbe go on sir twill only serve as minutes for my next pasquinade   marq as for you you are out of measure ridiculous you thought you could not sufficiently disgrace your family which is truly ancient and noble by imitating the other fashionable follies and extravagancies but you must get into the church be made an abbe one of that mongrel kind of animals who now indeed swarm all over the world half clergyman half coxcomb   abbe well marquis we had better not dispute for i fancy we shall never agree at present i believe the marchioness wishes to repose herself therefore good man if you will show us your place we shall be obliged to you   blaise to be sure sir if your honor pleases   abbe and then my dear madam you shall introduce me to the shepherdess   scene vi marquis and count mar those are your nobles of the present times if my son had nothing more noble about him he should not catch me scampering the devil knows where over the alps after him in compliment to any wife in the world bur here comes a coxcomb of another kind a fellow who cries for his wife with one eye and leers at every girl he meets with the other i shall divert myself with him or i am mistaken what still unhappy count zounds man i thought this journey would have diverted you   count ah i told you marquis what a wretched companion i should make for you   marq come come you must shake off your chagrin consider you are going to see the lovely shepherdess of the alps and would you visit your mistress with a face a yard long   count mistress lord marquis how you rattle me think of a mistress indeed who have so lately lost such a treasure my poor dear ah thou best of wives when shall i ever see thy fellow   marq i tell you this shepherdess is her very picture has every trace of her from the cast of her eye to the mole upon her left cheek that people used to take for a black patch   count captivating ornament   marq she has i assure you in short i am determined you shall see her your sorrow preys too much upon you and the only way to forget one woman is to make love to another   count do you think so   marq i am sure of it   count why this grief is very terrible without doubt and if there was any way to cure it  but then how could i expect any woman would listen to me broke down as i am by affliction   marq not listen to you damn it dont talk to me in that style dont i remember when you and i went to venice   count what upon the road the lovely brunetta who played upon the mandilina   marq ah rogue   count i shall never forget her what eyes   marq what teeth   count pearl   marq what cheeks   count roses   marq with the dew upon them when she cried at parting from you eh count   count oh never was man so happy   marq where was the countess then   count alas poor soul she little thought i was wronging her but my sins are punished for she is taken away from me and i shall never be happy any more   marq yes you will come come prepare yourself to see this wonder she will wound you deeper than the brunetta did   count no no i will not think of it melancholy shall be my only mistress nor shall i expect relief but in the cold tomb are you going to see her now   marq presently   count well adieu  i will find out some corner where i may indulge my misery going  and so she resembles my poor deceased dear returns  i should like just to see her   marq you shall not only see her but have her in your arms   count what and press her to my bosom  no no dont talk so   marq you shall i tell you  the charming tempting heavenly    count yielding creature  hey marquis   marq ay this is something like zounds  think of blubbering and crying and yet to say the truth i dont wonder at it for women make us just what they please   scene vii count count he is very right they do make us just what they please indeed  air there is something in women their lovers engage of whatever complexion or stature or age and she who would frighten a mere standerby is a venus herself in the fond lovers eye if she is pale never swan was a tenth part so fair if tawny like jet are her eyes and her hair if xantippe herself her scoldings thought wit if meek all good wives to their husbands submit ii if a pigmy how neat are her air and her mien if a steeple she is graceful and walks like a queen if a girl in her teens all is handsome that is young if eighty her fortune says  world hold your tongue in short to dear women it is given to please and though the whim often should take them to teaze to perplex to torment and a thousand things more they are the deities men were all born to adore  scene viii guillot and young bellemine guil indeed sir it is a very foolish thing and i would not have you think any more of it   y b that is my affair guillot   guil unless i sell you my cottage and sheep in short all my stock you shall be unhappy  i dont understand it for my part   y b and yet guillot it is very true   guil what a whim sir under favor  a gentleman as you seem to be rich and wellborn to come here and keep sheep   y b what would you have me say to you  it is for my pleasure  i come to taste at a distance from the town that happiness which heaven has in store for you the candor that reigns in your eyes convinces me your happy days are the charming image of the golden age to know love is to know happiness it is in the woods he is born the humblest estate is for me the sweetest and yours seems the retreat of innocence and tranquillity   guil for me who am a shepherd i swear to you that our lives have some good moments but it is hard it is hard   y b i know all this guillot and yet i persist   guil well i cannot help it sir i must not consent to it what would our neighbors say  to be sure if i had a mind nobody could furnish you with better things for your purpose than i  let me see  i have a  but no no no i cannot think of it  servant sir going   y b nay guillot pray come back i will give you a handsome price for your things   guil no no sir it is not that i dare say you have money enough and no doubt but you would part with it in a gentlemanlike way and as i said before if things were agreeable i dont know any body could match you better than i but lord only consider it is wrong sir it is indeed how many sheep did you please to want   y b i will buy all you have   guil all i have oh no i could not spare you all i have besides what should you buy any for   y b well but guillot   as they are disputing the symphony begins air guil i have twenty sheep now in the fold twelve ewes eight weathers one year old y b for those same sheep a hundred crowns guil oh zounds y b nay nay guil i will not i say y b sho sho guil no no sir it is too much youre wrong youre wrong y b i tell you guillot hold your tongue guil well if it must be so it must you will say twas forced on me i trust y b my friend you really are too nice a hundred crowns it is just the price come come go on guil i would rather not y b nay prithee be not such a sot guil my cottage neat as ever you saw thatched but last autumn with new straw  y b well well for that two hundred crowns guil oh zounds etc guil why you will take all y b it is my design and for your clothes i will give you mine guil the village all would say twas pride y b come guillot what have you beside guil why i have a faithful dog as true but he will be of no use to you y b well for the dog i will give ten crowns guil oh zounds etc  scene almost the same view differently distributed on one side is a hill at the bottom of the hill an old oak and at the foot of the oak a kind of rustic tomb adelaide is discovered seated here my afflicted mind nourishes its pain i cry and i am comforted twas here i saw my husband here alas i kept him from the battle here he bid me adieu here i waited his return here being dishonored lost without resource he seized the moment while i had fallen senseless at the news to take away that life which i had rendered odious and oh cruel and tender remembrance twas here i built his tomb but what flock moves this way i never before saw the shepherd who conducts them i will turn aside to avoid his presence   scene ix bellemine air y bell by love and fortune guided i quit the busy town with cot and sheep provided and vestments of a clown thus have i bartered riches for a shepherds little stock a crook to leap over ditches and well to climb each rock a faithful dog my steps to guide a scrip and hautboy by my side and my horn to give the alarm when wolves would harm my flock ii ah say then who can blame me for beauty it is i roam but if the chase should tame me perhaps i may come home till then i will give up riches etc at last i am a shepherd how many contending sensations do i feel ah finish love let me behold her the report alone of whose charms induced me to leave my country and my family beautiful and touching adelaide perhaps thou will listen to a timid shepherd when thou would startle at the voice of love alas the god thou fliest is my guide but let me rather seek occasion to do her kindness than surprise her too abruptly yonder she is i cannot be mistaken i will watch upon her steps for ever but i will find out some way to oblige her  he retires scene x adeliade young bellemine behind ade he is gone and i am irresistibly drawn again toward this spot   y bell gods what an angel   ade hark here is some one coming   y bell shall i speak to her coming forward here comes that fool guillot i must step aside or he will discover me gods what an angel  goes off scene xi adelaide guillot jeannotte ade heaven defend me what do i see who is that guillot   jean yes it is guillot out of his senses guillot grown rich in short guillot who so loved me yesterday today hates me worse than poison   ade what is the meaning of all this how came you so fine guillot   guil another gentleman and i changed clothes that is all   ade but why does your finery make you despise jeannotte   guil for a very good reason i intends to make love   ade alas guillot broken vows and inconstancy will never recommend you to me   guil oh lord i shall not be falsehearted to you a bit i always had a sort of a sneaking for you only i thought when i was but a poor shepherd you would turn up your nose at me i hardly believe you will now though   jean did any body ever hear such a wretch i will tear your eyes out and i will tear her eyes out and i will not suffer it so i will not   guil how will you do to help yourself you see mrs jeannotte what your jealousy has brought you to and so no more words if adelaide will have me i will have her   ade this love then which is said to be so sweet makes everywhere unhappiness if it is dangerous for shepherds for whom is it harmless   air chorus alas they say how sweet is love and talk of joys that lovers prove it is folly madness all and rage its joys an hour its pain an age ade come come be friends i see the truth this is some quarrel guil no forsooth it is honest earnest jean what again thou art the basest of all men i cannot bear it so i cannot ade come come dry up her tears guil i shall not i have said my mind and i say still if i can get your kind good will i will marry you tonight jean oh dear such unkind usage who can bear cho alas etc ade plainly friend guillot hear me speak those who their vows of love can break each promise false each oath a lie as from an adder would i fly guil i say you take not the thing right she is cross and scolds from morn till night that all the neighbors cry out shame ade if that is the case then she is to blame sweetness and gentleness should move alone to a return of love but if it is owing to her fears lest she should lose you dry her tears guil not i indeed jean there now see there guil i have neither for her love nor care and if you will have me not do you see another may  all is one to me jean i will beart no longer perjured wretch guil there there you see it was no fetch cho alas etc they go off at the end of the trio different ways end of the first act act ii scene i the same view that was seen at the beginning of the first act young bellemine i have watched till i have lost myself but how to accost her  how to manage the timidity of this solitary beauty  if she is unhappy her heart will have need of consolation after all we seem as if we were alone in the universe and shall be every thing to each other if we converse we shall not be far from friendship and friendship at our age often changes into love but she is here if i am right in my observation she has already some curiosity concerning me i will draw aside and endeavor to heighten it by mingling with her song the sound of my hautboy   scene ii adelaide ade the nightingale gives me his wonted evening salutation and as i return with my flock answers my sighs with a sweet complaining song  she sings sweet melancholy bird again  hautboy plays heavens what do i hear a hautboy accompanies me it is the shepherd who leads his sheep to feed at the foot of the mountain hautboy again a shepherd  let us listen  again it is an enchantment is it possible to believe that sentiment alone can be so faithful a guide who will dare after this to say that taste is the fruit of a slow culture it seems as if fortune pitied me and sent this shepherd as a new echo to answer to my griefs   air sweet melancholy bird again as thou art wont at every eve my hopeless sorrow in soft strain ah echo to me and relieve alas to answer my sad woe insympathy all nature grieves the rivers seem with tears to flow the zephyr sighs amidst the leaves  ade a shepherd this but hold the marquis of bellemine is in search after his only son it must be so but here he comes his air his manner his address all confirm me in my suspicions i will speak to him oh how i shall bless this accident if i can console this unfortunate pair   scene iii adelaide young bellemine ade do you lead your sheep far from hence shepherd   y b i dont lead them at all they go themselves to the pastures which they love   ade you are not of these parts then   y b no   ade nor as it should seem born to be a shepherd   y b since i am one doubtless i was born to be so i know not where i am aside   ade he seems troubled and as if fearful of being betrayed it is surely as i guessed no no your air your language all convince me that heaven designed you a more favorable lot   y b why should you think so twould be as reasonable for me to believe the same thing of you you have the air of an inhabitant of the woods and yet in that estate i see you but nature is the mother of shepherds as well as kings and sometimes with a light and favoring hand bestows talents and graces on the simple and timid shepherd as the object of her choice the flowers which are born in the country want no culture nor have the birds that sing so sweetly any lessons but those of nature   ade i am convinced  you would deceive me i tell you the art with which you animated the hautboy in a simple inhabitant of the woods would indeed be a rare prodigy   y b it is your voice it is the prodigy in a simple shepherdess insinuating   ade what has instructed you   y b my heart and my ear you sing i am ravished and my tractable hautboy longs to answer you is this art difficult alas to explain what one feels costs nothing when one has sensibility and tenderness to form enchanting sounds one has only to hear you twas that struck me with admiration and my mouth and my hautboy were inspired by my mind   ade but you expressed sadness   y b because you inspired it take a laughing air and i will play an allegro   ade no these places were not made for vain and frivolous joy complaints and sighs only are found here   y b let me then sigh with you tenderly   ade alas i penetrate his designs and must prevent them are you then unhappy   y b what if i am   ade perhaps then heaven has sent you that we may console each other but there must be a mutual confidence at sunrise tomorrow let me find you at the foot of that oak where first you heard me sigh there my heart will i lay open to your eyes but you must leave me now   y b i obey tomorrow at sunrise my impapatience overcomes me oh how i shall count each moment  air o time no more shall it be said thy ponderous wings are tipd with lead if pitying a lovers sorrow thou wilt haste and quickly bring tomorrow love overpowers me impatience devours me i dread yet long to see this spot alike in turn i freeze and burn and fear and wish  i know not what  scene iv adelaide thus i shall be sure of rendering him to his friends no no i no longer entertain a doubt that under this shepherds habit i have seen the young marquis of bellemine guillots appearance every thing confirms it but whence does it arise no matter whence every thing adds to my unhappiness his design is but too evident and he will join his entreaties with theirs to reconcile me to the world  ineffectual endeavors  air the little bark may safely ride where neither rocks nor quicksands lie but driven to sea by wind and tide as swift as swallows skim the sky the horror of the foaming main the lightnings glare the thunders roar give little prospect that again poor bark shall ever reach the shore  scene v scene continues marquis abbe marq well abbe i accept your proposal i will sign articles of peace immediately if you will enter into a treaty to show off the count   abbe and you promise for the future not to find fault either with my dress or manners   marq you may use nineteen perfumes to as many pocket handkerchiefs and take out forty toothpicks at one dinner time without my saying a word nay i will even praise your poetry and i am sure that is sacrifice enough in all conscience   abbe i am satisfied   marq to business then the count has been teazing me to introduce him to the shepherdess   abbe him a brute he would be as ridiculous as the bear in my fable that makes love to the panther   marq listen to me you must know i have been out upon the search for i like

marq ah my lovely girl i have been looking for you do you know you have robbed my wife and me of a nights sleep   ade me sir   marq yes you  you may remember when we were here before we used every argument in our power to induce you to go with us to italy and though afterward at your earnest entreaty we promised never to say any more to you on the subject we could hardly refrain from breaking this promise   ade alas sir dont think of me  i am put in the world to make everywhere unhappiness   marq looke adelaide i would not be thought inquisitively impertinent nor do i mean to seek any thing but your happiness i tell you my wife and i have been debating the matter all night and for the first time i believe this seven years we are both in one mind in consequence of our determination i come to offer you my son we are convinced your birth is as good as ours and as to fortune if any chance has robbed you of that it is lucky my boy has a good swinging one to put in his scale which would otherwise be overbalanced by your merit confide then to us the secret of your distress i know beforehand it is something that will make you more respectable in our eyes for it is impossible that any thing but goodness should dwell in such a heart as yours   ade sir i acknowledge that the notice you have been pleased to take of me is a distinction with which i had no right to flatter myself i confess also that i ought to look upon the offer of your son as a very high compliment your unparalleled kindness will never be erased from my memory but sir there is an abyss between the world and me that nothing can overleap   marq my dear child the more you humiliate yourself the higher you rise in my esteem at least let me show you the necessity of disclosing to us your situation that we may know how to soften the rigor of your fate consider what a terrible thing it will be to endure the inclemency of the seasons without a friend to support or assist you you will find no more blaises and renettes you will be an object of envy to the other villagers come come adelaide i have not made such a fine speech a long time and pray dont let it be in vain   ade sir you shall know my story i am now going to tell it your son he ought not to think of me and i have no other way of restoring him to himself and you than by holding up the unfortunate circumstances of my life that he may be the first to say it is impossible we should ever be united thus you will be acquainted with all my unhappiness and in return for this confidence i must entreat you when you leave this place to take every possible precaution to prevent my being an object of odious curiosity and while you stay here to guard me from importunities which are as hateful as they are ineffectual   marq that mandrake of an abbe i will lay a million damn him i will cut his ears off beautiful young creature you render yourself more and more estimable every moment be assured you have nothing to do but name your wishes and every thing within my fortune shall be yours   air ade my tears  alas i cannot speak must thank this goodness sure divine for had i words words are too weak too poor to vent such thoughts as mine the sun in its meridian height will gratitude like this inspire whose kindly heat and piercing light we wonder at and we admire exit scene ii marquis blaise marq i am not very fond of the pathetic but some how or other i cannot help being touched to the soul with this amiable young creatures distress   scene iii marquis abbe mar your most humble servant mr abbe dryly   abbe i have been searching for you marquis i have the most ridiculous circumstance in nature to tell you twould be matter for ten satirical odes   marq what is it   abbe the count has made me the confident of his amor   marq no no   abbe he has and my fellow la pierre is now upon the search for the best carriage to be found in this miserable place to carry off him and his fair one   marq that is excellent   abbe and what think you i intend to do   marq nay i dont know   abbe at the moment he gives his hand to the counterfeit shepherdess of the alps i will step in with the real one drive off and leave the poor count in the lurch   marq and you are really so egregiously conceited to believe this   abbe she has seen me sir   marq i know she has and to cut the matter short has placed herself under my protection you must theretherefore drop all thoughts of her   abbe must that is a little strong sir   marq come come abbe it will not do you cannot marry her because you are of the church and if you meditate any other design it becomes my affair   abbe your affair which way   marq because as an honest man this young creatures unfortunate situation obliges me to prevent her being insulted   abbe you are rather too old i should think to profess yourself a protector of distressed damsels marquis   marq one can never be too old puppy to profess ones self a protector of innocence besides i have brought you here therefore am in some degree accessory to your outrageous folly and a word in your ear  a man may by chance admit a rascal into his company but if he finds him out and does not chastise him he is little better than a rascal himself   abbe sir though i dont wear a sword i can use one   marq to do you justice i know you can though i should be sorry to see you draw it in so unworthy a cause however if it should be necessary i dont believe i have forgot that kind of sport myself i have only then one word to say to you you must either give me your honor never to speak to adelaide any more or you and i are two   abbe you and i are two then my lord pen and person i will not be answerable for my actions to you or any man i did the girl the honor i confess to make love to her and she answered me with a great deal of pride and a great deal of impertinence which must and shall be subdued even though the marquis of belemine was ever so to profess him her knight errant   marq very well very well i shall watch you in the mean time if you think to commit any violence by availing yourself of this young creatures defenseless situation you are no better than a robber who would take away her honor because he had a pistol at her breast  air why is the devil in you or are you such a ninny to believe of you she will ever think persuade her all you can no no whatever believe you your hopes will all deceive you for a girl of sense will yield to  not a monkey but a man ii zounds can that hat and feather or the coxcomb altogether a squire of silk  a mandrake  a mere flash in the pan his pretty self admiring  be ought but hateinspiring when a woman always yields to  not a monkey but a man iii then give this folly over nor seek to blend the lover with the ruffian for i plainly can discover that is your plan or spite of all your vapouring i will so finely spoil your capering you shall own this arm belongs to  not a monkey but a man  scene iii abbe la pierre abbe damme i am piqued at this  oh here comes la pierre  well what news   la p oh sir they will be drawn to matrimony in much the same style as they draw criminals to execution but however that is not very widely different from the ladys situation   abbe what you have got a carriage then   la p yes sir and such a one   abbe well but the plan is changed  i am going in this carriage instead of the count   la p you sir  oh oh i smoke it i saw you together  why sir the bargain has not been long making  so modest too  well who will ever trust to countenances after this   abbe hold monsieur la pierre not quite so fast if you please the bargain is not so firmly made but there will be a necessity for a little agreeable violence  you understand me  i suppose it is possible to procure three or four sturdy fellows   la p whew  are we thereabouts why this affair will make a noise sir   abbe i would have it in short this must all be done within half an hour meet me at the cottage and if you see the count tell him you cannot succeed for him   la p i am gone sir i suppose i may say that your honors purse is pretty full   abbe what you please as to that  and for thee if i am happy i will give thee a snug birth in a convent of benedictines for thy pains   scene iv abbe thus before there doubtable marquis will have time to look about him will i be far enough with my lovely prey our little novel will exactly make out the ballad i wrote once upon my stealing a nun out of a convent  air the coy pastora damon wooed damon the witty and the gay damon who never fair pursued but she became an easy prey yet with this nymph his every power in vain he tries no language moves thus do we see the tender flower shrink from the sun whose warmth it loves ii piqued at the little angry puss cried he she sets me all on fire then plagues himself and makes this fuss only to raise her value higher for that she loves me every hour each moment some new instance proves thus do we see the tender flower shrink from the sun whose warmth it loves iii how to resolve then what resource by fair means she will never come to what of a little gentle force suppose i try what that will do i know she will tears in torrents pour i know her cries will pierce the groves thus do we see the tender flower shrink from the sun whose warmth it loves  scene v marquis guillot jeannotte who come on disputing guil why i tell you jeannotte if you had not been so jealous it would never have happened   jean why for the matter of that guillot if i had been ever so jealous i dont see why    marq nay nay damn it dont fall out the moment you have made it up you have promised never to be jealous any more and you never to give any cause upon these conditions i shall throw something into your purse in the mean time you both remember how i told you to manage the count   jean yes sir never fear i have got my story   guil and so have i mine   marq well here he comes leave us together for a minute and come to him when you find him alone first guillot and then jeannotte   both well take care  they retire scene vi marquis count marq so count   count so marquis i have ten thousand obligations to you she is ready to go off with me   marq to go off with you how the devil could you bring her to this   count i dont know my old way i insinuated and insinuated    marq till she could refuse you nothing eh why this will make a devil of a clatter at turin you will be envied by the whole world   count yes i believe i shall indeed   marq and so the countess is quite forgotten   count now marquis that is unfriendly of you i had just got over the first shock and you have revived it again in my mind   marq now damn it count this is so absurd between two such friends as you and i dont i know what a life you used to lead with her   count horrible indeed but to do her justice poor woman she had a great many virtues   marq what virtues was not she petulant capricious illtempered   count as the devil but then she was divinely handsome   marq handsome what with that meagre figure and her painting herself red and white   count i have told her a thousand times how detestable it was but then her features    marq were at a miles distance from each other   count to be sure they were a little irregular but however in perfection itself you may find some flaw we see spots in the sun   marq come come her perfections compared to her imperfections were a drop in the ocean a grain of pepper upon a turtle in short she was a mixture of mischief and malice incapable of pleasing herself and envying all those who could her delight was to tyrannize over her husband and to play the coquette with every body else   count damme if i did not tell her the very words once myself when we quarrelled   marq how different is the present object of your wishes gentle mild engaging   count oh to rapture   marq so far from thinking herself above you she will look up to you as the author of her good fortune   count very true my dear friend i will go this minute and beg of her but zounds we cannot get a carriage to take us from hence   marq i who am your friend upon all other occasions have thought upon

her toilet i saw the sun rise this morning and the ceremony put me exactly in mind of a ladys issuing from her dressing room  air in the month of may the morning gray first peeps a doubtful light three strikes the clock the village cock next crows with all his might each waking bird chirping is heard tinges of red the sky adorn bird man and beast regard the east and pleased salute the rising morn the shepherd now his flock unfolds night like a thief steals slow away his dingy hue ugly to view is changed to a delightful blue all natures gay and now the villager beholds his mowers mow his ploughers plough sheep bleat birds sing and oxen low each rural sound salutes his ears he whistles to make one and now ushered by all this fine parade in every splendid pomp arrayed appears the

who so bright reflects her visions pure and white instant begone and quit the skies for lo the moon begins to rise ii ye pretty warblers of the grove who chant such artless tales of love the throstle
