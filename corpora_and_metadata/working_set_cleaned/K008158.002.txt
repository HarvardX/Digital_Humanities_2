had she sung  but with a frown revenge impatient rose ode to the passions the dawn of morning now trembled through the clouds when the travelers stopped at a small town to change horses theodore entreated adeline to alight and take some refreshment and to this she at length consented but the people of the inn were not yet up and it was some time before the knocking and roaring of the postillion could rouse them  having taken some slight refreshment theodore and adeline returned to the carriage the only subject upon which theodore could have spoke with interest delicacy forbade him at this time to notice and after pointing out some beautiful scenery on the road and making other efforts to support a conversation he relapsed into silence his mind though still anxious was now relieved from the apprehension that had long oppressed it when he first saw adeline her loveliness made a deep impression on his heart there was a sentiment in her beauty which his mind immediately acknowledged and the effect of which her manners and conversation had afterward confirmed her charms appeared to him like those since so finely described by an english poet oh have you seen bath d in the morning dew the budding rose its infant bloom display when first its virgin tints unfold to view it shrinks and scarcely trusts the blaze of day so soft so delicate so sweet she came youths damask glow just dawning on her cheek i gazed i sighed i caught the tender flame felt the fond pang and drooped with passion weak   a knowledge of her destitute condition and of the dangers with which she was environed had awakened in his heart the tenderest touch of pity and assisted the change of admiration into love the distress he suffered when compelled to leave her exposed to these dangers without being able to warn her of them can only be imagined during his residence with his regiment his mind was the constant prey of terrors which he saw no means of combating but by returning to the neighborhood of the abbey where he might obtain early intelligence of the marquiss schemes and be ready to give his assistance to adeline  leave of absence he could not request without betraying his design where most he dreaded it should be known and at length with a generous rashness which though it defied law was impelled by virtue he secretly quitted his regiment the progress of the marquiss plan he had observed with trembling anxiety till the night that was to decide the fate of adeline and himself roused all his mind to action and involved him in a tumult of hope and fear  horror and expectation  never till the present hour had he ventured to believe she was in safety now the distance they had gained from the chateau without perceiving any pursuit increased his best hopes it was impossible he could sit by the side of his beloved adeline and receive assurances of her gratitude and esteem without venturing to hope for her love he congratulated himself as her preserver and anticipated scenes of happiness when she should be under the protection of his family the clouds of misery and apprehension disappeared from his mind and left it to the sunshine of joy when a shadow of fear would sometimes return or when he recollected with compunction the circumstances under which he had left his regiment stationed as it was upon the frontiers and in a time of war he looked at adeline and her countenance with instantaneous magic beamed peace upon his heart  but adeline had a subject of anxiety from which theodore was exempt the prospect of her future days was involved in darkness and uncertainty again she was going to claim the bounty of strangers  again going to encounter the uncertainty of their kindness exposed to the hardships of dependence or to the difficulty of earning a precarious livelihood these anticipations obscured the joy occas oned by her escape and by the affection which the conduct and avowal of theodore had exhibited the delicacy of his behavior in forbearing to take advantage of her present situation to plead his love increased her esteem and flattered her pride  adeline was lost in meditation upon subjects like these when the postillion stopped the carriage and pointing to part of a road which wound down the side of a hill they had passed said there were several horsemen in pursuit theodore immediately ordered him to proceed with all possible speed and to strike out of the great road into the first obscure way that offered the postillion cracked his whip in the air and set off as if he was flying for life in the mean while theodore endeavored to reanimate adeline who was sinking with terror and who now thought if she could only escape from the marquis she could defy the future  presently they struck into a bye lane screened and overshadowed by thick trees theodore again looked from the window but the closing boughs prevented his seeing far enough to determine whether the pursuit continued for his sake adeline endeavored to disguise her emotions this lane said theodore will certainly lead to a town or village and then we have nothing to apprehend for though my single arm could not defend you against the number of our pursuers i have no doubt of being ale to interest some of the inhabitants in our behalf  adeline appeared to be comforted by the hope this reflection suggested and theodore aga n looked back but the windings of the road closed his view and the rattling of the wheels overcame every other sound at length he called to the postillion to stop and having listened attentively without perceiving any sound of horses he began to hope they were now in safety do you know where this road leads said he the postillion answered that he did not but he saw some houses through the trees at a distance and believed it led to them this was most welcome intelligence to theodore who looked forward and perceived the houses the postillion set off fear nothing my adored adeline said he you are now safe i will part with you but with life adeline sighed not for herself only but for the danger to which theodore might be exposed  they had continued to travel in this manner for near half an hour when they arrived at a small village and soon after stopped at an inn the best the place afforded as theodore lifted adeline from the chaise he again entreated her to dismiss her apprehensions and spoke with a tenderness to which she could reply only by a smile that ill concealed her anxiety after ordering refreshments he went out to speak with the landlord but had scarcely left the room when adeline observed a party of horsemen enter the innyard and she had no doubt these were the persons from whom they fled the faces of two of them only were turned toward her but she thought the figure of one of the others not unlike that of the marquis  her heart was chilled and for some moments the powers of reason forsook her her first design was to seek concealment but while she considered the means one of the horsemen looked up to the window near which she stood and speaking to his companions they entered the inn to quit the room without being observed was impossible to remain there alone and unprotected as she was would almost be equally dangerous she paced the room in an ago ny of terror often secretly calling on theodore and often wondering he did not return these were moments of indescribable suffering a loud and tumultuous sound of voices now arose from a distant part of the house and she soon distinguished the words of the disputants i arrest you in the kings name said one and bid you at your peril attempt to go from hence except under a guard  the next minute adeline heard the voice of theodore in reply i do not mean to dispute the kings orders said he and give you my word of honor not to go without you but first unhand me that i may return to that room i have a friend there whom i wish to speak with to this proposal they at first objected considering it merely as an excuse to obtain an opportunity of escaping but after much altercation and entreaty his request was granted he sprang forwards toward the room where adeline remained and while a sergeant and corporal followed him to the door the two soldiers went out into the yard of the inn to watch the windows of the apartment  with an eager hand he unclosed the door but adeline hastened not to meet him for she had fainted almost at the beginning of the dispute theodore called loudly for assistance and the mistress of the inn soon appeared with her stock of remedies which were administered in vain to adeline who remained insensible and by breathing alone gave signs of her existence the distress of theodore was in the mean time heightened by the appearance of the officers who laughing at the discovery of his pretended friend declared they could wait no longer saying this they would have forced him from the inanimate form of adeline over whom he hung in unutterable anguish when fiercely turning upon them he drew his sword and swore no power on earth should force him away before the lady recovered  the men enraged by the action and the determined air of theodore exclaimed do you oppose the kings orders and advanced to seize him but he presented the point of his sword and bid them at their peril approach one of them immediately drew theodore kept his guard but did not advance i demand only to wait here till the lady recovers said he you understand the alternative the man already exasperated by the opposition of theodore regarded the latter part of his speech as a threat and became determined not to give up the point he pressed forward and while his comrade called the men from the yard theodore wounded him slightly in the shoulder and received himself the stroke of a sabre on his head  the blood gushed furiously from the wound theodore staggering to a chair sunk into it just as the remainder of the party entered the room and adeline unclosed her eyes to see him ghastly pale and covered with blood she uttered an involuntary scream and exclaiming they have murdered him nearly relapsed at the sound of her voice he raised his head and smiling held out his hand to her i am not much hurt said he faintly and shall soon be better if indeed you are recovered she hastened toward him and gave her hand is nobody gone for a surgeon said she with a look of agony do not be alarmed said theodore i am not so ill as you imagine the room was now crowded with people whom the report of the affray had brought together among these was a man who acted as physician apothecary and surgeon to the village and who now stepped forward to the assistance of theodore  having examined the wound he declined giving his opinion but ordered the patient to be immediately put to bed to which the officers objected alleging that it was their duty to carry him to the regiment that cannot be done without great danger to his life replied the doctor and  oh his life said the sergeant we have nothing to do with that we must do our duty adeline who had hitherto stood in trembling anxiety could now no longer be silent since the surgeon said she has declared it his opinion that this gentleman cannot be removed in his present condition without endangering his life you will remember that if he dies yours will probably answer it  yes rejoined the surgeon who was unwilling to relinquish his patient i declare before these witnesses that he cannot be removed with safety you will do well therefore to consider the consequences he has received a very dangerous wound which requires the most careful treatment and the event is even then doubtful but if he travels a fever may ensue and the wound will then be mortal theodore heard this sentence with composure but adeline could with difficulty conceal the anguish of her heart she roused all her fortitude to suppress the tears that struggled in her eyes and though she wished to interest the humanity or to awaken the fears of the men in behalf of their unfortunate prisoner she dared not to trust her voice with utterance  from this internal struggle she was relieved by the compassion of the people who filled the room and becoming clamorous in the cause of theodore declared the officers would be guilty of murder if they removed him why he must die at any rate said the sergeant for quitting his post and drawing upon me in the execution of the kings orders a faint sickness seized the heart of adeline and she leaned for support against theodores chair whose concern for himself was for a while suspended in his anxiety for her he supported her with his arm and forcing a smile said in a low voice which she only could hear this is a misrepresentation i doubt not when the affair is inquired into it will be settled without any serious consequences  adeline knew these words were uttered only to console her and therefore did not give much credit to them though theodore continued to give her similar assurances of his safety meanwhile the mob whose compassion for him had been gradually excited by the obduracy of the officer were now roused to pity and indignation by the seeming certainty of his punishment and the unfeeling manner in which it had been denounced in a short time they became so much enraged that partly from a dread of farther consequences and partly from the shame which their charges of cruelty occasioned the sergeant consented that he should be put to bed till his commanding officer might direct what was to be done adelines joy at this circumstance overcame for a moment the sense of her misfortunes and of her situation  she waited in an adjoining room the sentence of the surgeon who was now engaged in examining the wound and though the accident would in any other circumstances have severely afflicted her she now lamented it the more because she considered herself as the cause of it and because the misfortune by illustrating more fully the affection of her lover drew him closer to her heart and seemed therefore to sharpen the poignancy of her affliction the dreadful assertion that theodore should he recover would be punished with death she scarcely dared to consider but endeavored to believe that it was no more than a cruel exaggeration of his antagonist  upon the whole theodores present danger together with the attendant circumstances awakened all her tenderness and discovered to her the true state of her affections the graceful form the noble intelligent countenance and the engaging manners which she had at first admired in theodore became afterward more interesting by that strength of thought and elegance of sentiment exhibited in his conversation his conduct since her escape had excited her warmest gratitude and the danger which he had now encountered in her behalf called forth her tenderness and heightened it into love the veil was removed from her heart and she saw for the first time its genuine emotions  the surgeon at length came out of theodores chamber into the room where adeline was waiting to speak with him she inquired concerning the state of his wound you are a relation of the gentlemans i presume madam his sister perhaps the question vexed and embarrassed her and without answering it she repeated her inquiry perhaps madam you are more nearly related pursued the surgeon seeming also to disregard her question perhaps you are his wife adeline blushed and was about to reply but he continued his speech the interest you take in his welfare is at least very flattering and i would almost consent to exchange conditions with him were i sure of receiving such tender compassion from so charming a lady saying this he bowed to the ground adeline assuming a very reserved air said now sir that you have concluded your compliment you will perhaps attend to my question i have enquired how you left your patient  that madam is perhaps a question very difficult to be resolved and it is likewise a very disagreeable office to pronounce ill news  i fear he will die the surgeon opened his snuff box and presented it to adeline die she exclaimed in a faint voice die  do not be alarmed madam resumed the surgeon observing her grow pale do not be alarmed it is possible that the wound may not have reached the  he stammered in that case the  stammering again is not affected and if so the interior membranes of the brain are not touched in this case the wound may perhaps escape inflammation and the patient may possibly recover but if on the other hand    i beseech you sir to speak intelligibly interrupted adeline and not to trifle with my anxiety do you really believe him in danger  in danger madam exclaimed the surgeon in danger yes certainly in very great danger saying this he walked away with an air of chagrin and displeasure adeline remained for some moments in the room in an excess of sorrow which she found it impossible to restrain and then drying her tears and endeavoring to compose her countenance she went to inquire for the mistress of the inn to whom she sent a waiter after expecting her in vain for some time she rang the bell and sent another message somewhat more pressing still the hostess did not appear and adeline at length went herself down stairs where she found her surrounded by a number of people relating with a loud voice and vaious gesticulations the particulars of the late accident perceiving adeline she called out oh here is mademoiselle herself and the eyes of the assembly were immediately turned upon her adeline whom the crowd prevented from approaching the hostess now beckoned her and was going to withdraw but the landlady eager in the pursuit of her story disregarded the signal in vain did adeline en endeavor to catch her eye it glanced every where but upon her who was unwilling to attract the farther notice of the crowd by calling out  it is a great pity to be sure that he should be shot said the landlady he is such a handsome man but they say he certainly will if he recovers poor gentleman he will very likely not suffer though for the doctor says he will never go out of this house alive adeline now spoke to a man who stood near and desiring he would tell the hostess she wished to speak with her left the place  in about ten minutes the landlady appeared alas mademoiselle said she your brother is in a sad condition they fear he will not get over it adeline inquired whether there was any other medical person in the town than the surgeon whom she had seen lord madam this is a rare healthy place we have little need of medicine people here such an accident never happened in it before the doctor has been here ten years but there is very bad encouragement for his trade and i believe he is poor enough himself one of the sorts quite enough for us adeline interrupted her to ask some questions concerning theodore whom the hostes had attended to his chamber she inquired how he had borne the dressing of the wound and whether he appeared to be easier after the operation questions to which the hostess gave no very satisfactory answers she now inquired whether there was any surgeon in the neighborhood of the town and was told there was not  the distress visible in adelines countenance seemed to excite the compassion of the landlady who now endeavored to console her in the best manner she was able she advised her to send for her friends and offered to procure a messenger adeline sighed and said it was unnecessary i dont know maamselle what you may think necessary continued the hostess but i know i should think it very hard to die in a strange place with no relations near me and i dare say the poor gentleman thinks so himself and besides who is to pay for his funeral if he dies adeline begged she would be silent and desiring that every proper attention might be given she promised her a reward for her trouble and requested pen and ink immediately ay to be sure maamselle that is the proper way why your friends would never forgive you if you did not acquaint them i know it by myself and as for taking care of him he shall have every thing the house affords and i warrant there is never a better inn in the province though the town is none of the biggest adeline was obliged to repeat her request for pen and ink before the loquacious hostess would quit the room  the thought of sending for theodores friends had in the tumult of the late scenes never occurred to her and she was now somewhat consoled by the prospect of comfort which it opened for him when the pen and ink were brought she wrote the following note to theodore  in your present condition you have need of every comfort that can be procured you and surely there is no cordial more valuable in illness than the presence of a friend suffer me therefore to acquaint your family with your situation it will be a satisfaction to me and i doubt not a consolation to you  in a short time after she had sent the note she received a message from theodore entreating most respectfully but earnestly to see her for a few minutes she immediately went to his chamber and found her worst apprehensions confirmed by the languor expressed in his countenance while the shock she received together with her struggle to disguise her emotions almost overcame her i thank you for this goodness said he extending his hand which she received and sitting down by the bed burst into a flood of tears when her agitation had somewhat subsided and removing her handkerchief from her eyes she again looked on theodore a smile of the tenderest love expressed his sense of the interest she took in his welfare and administered a temporary relief to her heart  forgive this weakness said she my spirits have of late been so variously agitated  theodore interrupted her  these tears are most flattering to my heart but for my sake endeavor to support yourself i doubt not i shall soon be better the surgeon   i do not like him said adeline but tell me how you find yourself he assured her that he was now much easier than he had yet been and mentioning her kind note he led to the subject on account of which he had solicited to see her my family said he reside at a great distance from hence and i well know their affection is such that were they informed of my situation no consideration however reasonable could prevent their coming to my assistance but before they can arrive their presence will probably be unnecessary adeline looked earnestly at him i should probably be well pursued he smiling before a letter could reach them it would therefore occasion them unnecessary pain and moreover a fruitless journey for your sake adeline i could wish they were here but a few days will more fully show the consequences of my wound let us wait at least till then and be directed by circumstances  adeline forbore to press the subject farther and turned to one more immediately interesting i much wish said she that you had a more able surgeon you know the geography of the province better than i do are we in the neighborhood ofany town likely to afford you other advice  i believe not said he and this is an affair of little consequence for my wound is so inconsiderable that a very moderate share of skill may suffice to cure it but why my beloved adeline do you give way to this anxiety why suffer yourself to be disturbed by this tendency to forbode the worst i am willing perhaps presumptuously so to attribute it to your kindness and suffer me to assure you that while it excites my gratitude it increases my tenderest esteem o adeline since you wish my speedy recovery let me see you composed while i believe you to be unhappy i cannot be well  she assured him she would endeavor to be at least tranquil and fearing the conversation if prolonged would be prejudicial to him she left him to repose  as she turned cut of the gallery she met the hostess upon whom certain words of adeline had operated as a talisman transforming neglect and impertinence into officious civility she came to enquire whether the gentleman above stairs had every thing that he liked for she was sure it was her endeavor that he should i have got him a nurse maamselle to attend him and i dare say she will do very well but i will look to that for i shall not mind helping him myself some times poor gentleman how patiently he bears it one would not think now that he believes he is going to die yet the doctor told him so himself or at least as good adeline was extremely shocked at this imprudent conduct of the surgeon and dismissed the landlady after ordering a slight dinner  toward evening the surgeon again made his appearance and having passed some time with his patient returned to the parlour according to the desire of adeline to inform her of his condition he answered adelines inquiries with great solemnity it is impossible to determine positively at present madam but i have reason to adhere to the opinion i gave you this morning i am not apt indeed to form opinions upon uncertain grounds i will give you a singular instance of this  it is not above a fortnight since i was sent for to a patient at some leagues distance i was from home when the messenger arrived and the case being urgent before i could reach the patient another physician was consulted who had ordered such medicines as he thought proper and the patient had been apparently relieved by them his friends were congratulating themselves upon his improvement when i arrived and had agreed in opinion with the physician that there was no danger in his case depend upon it said i you are mistaken these medicines cannot have relieved him the patient is in the utmost danger the patient groaned but my brother physician persisted in affirming that the remedies he had prescribed would not only be certain but speedy some good effect having been already produced by them upon this i lost all patience and adhering to my opinion that these effects were fallacious and the case desperate i assured the patient himself that his life was in the utmost danger i am not one of those madam who deceive their patients to the last moment but you shall hear the conclusion  my brother physician was i suppose enraged by the firmness of my opposition for he assumed a most angry look which did not in the least affect me and turning to the patient desired he would decide upon which of our opinions to rely for he must decline acting with me the patient did me the honor pursued the surgeon with a smile of complacency and smoothing his ruffles to think more highly of me than perhaps i deserved for he immediately dismissed my opponent i could not have believed said he as the physician left the room i could not have believed that a man who has been so many in the profession could be so wholly ignorant of it  i could not have believed it either said i  i am astonished that he was not aware of my danger resumed the patient  i am astonished likewise replied i  i was resolved to do what i could for the patient for he was a man of understanding as you perceive and i had a regard for him i therefore altered the prescriptions and myself administered the medicines but all would not do my opinion was verified and he died even before the next morning  adeline who had been compelled to listen to this long story sighed at the conclusion of it i dont wonder that you are affected madam said the surgeon the instance i have related is certainly a very affecting one it distressed me so much that it was some time before i could think or even speak concerning it but you must allow madam continued he lowering his voice and bowing with a look of self congratulation that this was a striking instance of the infallibility of my judgment  adeline shuddered at the infallibility of his judgment and made no reply it was a shocking thing for the poor man resumed the surgeon  it was indeed very shocking said adeline  it affected me a good deal when it happened continued he  undoubtedly sir said adeline  but time wears away the most painful impressions  i think you mentioned it was about a fortnight since this happened  somewhere thereabouts replied the surgeon without seeming to understand the observation  and will you permit me sir to ask the name of the physician who so ignorantly opposed you  certainly madam it is lafance  he lives in the obscurity he deserves no doubt said adeline  why no madam he lives in a town of some note at about the distance of four leagues from hence and affords one instance among many others that the public opinion is generally erroneous you will hardly believe it but i assure you it is a fact that this man comes into a great deal of practice while i am suffered to remain here neglected and indeed very little known  during his narrative adeline had been considering by what means she could discover the name of the physician for the instance that had been produced to prove his ignorance and the infallibility of his opponent had completely settled her opinion concerning them both she now more than ever wished to deliver theodore from the hands of the surgeon and was musing on the possibility when he with so much selfsecurity developed the means  she asked him a few more questions concerning the state of theodores wound and was told it was much as it had been but that some degree of fever had come on but i have ordered a fire to be made in the room continued the surgeon and some additional blankets to be laid on the bed these i doubt not will have a proper effect in the mean time they must be careful to keep from him every kind of liquid except some cordial draughts which i shall send he will naturally ask for drink but it must on no account be given to him  you do not approve then of the method which i have somewhere heard of said adeline of attending to nature in these cases  nature madam pursued he nature is the most improper guide in the world i always adopt a method directly contrary to what she would suggest for what can be the use of art if she is only to follow nature this was my first opinion on setting out in life and i have ever since strictly adhered to it from what i have said indeed madam you may perhaps perceive that my opinions may be depended on what they once are they always are for my mind is not of that frivolous kind to be affected by circumstances  adeline was fatigued by this discourse and impatient to impart to theodore her discovery of a physician but the surgeon seemed by no means disposed to leave her and was expatiating upon various topics with new instances of his surprising sagacity when the waiter brought a message that some person desired to see him he was however engaged upon too agreeable a topic to be easily prevailed upon to quit it and it was not till after a second message was brought that he made his bow to adeline and left the room the moment he was gone she sent a note to theodore entreating his permission to call in the assistance of the physician  the conceited manners of the surgeon had by this time given theodore a very unfavourable opinion of his talents and the last prescription had so fully confirmed it that he now readily consented to have other advice  adeline immediately inquired for a messenger but recollecting that the residence of the physician was still a secret she applied to the hostess who being really ignorant of it or pretending to be so gave her no information what farther inquiries she made were equally ineffectual and she passed some hours in extreme distress while the disorder of theodore rather increased than abated  when supper appeared she asked the boy who waited if he knew a physician of the name of lafance in the neighborhood not in the neighborhood madam but i know doctor lafance of chancy for i come from the town  adeline inquired farther and received very satisfactory answers but the town was at some leagues distance and the delay this circumstance must oceasion again alarmed her she however ordered a messenger to be immediately dispatched and having sent again to inquire concerning theodore retired to her chamber for the night  the continued fatigue she had suffered for the last fourteen hours overcame anxiety and her harrassed spirits sunk to repose she slept till late in the morning and was then awakened by the landlady who came to inform her that theodore was much worse and to inquire what should be done adeline finding that the physician was not arrived immediately arose and hastened to inquire farther concerning theodore the hostess informed her that he had passed a very disturbed night that he had complained of being very hot and desired that the fire in his room might be extinguished but that the nurse knew her duty too well to obey him and had strictly followed the doctors orders  she added that he had taken the cordial draughts regularly but had not withstanding continued to grow worse and at last became lightheaded in the mean time the boy who had been sent for the physician was still absent  and no wonder continued the hostess why only consider it is eight leagues off and the lad had to find the road bad as it is in the dark but indeed maamselle you might as well have trusted our doctor for we never want any body else not we in the town here and if i might speak my mind jacques had better have been sent off for the young gentlemans friends than for this strange doctor that no body knows  after asking some farther questions concerning theodore the answers to which rather increased than diminished her alarm adeline endeavored to compose her spirits and await in patience the arrival of the physician she was now more sensible than ever of the forlornness of her own condition and of the danger of theodores and earnestly wished that his friends could be informed of his situation a wish which could not be gratified for theodore who alone could acquaint her with their place of residence was deprived of recollection  when the surgeon arrived and perceived the situation of his patient he expressed no urprize but having asked some questions and given a few general directions he went down to adeline after paying her his usual compliments he suddenly assumed an air of importance i am sorry madam said he that it is my office to communicate disagreeable intelligence but i wish you to be prepared for the event which i fear is approaching adeline comprehended his meaning and though she had hitherto given little faith to his judgment she could not hear him hint at the immediate danger of theodore without yielding to the influence of fear  she entreated him to acquaint her with all he apprehended and he then proceeded to say that theodore was as he had foreseen much worse this morning than he had been the preceding night and the disorder having now affected his head there was every reason to fear it would prove fatal in a few hours the worst consequences may ensue continued he if the wound becomes inflamed there will be very little chance of his recovery  adeline listened to this sentence with a dreadful calmness and gave no utterance to grief either by words or tears the gentleman i suppose madam has friends and the sooner you inform them of his condition the better if they reside at any distance it is indeed too late but there are other necessary  you are ill madam  adedeline made an effort to speak but in vain and the surgeon now called loudly for a glass of water she drank it and a deep sigh that she uttered seemed somewhat to relieve her oppressed heart tears succeeded in the mean time the surgeon perceiving she was better though not well enough to listen to his conversation took his leave and promised to return in an hour the physician was not yet arrived and adeline awaited his appearance with a mixture of fear and anxious hope  about noon he came and having been informed of the accident by which the fever was produced and of the treatment which the surgeon had given it he ascended to theodores chamber in a quarter of an hour he returned to the room where adeline expected him the gentleman is still delirious said he but i have ordered him a composing draught  is there any hope sir inquired adeline yes madam certainly there is hope the case at present is somewhat doubtful but a few hours may enable me to judge with more certainty in the mean time i have directed that he shall be kept quiet and be allowed to drink freely of some diluting liquids  he had scarcely at adelines request recommended a surgeon instead of the one at present employed when the latter gentleman entered the room and perceiving the physician threw a glance of mingled surprise and anger at adeline who retired with him to another apartment where she dismissed him with a politeness which he did not deign to return and which he certainly did not deserve  early the following morning the surgeon arrived but either the medicines or the crisis of the disorder had thrown theodore into a deep sleep in which he remained for several hours the physician now gave adeline reason to hope for a fevourable issue and every precaution was taken to prevent his being disturbed he awoke perfectly sensible and free from fever and his first words inquired for adeline who soon learned that he was out of danger  in a few days he was sufficiently recovered to be removed from his chamber to a room adjoining where adeline met him with a joy which she found it impossible to repress and the observance of this lighted up his countenance with pleasure indeed adeline sensible to the attachment he had so nobly testified and softened by the danger he had encountered no longer attempted to disguise the tenderness of her esteem and was at length brought to confess the interest his first appearance had impressed upon her heart  after an hour of affecting conversation in which the happiness of a young and mutual attachment occupied all their minds and excluded every idea not in unison with delight they returned to a sense of their present embarrassments adeline recollected that theodore was arrested for disobedience of orders and deserting his post and theodore that he must shortly be torn away from adeline who would be left exposed to all the evils from which he had so lately rescued her this thought overwhelmed his heart with anguish and after a long pause he ventured to propose what his wishes had often suggested a marriage with adeline before he departed from the village this was the only means of preveting perhaps an eternal saparation and though he saw the many dangerous inconveniences to which she would be exposed by a marriage with a man circumstanced like himself yet these appeared so unequal to those she would otherwise he left to encounter alone that his reason could no longer scruple to adopt what his affection had suggested  adeline was for some time too much agitated to reply and though she had little to oppose to the arguments and pleadings of theodore though she had no friends to control and no contrariety of interests to perplex her she could not bring herself to consent thus hastily to a marriage with a man of whom she had little knowledge and to whose family and connections she had no sort of introduction at length she entreated he would drop the subject and the conversation for the remainder of the day was more general yet still interesting  that similarity of taste and opinion which had at first attracted them every moment now more fully disclosed their discourse was enriched by elegant literature and endeared by mutual regard adeline had enjoyed few opportunities of reading but the books to which she had access operating upon a mind eager for knowledge and upon a taste peculiarly sensible of the beautiful and the elegant had impressed all their excellencies upon her understanding theodore had received from nature many of the qualities of genius and from education all that it could bestow to these were added a noble independency of spirit a feeling heart and manners which partook of a happy mixture of dignity and sweetness  in the evening one of the officers who upon the representation of the sergeant was sent by the persons employed to prosecute military criminals arrived at the village and entering the apartment of theodore from which adeline immediately withdrew informed him with an air of infinite importance that he should set out on the following day for headquarters theodore answered that he was not able to bear the journey and referred him to his physician but the officer replied that he should take no such trouble it being certain that the physician might be instructed what to say and that he should begin his journey on the morrow here has been delay enough said he already and you will have sufficient business on your hands when you reach headquarters for the sergeant whom you have severely wounded intends to appear against you and this with the offense you have committed by deserting your post  theodores eyes flashed fire deserting said he rising from his seat and darting a look of menace at his accuser who dares to brand me with the name of deserter but instantly recollecting how much his conduct had appeared to justify the accusation he endeavored to stifle his emotions and with a firm voice and composed manner said that when he reached headquarters he should beready to answer whatever might be brought against him but that till then he should be silent the boldness of the officer was repressed by the spirit and dignity with which theodore spoke these words and muttering a reply that was scarcely audible he left the room  theodore sat musing on the danger of his situation he knew that he had much to apprehend from the peculiar circumstances attending his abrupt departure from his regiment it having been stationed in a garrison town upon the spanish frontiers where the discipline was very severe and from the power of his colonel the marquis de montalt whom pride and disappointment would now rouse to vengeance and probably render indefatigable in the accomplishment of his destruction but his thoughts soon fled from his own danger to that of adeline and in the consideration of this all his fortitude forsook him he could not support the idea of leaving her exposed to the evils he foreboded nor indeed of a separation so sudden as that which now threatened him and when she again entered the room he renewed his solicitations for a speedy marriage with all the arguments that tenderness and ingenuity could suggest  adeline when she learned that he was to depart on the morrow felt as if bereaved of her last comfort all the horrors of his situation arose to her mind and she turned from him in unutterable anguish considering her silence as a favorable presage he repeated his entreaties that she would consent to be his and thus give him a surety that their separation should not be eternal adeline sighed deeply to these words and who can know that our separation will not be eternal said she even if i could consent to the marriage you propose but while you hear my determination forbear to accuse me of indifference for indifference toward you would indeed be a crime after the services you have rendered me  and is a cold sentiment of gratitude all that i must expect from you said theodore i know that you are going to distress me with a proof of your indifference which you mistake for the suggestions of prudence and that i shall be compelled to look without reluctance upon the evils that may shortly await me ah adeline if you mean to reject this perhaps the last proposal which i can ever make to you cease at least to deceive yourself with an idea that you love me that delirium is fading even from my mind  can you then so soon forg t our conversation of this morning replied adeline and can you think so lightly of me as to believe i would profess a regard which i do not feel if indeed you can believe this i shall do well to forget that i ever made such an acknowledgement and you that you heard it  forgive me adeline forgive the doubts and inconsistencies i have betrayed let the anxieties of love and the emergency of my circumstances plead for me adeline smiling faintly through her tears held out her hand which he seized and pressed to his lips yet do not drive me to despair by a rejection of my suit continued theodore think what i must suffer to leave you here destitute of friends and protection  i am thinking how i may avoid a situation so deplorable said adeline they say there is a convent which receives boarders within a few miles and thither i wish to go  a convent rejoined theodore would you go to a convent do you know the persecutions you would be liable to and that if the marquis should discover you there is little probability the superior would resist his authority or at least his bribes  all this i have considered said adeline and am prepared to encounter it rather than enter into an engagement which at this time can be productive only of misery to us both  ah adeline could you think thus if you truly loved i see myself about to be separated and that perhaps for ever from the object of my tenderest affections  and i cannot but express all the anguish i feel  i cannot forbear to repeat every argument that may afford even the slightest possibility of altering your determination but you adeline you look with complacency upon a circumstance which tortures me with despair adeline who had long strove to support her spirits in his presence while she adhered to a reolution which reason suggested but which the pleadings of her heart powerfully opposed was unable longer to command her distress and burst into tears theodore was in the same moment convinced of his error and shocked at the grief he had occasioned he drew his chair toward her and taking her hand again entreated her pardon and endeavored in the tenderest accents to soothe and comfort her  what a wretch was i to cause you this distress by questioning that with regard which i can no longer doubt you honor me forgive me adeline say but you forgive me and whatever may be the pain of this separation i will no longer oppose it  you have given me some pain said adeline but you have not offended me  she then mentioned some farther particulars concerning the convent theodore endeavored to conceal the distress which the approaching separation occasioned him and to consult with her on these plans with composure his judgment by degrees prevailed over his passions and he now perceived that the plan she suggested would afford her best chance of security he considered what in the first agitation of his mind had escaped him that he might be condemned upon the charges brought against him and that his death should they have been married would not only deprive her of her protector but leave her more immediately exposed to the designs of the marquis who would doubtless attend his trial astonished that he had not noticed this before and shocked at the unwariness by which he might have betrayed her into so dangerous a situation he became at once reconciled to the idea of leaving her in a convent he could have wished to place her in the asylum of his own family but the circumstances under which she must be introduced were so awkward and painful and above all the distance at which they resided would render a journey so highly dangerous for her that he forbore to propose it he entreated only that she would allow him to write to her but recollecting that his letters might be a means of betraying the place of her residence to the marquis he checked himself i must deny myself even this melancholy pleasure said he lest my letters should discover your abode yet how shall i be able to endure the impatience and uncertainty to which prudence condemns me if you are in danger i shall be ignorant of it though indeed did i know it said he with a look of despair i could not fly to save you o exquisite misery it is now only i perceive all the horrors of confinement  it is now only that i understand all the value of liberty  his utterance was interrupted by the violent agitation of his mind he rose from his chair and walked with quick paces about the room adeline sat overcome by the description which theodore had given of his approaching situation and by the consideration that she might remain in the most terrible suspense concerning his fate she saw him in a prison  pale  emaciated and in chains  she saw all the vengeance of the marquis descending upon him and this for his noble exertions in her cause theodore alarmed by the placid despair expressed in her countenance threw himself into a chair by here is and taking her hand attempted to speak comfort to her but the words faltered on his lips and he could only bathe her hand with tears  this mournful silence was interrupted by the arrival of the carriage at the inn and theodore arising went to the window that opened into the yard the darkness of the night prevented his distinguishing the objects without but a light now brought from the house showed him a carriage and four attended by several servants presently he saw a gentleman wrapped up in a roquelaure alight and enter the inn and in the next moment he heard the voice of the marquis  he had slown to support adeline who was sinking with terror when the door opened and the marquis followed by the officers and several servants entered fury flashed from his eyes as they glanced upon theodore who hung over adeline with a look of fearful solicitude  seize that traitor said he turning to the officers why have you suffered him to remain here so long  i am no traitor said theodore with a firm voice and the dignity of conscious worth but a defender of innocence of one whom the treacherous marquis de montalt would destroy  obey your orders said the marquis to the officers adeline shrieked held faster by theodores arm and entreated the men not to part them force only can effect it said theodore as he looked round for some instrument of defense but he could see none and in the same moment they surrounded and seized him dread every thing from my vengeance said the marquis to theodore as he caught the hand of adeline who had lost all power of resistance and was scarcely sensible of what passed dread every thing from my vengeance you know you have deserved it  i defy your vengeance cried theodore and dread only the pangs of conscience which your power cannot inflict upon me though your vices condemn you to its tortures  take him instantly from the room and see that he is strongly fettered said the marquis he shall soon know what a criminal who adds insolence to guilt may suffer  theodore exclaiming oh adeline farewell was now forced out of the room while adeline whose torpid senses were roused by his voice and his last looks fell at the feet of the marquis and with tears of agony implored compassion for theodore but her pleadings for his rival served only to irritate the pride and exasperate the hatred of the marquis he denounced vengeance on his head and imprecations too dreadful for the spirits of adeline whom he compelled to rise and then endeavoring to stifle the emotlons of rage which the presence of theodore had excited he began to address her with his usual expressions of admiration  the wretched adeline who regardless of what he said still continued to plead for her unhappy lover was at length alarmed by the returning rage which the countenance of the marquis expressed and exerting all her remaining strength she sprung from his grasp toward the door of the room but he seized her hand before she could reach it and regardless of her shrieks bringing her back to her chair was going to speak when voices were heard in the passage and immediately the landlord and his wife whom adelines cries had alarmed entered the apartment the marquis turning furiously to them demanded what they wanted but not waiting for their answer he bade them attend him and quitting the room she heard the door locked upon her  adeline now ran to the windows which were unfastened and opened into the inn yard all was dark and silent she called aloud for help but no person appeared and the windows were so high that it was impossible to escape unassisted she walked about the room in an agony of terror and distress now stopping to listen and fancying she heard voices disputing below and now quickening her steps as suspense increased the agitation of her mind  she had continued in this state for near half an hour when she suddenly heard a violent noise in the lower part of the house which increased till all was uproar and confusion people passed quickly through the passages and doors were frequently opened and shut she called but received no answer it immediately occurred to her that theodore having heard her screams had attempted to come to her assistance and that the bustle had been occasioned by the opposition of the officers knowing their fierceness and cruelty she was seized with dreadful apprehensions for the life of theodore  a confused uproar of voices now sounded from below and the screams of women convinced her there was fighting she even thought she heard the clashing of swords the image of theodore dying by the hands of the marquis now rose to her imagination and the terrors of suspense became almost insupportable she made a desperate effort to force the door and again called for help but her trembling hands were powerless and every person in the house seemed to be too much engaged even to hear her a loud shriek now pierced her ears and amidst the tumult that followed she clearly distinguished deep groans this confirmation of her fears deprived her of all her remaining spirits and growing faint she sunk almost lifeless into a chair near the door the uproar gradually subsided till all was still but nobody returned to her soon after she heard voices in the yard but she had no power to walk across the room even to ask the questions she wished yet seared to have answered  about a quarter of an hour elapsed when the door was unlocked and the hostess appeared with a countenanee as pale as death for gods sake said adeline tell me what has happened is he wounded is he killed  he is not dead maamselle but   he is dying then  tell me where he is  let me go  stop maamselle cried the hostess you are to stay here i only want the hartshorn out of that cupboard there adeline tried to escape by the door but the hostess pushing her aside locked it and went down stairs  adelines distress now entirely overcame her and she sat motionless and scarcely conscious that she existed till roused by a sound of footsteps near the door which was again opened and three men whom she knew to be the marquiss servants entered she had sufficient recollection to repeat the questions she had asked the landlady but they answered only that she must come with them and that a chaise was waiting for her at the door still she urged her questions tell me if he lives cried she  yes maamselle he is alive but he is terribly wounded and the surgeon is just come to him as they spoke they hurried her along the passage and without noticing her entreaties and supplications to know whither she was going they had reached the foot of the stairs when her cries brought several people to the door to these the hostess related that the lady was the wife of a gentleman just arrived who had overtaken her in her slight with a gallant and account which the marquiss servants corroborated it is the gentleman who has just fought the duel added the hostess and it was on her account  adeline partly disdaining to take any notice of this artful story and partly from her desire to know the particulars of what had happened contented herself with repeating her inquiries to which one of the spectators at last replied that the gentleman was desperately wounded the marquiss people would now have hurried her into the chaise but she sunk lifeless in their arms and her condition so interested the humanity of the spectators that notwithstanding their belief of what had been said they opposed the effort made to carry her senseless as she was into the carriage  she was at length taken into a room and by proper applications restored to her senses there she so earnestly besought an explanation of what had happened that the hostess acquainted her with some particulars of the late rencounter when the gentleman that was ill heard your screams madam said she he became quite outrageous as they tell me and nothing could pacify him the marquis for they say he is a marquis but you know best was then in the room with my husband and i and when he heard the uproar he went down to see what was the matter and when he came into the room where the captain was he found him struggling with the sergeant then the captain was more outrageous than ever and notwithstanding he had one leg chained and no sword he contrived to get the serjeants cutlass out of the scabbard and immediately flew at the marquis and wounded him desperately upon which he was secured  it is the marquis then who is wounded said adeline the other gentleman is not hurt  no not he replied the hostess but he will smart for it by and bye for the marquis swears he will do for him adeline for a moment forgot all her misfortunes and all her danger in thankfulness for the immediate escape of theodore and she was proceeding to make some farther inquiries concerning him when the marquiss servants entered the room and declared they could wait no longer adeline now awakened to a sense of the evils with which she was threatened endeavored to win the pity of the hostess who however was or affected to be convinced of the truth of the marquiss story and therefore insensible to all she could urge again she addressed his servants but in vain they would neither suffer her to remain longer at the inn or inform her whither she was going but in the presence of several persons already prejudiced by the injurious assertions of the hostess adeline was hurried into the chaise and her conductors mounting their horses the whole party was very soon beyond the village  thus ended adelines share of an adventure begun with a prospect not only of security but of happiness an adventure which had attached her more closely to theodore and shown him to be more worthy of her love but which at the same time had distressed her by new disappointment produced the imprisonment of her generous and nowadored lover and delivered both himself and her into the power of a rival irritated by delay contempt and opposition  chapter xii nor sea nor shade nor shield nor rock nor cave nor silent deserts nor the sullen grave where flameeyd fury means to frown  can save  the surgeon of the place having examined the marquiss wound gave him an immediate opinion upon it and ordered that he should be put to bed but the marquis ill as he was had scarcely any other apprehension than that of losing adeline and declared he should be able to begin his journey in a few hours with this intention he had began to give orders for keeping horses in readiness when the surgeon persisting most seriously and even passionately to exclaim that his life would be the sacrifice of his rashness he was carried to a bedchamber where his valet alone was permitted to attend him  this man the convenient confidant of all his intrigues had been the chief instrument in assisting his designs concerning adeline and was indeed the very person who had brought her to the marquiss villa on the borders of the forest to him the marquis gave his farther directions concerning her and foreseeing the inconvenience as well as the danger of detaining her at the inn he had ordered him with several other servants to carry her away immediately in a hired carriage the valet having gone to execute his orders the marquis was left to his own reflections and to the violence of contending passions  the reproaches and continued opposition of theodore the favored lover of adeline exasperated his pride and roused all his malice he could not for a moment consider this opposition which was in some respects successful without feeling an excess of indignation and inveteracy such as the prospect of a speedy revenge could alone enable him to support  when he had discovered adelines escape from the villa his surprise at first equalled his disappointment and after exhausting the paroxysms of his rage upon his domestics he dispatched them all different ways in pursuit of her going himself to the abbey in the faint hope that destitute as she was of other succor she might have fled thither la motte however being as much surprised as himself and as ignorant of the route which adeline had taken he returned to the villa impatient of intelligence and found some of his servants arrived without any news of adeline and those who came afterward were as successless as the first  a few days after a letter from the lieutenant colonel of the regiment informed him that theodore had quitted his company and had been for some time absent nobody knew where this information confirming a suspicion which ad frequently occurred to him that theodore had been by some means or other instrumental in the escape of adeline all his other passions became for a time subservient to his revenge and he gave orders for the immediate pursuit and apprehension of theodore but theodore in the mean time had been overtaken and secured  it was in consequence of having formerly observed the growing partiality between him and adeline and of intelligence received from la motte who had noticed their interview in the forest that the marquis had resolved to remove a rival so dangerous to his love and so likely to be informed of his designs he had therefore told theodore in a manner as plausible as he could that it would be necessary for him to join the regiment a notice which affected him only as it related to adeline and which seemed the less extraordinary as he had already been at the villa a much longer time than was usual with the officers invited by the marquis theodore indeed very well knew the character of the marquis and had accepted his invitation rather from an unwillingness to show any disrespect to his colonel by a refusal than from a sanguine expectation of pleasure  from the men who had apprehended theodore the marquis received the information which had enabled him to pursue and recover adeline but though he had now effected this he was internally a prey to the corrosive effects of disappointed passion and exasperated pride the anguish of his wound was almost forgotten in that of his mind and every pang he felt seemed to increase his thirst of revenge and to recoil with new torture upon his heart while he was in this state he heard the voice of the innocent adeline imploring protection but her cries excited in him neither pity or remorse and when soon after the carriage drove away and he was certain both that she was secured and theodore was wretched he seemed to feel some cessation of mental pain  theodore indeed did suffer all that a virtuous mind laboring under oppression so severe could feel but he was at least free from those inveterate and malignant passions which tore the bosom of the marquis and which inflict upon the possessor a punishment more severe than any they can prompt him to imagine for another what indignation he might feel toward the marquis was at this time secondary to his anxiety for adeline his captivity was painful as it prevented his seeking a just and honorable revenge but it was dreadful as it withheld him from attempting the rescue of her whom he loved more than life  when he heard the wheels of the carriage that contained her drive off he felt an agony of despair which almost overcame his reason even the stern hearts of the soldiers who attended him were not wholly insensible to his wretchedness and by venturing to blame the conduct of the marquis they endeavored to console their prisoner the physician who was just arrived entered the room during this paroxysm of his distress and both feeling and expressing much concern at his condition inquired with strong surprise why he had been thus precipitately removed to a room so very unfit for his reception  theodore explained to him the reason of this of the distress he suffered and of the chains by which he was disgraced and perceiving the physician listened to him with attention and compassion he became desirous of acquainting him with some farther particulars for which purpose he desired the soldiers to leave the room the men complying with his request stationed themselves on the outside of the door  he then related all the particulars of the late transaction and of his connection with the marquis the physician attended to his narrative with deep concern and his countenance frequently expressed strong agitation when theodore concluded he remained for some time silent and lost in thought at length awaking from his reverie he said i fear your situation is desperate the character of the marquis is too well known to suffer him either to be loved or respected from such a man you have nothing to hope for he has scarcely any thing to fear i wish it was in my power to serve you but i see no possibility of it  alas said theodore my situation is indeed desperate and  for that suffering angel  deep sobs interrupted his voice and the violence of his agitation would not allow him to proceed the physician could only express the sympathy he felt for his distress and entreat him to be more calm when a servant entered the room from the marquis who desired to see the physician immediately after some time he said he would attend the marquis and having endeavored to attain a degree of composure which he found it difficult to assume he wrung the hand of theodore and quitted the room promising to return before he left the house  he found the marquis much agitated both in body and mind and rather more apprehensive for the consequences of the wound than he had expected his anxiety for theodore now suggested a plan by the execution of which he hoped he might be able to serve him having felt his patients pulse and asked some questions he assumed a very serious look when the marquis who watched every turn of his countenance desired he would without hesitation speak his opinion  i am sorry to alarm you my lord but here is some reason for apprehension how long is it since you received the wound  good god there is danger then cried the marquis adding some bitter execrations against theodore  there certainly is danger replied the physician a few hours may enable me to determine its degree  a few hours sir interrupted the marquis a few hours the physician entreated him to be more calm confusion cried the marquis a man in health may with great composure entreat a dying man to be calm theodore will be broke upon the wheel for it however  you mistake me sir said the physician if i believe you a dying man or indeed very near death i should not have spoken as i did but it is of consequence i should know how long the wound has been inflicted the marquiss terror now began to subside and he gave a circumstantial account of the affray with theodore representing that he had been basely used in an affair where his own conduct had been perfectly just and humane the physician heard this relation with great coolness and when it concluded without making any comment upon it told the marquis he would prescribe a medicine which he wished him to take immediately  the marquis again alarmed by the gravity of his manner entreated he would declare most seriously whether he thought him in immediate danger the physician hesitated and the anxiety of the marquis increased it is of consequence said he that i should know my exact situation the physician then said that if he had any worldly affairs to settle it would be as well to attend to them for that it was impossible to say what might be the event  he then turned the discourse and said he had just been with the young officer under arrest who he hoped would not be removed at present as such a procedure must endanger his life the marquis uttered a dreadful oath and cursing theodore for having brought him to his present condition said he should depart with the guard that very night against the cruelty of this sentence the physician ventured to expostulate and endeavoring to awaken the marquis to a sense of humanity pleaded earnestly for theodore but these entreaties and arguments seemed by displaying to the marquis a part of his own character to rouse his resentment and rekindle all the violence of his passions  the physician at length withdrew in despondency after promising at the marquiss request not to leave the inn he had hoped by aggravating his danger to obtain some advantages both for adeline and theodore but the plan had quite a contrary effect for the apprehension of death so dreadful to the guilty mind of the marquis instead of awakening penitence increased his desire of vengeance against the man who had brought him to such a situation he determined to have adeline conveyed where theodore should he by any accident escape could never obtain her and thus to secure to himself at least some means of revenge he knew however that when theodore was once safely conveyed to his regiment his destruction was certain for should he even be acquitted of the intentention of deserting he would be condemned for having assaulted his superior officer  the physician returned to the room where theodore was confined the violence of his distress was now subsided into a stern despair more dreadful than the vehemence which had lately possessed him the guard in compliance with his request having left the room the phyician repeated to him some part of his conversation with the marquis theodore after expressing his thanks said he had nothing more to hope for himself he felt little it was for his family and for adeline he suffered he enquired what route she had taken and though he had no prospect of deriving advantage from the information desired the physician to assist him in obtaining it but the landlord and his wife either were or affected to be ignorant of the matter and it was in vain to apply to any other person  the sergeant now entered with orders from the marquis for the immediate departure of theodore who heard the message with composure though the physician could not help expressing his indignation at this precipitate removal and his dread of the consequences that might attend it theodore had scarcely time to declare his gratitude for the kindness of this valuable friend before the soldiers entered the room to conduct him to the carriage in waiting as he bade him farewell theodore slipped his purse into his hand and turning abruptly away told the soldiers to lead on but the physician stopped him and refused the present with such serious warmth that he was compelled to resume it he wrung the hand of his new friend and being unable to speak hurried away the whole party immediately set off and the unhappy theodore was left to the remembrance of his past hopes and sufferings to his anxiety for the fate of adeline the contemplation of his present wretchedness and the apprehension of what might be reserved for him in future for himself indeed he saw nothing but destruction and was only relieved from total despair by a feeble hope that she whom he loved better than himself might one time enjoy that happiness of which he did not venture to look for a participation  chapter xiii have you the heart when your head did but ach  i knit my handkerchief about your brows and with my hand at midnight held up your head and like the watchful minutes to the hour still and anon cheered up the heavy time king john if the midnight bell did with his iron tongue and brazen mouth sound one unto the drowsy race of night if this same were a churchyard where we stand and thou possessed with a thousand wrongs or if that surly spirit melancholy had baked thy blood and made it heavy thick then in despite of broadeyed watchful day i would into thy bosom pour my thoughts king john meanwhile the persecuted adeline continued to travel with little interruption all night her mind suffered such a tumult of grief regret despair and terror that she could not be said to think the marquiss valet who had placed himself in the chaise with her at first seemed inclined to talk but her inattention soon silenced him and left her to the indulgence of her own misery  they seemed to travel through obscure lanes and byeways along which the carriage drove as furiously as the darkness would permit when the dawn appeared she perceived herself on the borders of a forest and renewed her entreaties to know whither she was going the man replied he had no orders to tell but she would soon see adeline who had hitherto supposed they were carrying her to the villa now began to doubt it and as every place appeared less terrible to her imagination than that her despair began to abate and she thought only of the devoted theodore whom she knew to be the victim of malice and revenge  they now entered upon the forest and it occurred to her that she was going to the abbey for though she had no remembrance of the scenery through which she passed it was not the less probable that this was the forest of fontangville whose boundaries were by much too extensive to have come within the circle of her former walks this conjecture revived a terror little inferior to that occasioned by the idea of going to the villa for at the abbey she would be equally in the power of the marquis and also in that of her cruel enemy la motte her mind revolted at the picture her fancy drew and as the carriage moved under the shades she threw from the window a look of eager inquiry for some object which might confirm or destroy her present surmise she did not long look before an opening in the forest showed her the distant towers of the abbey  i am indeed lost then said she bursting into tears  they were soon at the foot of the lawn and peter was seen running to open the gate at which the carriage stopped when he saw adeline he looked surprised and made an effort to speak but the chaise now drove up to the abbey where at the door of the hall la motte himself appeared as he advanced to take her from the carriage an universal trembling seized her it was with the utmost difficulty she supported herself and for some moments she neither observed his countenance nor heard his voice he offered his arm to assist her into the abbey which she at first refused but having tottered a few paces was obliged to accept they then entered the vaulted room where sinking into a chair a flood of tears came to her relief la motte did not interrupt the silence which continued for some time but paced the room in seeming agitation when adeline was sufficiently recovered to notice external objects she observed his countenance and there read the tumult of his soul while he was struggling to assume a firmness which his better feelings opposed  la motte now took her hand and would have led her from the room but she stopped and with a kind of desperate courage made an effort to engage him to pity and to save her he interrupted her it is not in my power said he in a voice of emotion i am not master of myself or my conduct inquire no farther  it is sufficient for you to know that i pity you more i cannot do he gave her no time to reply but taking her hand led her to the stairs of the tower and from thence to the chamber she had formerly occupied  here you must remain for the present said he in a confinement which is perhaps almost as involuntary on my part as it can be on yours i am willing to render it as easy as posble and have therefore ordered some books to be brought you  adeline made an effort to speak but he hurried from the room seemingly ashamed of the part he had undertaken and unwilling to trust himself with her tears she heard the door of the chamber locked and then looking toward the windows perceived they were secured the door that led to the other apartments was also fastened such preparation for security shocked her and hopeless as she had long believed herself she now perceived her mind to sink deeper in despair when the tears she shed had somewhat relieved her and her thoughts could turn from the subjects of her immediate concern she was thankful for the total seclusion allotted her since it would spare her the pain she must feel in the presence of monsieur and madame la motte and allow the unrestrained indulgence of her own sorrow and reflection reflection which however distressing was preserable to the agony inflicted on the mind when agitated by care and fear it is obliged to assume an appearance of tranquillity  in about a quarter of an hour her chamber door was unlocked and annette appeared with refreshments and books she expressed satisfaction at seeing adeline again but seemed fearful of speaking knowing probably that it was contrary to the orders of la motte who she said was waiting at the bottom of the stairs when annette was gone adeline took some refreshment which was indeed necessary for she had tasted nothing since she left the inn she was pleased but not surprised that madame la motte did not appear who it was evident shunned her from a consciousness of her own ungenerous conduct a consciousness which offered some presumption that she was still not wholly unfriendly to her she reflected upon the words of la motte i am not master of myself or my conduct and though they afforded her no hope she derived some comfort poor as it was from the belief that he pitied her after some time spent in miserable reflection and various conjectures her longagitated spirits seemed to demand repose and she laid down to sleep  adeline slept quietly for several hours and awoke with a mind refreshed and tranquillized to prolong this temporary peace and to prevent therefore the intrusion of her own thoughts she examined the books la motte had sent her among these she found some that in happier times had elevated her mind and interested her heart their effect was now weakened they were still however able to soften for a time the sense of her misfortunes  but this lethean medicine to a wounded mind was but a temporary blessing the entrance of la motte dissolved the illusions of the page and awakened her to a sense of her own situation he came with food and having placed it on the table left the room without speaking again she endeavored to read but his appearance had broken the enchantment  bitter reflection returned to her mind and brought with it the image of theodore  of theodore lost to her for ever  la motte mean while experienced all the terrors that could be inflicted by a conscience not wholly hardened to guilt he had been led on by passion to dissipation  and from dissipation to vice but having once touched the borders of infamy the progressive steps followed each other fast and he now saw himself the pander of a villain and the betrayer of an innocent girl whom every plea of justice and humanity called upon him to protect he contemplated his picture  he shrunk from it but he could change its deformity only by an effort too nobly daring for a mind already effeminated by vice he viewed the dangerous labyrinth into which he was led and perceived as if for the first time the progression of his guilt from this labyrinth he weakly imagined farther guilt could alone extricate him instead of employing his mind upon the means of saving adeline from destruction and himself from being instrumental to it he endeavored only to lull the pangs of conscience and to persuade himself into a belief that he must proceed in the course he had begun he knew himself to be in the power of the marquis and he dreaded that power more than the sure though distant punishment that awaits upon guilt the honor of adeline and the quiet of his own conscience he consented to barter for a few years of existence  he was ignorant of the present illness of the marquis or he would have perceived that there was a chance of escaping the threatened punishment at a price less enormous than infamy and he would perhaps have endeavored to save adeline and himself by flight but the marquis foreseeing the possibility of this had ordered his servants carefully to conceal the circumstance which detained him and to acquaint la motte that he should be at the abbey in a few days at the same time directing his valet to await him there adeline as he expected had neither inclination nor opportunity to mention it and thus la motte remained ignorant of the circumstance which might have preserved him from farther guilt and adeline from misery  most unwillingly had la motte made his wife acquainted with the action which had made him absolutely dependent upon the will of the marquis but the perturbation of his mind partly betrayed him frequently in his sleep he muttered incoherent sentences and frequently would start from his slumber and call in passionate exclamation upon adeline these instances of a disturbed mind had alarmed and terrified madame la motte who watched while he slept and soon gathered from his words a confused idea of the marquiss designs  she hinted her suspicions to la motte who reproved her for having entertained them but his manner instead of repressing increased her fears for adeline fears which the conduct of the marquis soon confirmed on the night that he slept at the abbey it had occurred to her that whatever scheme was in agitation would now most probably be discussed and anxiety for adeline made her stoop to a meanness which in other circumstances would have been despicable she quitted her room and concealing herself in an apartment adjoining that in which she had left the marquis and her husband listened to their discourse it turned upon the subject she had expected and disclosed to her the full extent of their designs terrified for adeline and shocked at the guilty weakness of la motte she was for some time incapable of thinking or determining how to proceed she knew her husband to be under great obligation to the marquis whose territory thus afforded him a shelter from the world and that it was in the power of the former to betray him into the hands of his enemies she believed also that the marquis would do this if provoked yet she thought upon such an occasion la motte might find some way ofappeasing the marquis without subjecting himself to dishonor after some farther reflection her mind became more composed and she returned to her chamber where la motte soon followed her spirits however were not now in a state to encounter either his displeasure or his opposition which she had too much reason to expect whenever she should mention the subject of her concern and she therefore resolved not to notice it till the morrow  on the morrow she told la motte all he had uttered in his dreams and mentioned other circumstances which convinced him it was in vain any longer to deny the truth of her apprehensions his wife then represented to him how possible it was to avoid the infamy into which he was about to plunge by quitting the territories of the marquis and pleaded so warmly for adeline that la motte in sullen silence appeared to meditate upon the plan his thoughts were however very differently engaged he was conscious of having deserved from the marquis a dreadful punishment and knew that if he exasperated him by refusing to acquiesce with his wishes he had little to expect from flight for the eye of justice and revenge would pursue him with indefatigable research  la motte meditated how to break this to his wife for he perceived that there was no other method of counteracting her virtuous compassion for adeline and the dangerous consequences to be expected from it than by opposing it with terror for his safety and this could be done only by showing her the full extent of the evils that must attend the resentment of the marquis vice had not yet so entirely darkened his conscience but that the blush of shame stained his cheek and his tongue faltered when he would have told his guilt at length finding it impossible to mention particulars he told her that on account of an affair which no entreaties should ever induce him to explain his life was in the power of the marquis you see the alternative said he take your choice of evils and if you can tell adeline of her danger and sacrifice my life to save her from a situation which many would be ambitious to obtain  madame la motte condemned to the horrible alternative of permitting the seduction of innocence or of dooming her husband to destruction suffered a distraction of thought which defied all control perceiving however that an opposition to the designs of the marquis would ruin la motte and avail adeline little she determined to yield and endure in silence  at the time when adeline was planning her escape from the abbey the significant looks of peter had led la motte to suspect the truth and to observe them more closely he had seen them separate in the hall in apparent confusion and had afterward observed them conversing together in the cloisters circumstances so unusual left him not a doubt that adeline had discovered her danger and was concerting with peter some means of escape affecting therefore to be informed of the whole affair he charged peter with treachery toward himself and threatened him with the vengeance of the marquis if he did not disclose all he knew the menace intimidated peter and supposing that all chance of assisting adeline was gone he made a circumstantial confession and promised to forbear acquainting adeline with the discovery of the scheme in this promise he was seconded by inclination for he feared to meet the displeasure which adeline believing he had betrayed her might express  on the evening of the day on which adelines intended escape was discovered the marquis designed to come to the abbey and it had been agreed that he should then take adeline to his villa la motte had immediately perceived the advantage of permitting adeline to repair in the belief of being undiscovered to the tomb it would prevent much disturbance and opposition and spare himself the pain he must feel in her presence when she should know that he had betrayed her a servant of the marquis might go at the appointed hour to the tomb and wrapped in the disguise of night might take her quietly thence in the character of peter thus without resistance she would be carried to the villa nor discover her mistake till it was too late to prevent its consequence  when the marquis did arrive la motte who was not so much intoxicated by the wine he had drank as to forget his prudence informed him of what had happened and what he had planned and the marquis approving it his servant was made acquainted with the signal which afterward betrayed adeline to his power  a deep consciousness of the unworthy neutrality she had observed in adelines concerns made madame la motte anxiously avoid seeing her now that she was again in the abbey adeline understood this conduct and she rejoiced that she was spared the anguish of meeting her as an enemy whom she had once considered as a friend several days now passed in solitude in miserable retrospection and dreadful expectation the perilous situation of theodore was almost the constant subject of her thoughts often did she breathe an agonizing wish for his safety and often look round the sphere of possibility in search of hope but hope had almost left the horizon of her prospect and when it did appear it sprung only from the death of the marquis whose vengeance threatened most certain destruction  the marquis mean while lay at the inn at baux in a state of very doubtful recovery the physician and surgeon neither of whom he would dismiss nor suffer to leave the village proceeded upon contrary principles and the good effect of what the one prescribed was frequently counteracted by the injudicious treatment of the other humanity alone prevailed on the physician to continue his attendance the malady of the marquis was also heightened by the impatience of his temper the terrors of death and the irritation of his passions one moment he believed himself dying another he could scarcely be prevented from attempting to follow adeline to the abbey so various were the fluctuations of his mind and so rapid the schemes that succeeded each other that his passions were in a continual state of conflict the physician attempted to persuade him that his recovery greatly depended upon tranquillity and to prevail upon him to attempt at least some command of his feelings but he was soon silenced in hopeless disgust by the impatient answers of the marquis  at length the servant who had carried off adeline returned and the marquis having ordered him into his chamber asked so many questions in a breath that the man knew not which to answer at length he pulled a folded paper from his pocket which he said had been dropped in the chaise by mademoiselle adeline and as he thought his lordship would like to see it he had taken care of it the marquis stretched forth his hand with eagerness and received a note addressed to theodore on perceiving the superscription the agitation of jealous rage for a moment overcame him and he held it in his hand unable to open it  he however broke the seal and found it to be a note of inquiry written by adeline to theodore during his illness and which from some accident she had been prevented from sending him the tender solicitude it expressed for his recovery stung the soul of the marquis and drew from him a comparison of her feelings on the illness of his rival and that of himself she could be solicitous for his recovery said he but for mine she only dreads it as if willing to prolong the pain this little billet had excited he then read it again again he cursed his fate and execrated his rival giving himself up as usual to the transports of his passion he was going to throw it from him when his eyes caught the seal and he looked earnestly at it his anger seemed now to have subsided he deposited the note carefully in his pocket book and was for some time lost in thought  after many days of hopes and fears the strength of his constitution overcame his illness and he was well enough to write several letters one of which he immediately sent off to prepare la motte for his reception the same policy which had prompted him to conceal his illness from la motte now urged him to say what he knew would not happen that he should reach the abbey on the day after his servant he repeated this injunction that adeline should be strictly guarded and renewed his promises of reward for the future services of la motte  la motte to whom each succeeding day had brought new surprise and perplexity concerning the absence of the marquis received this notice with uneasiness for he had begun to hope that the marquis had altered his intentions concerning adeline being either engaged in some new adventure or obliged to visit his estates in some distant province he would have been willing thus to have got rid of an affair which was to reflect so much dishonor on himself  this hope was now vanished and he directed madame to prepare for the reception of the marquis adeline passed these days in a state of suspense which was now cheered by hope and now darkened by despair this delay so much exceeding her expectation seemed to prove that the illness of the marquis was dangerrous and when she looked forward to the consequences of his recovery she could not be sorry that it was so so odious was the idea of him to her mind that she would not suffer her lips to pronounce his name nor make the inquiry of annette which was of such consequence to her peace  it was about a week after the receipt of the marquiss letter that adeline one day saw from her window a party of horsemen enter the avenue and knew them to be the marquis and his attendants she retired from the window in a state of mind not to be described and sinking into a chair was for some time scarcely conscious of the objects around her when she had recovered from the first terror which his appearance excited she again tottered to the window the party was not in sight but she heard the trampling of horses and knew that the marquis had wound round to the great gate of the abbey she addressed herself to heaven for support and protection and her mind being now somewhat composed sat down to wait the event  la motte received the marquis with expressions of surprise at his long absence and the latter merely saying he had been detained by illness proceeded to enquire for adeline he was told she was in her chamber from whence she might be summoned if he wished to see her the marquis hesitated and at length excused himself but desired she might be strictly watched perhaps my lord said la motte smling adelines obstinacy has been too powerful for your passion you seem less interested concerning her than formerly  oh by no means replied the marquis she interests me if possible more than ever so much indeed that i cannot have her too closely guarded and i therefore beg la motte that you will suffer nobody to attend her but when you can observe them yourself is the room where she is confined sufficiently secure la motte assured him it was but at the same time expressed his wish that she was removed to the villa if by any means said he she should contrive to escape i know what i must expect from your displeasure and this reflection keeps my mind in continual anxiety  this removal cannot be at present said the marquis she is safer here and you do wrong to disturb yourself with any apprehension of her escape if her chamber is really so secure as you represent it  i can have no motive for deceiving you my lord in this point  i do not suspect you of any said the marquis guard her carefully and trust me she will not escape i can rely upon my valet and if you wish it he shall remain here la motte thought there could be no occasion for him and it was agreed that the man should go home  the marquis after remaining about half an hour in conversation with la motte left the abbey and adeline saw him depart with a mixture of surprise and thankfulness that almost overcame her she had waited in momentary expectation of being summoned to appear and had been endeavoring to arm herself with resolution to support his presence she had listened to every voice that sounded from below and at every step that crossed the passage her heart had palpitated with dread left it should be la motte coming to lead her to the marquis this state of suffering had been prolonged almost beyond her power of enduring it when she heard voices under her window and rising saw the marquis ride away after giving way to the joy and thankfulness that swelled her heart she endeavored to account for this circumstance which considering what had passed was certainly very strange it appeared indeed wholly inexplicable and after much fruitless inquiry she quitted the subject endeavoring to persuade herself that it could only portend good  the time of la mottes usual visitation now drew near and adeline expected it in the trembling hope of hearing that the marquis had ceased his persecution but he was as usual sullen and silent and it was not till he was about to quit the room that adeline had the courage to inquire when the marquis was expected again la motte opening the door to depart replied on the following day and adeline whom fear and delicacy embarrassed saw she could obtain no intelligence of theodore but by a direct question she looked earnestly as if she would have spoke and he stopped but she blushed and was still silent till upon his again attempting to leave the room she faintly called him back  i would ask said she after that unfortunate chevalier who has incurred the resentment of the marquis by endeavoring to serve me has the marquis mentioned him  he has replied la motte and your indifference toward the marquis is now fully explained  since i must feel resentment toward those who injure me said adeline i may surely be allowed to be grateful toward those who serve me had the marquis deserved my esteem he would probably have possessed it  well well said la motte this young hero who it seems has been brave enough to lift his arm against his colonel is taken care of and i doubt not will soon be sensible of the value of his quixotism indignation grief and fear struggled in the bosom of adeline she disdained to give la motte an opportunity of again pronouncing the name of theodore yet the uncertainty under which she labored urged her to inquire whether the marquis had heard of him since he left caux yes said la motte he has been safely carried to his regimen where he is confined till the marquis can attend to appear against him  adeline had neither power nor inclination to inquire farther and la motte quitting the chamber she was left to the misery he had renewed though this information contained no new circumstance of misfortune for she now heard confirmed what she had always expected a weight of new sorrow seemed to fall upon her heart and she perceived that she had unconsciously cherished a latent hope of theodores escape before he reached the place of his destination all hope was now however gone he was suffering the miseries of a prison and the tortures of apprehension both for his own life and her safety she pictured to herself the dark damp dungeon where he lay loaded with chains and pale with sickness and grief she heard him in a voice that thrilled her heart call upon her name and raise his eyes to heaven in silent supplication she saw the anguish of his countenance the tears that fell slowly on his cheek and remembering at the same time the generous conduct that had brought him to this abyss of misery and that it was for her sake he suffered gries resolved itself into despair her tears ceased to slow and she sunk silently into a state of dreadful torpor  on the morrow the marquis arrived and departed as before several days then elapsed and he did not appear till one evening as la motte and his wife were in their usual sittingroom he entered and conversed for sometime upon general subjects from which however he by degrees fell into a reverie and after a pause of silence he rose and drew la motte to the window i would speak with you alone said he if you are at leisure if not another time will do la motte assuring him he was perfectly so would have conducted him to another room but the marquis proposed a walk in the forest they went out together and when they had reached a solitary glade where the spreading branches of the beech and oak deepened the shades of twilight and threw a solemn obscurity around the marquis turned to la motte and addressed him  your condition la motte is unhappy this abbey is a melancholy residence for a man like you fond of society and like you also qualified to adorn it la motte bowed i wish it was in my power to restore you to the world continued the marquis perhaps if i knew the particulars of the affair which has driven you from it i might perceive that my interest could effectually serve you i think i have heard you hint it was an affair of honor la motte was silent i mean not to distress you however nor is it common curiosity that prompts this inquiry but a sincere desire to befriend you you have already informed me of some particulars of your misfortunes i think the liberality of your temper led you into expenses which you afterward endeavored to retrieve by gaming  yes my lord said la motte it is true that i dissipated the greater part of an affluent fortune in luxurious indulgences and that i afterward took unworthy means to recover it but i wish to be spared upon this subject i would if possible lose the remembrance of a transaction which must for ever stain my character and the rigorous effect of which i fear it is not in your power my lord to soften  you may be mistaken on this point replied the marquis my interest at court is by no means inconsiderable fear not from me any severity of censure i am not at all inclined to judge harshly of the faults of others i well know how to allow for the emergency of circumstances and i think la motte you have hitherto found me your friend  i have my lord  and when you recollect that i have forgiven a certain transaction of late date    it is true my lord and allow me to say i have a just sense of your generosity the transaction you allude to is by far the worst of my life and what i have to relate cannot therefore lower me in your opinion when i had dissipated the greatest part of my property in habits of voluptuous pleasure i had recourse to gaming to supply the means of continuing them a run of good luck for some time enabled me to do this and encouraging my most sanguine expectations i continued in the same career of success  soon after this a sudden turn of fortune destroyed my hopes and reduced me to the most desperate extremity in one night my money was lowered to the sum of two hundred louis these i resolved to stake also and with them my life for it was my resolution not to survive their loss never shall i forget the horrors of that moment on which hung my fate nor the deadly anguish that seized my heart when my last stake was gone i stood for some time in a state of stupefaction till roused to a sense of my misfortune my passion made me pour forth execrations on my more fortunate rivals and act all the frenzy of despair during this paroxysm of madness a gentleman who had been a silent observer of all that passed approached me  you are unfortunate sir said he  i need not be informed of that sir i replied  you have perhaps been ill used resumed he  yes sir i am ruined and therefore it may be said i am ill used  do you know the people you have played with  no but i have met them in the first circles  then i am probably mistaken said he and walked away his last words roused me and raised a hope that my money had not been fairly lost wishing for farther information i went in search of the gentleman but he had left the rooms i however stifled my transports returned to the table where i had lost my money placed myself behind the chair of one of the persons who had won it and closely watched the game for some time i saw nothing that could confirm my suspicions but was at length convinced they were just  when the game was ended i called one of my adversaries out of the room and telling him what i had observed threatened instantly to expose him if he did not restore my property the man was for some time as positive as myself and assuming the bully threatened me with chastisement for my scandalous assertions i was not however in a state of mind to be frightened and his manner served only to exasperate my temper already sufficiently inflamed by missortune after retorting his threats i was about to return to the apartment we had left and expose what had passed when with an insidious smile and a softened voice he begged i would favor him with a few moments attention and allow him to speak with the gentleman his partner to the latter part of his request i hesitated but in the mean time the gentleman himself entered the room his partner related to him in few words what had passed between us and the terror that appeared in his countenance sufficiently declared his consciousness of guilt  they then drew aside and remained a few minutes in conversation together after which they approached me with an offer as they phrased it of a compromise i declared however against any thing of this kind and swore nothing less than the whole sum i had lost should content me  is it not possible monsieur that you may be offered something as advantageous as the whole  i did not understand their meaning but after they had continued for some time to give distant hints of the same sort they proceeded to explain  perceiving their characters wholly in my power they wished to secure my interest to their party and therefore informing me that they belonged to an association of persons who lived upon the folly and inexperience of others they offered me a share in their concern my fortunes were desperate and the proposal now made me would not only produce an immediate supply but enable me to return to those scenes of dissipated pleasure to which passion had at first and long habit afterward attached me i closed with the offer and thus sunk from dissipation into infamy  la motte paused as if the recollection of these times filled him with remorse the marquis understood his feelings you judge too rigorously of yourself said he there are few persons let their appearance of honesty be what it may who in such circumstances would have acted better than you have done had i been in your situation i know not how i might have acted that rigid virtue which shall condemn you may dignify itself with the appel ation of wisdom but i wish not to possess it let it still reside where it generally is to be found in the cold bosoms of those who wanting feeling to be men dignify themselves with the title of philosophers but pray proceed  our success was for some time unlimited for we held the wheel of fortune and trusted not to her caprice thoughtless and voluptuous by nature my expenses fully kept pace with my income an unlucky discovery of the practices of our party was at length made by a young nobleman which obliged us to act for some time with the utmost circumspection it would be tedious to relate the particulars which made us at length so suspected that the distant civility and cold reserve of our acquaintance rendered the frequenting public assemblies both painful and unprofitable we turned our thoughts to other modes o obtaining money and a swindling transaction in which i engaged to a very large amount soon compelled me to leave paris you know the rest my lord  la motte was now silent and the marquis continued for some time musing you prceive my lord at length resumed la motte you perceive that my case is hopeless  it is bad indeed but not entirely hopeless from my soul i py you yet if you should return to the world and incur the danger of prosecution i think my interest with the minister might save you from any severe punishment you seem however to have lost your relish for society and perhaps do not wish to return to it  oh my lord can you doubt this  but i am overcome with the excess of your goodness would to heaven it were in my power to prove the gratitude it inspires  talk not of goodness said the marquis i will not pretend that my desire of serving you is unalloyed by any degree of selfinterest i will not affect to be more than man and trust me those who do are less it is in your power to testify your gratitude and bind me to your interest for ever he paused name but the means cried la motte name but the means and if they are within the compass of possibility they shall be executed the marquis was still silent do you doubt my sincerity my lord that you are yet silent do you fear to repose a confidence in the man whom you have already loaded with obligation who lives by your mercy and almost by your means the marquis looked earnestly at him but did not speak i have not deserved this of you my lord speak i entreat you  there are certain prejudices attached to the human mind said the marquis in a slow and solemn voice which it requires all our wisdom to keep from interfering with our happiness certain set notions acquired in infancy and cherished involuntarily by age which grow up and assume a gloss so plausible that few minds in what is called a civilized country can afterward overcome them truth is often perverted by education while the refined europeans boast a standard of honor and a sublimity of virtue which often leads them from pleasure to misery and from nature to error the simple uninformed an erican follows the impulse of his heart and obeys the inspiration of wisdom the marquis paused and la motte continued to listen in eager expectation  nature uncontaminated by false refinement resumed the marquis every where acts alike in the great occurrences of life the indian discovers his friend to be perfidious and he kills him the wild asiatic does the same the turk when ambition fires or revenge provokes gratifies his passion at the expense of life and does not call it murder even the polished italian distracted by jealousy or tempted by a strong circumstance of advantage draws his stilletto and accomplishes his purpose it is the first proof of a superior mind to libe ate itself from prejudices of country or of education you are silent la motte are you not of my opinion  i am attending my lord to your reasoning  there are i repeat it said the marquis people of minds so weak as to shrink from acts they have been accustomed to hold wrong however advantageous they never suffer themselves to be guided by circumstances but fix for life upon a certain standard from which they will on no account depart self preservation is the great law of nature when a reptile hurts us or an animal of prey threatens us we think no farther but endeavor to annihilate it when my life or what may be essential to my life requires the sacrifice of another or even if some passion wholly unconquerable requires it i should be a madman to hesitaate la motte i think i may confide in you  there are ways of doing certain things  you understand me there are times and circumstances and opportuniies  you comprehend my meaning  explain yourself my lord  kind services that  in short there are services which excite all our gratitude and which we can never think repaid it is in your power to place me in such a situation  indeed my lord name the means  i have already named them this abbey well suits the purpose it is shut up from the eye of observation any transaction may be concealed within its walls the hour of midnight may witness the deed and the morn shall not dawn to disclose it these woods tell no tales ah la motte am i right in trusting this business with you may i believe you are desirous of serving me and of preserving yourself the marquis paused and looked steadfastly at la motte whose countenance was almost concealed by the gloom of evening  my lord you may trust me in any thing explain yourself more fully  what security will you give me for your faithfulness  my life my lord is it not already in your power the marquis hesitated and then said tomorrow about this time i shall return to the abbey and will then explain my meaning if indeed you shall not already have understood it you in the mean time will consider your own powers of resolution and be prepared either to adopt the purpose i shall suggest or to declare you will not la motte made some confused reply farewell till tomorrow said the marquis remember that freedom and affluence are now before you he moved toward the abbey and mounting his horse rode off with his attendants la motte walked slowly home musing on the late conversation  chapter xiv danger whose limbs of giant mold what mortal eye can fixed behold who stalks his round an hideous form  howling amidst the midnight storm  and with him thousand phantoms joined  who prompt to deeds accursed the mind  on whom that ravning brood of fate who lap the blood of sorrow wait who fear this ghastly train can see and look not madly wild like thee collins the marquis was punctual to the hour la morte received him at the gate but he declined entering and said he preferred a walk in the forest thither therefore la motte attended him after some general conversation well said the marquis have you considered what i said and are you prepared to decide  i have my lord and will quickly decide when you shall farther explain yourself till then i can form no resolution the marquis appeared dissatisfied and was a moment silent is it then possible he at length resumed that you do not understand this ignorance is surely affected la motte i expect sincerity tell me herefore is it necessary i should say more  it is my lord said la motte immediately is you fear to confide in me freely how can i fully accomplish your purpose  before i proceed farther said the marquis let me administer some oath which shall bind you to secrecy but this is scarcely necessary for could i even doubt your word of honor the remembrance of a certain transaction would point out to you the necessity of being as silent yourself as you must wish me to be there was now a pause of silence during which both the marquis and la motte betrayed some confusion i think la motte said he i have given you sufficient proof that i can be grateful the services you have already rendered me with respect to adeline have not been unrewarded  true my lord i am ever willing to acknowledge this and am sorry it has not been in my power to serve you more effectually your farther views respecting her i am ready to assist  i thank you  adeline  the marquis hesitated  adeline rejoined la motte eager to anticipate his wishes has beauty worthy of your pursuit she has inspired a passion of which she ought to be proud and at any rate she shall soon be yours her charms are worthy of   yes yes interrupted the marquis but  he paused  but they have given you too much trouble in the pursuit said la motte and to be sure my lord it must be confessed they have but this trouble is all over  you may now consider her as your own  i would do so said the marquis fixing an eye of earnest regard upon la motte  i would do so  name your hour my lord you shall not be interrupted  beauty such as adelines   watch her closely interrupted the marquis and on no account suffer her to leave her apartment where is she now  confined in her chamber  very well but i am impatient  name your time my lord  tomorrow night   tomorrow night said the marquis  tomorrow night do you understand me now  yes my lord this night if you wish it so but had you not better dismiss your servants and remain yourself in the forest you know the door that opens upon the woods from the west tower come thither about twelve  i will be there to conduct you to her chamber remember then my lord that to right   adeline dies interrupted the marquis in a low voice scarcely human do you understand me now  la motte shrunk aghast  my lord  la motte said the marquis  there was silence of several minutes in which la motte endeavored to recover himself  let me ask my lord the meaning of this said he when he had breath to speak why should you wish the death of adeline  of adeline whom so lately you loved  make no inquiries for my motive said the marquis but it is as certain as that i live that she you name must die this is sufficient the surprise of la motte equalled his horror the means are various resumed the marquis i could have wished that no blood might be spilt and there are drugs sure and speedy in their effect but they cannot be soon or safely procured i also wish it over  it must be done quickly  this night  this night my lord  aye this night la motte if it is to be why not soon have you no convenient drug at hand  none my lord  i feared to trust a third person or i should have been provided said the marquis as it is take this poignard use it as occasion offers but be resolute la motte received the poignard with a trembling hand and continued to gaze upon it for some time scarcely knowing what he did put it up said the marquis and endeavor to recollect yourself la motte obeyed but continued to muse in silence  he saw himself entangled in the web which his own crimes had woven being in the power of the marquis he knew he must either consent to the commission of a deed from the enormity of which depraved as he was he shrunk in horror or sacrifice fortune freedom probably life itself to the refusal had had been led on by gradations from folly to vice till he now saw before him an abyss of guilt which startled even the conscience that so long had slumbered the means of retreating were desperate  to proceed was equally so  when he considered the innocence and the helplessness of adeline her orphan state her former affectionate conduct and her confidence in his protection his heart melted with compassion for the distress he had already occasioned her and shrunk in terror from the deed he was urged to commit but when on the other hand he contemplated the destruction that threatened him from the vengeance of the marquis and then considered the advantages that were offered him of favor freedom and probably fortune terror and temptation contributed to overcome the pleadings of humanity and silence the voice of conscience in this state of tumultuous uncertainty he continued for some time silent until the voice of the marquis roused him to a conviction of the necessity of at least appearing to acquiesce in his designs  do you hesitate said the marquis  no my lord my resolution is fixed  i will obey you but methinks it would be better to avoid bloodshed strange secrets have been revealed by   aye but how avoid it interrupted the marquis  poison i will not venture to procure i have given you one sure instrument of death you also may find it dangerous to inquire for a drug la motte perceived that he could not purchase poison without incurring a discovery much greater than that he wished to avoid you are right my lord and i will follow your orders implicitly the marquis now proceeded in broken sentences to give farther directions concerning this dreadful scheme  in her sleep said he at midnight the family will then be at rest afterward they planned a story which was to account for her disappearance and by which it was to seem that she had sought an escape in consequence of her aversion to the addresses of the marquis the doors of her chamber and of the west tower were to be left open to corroborate this account and many other circumstances were to be contrived to confirm the suspicion they farther consulted how the marquis was to be informed of the event and it was agreed that he should come as usual to the abbey on the following day  tonight then said the marquis i may rely upon your resolution  you may my lord  farewell then when we meet again   when we meet again said la motte it will be done he followed the marquis to the abbey and having seen him mount his horse and wished him a good night he retired to his chamber where he shut himself up  adeline mean while in the solitude of her prison gave way to the despair which her condition inspired she tried to arrange her thoughts and to argue herself into some degree of resignation but reflection by representing the past and reason by anticipating the future brought before her mind the full picture of her misfortunes and she sunk in despondency of theodore who by a conduct so noble had testified his attachment and involved himself in ruin she thought with a degree of anguish infinitely superior to any she had felt upon any other occasion  that the very exertions which had deserved all her gratitude and awakened all her tenderness should be the cause of his destruction was a circumstance so much beyond the ordinary bounds of misery that her fortitude sunk at once before it the idea of theodore suffering  theodore dying  was for ever present to her imagination and frequently excluding the sense of her own danger made her conscious only of his sometimes the hope he had given her of being able to vindicate his conduct or at least to obtain a pardon would return but it was like the faint beam of an april morn transient and cheerless she knew that the marquis stung with jealousy and exasperated to revenge would pursue him with unrelenting malice  against such an enemy what could theodore oppose conscious rectitude would not avail him to ward off the blow which disappointed passion and powerful pride directed her distress was considerably heightened by reflecting that no intelligence of him could reach her at the abbey and that she must remain she knew not how long in the most dreadful suspense concerning his fate from the abbey she saw no possibility of escaping she was a prisoner in a chamber enclosed at every avenue she had no opportunity of conversing with any person who could afford her even a chance of relief and she saw herself condemned to await in passive silence the impending destiny infinitely more dreadful to her immagination than death itself  thus circumstanced she yielded to the pressure of her misfortunes and would sit for hours motionless and given up to thought theodore she would frequently exclaim you cannot hear my voice you cannot fly to help me yourself a prisoner and in chains the picture was too horrid the swelling anguish of her heart would subdue her utterance  tears bathed her checks  and she became insensible to every thing but the misery of theodore  on this evening her mind had been remarkably tranquil and as she watched from her window with a still and melancholy pleasure the setting sun the fading splendor of the western horizon and the gardual approach of twilight her thoughts bore her back to the time when in happier circumstances she had watched the same appearances she recollected also the evening of her temporary escape from the abbey when from this same window she had viewed the declining sun  how anxiously she had awaited the fall of twilight  how much she had endeavored to anticipate the events of her future life  with what trembling fear she had descended from the tower and ventured into the forest these reflections produced others that filled her heart with anguish and her eyes with tears  while she was lost in her melancholy reverie she saw the marquis mount his horse and depart from the gates the sight of him revived in all its force a sense of the misery he inflicted on her beloved theodore and a consciousness of the evils which more immediately threatened herself she withdrew from the window in an agony of tears which continuing for a considerable time her frame was at length quite exhausted and she retired early to rest  la motte remained in his chamber till supper obliged him to descend at table his wild and haggard countenance which in spite of all his endeavors betrayed the disorder of his mind and his long and frequent fits of abstraction surprised as well as alarmed madame la motte when peter left the room she tenderly inquired what had disturbed him and he with a distorted smile tried to be gay but the effort was beyond his art and he quickly relapsed into silence or when madame la motte spoke and he strove to conceal the absence of his thoughts he answered so entirely from the purpose that his abstraction became still more apparent observing this madame la motte appeared to take no notice of his present temper and they continued to sit in uninterrupted silence till the hour of rest when they retired to their chamber  la motte lay in a state of disturbed watchfulness for some time and his frequent starts awoke madame who however being pacified by some trifling excuse soon went to sleep again this agitation continued till near midnight when recollecting that the time was now passing in idle reflection which ought to be devoted to action he stole silently from his bed wrapped himself in his night gown and taking the lamp which burned nightly in his chamber passed up the spiral staircase as he went he frequently looked back and often started and listened to the hollow sighings of the blast  his hand shook so violently when he attempted to unlock the door of adelines chamber that he was obliged to set the lamp on the ground and apply both his hands the noise he made with the key induced him to suppose he must have awakened her but when he opened the door and perceived the stillness that reigned within he was convinced she was asleep when he approached the bed he heard her gently breathe and soon after sigh  and he stopped but silence returning he again advanced and then heard her sing in her sleep as he listened he distinguished some notes of a melancholy little air which in her happier days she had often sung to him the low and mournful accent in which she now uttered them expressed too well the tone of her mind  la motte now stepped hastily toward the bed when breathing a deep sigh she was again silent he undrew the curtain and saw her lying in a profound sleep her cheek yet wet with tears resting upon her arm he stood a moment looking at her and as he viewed her innocent and lovely countenance pale in grief the light of the lamp which shone strong upon her eyes awoke her and perceiving a man she uttered a scream her recollection returning she knew him to be la motte and it instantly recurring to her that the marquis was at hand she raised herself in bed and implored pity and protection la motte stood looking eagerly at her but without replying  the wildness of his looks and the gloomy silence he preserved increased her alarm and with tears of terror she renewed her supplication you once saved me from destruction cried she o save me now have pity upon me  i have no protector but you  what is it you fear said la motte in a tone scarcely articulate  o save me  save me from the marquis  rise then said he and dress yourself quickly  i shall be back again in a few minutes he lighted a candle that stood on the table and left the chamber adeline immediately arose and endeavored to dress but her thoughts were so bewildered that she scarcely knew what she did and her whole frame so violently agitated that it was with the utmost difficulty she preserved herself from fainting she threw her clothes hastily on and then sat down to await the return of la motte a considerable time elapsed yet he did not appear and having in vain endeavored to compose her spirits the pain of suspense at length became so insupportable that she opened the door of her chamber and went to the top of the staircase to listen she thought she heard voices below but considering that if the marquis was there her appearance could only increase her danger she checked the step she had almost involuntarily taken to descend still she listened and still thought she distinguished voices soon after she heard a door shut and then footsteps and she hastened back to her chamber  near a quarter of an hour elapsed and la motte did not appear when again she thought she heard a murmur of voices below and also passing steps and at length her anxiety not suffering her to remain in her room she moved through the passage that communicated with the spiral staircase but all was now still in a few moments however a light flashed across the hall and la motte appeared at the door of the vaulted room he looked up and seeing adeline in the gallery beckoned her to descend  she hesitated and looked toward her chamber but la motte now approached the stairs and with faultering steps she went to meet him i fear the marquis may see me said she whispering where is he la motte took her hand and led her on assuring her she had nothing to fear from the marquis the wildness of his looks however and the trembling of his hand seemed to contradict this assurance and she inquired whither he was leading her to the forest said la motte that you may escape from the abbey  a horse waits for you without i can save you by no other means new terror seized her she could scarcely believe that la motte who had hitherto conspired with the marquis and had so closely confined her should now himself undertake her escape and she at this moment felt a dreadful presentiment which it was impossible to account for that he was leadding her out to murder her in the forest again shrinking back she supplicated his mercy he assured her he meant only to protect her and desired she would not waste time  there was something in his manner that spoke sincerity and she suffered him to conduct her to a side door that opened into the forest where she could just distinguish through the gloom a man on horseback this brought to her remembrance the night in which she had quutted the tomb when trusting to the person who appeared she had been carried to the marquiss villa la motte called and was answered by peter whose voice somewhat reassured adeline  he then told her that the marquis would return to the abbey on the following morning and that this could be her only opportunity of escaping his designs that she might rely upon his la mottes word that peter had orders to carry her wherever she chose but as he knew the marquis would be indefatigable in search of her he advised her by all means to leave the kingdom which she might do with peter who was a native of savoy and would convey her to the house of his sister there she might remain till la motte himself who did not now think it would be safe to continue much longer in france should join her he entreated her whatever might happen never to mention the events which had passed at the abbey to save you adeline i have risked my life do not increase my danger and your own by any unnecessary discoveries we may never meet again but i hope you will be happy and remember when you think of me that i am not quite so bad as i have been tempted to be  having said this he gave her some money which he told her would be necessary to defray the expenses of her journey adeline could no longer doubt his sincerity and her transports of joy and gratitude would scarcely permit her to thank him she wished to have bid madame la motte farewell and indeed earnestly requested it but he again told her she had no time to lose and having wrapped her in a large cloak he lifted her upon the horse she bade him adieu with tears of gratitude and peter set off as fast as the darkness would permit  when they were got some way i am glad with all my heart maamselle said he to see you again who would have thought after all that my master himself would have bid me take you away  well to be sure strange things come to pass but i hope we shall have better luck this time adeline not choosing to reproach him with the treachery of which she feared he had been formerly guilty thanked him for his good wishes and said she hoped they should be more fortunate but peter in his usual strain of eloquence proceeded to undeceive her in this point and to acquaint her with every circumstance which his memory and it was naturally a strong one could furnish  peter expressed such an artless interest in her welfare and such a concern for her disappointment that she could no longer doubt his faithfulness and this conviction not only strengthened her confidence in the present undertaking but made her listen to his conversation with kindness and pleasure i should never have staid at the abbey till this time said he if i could have got away but my master frighted me so about the marquis and i had not money enough to carry me into my own country so that i was forced to stay it is well we have got some solid louisdors now for i question maamelle whether the people on the road would have taken those trinkets you formerly talked of for money  possibly not said adeline i am thankful to monsieur la motte that we have more certain means of procuring conveniences what route shall you take when we leave the forest peter  peter mentioned very correctly a great part of the road to lions and then said he we can easily get to savoy and that will be nothing my sister god bless her i hope is living i have not seen her many year but if she is not all the people will be glad to see me and you will easily get a lodging maamselle and every thing you want  adeline resolved to go with him to savoy la motte who knew the character and designs of the marquis had advised her to leave the kingdom and had told her what her fears would have suggested that the marquis would be indefatigable in search of her his motive for this advice must be a desire of serving her why else when she was already in his power should he remove her to another place and even furnish her with money for the expenses of a journey  at leloncourt where peter said he was well known she would be most likely to meet with protection and comfort even should his sister be dead and its distance and solitary situation were circumstances that pleased her these reflections would have pointed out to her the prudence of proceeding to savoy had she been less destitute of resources in france in her present situation they proved it to be necessary  she enquired farther concerning the route they were to take and whether peter was sufficiently acquainted with the road  when once i get to thiers i know it well enough said peter for i have gone it many a time in my younger days and any body will tell us the way there they traveled for several hours in darkness and silence and it was not till they emerged from the forest that adeline saw the morning light streak the eastern clouds the sight cheered and revived her and as she traveled silently along her mind revolved the events of the past night and meditated plans for the future the present kindness of la motte appeared so very different from his former conduct that it astonished and perplexed her and she could only account for it by attributing it to one of those sudden impulses of humanity which sometimes operate even upon the most depraved hearts  but when she recollected his former words that he was not master of himself she could scarcely believe that mere pity could induce him to break the bonds which had hitherto so strongly held him and then considering the altered conduct of the marquis she was inclined to think that she owed her liberty to some change in his sentiments toward her yet the advice la motte had given her o quit the kingdom and the money with which he had supplied her for that purpose seemed to contradict this opinion and involved her again in doubt  peter now got directions to thiers which place they reached without any accident and there stopped to refresh themselves as soon as peter thought the horse sufficiently rested they again set forward and from the rich plains of the lyonnois adeline for the first time caught a view of the distant alps whose majestic heads seeming to prop the vault of heaven filled her mind with sublime emotions  in a few hours they reached the vale in which stands the city of lions whose beautiful environs studded with villas and rich with cultivation withdrew adeline from the melancholy contemplation of her own circumstances and her more painful anxiety for theodore  when they reached that busy city her first care was to enquire concerning the passage of the rhone but she forbore to make these inquiries of the people of the inn considering that if the marquis should trace her thither they might enable him to pursue her route she therefore sent peter to the quays to hire a boat while she herself took a slight repast it being her intention to embark immediately peter presently returned having engaged a boat and men to take them up the rhone to the nearest part of savoy from whence they were to proceed by land to the village of leloncourt  having taken some refreshment she ordered him to conduct her to the vessel a new and striking seen presented itself to adeline who looked with surprise upon the river gay with vessels and the quay crowded with busy faces and felt the contrast which the cheerful objects around bore to herself  to her an orphan desolate helpless and flying from persecution and her country she spoke with the master of the boat and having sent peter back to the inn for the horse la mottes gift to peter in lieu of some arrears of wages they embarked  as they slowly passed up the rhone whose steep banks crowned with mountains exhibited the most various wild and romantic scenery adeline sat in pensive reverie the novelty of the scene through which she floated now frowning with savage grandeur and now smiling in fertility and gay with towns and villages soothed her mind and her sorrow gradually softened into a gentle and not unpleasing melancholy she had seated herself at the head of the boat where she watched its sides cleave the swift stream and listened to the dashing of the waters  the boat slowly opposing the current passed along for some hours and at length the veil of evening was stretched over the landscape the weather was fine and adeline regardless of the dews that now fell remained in the open air observing the objects darken round her the gay tints of the horizon fade away and the stars gradually appear trembling upon the lucid mirror of the waters the scene was now sunk in deep shadow and the silence of the hour was broken only by the measured dashing of the oars and now and then by the voice of peter speaking to the boatmen adeline sat lost in thought the forlornness of her circumstances came heightened to her imagination  she saw herself surrounded by the darkness and stillness of night in a strange place far distant from any friends going she scarcely knew whither under the guidance of strangers and pursued perhaps by an inveterate enemy she pictured to herself the rage of the marquis now that he had discovered her flight and though she knew it very unlikely he should follow her by water for which reason she had chosen that manner of traveling she trembled at the portrait her fancy drew her thoughts then wandered to the plan she should adopt after reaching savoy and much as her experience had prejudiced her against the manners of a convent she saw no place more likely to afford her a proper asylum at length she retired to the little cabin for a few hours repose  she awoke with the dawn and her mind being too much disturbed to sleep again she rose and watched the gradual approach of day as she mused she expressed the feelings of the moment in the following sonnet morns beaming eyes at length unclose and wake the blushes of the rose that all night long oppressed with dews and veiled in chilling shade its hues reclined forlorn the languid head and sadly sought its parent bed warmth from her ray the trembling flower derives and sweetly blushing through its tears revives morns beaming eyes at length unclose and melt the tears that bend the rose but can their charms suppress the sigh or chase the tear from sorrows eye can all their lustrous light impart one ray of peace to sorrows heart ah no their fires her fainting soul oppress  eves pensive shades more soothe her meek distress   when adeline left the abbey la motte had remained for some time at the gate listening to the steps of the horse that carried her till the sound was lost in distance he then turned into the hall with a lightness of heart to which he had long been a stranger the satisfaction of having thus preserved her as he hoped from the designs of the marquis overcame for a while all sense of the danger in which this step must involve him but when he returned entirely to his own situation the terrors of the marquiss resentment struck their full force upon his mind and he considered how he might best escape it  it was now past midnight  the marquis was expected early on the following day and in this interval it at first appeared probable to him that he might quit the forest there was only one horse but he considered whether it would be best to set off immediately for auboine where a carriage might be procured to convey his family and his movables from the abbey or quietly to await the arrival of the marquis and endeavor to impose upon him by a forged story of adelines escape  the time which must clapse before a carriage could reach the abbey would leave him scarcely sufficient to escape from the forest what money he had remaining from the marquiss bounty would not carry him far and when it was expended he must probably be at a loss for subsistence should he not before then be detected by remaining at the abbey it would appear that he was unconscious of deserving the marquiss resentment and though he could not expect to impress a belief upon him that his orders had been executed he might make it appear that peter only had been accessory to the escape of adeline an account which would seem the more probable from peters having been formerly detected in a similar scheme he believed also that if the marquis should threaten to deliver him into the hands of justice he might save himself by a menace of disclosing the crime he had commissioned him to perpetrate  thus arguing la motte resolved to remain at the abbey and await the event of the marquiss disappointment  when the marquis did arrive and was informed of adelines flight the strong workings of his soul which appeared in his countenance for a while alarmed and terrified la motte he cursed himself and her in terms of such coarseness and vehemence as la motte was astonished to hear from a man whose manners were generally amiable whatever might be the violence and criminality of his passions to invent and express these terms seemed to give him not only relief but delight yet he appeared more shocked at the circumstance of her escape than exasperated at the carelessness of la motte and recollecting at length that he wasted time he left the abbey and dispatched several of his servants in pursuit of her  when he was gnoe la motte believing his story had succeeded returned to the pleasure of considering that he had done his duty and to the hope that adeline was now beyond the reach of pursuit this calm was of short continuance in a few hours the marquis returned accompanied by the officers of justice the affrighted la motte perceiving him approach endeavored to conceal himself but was seized and carried to the marquis who drew him aside  i am not to be imposed upon said he by such a superficial story as you have invented you know your life is in my hands tell me instantly where you have secreted adeline or i will charge you with the crime you have committed against me but upon your disclosing the place of her concealment i will dismiss the officers and if you wish it assist you to leave the kingdom you have no time to hesitate and may know that i will not be trifled with la motte attempted to appease the marquis and affirmed that adeline was really fled he knew not whither you will remember my lord that your character is also in my power and that if you proceed to extremities you will compel me to reveal in the face of day that you would have made me a murderer  and who will believe you said the marquis the crimes that banished you from society will be no testimony of your veracity and that with which i now charge you will bring with it a sufficient presumption that your accusation is malicious officers do your duty  they entered the room and seized la motte whom terror now deprived of all power of resistance could resistance have availed him and in the perturbation of his mind he informed the marquis that adeline had taken the road to lions this discovery however was made too late to serve himself the marquis seized the advantage it offered but the charge had been given and with the anguish of knowing that he had exposed adeline to danger without benefiting himself la motte submitted in silence to his fate scarcely allowing him time to collect what little effects might easily be carried with him the officers conveyed him from the abbey but the marquis in consideration of the extreme distress of madame la motte directed one of his servants to procure a carriage from auboine that she might follow her husband  the marquis in the mean time now acquainted with the route adeline had taken sent forward his faithful valet to trace her to her place of concealment and return immediately with intelligence to the villa  abandoned to despair la motte and his wife quitted the forest of fontangville which had for so many months afforded them an asylum and embarked once more upon the tumultuous world where justice would meet la motte in the form of destruction they had entered the forest as a refuge rendered necessary by the former crimes of la motte and for some time found in it the security they sought but other offenses for even in that sequestered spot there happened to be temptation soon succeeded and his life already sufficiently marked by the punishment of vice now afforded him another instance of this great truth that where guilt is there peace cannot enter  chapter xv hail awful scenes that calm the troubled breast and woo the weary to profound repose beattie adeline mean while and peter proceeded on their voyage without any accident and landed in savoy where peter placed her upon the horse and himself walked beside her when he came within sight of his native mountains his extravagant joy burst forth into frequent exclamations and he would often ask adeline if she had ever seen such hills in france no no said he the hills there are very well for french hills but they are not to be named on the same day with ours adeline lost in admiration of the astonishing and tremendous scenery around her assented very warmly to the truth of peters assertion which encouraged him to expatiate more largely upon the advantages of his country its disadvantages he totally forgot and though he gave away his last sous to the children of the peasantry that run barefooted by the side of the horse he spoke of nothing but the happiness and content of the inhabitants  his native village indeed was an exception to the general character of the country and to the usual effects of an arbitrary government it was flourishing healthy and happy and these advantages it chiefly owed to the activity and attention of the benevolent clergyman whose cure it was  adeline who now began to feel the effects of long anxiety and fatigue much wished to arrive at the end of her journey and inquired impatiently of peter concerning it her spirits thus weakened the gloomy grandeur of the scenes which had so lately awakened emotions of delightful sublimity now awed her into terror she trembled at the sound of the torrents rolling among the clifts and thundering in the vale below and shrunk from the view of the precipices which sometimes overhung the road and at others appeared beneath it fatigued as she was she frequently dismounted to climb on foot the steep flinty road which she feared to travel on horseback  the day was closing when they drew near a small village at the foot of the savoy alps and the sun in all his evening splendor now sinking behind their summits threw a farewell gleam athwart the landscape so soft and glowing as drew from adeline languid as she was an exclamation of rapture  the romantic situation of the village next attracted her notice it stood at the foot of several stupendous mountains which formed a chain round a lake at some little distance and the woods that swept from their summits almost embosomed the village the lake unruffled by the lightest air reflected the vermeil tints of the horizon with the sublime scenery on its borders darkening every instant with the falling twilight  when peter perceived the village he burst into a shout of joy thank god said he we are near home there is my dear native place it looks just as it did twenty years ago and there are the same old trees growing round our cottage yonder and the huge rock that rises above it my poor father died there maamselle pray heaven my sister be alive it is a long while since i saw her adeline listened with a melancholy pleasure to these artless expressions of peter who in retracing the scenes of his former days seemed to live them over again as they approached the village he continued to point out various objects of his remembrance and there too is the good pastors chateau look maamselle that white house with the smoke curling that stands on the edge of the lake yonder i wonder whether he is alive yet he was not old when i left the place and as much beloved as ever man was but death spares nobody  they had by this time reached the village which was extremely neat though it did not promise much accommodation peter had hardly advanced ten steps before he was accosted by some of his old acquaintance who shook hands and seemed not to know how to part with him he inquired for his sister and was told she was alive and well as they passed on so many of his old friends flocked round him that adeline became quite weary of the delay many whom he had left in the vigor of life were now tottering under the infirmities of age whiletheir sons and daughters whom he had known only in the playfulness of infancy were grown from his remembrance and in the pride of youth at length they approached the cottage and were met by his sister who having heard of his arrival came and welcomed him with unfeigned joy  on seeing adeline she seemed surprised but assisted her to alight and conducting her into a small but neat cottage received her with a warmth of ready kindness which would have graced a better situation adeline desired to speak with her alone for the room was now crowded with peters friends and then acquainting her with such particulars of her circumstances as it was necessary to communicate desired to know if she could be accommodated with lodging in the cottage yes maamselle said the good woman such as it is you are heartily welcome i am only sorry it is not better but you seem ill maamselle what shall i get you  adeline who had been long struggling with fatigue and indisposition now yielded to their pressure she said she was indeed ill but hoped that rest would restore her and desired a bed might be immediately prepared the good woman went out to obey her and soon returning showed her to a little cabin where she retired to a bed whose cleanliness was its only recommendation  but notwithstanding her fatigue she could not sleep and her mind in spite of all her efforts returned to the scenes that were passed or presented gloomy and imperfect visions of the future  the difference between her own condition and that of other persons educated as she had been struck her forcibly and she wept they said she have friends and relations all striving to save them not only from what may hurt but what may displease them watching not only for their present safety but for their future advantage and preventing them even from injuring themselves but during my whole life i have never known a friend have been in general surrounded by enemies and very seldom exempt from some circumstance either of danger or calamity yet surely i am not born to be for ever wretched the time will come when  she began to think she might one time be happy but recollecting the desperate situation of theodore no said she i can never hope even for peace  early the following morning the good woman of the house came to inquire how she had rested and found she had slept little and was much worse than on the preceding night the uneasiness of her mind contributed to heighten the feverish sypmtoms that attended her and in the course of the day her disorder began to assume a serious aspect she observed its progress with composure resigning herself to the will of god and feeling little to regret in life her kind hostess did every thing in her power to relieve her and there was neither physician nor apothecary in the village so that nature was deprived of none of her advantages notwithstanding this the disorder rapidly increased and on the third day from its first attack she became delirious after which she sunk into a state of stupefaction  how long she remained in this deplorable condition she knew not but on recovering her senses she found herself in an apartment very different from any she remembered it was spacious and almost beautiful the bed and every thing around being in one style of elegant simplicity for some minutes she lay in a trance of surprise endeavoring to recollect her scattered ideas of the past and almost fearing to move lest the pleasing vision should vanish from her eyes  at length she ventured to raise herself when she presently heard a soft voice speaking near her and the bed curtain on one side was gently undrawn by a beautiful girl as she leaned forward over the bed and with a smile of mingled tenderness and joy inquired of her patient how she did adeline gazed in silent admiration upon the most interesting female countenance she had ever seen in which the expression of sweetness united with lively sense and refinement was chastened by simplicity  adeline at length recollected herself sufficiently to thank her kind inquirer and begged to know to whom she was obliged and where she was the lovely girl pressed her hand it is we who are obliged said she oh how i rejoice to find that you have recovered your recollection she said no more but flew to the door of the apartment and disappeared in a few minutes she returned with an elderly lady who approaching the bed with an air of tender interest asked concerning the state of adeline to which the latter replied as well as the agitation of her spirits would permit and repeated her desire of knowing to whom she was so greatly obliged you shall know that hereafter said the lady at present be assured that you are with those who will think their care much overpaid by your recovery submit therefore to every thing that may conduce to it and consent to be kept as quiet as possible  adeline gratefully smiled and bowed her head in silent assent the lady now quitted the room for a medicine having given which to adeline the curtain was closed and she was left to repose but her thoughts were too busy to suffer her to profit by the opportunity she contemplated the past and viewed the present and when she compared them the contrast struck her with astonishment the whole appeared like one of those sudden transitions so frequent in dreams in which we pass from grief and despair we know not how to comfort and delight  yet she looked forward to the future with a trembling anxiety that threatened to retard her recovery and which when she remembered the words of her generous benefactress she endeavored to suppress had she better known the disposition of the persons in whose house she now was her anxiety as far as it regarded herself must in a great measure have been done away for la luc its owner was one of those rare characters to whom misfortune seldom looks in vain and whose native goodness confirmed by principle is uniform and unassuming in its acts the following little picture of his domestic life his family and his manners will more fully illustrate his character it was drawn from the life and its exactness will it is hoped compensate for its length the family of la luc but half mankind like handels fool destroy through rage and ignorance the strain of joy irregularly wild their passions roll through natures finest instrument the soul while men of sense with handels happier skill correct the taste and harmonize the will teach their affections like his notes to flow nor raised too high nor ever sunk too low till every virtue measured and refined as fits the concert of the master mind melts in its kindred sounds and pours along the according music of the moral song cawthorne  in the village of leloncourt celebrated for its picturesque situation at the foot of the savoy alps lived arnaud la luc a clergyman descended from an ancient family of france whose decayed fortunes occasioned them to seek a retreat in switzerland in an age when the violence of civil commotion seldom spared the conquered he was minister of the village and equally loved for the piety and benevolence of the christian as respected for the dignity and elevation of the philosopher his was the philosophy of nature directed by common sense he despised the jargon o the modern schools and the brilliant absurdities of systems which have dazzled without enlightening and guided without convincing their disciples  his mind was penetrating his views extensive and his systems like his religion were simple rational and sublime the people of his parish looked up to him as to a father for while his precepts directed their minds his example touched their hearts  in early youth la luc lost a wife whom he tenderly loved this event threw a tincture of soft and interesting melancholy over his character which remained when time had mellowed the remembrance that occasioned it philosophy had strengthened not hardened his heart it enabled him to resist the pressure of affliction rather than to overcome it  calamity taught him to feel with peculiar sympathy the distresses of others his income from the parish was small and what remained from the divided and reduced estates of his ancestors did not much increase it but though he could not always relieve the necessities of the indigent his tender pity and holy conversation seldom failed in administering consolation to the mental sufferer on these occasions the sweet and exquisite emotions of his heart have often induced him to say that could the voluptuary be once sensible of these feelings he would never after forego the luxury of doing good  ignorance of true pleasure he would say more frequently than temptation to that which is false leads to vice  la luc had one son and a daughter who were too young when their mother died to lament their loss he loved them with peculiar tenderness as the children of her whom he never ceased to deplore and it was for some time his sole amusement to observe the gradual unfolding of their infant minds and to bend them to virtue his was the deep and silent sorrow of the heart his complaints he never obtruded upon others and very seldom did he even mention his wife his grief was too sacred for the eye of the vulgar often he retired to the deep solitude of the mountains and amid their solemn and tremendous scenery would brood over the remembrance of times past and resign himself to the luxury of grief on his return from these little excursions he was always more placid and contented a sweet tranquillity which arose almost to happiness was diffused over his mind and his manners were more than usually benevolent as he gazed on his children and fondly kissed them a tear would sometimes steal into his eye but it was a tear of tender regret unmingled with the darker qualities of sorrow and was most precious to his heart  on the death of his wife he received into his house a maiden sister a sensible worthy woman who was deeply interested in the happiness of her brother her affectionate attention and judicious conduct anticipated the effect of time in softening the poignancy of his distress and her unremitted care of his children while it proved the goodness of her own heart attracted her more closely to his  it was with inexpressible pleasure that he traced in the infant features of clara the resemblance of her mother the same gentleness of manner and the same sweetness of disposition soon displayed themselves and as she grew up her actions frequently reminded him so strongly of his lost wife as to fix him in reveries which absorbed all his soul  engaged in the duties of his parish the education of his children and in philosophic research his years passed in tranquillity the tender melancholy with which affliction had tinctured his mind was by long indulgence become dear to him and he would not have relinquished it for the brightest dream of airy happiness when any passing incident disturbed him he retired for consolation to the idea of her he so faithfully loved and yielding to a gentle and what the world would call a romantic sadness gradually reassumed his composure this was the secret luxury to which he withdrew from temporary disappointment  the solitary enjoyment which dissipated the cloud of care and blunted the sting of vexation  which elevated his mind above this world and opened to his view the sublimity of another  the spot he now inhabited the surrounding scenery the romantic beauties of the neighboring walks were dear to la luc for they had once been loved by clara they had been the scenes of her tenderness and of his happiness  his chateau stood on the borders of a small lake that was almost environed by mountains of stupendous height which shooting into a variety of grotesque forms composed a scenery singularly solemn and sublime dark woods intermingled with bold projections of rock sometimes barren and sometimes covered with the purple bloom of wild flowers impended over the lake and were seen in the clear mirror of its waters the wild and alpine heights which rose above were either crowned with perpetual snows or exhibited tremendous crags and masses of solid rock whose appearance was continually changing as the rays of light were variously reflected on their surface and whose summits were often wrapped in impenetrable mists some cottages and hamlets scattered on the margin of the lake or seated in picturesque points of view on the rocks above were the only objects that reminded the beholder of humanity  on the side of the lake nearly opposite to the chateau the mountains receded and a long chain of alps was seen stretching in perspective their innumerable tints and shades some veiled in blue mists some tinged with rich purple and others glittering in partial light gave luxurious and magical coloring to the scene  the chateau was not large but it was convenient and was characterised by an air of elegant simplicity and good order the entrance was a small hall which opening by a glass door into the garden afforded a view of the lake with the magnificent scenery exhibited on its borders on the left of the hall was la lucs study where he usually passed his mornings and adjoining was a small room fitted up with chemical apparatus astronomical instruments and other implements of science on the right was the family parlour and behind it a room which belonged exclusively to madame la luc here were deposited various medicines and botanical distillations together with the apparatus for preparing them from this room the whole village was liberally supplied with physical comfort for it was the pride of madame to believe herself skilful in relieving the disorders of her neighbors  behind the chateau rose a tuft of pines and in front a gentle declivity covered with verdure and flowers extended to the lake whose waters flowed even with the grass and gave freshness to the acacias that waved over its surface flowering shrubs intermingled with mountain ash cypress and evergreen oak marked the boundary of the garden  at the return of spring it was claras care to direct the young shoots of the plants to nurse the budding flowers and to shelter them with the luxuriant branches of the shrubs from the cold blasts that descended from the mountains in summer she usually rose with the sun and visited her favorite flowers while the dew yet hung glittering on their leaves the freshness of early day with the glowing coloring which then touched the scenery gave a pure and exquisite delight to her innocent heart born amid scenes of grandeur and sublimity she had quickly imbibed a taste for their charms which taste was heightened by the influence of a warm imagination to view the sun rising above the alps tinging their snowy heads with light and suddenly darting his rays over the whole face of nature  to fee the fiery splendor of the clouds reflected in the laek below and the roseate tints first steal upon the rocks above  were among the earliest pleasures of which clara was susceptible from being delighted with the observance of nature she grew pleased with seeing her finely imitated and soon displayed a taste for poetry and painting when she was about sixteen she often selected from her fathers library those of the italian poets most celebrated for picturesque beauty and would spend the first hours of morning in reading them under the shade of the acacias that bordered the lake here too she would often attempt rude sketches of the surrounding scenery and at length by repeated efforts assisted by some instruction from her brother she succeeded so well as to produce twelve drawings in crayon which were judged worthy of decorating the parlour of the chateau  young la luc played the flute and she listened to him with exquisite delight particularly when he stood on the margin of the lake under her beloved acacias her voice was sweet and flexible thought not strong and she soon learned to modulate it to the instrument she knew nothing of the intricacies of execution her airs were simple and her style equally so but she soon gave them a touching expression inspired by the sensibility of her heart which seldom left those of her hearers unaffected  it was the happiness of la luc to see his children happy and in one of his excursions to geneva whither he went to visit some relations of his late wife he bought clara a lute she received it with more gratitude than she could express and having learned one air she hastened to her favorite acacias and played it again and again till she forgot every thing besides her little domestic duties her books her drawing even the hour which her father dedicated to her improvement when she met her brother in the library and with him partook of knowledge even this hour passed unheeded by la luc suffered it to pass madame was displeased that her niece neglected her domestic duties and wished to reprove her but la luc begged she would be silent let experience teach her her error said he precept seldom brings conviction to young minds  madame objected that experience was a slow teacher it is a sure one replied la luc and is not unfrequently the quickest of all teachers when it cannot lead us into serious evil it is well to trust to it  the second day passed with clara as the first and the third as the second she could now play several tunes she came to her father and repeated what she had learnt  at supper the cream was not dressed and there was no fruit on the table la luc inquired the reason clara recollected it and blushed she observed that her brother was absent but nothing was said toward the conclusion of the repast he appeared his countenance expressed unusual satisfaction but he seated himself in silence clara inquired what had detained him from supper and learnt that he had been to a sick family in the neighborhood with the weekly allowance which her father gave them la luc had entrusted the care of this family to his daughter and it was her duty to have carried them their little allowance on the preceding day but she had forgot every thing but music  how did you find the woman said la luc to his son worse sir he replied for her medicines had not been regularly given and the children had had little or no food today  clara was shocked no food today said she to herself and i have been playing all day on my lute under the acacias by the lake her father did not seem to observe her emotion but turned to his son i left her better said the latter the medicines i carried eased her pain and i had the pleasure to see her children make a joyful pper  clara perhaps for the first time in her life envied him his pleasure her heart was full and she sat silent no food to day thought she  she retired pensively to her chamber the sweet serenity with which she usually went to rest was vanished for she could no longer reflect on the past day with satisfaction  what a pity said she that what is so pleasing should be the cause of so much pain this lute is my delight and my torment this reflection occasioned her much internal debate but before she could come to any resolution upon the point in question she fell asleep  she awoke very early the next morning and impatiently watched the progress of the dawn the sun at lenth appearing she arose and determined to make all the atonement in her power for her former neglect hastened to the cottage  here she remained a considerable time and when she returned to the chateau her countenance had recovered all its usual serenity she resolved however not to touch her lute that day  till the hour of breakfast she busied herself in binding up the flowers and pruning the shoots that were too luxuriant and she at length found herself she scarcely knew how beneath her beloved acacias by the side of the lake ah said she with a sigh how sweetly would the song i learned yesterday sound now over the waters but she remembered her determination and checked the step she was involuntarily taking toward the chateau  she attended her father in the library at the usual hour and learned from his discourse with her brother on what had been read the two preceding days that she had lost much entertaining knowledge she requested her father would inform her to what this conversation alluded but he calmly replied that she had preferred another amusement at the time when the subject was discussed and must therefore content herself with ignorance you would reap the rewards of study from the amusements of idleness said he learn to be reasonable  d not expect to unite inconsistencies  clara felt the justness of this rebuke and remembered her lute what mischief has it occasioned sighed she yes i am determined not to touch it at all this day i will prove that i am able to control my inclinations when i see it is necessary so to do thus resolving she applied herself to study with more than usual assiduity  she adhered to her resolution and toward the close of day went into the garden to amuse herself the evening was still and uncommonly beautiful nothing was heard but the faint ing of the leaves which returned but a ervals making silence more solenm  distant murmurs of the torrents that ed among the cliffs as she stood by the lake and watched the sun slowly sinking below the alps whose summits were tinged with gold and purple as she saw the last rays of light gleam upon the waters whose surface was not curled by the lightest air she sighed oh how enchanting would be the sound of my lute at this moment on this spot and when every thing is so still around me  the temptation was too powerful for the resolution of clara she ran to the chateau returned with the instrument to her dear acacias and beneath their shade continued to play till the surrounding objects faded in in darkness from her sight but the moon arose and shedding a trembling luster on the lake made the scene more captivating than ever  it was impossible to quit so delightful a spot clara repeated her favorite airs again and again the beauty of the hour awakened all her genius she never played with such expression before and she listened with increasing rapture to the tones as they languished over the waters and died away on the distant air she was perfectly enchanted no nothing was ever so delightful as to play on the lute beneath her acacias on the margin of the lake by moonlight  when she returned to the chateau supper was over la luc had observed clara and would not suffer her to be interrupted  when the enthusiasm of the hour was passed she recollected that she had broken her resolution and the reflection gave her pain i prided myself on controling my inclinations said she and i have weakly yielded to their direction but what evil have i incurred by indulging them this evening i have neglected no duty for i had none to perform of what then have i to accuse myself it would have been absurd to have kept my resolution and denied myself a pleasure when there appeared no reason for this selfdenial  she paused not quite satisfied with this reasoning suddenly resuming her enquiry but how said she am i certain that i should have resisted my inclinations if there had been a reason for opposing them if the poor family whom i neglected yesterday had been unsupplied to day i fear i should again have forgotten them while i played on my lute on the banks of the lake  she then recollected all that her father had at different times said on the subject of selfcommand and she felt some pain  no said she if i do not consider that to preserve a resolution which i have once solemnly formed is a sufficient reason to control my inclinations i fear no other motive would long restrain me i seriously determined not to touch my lute this whole day and i have broken my resolution tomorrow perhaps i may be tempted to neglect some duty for i have discovered that i cannot rely on my own prudence since i cannot conquer temptation i will fly from it  on the following morning she brought her lute to la luc and begged he would receive it again and at least keep it till she had taught her inclinations to submit to control  the heart of la luc swelled as she spoke no clara said he it is unnecessary that i should receive your lute the sacrifice you would make proves you worthy of my confidence take back the instrument since you have sufficient resolution to resign it when it leads you from duty i doubt not that you will be able to control its influence now that it is restored to you  clara felt a degree of pleasure and pride at these words such as she had never before experienced but she thought that to deserve the commendation they bestowed it was necessary to complete the sacrifice she had begun in the virtuous enthusiasm of the moment the delights of music were forgotten in those of aspiring to wellearned praise and when she refused the lute thus offered she was conscious only of exquisite sensations dear sir said she tears of pleasure swelling in her eyes allow me to deserve the praises you bestow and then i shall indeed be happy  la luc thought she had never resembled her mother so much as at this instant and tenderly kissing her he for some moments wept in silence when he was able to speak you do already deserve my praises said he and i restore your lute as a reward for the conduct which excites them this scene called back recollections too tender for the heart of la luc and giving clara the inst ument he abruptly quitted the room  la lucs son a youth of much promise was designed by his father for the church and had received from him an excellent education which however it was thought necessary he should finish at an university that of geneva was fixed upon by la luc his scheme had been to make his son not a scholar only he was ambitious that he should also be enviable as a man from early infancy he had accustomed him to hardihood and endurance and as he advanced in youth he encouraged him in manly exercises and acquainted him with the useful arts as well as with abstract science  he was high spirited and ardent in his temper but his heart was generous and affectionate he looked forward to geneva and to the new world it would disclose with the sanguine expectations of youth and in the delight of these expectations was absorbed the regret he would otherwise have felt at a separation from his family  a brother of the late madame la luc who was by birth an english woman resided at geneva with his family to have been related to his wife was a sufficient claim upon the heart of la luc and he had therefore always kept up an intercourse with mr audley though the difference in their characters and manner of thinking would never permit this association to advance into friendship la luc now wrote to him signifying an intention of sending his son to geneva and recommending him to his care to this letter mr audley returned a friendly answer and a short time after an acquaintance of la lucs being called to geneva he determined that his son should accompany him the separation was painful to la luc and almost insupportable to clara madame was grieved and took care that he should have a sufficient quantity of medicines put up in his traveling trunk she was also at some pains to point out their virtues and the different complaints for which they were requisite but she was careful to deliver her lecture during the absence of her brother  la luc with his daughter accompanied his son on horseback to the next town which was about eight miles from leloncourt and there again enforcing all the advice he had formerly given him respecting his conduct and pursuits and again yielding to the tender weakness of the father he bade him farewell clara wept and felt more sorrow at this parting than the occasion could justify but this was almost the first time she had known grief and she artlessly yielded to its influence  la luc and clara traveled pensively back and the day was closing when they came within view of the lake and soon after of the chateau never had it appeared gloomy till now but now clara wandered forlornly through every deserted apartment where she had been accustomed to see her brother and recollected a thousand little circumstances which had he been present she would have thought immaterial but on which imagination now stamped a value the garden the scenes around all wore a melancholy aspect and it was long ere they resumed their natural character and clara recovered her vivacity  near four years had elapsed since this separation when one evening as madame la luc and her niece were sitting at work together in the parlour a good woman in the neighborhood desired to be admitted she came to ask for some medicines and the advice of madame la luc here is a sad accident happened at our house madame said she i am sure my heart aches for the poor young creature  madame la luc desired she would explain herself and the woman proceeded to say that her brother peter whom she had not seen for so many years was arrived and had brought a young lady to her cottage who she verily believed was dying she described her disorder and acquainted madame with what particulars of her mournful story peter had related failing not to exaggerate such as her compassion for the unhappy stranger and her love of the mavelous prompted  the account appeared a very extraordinary one to madame but pity for the forlorn condition of the young sufferer induced her to inquire farther into the affair do let me go to her madam said clara who had been listening with ready compassion to the poor womans narrative do suffer me to go  she must want comforts and i wish much to see how she is madame asked some farther questions concerning her disorder and then taking off her spectacles she rose from her chair and said she would go herself clara desired to accompany her they put on their hats and followed the good woman to the cottage where in a very small close room on a miserable bed lay adeline pale emaciated and unconscious of all around her madame turned to the woman and asked how long she had been in this way while clara went up to the bed and taking the almost lifeless hand that lay on the quilt looked anxiously in her face she observes nothing said she poor creature i wish she was at the chateau she would be better accommodated and i could nurse her there the woman told madame la luc that the young lady had lain in that state for several hours madame examined her pulse and shook her head this room is very close said she  very close indeed cried clara eagerly surely she would be better at the chateau if she could be moved  we will see you about that said her aunt in the mean time let me speak to peter it is some years since i saw him she went to the outer room and the woman ran out of the cottage to look for him when she was gone this is a miserable habitation for the poor stranger said clara she will never be well here do madam let her be carried to our house i am sure my father would wish it besides there is something in her features even inanimate as they now are that prejudices me in her favor  shall i never persuade you to give up that romantic notion of judging people by their faces said her aunt what sort of a face she has is of very little consequence  her condition is lamentable and i am desirous of altering it but i wish first to ask peter a few questions concerning her  thank you my dear aunt said clara she will be removed then madame la luc was going to reply but peter now entered and expressing great joy at seeing her again inquired how monsieur la luc and clara did clara immediately welcomed honest peter to his native place and he returned her salutation with many expressions of surprise at finding her so much grown though i have so often dandled you in my arms maamselle i should never have known you again young twigs shoot fast as they say  madame la luc now inquired into the particulars of adelines story and heard as much as peter knew of it being only that his late master found her in a very distressed situation and that he had himself brought her from the abbey to save her from a french marquis the simplicity of peters manner would not suffer her to question his veracity though some of the circumstances he related excited all her surprise and awakened all her pity tears frequently stood in claras eyes during the course of his narrative and when he concluded she said dear madam i am sure when my father learns the history of this unhappy young woman he will not refuse to be a parent to her and i will be her sister  she deserves it all said peter for she is very good indeed he then proceeded in a strain of praise which was very unusual with him  i will go home and consult with my brother about her said madame la luc rising she certainly ought to be removed to a more airy room the chateau is so near that i think she may be carried thither without much risk  heaven bless you madam cried peter rubbing his hands for your goodness to my poor young lady  la luc had just returned from his evening walk when they reached the chateau madame told him where she had been and related the history of adeline and her present condition by all means have her removed hither said la luc whose eyes bore testimony to the tenderness of his heart she can be better attended to here than in susans cottage  i knew you would say so my dear father said clara i will go and order the green bed to be prepared for her  be patient niece said madame la luc there is no occasion for such haste some things are to be considered first but you are young and romantic  la luc smiled  the evening is now closed resumed madame it will therefore be dangerous to remove her before morning early tomorrow a room shall be got ready and she shall be brought here in the mean time i will go and make up a medicine which i hope may be of service to her  clara reluctantly assented to this delay and madame la luc retired to her closet  on the following morning adeline wrapped in blankets and sheltered as much as possible from the air was brought to the chateau where the good la luc desired she might have every attention paid her and where clara watched over her with unceasing anxiety and tenderness she remained in a state of torpor during the greater part of the day but toward evening she breathed more freely and clara who still watched by her bed had at length the pleasure of perceiving that her senses were restored it was at this moment that she found herself in the situation from which we have digressed to give this account of the venerable la luc and his family the reader will find that his virtues and his friendship to adeline deserved this notice  chapter xvi still fancy to herself unkind awakes to grief the softened mind and points the bleeding friend collins adeline assisted by a fine constitution and the kind atentions of her new friends was in a little more than a week so much recovered as to leave her chamber she was introduced to la luc whom she met with tears of gratitude and thanked for his goodness in a manner so warm yet so artless as interested him still more in her favor during the progress of her recovery the sweetness of her behavior had entirely won the heart of clara and greatly interested that of her aunt whose reports of adeline together with the praises bestowed by clara had excited both esteem and curiosity in the breast of la luc and he now met her with an expression of benignity which spoke peace and comfort to her heart she had acquainted madame la luc with such particulars of her story as peter either through ignorance or inattention had not communicated suppressing only through a false delicacy perhaps an acknowledgement of her attachment to theodore these circumstances were repeated to la luc who ever sensible to the sufferings of others was particularly interested by the singular misfortunes of adeline  near a fortnight had elapsed since her removal to the chateau when one morning la luc desired to speak with her alone she followed him into his study and then in a manner the most delicate he told her that as he found she was so unfortunate in her father he desired she would henceforth consider him as her parent and his house as her home you and clara shall be equally my daughters continued he i am rich in having such children the strong emotions of surprise and gratitude for some time kept adeline silent do not thank me said la luc i know all you would say and i know also that i am but doing my duty i thank god that my duty and my pleasures are generally in unison adeline wiped away the tears which his goodness had excited and was going to speak but la luc pressed her hand and turning away to conceal his emotion walked out of the room  adeline was now considered as a part of the family and in the parental kindness of la luc the sisterly affection of clara and the steady and uniform regard of madame she would have been happy as she was thankful had not unceasing anxiety for the fate of theodore of whom in this solitude she was less likely than ever to hear corroded her heart and embittered every moment of reflection even when sleep obliterated for a while the memory of the past his image frequently arose to her fancy accompanied by all the exaggerations of terror she saw him in chains and struggling in the grasp of ruffians or saw him led amidst the dreadful preparations for execution into the field she saw the agony of his look and heard him repeat her name in frantic accents till the horrors of the scene overcame her and she awoke  a similarity of taste and character attached her to clara yet the misery that preyed upon her heart was of a nature too delicate to be spoken of and she never mentioned theodore even to her friend her illness had yet left her weak and languid and the perpetual anxiety of her mind contributed to prolong this state she endeavored by strong and almost continual efforts to abstract her thoughts from their mournful subject and was often successful la luc had an excellant library and the instruction it offered at once gratified her love of knowledge and withdrew her mind from painful recollections his conversation too afforded her another refuge from misery  but her chief amusement was to wander among the sublime scenery of the adjacent country sometimes with clara though often with no other companion than a book there were indeed times when the conversation of her friend imposed a painful restraint and when given up to reflection she would ramble alone through scenes whose solitary grandeur assisted and soothed the melancholy of her heart here she would retrace all the conduct of her beloved theodore and endeavor to recollect his exact countenance his air and manner now she would weep at the remembrance and then suddenly considering that he had perhaps already suffered an ignominious death for her sake even in consequence of the very action which had proved his love a dreadful despair would seize her and arresting her tears would threaten to bear down every barrier that fortitude and reason could oppose  fearing longer to trust her own thoughts she would hurry home and by a desperate effort would try to lose in the conversation of la luc the remembrance of the past her melancholy when he observed it la luc attributed to a sense of the cruel treatment she had received from her father a circumstance which by exciting his compassion endeared her more strongly to his heart while that love of rational conversation which in her calmer hours so frequently appeared opened to him a new source of amusement in the cultivation of a mind eager for knowledge and susceptible of all the energies of genius she found a melancholy pleasure in listening to the soft tones of claras lute and would often soothe her mind by attempting to repeat the airs she heard  the gentleness of her manners partaking so much of that pensive character which marked la lucs was soothing to his heart and tinctured his behavior with a degree of tenderness that imparted comfort to her and gradually won her entire confidence and affection she saw with extreme concern the declining state of his health and united her efforts with those of the family to amuse and revive him  the pleasing society of which she partook and the quietness of the country at length restored her mind to a state of tolerable composure she was now acquainted with all the wild walks of the neighboring mountains and never tired of viewing their astonishing scenery she often indulged herself in traversing alone their unfrequented paths where now and then a peasant from a neighboring village was all that interrupted the profound solitude she generally took with her a book that if she perceived her thoughts inclined to fix on the one object of her grief she might force them to a subject less dangerous to her peace she had become a tolerable proficient in english while at the convent where she received her education and the instruction of la luc who was well acquainted with the language now served to her he was partial to the english he admired their character and the constitution of their laws and his library contained a collection of their best authors particularly of their philosophers and poets adeline found that no species of writing had power so effectually to withdraw her mind from the contemplation of its own misery as the higher kinds of poetry and in these her taste soon taught her to distinguish the superiority of the english from that of the french the genius of the language more perhaps than the genius of the people if indeed the distinction may be allowed occasioned this  she frequently took a volume of shakespeare or milton and having gained some wild eminence would seat herself beneah the pines whose low murmurs soothed her heart and conspired with the visions of the poet to lull her to forgetfulness of grief  one evening when clara was engaged at home adeline wandered alone to a favorite spot among the rocks that bordered the lake it was an eminence which commanded an entire view of the lake and of the stupendous mountains that environed it a few ragged thorns grew from the precipice beneath which descended perpendicularly to the waters edge and above rose a thick wood of larch pine and fir intermingled with some chestnut and mountain ash the evening was fine and the air so still that it scarcely waved the light leaves of the trees around or rimpled the broad expanse of the waters below adeline gazed on the scene with a kind of still rapture and watched the sun sinking amid a crimson glow which tinted the bosom of the lake and the snowy heads of the distant alps the delight which the scenery inspired soothing each gust of passion into peace all but the swellings of the softened heart that waken not disturb the tranquil mind was now heightened by the tones of a french horn and looking on the lake she perceived at some distance a pleasure boat as it was a spectacle rather uncommon in this solitude she concluded the boat contained a party of foreigners come to view the wonderful scenery of the country or perhaps of genevois who chose to amuse themselves on a lake as grand though much less extensive than their own and the latter conjecture was probably just  as she listened to the mellow and enchanting tones of the horn which gradually sunk away in distance the scene appeared more lovely than before and finding it impossible to forbear attempting to paint in language what was so beautiful in reality she composed the following stanzas how smooth that lake expands its ample breast where smiles in softened glow the summer sky how vast the rocks that over its surface rest how wild the scenes its winding shores supply now down the western steep slow sinks the sun and paints with yellow gleam the tufted woods while here the mountainshadows broad and dun sweep over the crystal mirror of the floods mark how his splendor tips with partial light those shattered battlements that on the brow of yon bold promontory burst to sight from over the woods that darkly spread below in the soft blush of lights reflected power the ridgy rock the woods that crown its steep the illumined battlement and darker tower on the smooth wave in trembling beauty sleep but lo the sun recalls his fervid ray and cold and dim the watery visions fail while over yon cliff whose pointed craggs decay mild evening draws her thin empurpled veil how sweet that strain of melancholy horn that floats along the slowlyebbing wave and up the farreceding mountains borne returns a dying close from echos cave hail shadowy forms of still expressive eve your pensive graces stealing on my heart bid all the fineattund emotions live and fancy all her loveliest dreams impart   la luc observing how much adeline was charmed with the features of the country and desirous of amusing her melancholy which notwithstanding her efforts was often too apparent wished to show her other scenes than those to which her walks was circumscribed he proposed a party on horseback to take a nearer view of the glaciers to attempt their ascent was a difficulty and fatigue to which neither la luc in his present state of health nor adeline were equal she had not been accustomed to ride single and the mountainous road they were to pass made the experiment rather dangerous but she concealed her fears and they were not sufficient to make her wish to forego an enjoyment such as was now offered her  the following day was fixed for this excursion la luc and his party arose at an early hour and having taken a slight breakfast they set out toward the glacier of montanvert which lay at a few leagues distance peter carried a small basket of provisions and it was their plan to dine on some pleasant spot in the open air  it is unnecessary to describe the high enthusiasm of adeline the more complacent pleasure of la luc and the transports of clara as the scenes of this romantic country shifted to their eyes now frowning in dark and gloomy grandeur it exhibited only tremendous rocks and cataracts rolling from the heights into some deep and narrow valley along which their united waters roared and foamed and burst away to regions inaccessible to mortal foot and now the scene arose less fiercely wild the pomp of groves and garniture of fields were intermingled with the ruder features of nature and while the snow froze on the summit of the mountain the vine blushed at its foot  engaged in interesting conversation and by the admiration which the country excited they traveled on till noon when they looked round for a pleasant spot where they might rest and take refreshment at some little distance they perceived the ruins of a fabric which had once been a castle it stood almost on a point of rock that overhung a deep valley and its broken turrets rising from among the woods that embosomed it heightened the picturesque beauty of the object  the edifice invited curiosity and the shades repose  la luc and his party advanced deep struck with awe they marked the dome overthrown where once the beauty bloomed the warrior shone they saw the castles mouldering towers decayed the loose stone tottering over the trembling shade   they seated themselves on the grass under the shade of some high trees near the ruins an opening in the woods afforded a view of the distant alps  the deep silence of solitude reigned for some time they were lost in meditation adeline felt a sweet complacency such as she had long been a stranger to looking at la luc she perceived a tear stealing down his cheek while the elevation of his mind was strongly expressed on his countenance he turned on clara his eyes which were now filled with tenderness and made an effort to recover himself  the stillness and total seclusion of this scene said adeline those stupendous mountains the gloomy grandeur of these woods together with that monument of faded glory on which the hand of time is so emphatically impressed diffuse a sacred enthusiasm over the mind and awaken sensations truly sublime  la luc was going to speak but peter coming forward desired to know whether he had not better open the wallet as he fancied his honor and the young ladies must be main hungry jogging on so far up hill and down before dinner they acknowledged the truth of honest peters suspicion and accepted his hint  refreshments were spread on the grass and having seated themselves under the canopy of waving woods surrounded by the sweets of wild flowers they inhaled the pure breeze of the alps which might be called spirit of air and partook of a repast which these circumstances rendered delicious  when they arose to depart i am unwilling said clara to quit this charming spot how delightful would it be to pass ones life beneath these shades with the friends who are dear to one  la luc smiled at the romantic simplicity of the idea but adeline sighed deeply to the image of felicity and of theodore which it recalled and turned away to conceal her tears  they now mounted their horses and soon after arrived at the foot of montanvert the emotions of adeline as she contemplated in various points of view the astonishing objects around her surpassed all expression and the feelings of the whole party were too strong to admit of conversation the profound stillness which reigned in these regions of solitude inspired awe and heightened the sublimity of the scenery to an exquisite degree  it seems said adeline as if we were walking over the ruins of the world and were the only persons who had survived the wreck i can scarcely persuade myself that we are not left alone on the globe  the view of these objects said la luc lift the soul to their great author and we contemplate with a feeling almost too vast for humanity  the sublimity of his nature in the grandeur of his works  la luc raised his eyes filled with tears to heaven and was for some moments lost in silent adoration  they quitted these scenes with extreme reluctance but the hour of the day and the appearance of the clouds which seemed gathering for a storm made them hasten their departure could she have been sheltered from its fury adeline almost wished to have witnessed the tremendous effect of a thunder storm in these regions  they returned to leloncourt by a different route and the shade of the overhanging precipices was deepened by the gloom of the atmosphere it was evening when they came within view of the lake which the travelers rejoiced to see for the storm so long threatened was now fast approaching the thunder murmured among the alps and the dark vapors that rolled heavily along their sides heightened their dreadful sublimity la luc would have quickened his pace but the road winding down the steep side of a mountain made caution necessary the darkening air and the lightnings that now flashed along the horizon terrified clara but she withheld the expression of her fear in consideration of her father a peal of thunder which seemed to shake the earth to its foundations and was reverberated in tremendous echoes from the cliffs burst over their heads claras horse took fright at the sound and setting off hurried her with amazing velocity down the mountain toward the lake which washed its foot the agony of la luc who viewed her progress in the horrible expectation of seeing her dashed down the precipice that bordered the road is not to be described  clara kept her seat but terror had almost deprived her of sense he efforts to preserve herself were mechanical for she scarcely knew what she did the horse however carried her safely almost to the foot of the mountain but was making toward the lake when a gentleman who traveled along the road caught the bridle as the animal endeavored to pass the sudden stopping of the horse threw clara to the ground and impatient of restraint the animal burst from the hand of the stranger and plunged into the lake the violence of the fall deprived her of recollection but while the stranger endeavored to support her his servant ran to fetch water  she soon recovered and unclosing her eyes found herself in the arms of a chevalier who appeared to support her with difficulty the compassion expressed in his countenance while he inquired how she did revived her spirits and she was endeavoring to thank him for his kindness when la luc and adeline came up the terror impressed on her fathers features was perceived by clara languid as she was she tried to raise herself and said with a faint smile which betrayed instead of disgusing her sufferings dear sir i am not hurt her pale countenance and the blood that trickled down her cheek contradicted her words but la luc to whom terror had suggested the utmost possible evil now rejoiced to hear her speak he recalled some presence of mind and while adeline applied her salts he chased her temples  when she revived she told him how much she was obliged to the stranger la luc endeavored to express his gratitude but the former interrupting him begged he might be spared the pain of receiving thanks for having followed only an impulse of common humanity  they were now not far from leloncourt but the evening was almost shut in and the thunder murmured deeply among the hills la luc was distressed how to convey clara home  in endeavoring to raise her from the ground the stranger betrayed such evident symptoms of pain that la luc inquired concerning it the sudden jerk which the horse had given the arm of the chevalier in escaping from his hold had violently sprained his shoulder and rendered his arm almost useless the pain was exquisite and la luc whose fears for his daughter were now subsiding was shocked at the circumstance and pressed the stranger to accompany him to the village where relief might be obtained he accepted the invitation and clara being at length placed on a horse led by her father was conducted to the chateau  when madame who had been looking out for la luc some time perceived the cavalcade approaching she was alarmed and her apprehensions were confirmed when she saw the situation of her niece clara was carried into the house and la luc would have sent for a surgeon but there was none within several leagues of the village neither were there any of the physical profession within the same distance clara was assisted to her chamber by adeline and madame la luc undertook to examine the wounds the result restored peace to the family for though she was much bruised she had escaped material injury a slight contusion on the forehead had occasioned the bloodshed which at first alarmed la luc madame undertook to restore her niece in a few days with the assistance of a balsam composed by herself on the virtues of which she descanted with great eloquence till la luc interrupted her by reminding her of the condition of her patient  madame having bathed claras bruises and given her a cordial of incomparable efficacy left her and adeline watched in the chamber of her friend till she retired to her own for the night  la luc whose spirits had suffered much perturbation was now tranquillized by the report his sister made of clara he introduced the stranger and having mentioned the accident he had met with desired that he might have immediate assistance madame hastened to her closet and it is perhaps difficulty to determine whether she felt most concern for the sufferings of her guest or pleasure at the opportunity thus offered of displaying her physical skill however this might be she quitted the room with great alacrity and very quickly returned with a phial containing her inestimable balsam and having given the necessary directions for the application of it she left the stranger to the care of his servant  la luc insisted that the chevalier m verneuil should not leave the chateau that night and he very readily submitted to be detained his manners during the evening were as frank and engaging as the hospitality and gratitude of la luc were sincere and they soon entered into interesting conversation m verneuil conversed like a man who had seen much and thought more and if he discovered any prejudice in his opinions it was evidently the prejudice of a mind which seeing objects through the medium of its own goodness tinges them with the hue of its predominant quality la luc was much pleased for in his retired situation he had not often an opportunity of receiving the pleasure which results from a communion of intelligent minds he found that m verneuil had traveled la luc having asked some questions relative to england they fell into discourse concerning the national characters of the french and english  if it is the privilege of wisdom said m verneuil to look beyond happiness i own i had rather be without it when we observe the english their laws writings and conversation and at the same time mark their countenances manners and the frequency of suicide among them we are apt to believe that wisdom and happiness are incompatible if on the other hand we turn to their neighbors the french and see it must be remembered that this was said in the seventeenth century their wretched policy their sparkling but sophistical discourse frivolous occupations and withal their gay animated air we shall be compelled to acknowledge that happiness and folly too often dwell together  it is the end of wisdom said la luc to attain happiness and i can hardly dignify that conduct or course of thinking which tends to misery with the name of wisdom by this rule perhaps the folly as we term it of the french deserves since its effect is happiness to be called wisdom that airy thoughtlessness which seems alike to contemn reflection and anticipation produces all the effect of it without reducing its subjects to the mortification of philosophy but in truth wisdom is an exertion of mind to subdue folly and as the happiness of the french is less the consequence of mind than of constitution it deserves not the honors of wisdom  discoursing on the variety of opinions that are daily formed on the same conduct la luc observed how much that which is commonly called opinion is the result of passion and temper  true said m verneuil there is a tone of thought as there is a key note in music that leads all its weaker affections thus where the powers of judging may be equal the disposition to judge is different and the actions of men are at least but too often arraigned by whim and caprice by partial vanity and the humor of the moment  here la luc took occasion to reprobate the conduct of those writers who by showing the dark side only of human nature and by dwelling on the evils only which are incident to humanity have sought to degrade man in his own eyes and to make him discontented with life what should we say of a painter continued la luc who collected in his piece objects of a black hue only who presented you with a black man a black horse a black dog etc etc and tells you that his is a picture of nature and that nature is black  it is true you would reply the objects you exhibit do exist in nature but they form a very small part of her works you say that nature is black and to prove it you have collected on your canvass all the animals of this hue that exist but you have forgot to paint the green earth the blue sky the white man and objects of all those various hues with which creation abounds and of which black is a very inconsiderable part  the countenance of m verneuil lightened with peculiar animation during the discourse of la luc  to think well of his nature said he is necessary to the dignity and the happiness of man there is a decent pride which becomes every mind and is congenial to virtue that consciousness of innate dignity which shows him the glory of his nature will be his best protection from the meanness of vice where this consciousness is wanting continued m verneuil there can be no sense of moral honor and consequently none of the higher prinples of action what can be expected of him who says it is his nature to be mean and selfish or who can doubt that he who thinks thus thinks from the experience of his own heart from the tendency of his own inclinations let it always be remembered that he who would persuade men to be good ought to show them that they are great you speak said la luc with the honest enthusiasm of a virtuous mind and in obeying the impulse of your heart you utter the truths of philosophy and trust me a bad heart and a truly philosophic head has never yet been united in the same individual vicious inclinations not only corrupt the heart but the understanding and thus lead to false reasoning virtue only is on the side of truth  la luc and his guest mutually pleased with each other entered upon the discussion of subjects so interesting to them both that it was late before they parted for the night  chapter xvii it was such a scene as gave a kind relief to memory in sweetly pensive grief virgils tomb mine be the breezy hill that skirts the down where a green grassy turf is all i crave with here and there a violet bestrown and many an evening sun shine sweetly on my grave the minstrel repose had so much restored clara that when adeline anxious to know how she did went early in the morning to her chamber she found her already risen and ready to attend the family at breakfastmonsieur verneuil appeared also but his looks betrayed a want of rest and indeed he had suffered during the night a degree of anguish from his arm which it was an effort of some resolution to endure in silence it was now swelled and somewhat inflamed and this might in some degree be attributed to the effect of madam la lucs balsam whose restorative qualities had for once failed the whole family sympathised with his sufferings and madame at the request of m verneuil abandoned her balsam and substituted an emollient fomentation  from an application of this he in a short time found an abatement of the pain and returned to the breakfast table with greater composure the happiness which la luc felt at seeing his daughter in safety was very apparent but the warmth of his gratitude toward her preserver he found it difficult to express clara spoke the genuine emotions of her heart with artless but modest energy and testified sincere concern for the sufferings which she had occasioned m verneuil  the pleasure received from the company of his guest and the consideration of the essential services he had rendered him co operated with the natural hospitality of la luc and he pressed m verneuil to remain some time at the chateau  i can never repay the services you have done me said la luc yet i seek to increase my obligations to you by requesting you will prolong your visit and thus allow me an opportunity of cultivating your acquaintance  m verneuil who at the time he met la luc was traveling from geneva to a distant part of savoy merely for the purpose of viewing thecountry being now delighted with his host and with every thing around him willingly accepted the invitation in this circumstance prudence concurred with inclination for to have pursued his journey on horseback in his present situation would have been dangerous if not impracticable  the morning was spent in conversation in which m verneuil displayed a mind enriched with taste enlightened by science and enlarged by observation the situation of the chateau and the features of the surrounding scenery charmed him and in the evening he found himself able to walk with la luc and explore the beauties of this romantic region as they passed through the village the salutations of the peasants in whom love and respect were equally blended and their eager inquiries after clara bore testimony to the character of la luc while his countenance expressed a serene satisfaction arising from the consciousness of deserving and possessing their love  i live surrounded by my children said he turning to m verneuil who had noticed their eagerness for such i consider my parishioners in discharging the duties of my office i am repaid not only by my own conscience but by their gratitude there is a luxury in observing their simple and honest love which i would not exchange for any thing the world calls blessings  yet the world sir would call the pleasures of which you speak romantic said m verneuil for to be sensible of this pure and exquisite delight exquires a heart untainted with the vicious pleasures of society  pleasures that deaden its finest feelings and poison the scource of its truest enjoyments  they pursued their way along the borders of the lake sometimes under the shade of hanging woods and sometimes over hillocks of turf where the scene opened in all its wild magnificence m verneuil often stoped in raptures to observe and point out the singular beauties it exhibited while la luc pleased with the delight his friend expressed surveyed with more than usual satisfaction the objects which had so often charmed him before but there was a tender melancholy in the tone of his voice and his countenance which arose from the recollection of having often traced those scenes and partook of the pleasure they inspired with her who had long since bade them an eternal farewell  they presently quitted the lake and winding up a steep ascent between the woods came after an hours walk to a green summit which appeared among the savage rocks that environed it like the blossom on the thorn it was a spot formed for solitary delight inspiring that soothing tenderness so dear to the feeling mind and which calls back to memory the images of passed regret softened by distance and endeared by frequent recollection wild shrubs grew from the crevices of the rocks beneath and the high trees of pine and cedar that waved above afforded a melancholy and romantic shade the silence of the scene was interrupted only by the breeze as it rolled over the woods and by the solitary notes of the birds that inhabited the cliffs  from this point the eye commanded an entire view of those majestic and sublime alps whose aspect fills the soul with emotions of indescribable awe and seems to lift it to a nobler nature the village and the chateau of la luc appeared in the bosom of the mountains a peaceful retreat from the storms that gathered on their tops all the faculties of m verneuil were absorbed in admiration and he was for some time quite silent at length bursting into a rhapsody he turned and would have addressed la luc when he perceived him at a distance leaning against a rustic urn over which drooped in beautiful luxuriance the weeping willow  as he approached la luc quitted his position and advanced to meet him while m verneuil inquired upon what occasion the urn had been erected la luc unable to answer pointed to it and walked silently away and m verneuil approaching the urn read the following inscription to  m verneuil now comprehended the whole and feeling for his friend was hurt that he had noticed this monument of his grief he rejoined la luc who was standing on the point of the eminence contemplating the landscape below with an air more placid and touched with the sweetness of piety and resignation he perceived that m verneuil was some what disconcerted and he sought to remove his uneasiness you will consider it said he as a mark of my esteem that i have brought you to this spot it is never profaned by the presence of the unfeeling they would deride the faithfulness of an attachment which has so long survived its objects and which in their own breasts would quickly have been lost amidst the dissipation of general society i have cherished in my heart the remembrance of a woman whose virtues claimed all my love i have cherished it as a treasure to which i could withdraw from temporary cares and vexations in the certainty of finding a soothing though melancholy comfort  la luc paused m verneuil expressed the sympathy he felt but he knew the sacredness of sorrow and soon relapsed into silence one of the brightest hopes of a future state resumed la luc is that we shall meet again those whom we have loved upon earth and perhaps our happiness may be permitted to consist very much in the society of our friends purified from the frailties of mortality with the finer affections more sweetly attuned and with the faculties of mind infinitely more elevated and enlarged we shall then be enabled to comprehend subjects which are too vast for human conception to comprehend perhaps the sublimity of that deity who first called us into being these views of futurity my friend elevate us above the evils of this world and seem to communicate to us a portion of the nature we contemplate  call them not the illusions of a visionary brain proceeded la luc i trust in their reality of this i am certain that whether they are illusions or not a faith in them ought to be cherished for the comfort it brings to the heart and reverenced for the dignity it imparts to the mind such feelings make a happy and an important part of our belief in a future existence they give energy to virtue and stability to principle  this said m verneuil is what i have often felt and what every ingenuous mind must acknowledge  la luc and m verneuil continued in conversation till the sun had left the scene the mountains darkened by twilight assumed a sublimer aspect while the tops of some of the highest alps were yet illuminated by the suns rays and formed a striking contrast to the shadowy obscurity of the world below as they descended through the woods and traversed the margin of the lake the stillness and solemnity of the hour diffused a pensive sweetness over their minds and sunk them into silence  they found supper spread as was usual in the hall of which the windows opened upon a garden where the flowers might be said to yield their fragrance in gratitude to the refreshing dews the windows were embowered with eglantine and other sweet shrubs which hung in wild luxuriance around and formed a beautiful and simple decoration clara and adeline loved to pass the evenings in this hall where they had acquired the first rudiments of astronomy and from which they had a wide view of the heavens la luc pointed out to them the planets and the fixed stars explained their laws and from thence taking occasion to mingle moral with scientific instruction would often ascend toward that great first cause whose nature soars beyond the grasp of human comprehension  no study he would sometimes say so much enlarges the mind or impresses it with so sublime an idea of the deity as that of astronomy when the imagination launches into the regions of space and contemplates the innumerable worlds which are scattered through it we are lost in astonishment and awe this globe apappears as a mass of atoms in the immensity of the universe and man a mere insect yet how wonderful that man whose frame is so diminutive in the scale of being should have powers which spurn the narrow boundaries of time and place soar beyond the sphere of his existence penetrate the secret laws of nature and calculate their progressive effects  oh how expressively does this prove the spirituality of our being let the materialist consider it and blush that he has ever doubted  in this hall the whole family now met at supper and during the remainder of the evening the conversation turned upon general subjects in which clara joined in modest and judicious remark la luc had taught her to familiarize her mind to reasoning and had accustomed her to deliver her sentiments freely she spoke them with a simplicity extremely engaging and which convinced her hearers that the love of knowledge not the vanity of talking induced her to converse m verneuil evidently endeavored to draw forth her sentiments and clara interested by the subjects he introduced a stranger to affectation and pleased with the opinions he expressed answered them with frankness and animation they retired mutually pleased with each other  m verneuil was about six and thirty his figure manly his countenance frank and engaging a quick penetrating eye whose fire was softened by benevolence disclosed the chief traits of his character he was quick to discern but generous to excuse the follies of mankind and while no one more sensibly felt an injury none more readily accepted the concession of an enemy  he was by birth a frenchman a fortune lately devolved to him had enabled him to execute the plan which his active and inquisitive mind had suggested of viewing the most remarkable parts of the continent he was peculiarly susceptible of the beautiful and sublime in nature to such a taste switzerland and the adjacent country was of all others the most interesting and he found the scenery it exhibited infinitely surpassing all that his glowing imagination had painted he saw with the eye of a painter and felt with the rapture of a poet  in the habitation of la luc he met with the hospitality the frankness and the simplicity so characteristic of the country in his venerable host he saw the strength of philosophy united with the finest tenderness of humanity  a philosophy which taught him to correct his feelings not to annihilate them in clara the bloom of beauty with the most perfect simplicity of heart and in adeline all the charms of elegance and grace with a genius deserving of the highest culture in this family picture the goodness of madame la luc was not unperceived or forgotten the cheerfulness and harmony that reigned within the chateau was delightful but the philanthropy which flowing from the heart of the pastor was diffused through the whole village and united the inhabitants in the sweet and firm bonds of social compact was divine the beauty of its situation conspired with these circumstances to make leloncourt seem almost a paradise m verneuil sighed that he must so soon quit it i ought to seek no farther said he for here wiswisdom and happiness dwell together  the admiration was reciprocal la luc and his family found themselves much interested in m verneuil and looked forward to the time of his departure with regret so warmly they pressed him to prolong his visit and so powerfully his own inclinations seconded theirs that he accepted the invitation la luc omitted no circumstance which might contribute to the amusement of his guest who having in a few days recovered the use of his arm they made several excursions among the mountains adeline and clara whom the care of madame had restored to her usual health were generally of the party  after spending a week at the chateau m verneuil bade adieu to la luc and his family they parted with mutual regret and the former promised that when he returned to geneva he would take leloncourt in his way as he said this adeline who had for some time observed with much alarm la lucs declining health looked mournfully on his languid countenance and uttered a secret prayer that he might live to receive the visit of m verneuil  madame was the only person who did not lament his departure she saw that the efforts of her brother to entertain his guest were more than his present state of health would admit of and she rejoiced in the quiet that would now return to him  but this quiet brought la luc no respite from illness the fatigue he had suffered in his late excursions seemed to have increased his disorder which in a short time assumed the aspect of a consumption yielding to the solicitations of his family he went to geneva for advice and was there recommended to try the air of nice  the journey thither however was of considerable length and believing his life to be very precarious he hesitated whether to go he was also unwilling to leave the duty of his parish unperformed for so long a period as his health might require but this was an objection which would not have withheld him from nice had his faith in the climate been equal to that of his physicians  his parishioners felt the life of their pastor to be of the utmost consequence to them it was a general cause and they testified at once his worth and their sense of it by going in a body to solicit him to leave them he was much affected by this instan of their attachment such a proof of regard joined with the entreaties of his own family and a consideration that for their sakes it was a duty to endeavor to prolong his life was too powerful to be withstood and he determined to set out for italy  it was settled that clara and adeline whose health la luc thought required change of air and scene should accompany him attended by the faithful peter  on the morning of his departure a large body of his parishioners assembled round the door to bid him farewell it was an affecting scene they might meet no more at length wiping the tears from his eyes la luc said let us trust in god my friends he has power to heal all disorders both of body and mind we shall meet again if not in this world i hope in a better let our conduct be such as to ensure that better  the sobs of his people prevented any reply there was scarcely a dry eye in the village for there was scarcely an inhabitant of it that was not now assembled in the presence of la luc he shook hands with them all farewell my friends said he we shall meet again god grant we may said they with one voice of fervent petition  having mounted his horse and clara and adeline being ready they took a last leave of madame la luc and quitted the chateau the people unwilling to leave la luc the greater part of them accompanied him to some distance from the village as he moved slowly on he cast a last lingering look at his little home where he had spent so many peaceful years and which he now gazed on perhaps for the last time and tears rose to his eyes but he checked them every scene of the adjacent country called up as he passed some tender remembrance he looked toward the spot consecrated to the memory of his deceased wife the dewy vapors of the morning veiled it la luc felt the disappointment more deeply perhaps than reason could justify but those who know from experience how much the imagination loves to dwell on any object however remotely connected with that of our tenderness will feel with him this was an object round which the affections of la luc had settled themselves it was a memorial to the eye and the view of it awakened more forcibly in the memory every tender idea that could associate with the primary subject of his regard in such cases fancy gives to the illusions of strong affection the stamp of reality and they are cherished by the heart with romantic fondness  his people accompanied him for near a mile from the village and could scarcely then be prevailed on to leave him at length he once more bade them farewell and went on his way followed by their prayers and blessings  la luc and his little party traveled slowly on sunk in pensive silence  a silence too pleasingly sad to be soon relinquished and which they indulged without fear of interruption the solitary grandeur of the scenes through which they passed and the soothing murmur of the pines that waved above aided this soft luxury of meditation  they proceeded by easy stages and after traveling for some days among the romantic mountains and green valleys of piedmont they entered the rich county of nice the gay and luxuriant views which now opened upon the travelers as they wound among the hills appeared like scenes of fairy enchantment or those produced by the lonely visions of the poets while the spiral summits of the mountains exhibited the snowy severity of winter the pine the cypress the olive and the myrtle shaded their sides with the green tints of spring and groves of orange lemon and citron spread over their feet the full glow of autumn as they advanced the scenery became still more diversified and at length between the receding heights adeline caught a glimpse of the distant waters of the mediterranean fading into the blue and cloudless horizon she had never till now seen the ocean and this transient view of it roused her imagination and made her watch impatiently for a nearer prospect  it was toward the close of day when the travelers winding round an abrupt projection of that range of alps which crowns the amphitheatre that environs nice looked down upon the green hills that stretch to the shores on the city and its ancient castle and on the wide waters of the mediterranean with the mountains of corsica in the farthest distance such a sweep of sea and land so varied with the gay the magnificent and the awful would have fixed any eye in admiration  for adeline and clara novelty and enthusiasm added their charms to the prospect the soft and salubrious air seemed to welcome la luc to this smiling region and the serene atmosphere to promise invariable summer they at length descended upon the little plain where stands the city of nice and which was the most extensive piece of level ground they had passed since they entered the county here in the bosom of the mountains sheltered from the north and the east where the western gales alone seemed to breathe all the blooms of spring and the riches of autumn were united trees of myrtle bordered the road which wound among groves of orange lemon and bergamot whose delicious fragrance came to the sense mingled with the breath of roses and carnations that blossomed in their shade the gently swelling hills that rose from the plain were covered with vines and crowned with cypresses olives and date trees beyond there appeared the sweep of lofty mountains whence the travelers had descended and whence rose the little river paglion swollen by the snows that melt on their summits and which after meandering through the plain washes the walls of nice where it falls into the mediterranean in this blooming region adeline observed that the countenances of the peasants meagre and discontented formed a melancholy contrast to the face of the country and she lamented again the effects of an arbitrary government where the bounties of nature which were designed for all are monopolized by a few and the many are suffered to starve tantalized by surrounding plenty  the city lost much of its enchantment on a nearer approach its narrow streets and shabby houses but ill answered the expectation which a distant view of its ramparts and its harbor gay with vessels seemed to authorize the appearance of the inn at which la luc now alighted did not contribute to soften his disappointment but if he was surprised to find such indifferent accommodation at the inn of a town celebrated as the resort of valetudinarians he was still more so when he learned the difficulty of procuring furnished lodgings  after much search he procured apartments in a small but pleasant house situated a little way out of the town it had a garden and a terrace which overlooked the sea and was distinguished by an air of neatness very unusual in the houses of nice he agreed to board with the family whose table likewise accommodated a gentleman and lady their lodgers and thus he became a temporary inhabitant of this charming climate  on the following morning adeline rose at an early hour eager to indulge the new and sublime emotion with which a view of the ocean inspired her and walked with clara toward the hills that afforded a more extensive prospect they pursued their way for some time between high embowering banks till they arrived at an eminence whence heaven earth ocean smiled   they sat down on a point of rock overshadowed by lofty palm trees to contemplate at leisure the magnificent scene the sun was just emerged from the sea over which his rays shed a flood of light and darted a thousand brilliant tints on the vapors that ascended the horizon and floated there in light clouds leaving the bosom of the waters below clear as crystal except where the white surges were seen to beat upon the rocks and discovering the distant sails of the fishing boats and the far distant highlands of corsica tinted with aetherial blue clara after some time drew forth her pencil but threw it aside in despair adeline as they returned home through a romantic glen when her senses were no longer absorbed in the contemplation of this grand scenery and when its images floated on her memory only in softened colors repeated the following lines sunrise a sonnet often let me wander at the break of day through the cool vale oerhung with waving woods drink the rich fragrance of the budding may and catch the murmur of the distant floods or rest on the fresh bank of limpid rill where sleeps the vilet in the dewy shade where opening lilies balmy sweets distill and the wild muskrose weeps along the glade or climb the eastern cliff whose airy head hangs rudely over the blue and misty main watch the fine hues of morn through ether spread and paint with roseate glow the crystal plain oh who can speak the rapture of the soul when over the waves the sun first steals to sight and all the world of waters as they roll and heavens vast vault unveils in living light so lifes young hour to man enchanting smiles with sparkling health and joy and fancys fairy wiles   la luc in his walks met with some sensible and agreeable companions who like himself came to nice in search of health of these he soon formed a small but pleasant society among whom was a frenchman whose wild manners marked with a deep and interesting melancholy had particularly attracted la luc he very seldom mentioned himself or any circumstance that might lead to a knowledge of his family but on other subjects conversed with frankness and much intelligence la luc had frequently invited him to his lodgings but he had always declined the invitation and this in a manner so gentle as to disarm displeasure and convince la luc that his refusal was the consequence of a certain dejection of mind which made him reluctant to meet other strangers  the description which la luc had given of this foreigner had excited the curiosity of clara and the sympathy which the unfortunate feel for each other called forth the commiseration of adeline for that he was unfortunate she could not doubt on their return from an evening walk la luc pointed out the chevalier and quickened his pace to overtake him adeline was for a moment impelled to follow but delicacy checked her steps she knew how painful the presence of a stranger often is to a wounded mind and forbore to intrude herself on his notice for the sake of only satisfying an idle curiosity she turned therefore into another path but the delicacy which now prevented the meeting accident in a few days defeated and la luc introduced the stranger adeline received him with a soft smile but endeavored to restrain the expression of pity which her features had involuntarily assumed she wished him not to know that she observed he was unhappy  after this interview he no longer rejected the invitations of la luc but made him frequent visits and often accompanied adeline and clara in their rambles the mild and sensible conversation of the former seemed to soothe his mind and in her presence he frequently conversed with a degree of animation which la luc till then had not observed in him adeline too derived from the similarity of their taste and his intelligent conversation a degree of satisfaction which contributed with the compassion his dejection inspired to win her confidence and she conversed with an easy frankness rather unusual to her  his visits soon became more frequent he walked with la luc and his family he attended them on their little excursions to view those magnisicent remains of roman antiquity which enrich the neighborhood of nice when the ladies sat at home and worked he enlivened the hours by reading to them and they had the pleasure to observe his spirits somewhat relieved from the heavy melancholy that had oppressed him  m amand was passionately fond of music clara had not forgot to bring her beloved lute he would sometimes strike the chords in the most sweet and mournful symphonies but never could be prevailed on to play when adeline or clara played he would sit in deep reverie and lost to every object around him except when he fixed his eyes in mournful gaze on adeline and a sigh would sometimes escape him  one evening adeline having excused herself from accompanying la luc and clara in a visit to a neghbouring family she retired to the terrace of the garden which overlooked the sea and as she viewed the tranquil splendor of the setting sun and his glories reflected on the polished surface of the waves she touched the strings of the lute in softest harmony her voice accompanying it with words which she had one day written after having read that rich effusion of shakespeares genius a midsummer nights dream titania to her love o fly with me through distant air to isles that gem the western deep for laughing summer revels there and hangs her wreath on every steep as through the green transparent sea light floating on its waves we go the nymphs shall gaily welcome me far in their coral caves below for often upon their margin sands when twilight leads the freshning hours i come with all my jocund bands to charm them from their seagreen bowers and well they love our sports to view and on the oceans breast to lave and often as we the dance renew they call up music from the wave swift hie we to that splendid clime where gay jamaica spreads her scene lifts the blue mountain  wild  sublime and smooths her vales of vivid green where throned high in pomp of shade the power of vegetation reigns expanding wide over hill and glade shrubs of all growth  fruit of all stains she steals the sunbeams fervid glow to paint her flowers of mingling hue and over the grape the purple throw breaking from verdant leaves to view there myrtle bowers and citron grove oercanopy our airy dance and there the seabreeze loves to rove when trembles days departing glance and when the false moon steals away or ere the chacing morn does rise often fearless we our gambols play by the fireworms radiant eyes and suck the honeyd reeds that swell in tufted plumes of silver white or pierce the cocoas milky cell to sip the nectar of delight and when the shaking thunders roll and lightnings strike athwart the gloom we shelter in the cedars bole and revel mid the rich perfume but chief we love beneath the palm or verdant plantains spreading leaf to hear upon the midnight calm sweet philomela pour her grief to mortal sprite such dulcet sound such blissful hours were never known o fly with me my airy round and i will make them all thine own   adeline ceased to sing  when she immediately heard repeated in a low voice to mortal sprite such dulcet sound such blissful hours were never known and turning her eyes whence it came she saw m amand she blushed and laid down the lute which he instantly took up and with a tremulous hand drew forth tones that might create a soul under the ribs of death in a melodious voice that trembled with sensibility he sang the following sonnet how sweet is loves first gentle sway when crowned with flowers he softly smiles his blue eyes fraught with tearful wiles where beams of tender transport play hope leads him on his airy way and faith and fancy still beguiles  faith quickly tangled in her toils  fancy whose magic forms so gay the fair deceivers self deceive  how sweet is loves first gentle sway never would that heart he bids to grieve from sorrows soft enchantments stray  never  till the god exulting in his art relentless frowns and wings the envenomed dart   monsieur amand paused he seemed much oppressed and at length bursting into tears laid down the instrument and walked abruptly away to the farther end of the terrace adeline without seeming to observe his agitation rose and leaned upon the wall below which a group of fishermen were busily employed in drawing a net in a few moments he returned with a composed and softened countenance forgive this abrupt conduct said he i know not how to apologize for it but by owning its cause when i tell you madam that my tears flow to the memory of a lady who strongly resembled you and who is lost to me for ever you will know how to pity me  his voice faultered and he paused adeline was silent the lute he resumed was her favorite instrument and when you touched it with such melancholy expression i saw her very image before me but alas why do i distress you with a knowledge of my sorrows she is gone and never to return and you adeline  you  he checked his speech and adeline turning on him a look of mournful regard observed a wildness in his eyes which alarmed her these recollections are too painful said she in a gentle voice let us return to the house m la luc is probably come home  o no replied m amand no  this breeze refreshes me how often at this hour have i talked with her as i now talk with you  such were the soft tones of her voice  such the ineffable expression of her countenance  adeline interrupted him let me beg of you to consider your health  this dewy air cannot be good for invalids he stood with his hands clasped and seemed not to hear her she took up the lute to go and passed her fingers lightly over the chords the sounds recalled his scattered senses he raised his eyes and fixed them in long unsettled gaze upon hers must i leave you here said she smiling and standing in an attitude to depart  i entreat you to play again the air i heard just now said m amand in a hurried voice certainly and she immediately began to play he leaned against a palm tree in an attitude of deep attention and as the sounds languished on the air his features gradually lost their wild expression and he melted into tears he continued to weep silently till the song concluded and it was some time before he recovered voice enough to say adeline i cannot thank you for this goodness my mind has recovered its bias you have soothed a broken heart increase the kindness you have shown me by promising never to mention what you have witnessed this evening and i will endeavor never again to wound your sensibility by a similar offense  adeline gave the required promise and m amand pressing her hand with a melancholy smile hurried from the garden and she saw him no more that night  la luc had been near a fortnight at nice and his health instead of amending seemed rather to decline yet he wished to make a longer experiment of the climate the air which failed to restore her venerable friend revived adeline and the variety and novelty of the surrounding scenes amused her mind though since they could not obliterate the memory of past or suppress the pang of present affection they were ineffectual to dissipate the sick languor of melancholy company by compelling her to withdraw her attention from the subject of her sorrow afforded her a transient relief but the violence of the exertion generally left her more depressed it was in the stillness of solitude in the tranquil observance of beautiful nature that her mind recovered its tone and indulging the pensive inclination now become habitual to it was soothed and fortified of all the grand objects which nature had exhibited the ocean inspired her with the most sublime admiration she loved to wander alone on its shores and when she could escape so long from the duties or the forms of society she would sit for hours on the beach watching the rolling waves and listening to their dying murmur till her softened fancy recalled long lost scenes and restored the image of theodore when tears of despondency too often followed those of pity and regret but these visions of memory painful as they were no longer excited that frenzy of grief they formerly awakened in savoy the sharpness of misery was passed though its heavy influence was not perhaps less powerful to these solitary indulgencies generally succeeded calmness and what adeline endeavored to believe was resignation  she usually rose early and walked down to the shore to enjoy in the cool and silent hours of the morning the cheering beauty of nature and inhale the pure seabreeze every object then smiled in fresh and lively colors the blue sea the brilliant sky the distant fishing boats with their white sails and the voices of the fishermen borne at intervals on the air were circumstances which reanimated her spirits and in one of her rambles yielding to that taste for poetry which had seldom forsaken her she repeated the following lines morning on the sea shore what print of fairy feet is here on neptunes smooth and yellow sands what midnight revels airy dance beneath the moonbeams trembling glance has blessed these shores  what sprightly bands have chased the waves uncheckd by fear whoever they were they fled from morn for now all silent and forlorn these tideforsaken sands appear  return sweet sprites the scene to cheer in vain the call  till moonlights hour again diffuse its softer power titania nor her fairy loves emerge from indias spicy groves then when the shadwy hour returns when silence reigns over air and earth and every star in ether burns they come to celebrate their mirth in frolic ringlet trip the ground bid musics voice on silence win till magic echoes answer round  thus do their festive rites begin o fairy forms so coy to mortal ken your mystic steps to poets only shown o ead me to the brook or hallowed glen retiring far with winding woods oergrown wherever ye best delight to rule if in some forests lone retreat thither conduct my willing feet to the light brink of fountain cool where sleeping in the midnight dew lie springs young buds of every hue yielding their sweet breath to the air to fold their silken leaves from harm and their chill heads in moonshine warm to bright titanias tender care there to the nightbirds plaintive chaunt your carols sweet ye love to raise with oaten reed and pastral lays and guard with forceful spell her haunt who when your antic sports are done often lulls ye in the lilys cell sweet flower that suits your slumbers well and shields you from the rising sun when not to indias steeps ye fly after twilight and the moon in honeyd buds ye love to lie while reigns supreme lights fervid noon nor quit the cell where peace pervades till night leads on the dews and shades even now your scenes enchanted meet my sight i see the earth unclose the palace rise the high dome swell and long arcades of light glitter among the deep embowring woods and glance reflected from the trembling floods while to soft lutes the portals wide unfold and fairy forms of fine aetherial dies advance with frolic steps and laughing eyes their hair with pearl their garments decked with gold pearls that in neptunes briny waves they sought and gold from indias deepest caverns brought thus your light visions to my eyes unveil ye sportive pleasures sweet illusions hail but ah at morns first blush again ye fade so from youths ardent gaze lifes landscape gay and forms in fancys summer hues arrayed dissolve at once in air at truths resplendent day   during several days succeeding that on which m amand had disclosed the cause of his melancholy he did not visit la luc at length adeline met him in one of her solitary rambles on the shore he was pale and dejected and seemed much agitated when he observed her she therefore endeavored to avoid him but he advanced with quickened steps and accosted her he said it was his intention to leave nice in a few days i have found no benefit from the climate added m amand alas what climate can relieve the sickness of the heart i go to lose in the varieties of new scenes the remembrance of past happiness yet the effort is vain i am every where equally restless and unhappy adeline tried to encourage him to hope much from time and change of place time will blunt the sharpest edge of sorrow said she i know it from experience yet while she spoke the tears in her eyes contradicted the assertion of her lips you have been unhappy adeline  yes  i knew it from the first the smile of pity which you gave me assured me that you knew what it was to suffer the desponding air with which he spoke renewed her apprehension of a scene similar to the one she had lately witnessed and she changed the subject but he soon returned to it you bid me hope much from time  my wife  my dear wife  his tongue faultered  it is now many months since i lost her  yet the moment of her death seems but as yesterday adeline faintly smiled you can scarcely judge of the effect of time yet you have much to hope for he shook his head but i am again intruding my misfortunes on your notice forgive this perpetual egotism there is a comfort in the pity of the good such as nothing else can impart this must plead my excuse may you adeline never want it ah those tears   adeline hastily dried them m amand forbore to press the subject and immediately began to converse on indifferent topics they returned toward the chateau but la luc being from home m amand took leave at the door adeline retired to her chamber oppressed by her own sorrows and those of her amiable friend  near three weeks had now elapsed at nice during which the disorder of la luc seemed rather to increase than to abate when his physician very honestly confessed the little hope he entertained from the climate and advised him to try the effect of a sea voyage adding that if the experiment failed even the air of montpellier appeared to him more likely to afford relief than that of nice la luc received this disinterested advice with a mixture of gratitude and disappointment the circumstances which had made him reluctant to quit savoy rendered him yet more so to protract his absence and increase his expenses but the ties of affection that bound him to his family and the love of life which so seldom leaves us again prevailed over inferior considerations and he determined to coast the mediterranean as far as languedoc where if the voyage did not answer his expectations he would land and proceed to montpellier  when m amand learned that la luc designed to quit nice in a few days he determined not to leave it before him during this interval he had not sufficient resolution to deny himself the frequent conversation of adeline though her presence by reminding him of his lost wife gave him more pain than comfort he was the second son of a french gentleman of family and had been married about a year to a lady to whom he had long been attached when she died in her lyingin the infant soon followed its mother and left the disconsolate father abandoned to grief which had preyed so heavily on his health that his physician thought it necessary to send him to nice from the air of nice however he had derived no benefit and he now determined to travel farther into italy though he no longer felt any interest in those charming scenes which in happier days and with her whom he never ceased to lament would have afforded him the highest degree of mental luxury  now he sought only to escape from himself or rather from the image of her who had once constituted his truest happiness  la luc having laid his plan hired a small vessel and in a few days embarked with a sick hope bidding adieu to the shores of italy and the towering alps and seeking on a new element the health which had hitherto mocked his pursuit  m amand took a melancholy leave of his new friends whom he attended to the sea side when he assisted adeline on board his heart was too full to suffer him to say farewell but he stood long on the beach pursuing with his eyes her course over the waters and waving his hand till tears dimmed his sight the breeze wafted the vessel gently from the coast and adeline saw herself surrounded by the undulating waves of the ocean the shore appeared to recede its mountains to lessen the gay colors of its landscape to melt into each other and in a short time the figure of m amand was seen no more the town of nice with its castle and harbor next faded away in distance and the purple tint of the mountains was at length all that remained on the verge of the horizon she sighed as she gazed and her eyes filled with tears so vanished my prospect of happiness said she and my future view is like the waste of waters that surround me her heart was full and she retired from observation to a remote part of the deck where she indulged her tears as she watched the vessel cut its way through the liquid glass the water was so transparent that she saw the sunbeams playing at a considerable depth and fish of various colors glance athwart the current innumerable marine plants spread their vigorous leaves on the rocks below and the richness of their verdure formed a beautiful contrast to the glowing scarlet of the coral that branched beside them  the distant coast at length entirely disappeared adeline gazed with an emotion the most sublime on the boundless expanse of waters that spread on all sides she seemed as if launched into a new world the grandeur and immensity of the view astonished and overpowered her for a moment she doubted the truth of the compass and believed it to be almost impossible for the vessel to find its way over the pathless waters to any shore and when she considered that a plank alone separated her from death a sensation of unmixed terror superseded that of sublimity and she hastily turned her eyes from the prospect and her thoughts from the subject  chapter xviii is there a heart that muse cannot melt alas how is that rgged heart forlorn is there who never the mystic transports felt of solitude and melancholy born he need not woo the muse  he is her scorn beattie toward evening the captain to avoid the danger of encountering a barbary corsair steered for the french coast and adeline distinguished in the gleam of the setting sun the shores of provence feathered with wood and green with pasturage la luc languid and ill had retired to the cabin whither clara attended him the pilot at the helm guiding the small vessel through the sounding waters and one solitary sailor leaning with crossed arms against the mast and now and then singing parts of a mournful ditty were all of the crew except adeline that remained upon deck  and adeline silently watched the declining sun which threw a saffron glow upon the waves and on the sails gently swelling in the breeze that was now dying away the sun at length sunk below the ocean and twilight stole over the scene leaving the shadowy shores yet visible and touching with a solemn tint the waters that stretched wide around she sketched the picture but it was with a saint pencil night over the dim breast of oceans wave night spreads afar her gloomy wings and pensive thought and silence brings save when the distant waters lave or when the mariners lone voice swells faintly in the passing gale or when the screaming seagulls poise over the tall mast and swelling sail bounding the gray gleam of the deep where fancied forms arouse the mind dark sweep the shores on whose rude steep sighs the sad spirit of the wind sweet is its voice upon the air at evnings melancholy close while the smooth wave in silence flows sweet sweet the peace its stealing accents bear blessed be thy shades o night and blessed the song thy low winds breathe the distant shores along   as the shadows thickened the scene sunk into deeper repose even the sailors song had ceased no sound was heard but that of the waters dashing beneath the vessel and their fainter murmur on the pebbly coast adelines mind was in unison with the tranquillity of the hour lulled by the waves she resigned herself to a still melancholy and sat lost in reverie the present moment brought to her recollection her voyage up the rhone when seeking refuge from the terrors of the marquis de montalt she so anxiously endeavored to anticipate her future destiny she then as now had watched the fall of evening and the fading prospect and she remembered what a desolate feeling had accompanied the impression which those objects made she had then no friends  no asylum  no certainty of escaping the pursuit of her enemy now she had found affectionate friends  a secure retreat  and was delivered from the terrors she then suffered  but still she was unhappy the remembrance of theodore  of theodore who had loved her so truly who had encountered and suffered so much for her sake and of whose fate she was now as ignorant as when she traversed the rhone was an incessant pang to her heart she seemed to be more remote than ever from the possibility of hearing of him sometimes a faint hope crossed her that he had escaped the malice of his persecutor but when she considered the inveteracy and power of the latter and the heinous light in which the law regards an assault upon a superior officer even this poor hope vanished and left her to tears and anguish such as this reverie which began with a sensation of only gentle melancholy now led to she continued to muse till the moon arose from the bosom of the ocean and shed her trembling luster upon the waves diffusing peace and making silence more solemn beaming a soft light on thewhite sails and throwing upon the waters the tall shadow of the vessel which now seemed to glide along unopposed by any current her tears had somewhat relieved the anguish of her mind and she again reposed in placid melancholy when a strain of such tender and entrancing sweetness stole on the silence of the hour that it seemed more like celestial than mortal music  so soft so soothing it sunk upon her ear that it recalled her from misery to hope and love she wept again  but these were tears which she would not have exchanged for mirth and joy she looked round but perceived neither ship or boat and as the undulating sounds swelled on the distant air she thought they came from the shore sometimes the breeze wasted them away and again returned them in tones of the most languishing softness the links of the air thus broken it was music rather than melody that she caught till the pilot gradually steering nearer the coast she distinguished the notes of a song familiar to her ear she endeavored to recollect where she had heard it but in vain yet her heart beat almost unconsciously with a something resembling hope still she listened till the breeze again stole the sounds with regret she now perceived that the vessel was moving from them and at length they trembled faintly on the waves sunk away at distance and were heard no more she remained upon the deck a considerable time unwilling to relinquish the expectation of hearing them again and their sweetness still vibrating on her fancy and at length retired to the cabin oppressed by a degree of disappointment which the occasion did not appear to justify  la luc grew better during the voyage his spirits revived and when the vessel entered that part of the mediterranean called the gulf of lions he was sufficiently animated to enjoy from the deck the noble prospect which the sweeping shores of provence terminating in the far distant ones of languedoc exhibited adeline and clara who anxiously watched his looks rejoiced in their amendment and the fond wishes of the latter already anticipated his perfect recovery the expectations of adeline had been too often checked by disappointment to permit her now to indulge an equal degree of hope with that of her friend yet she consided much in the effect of this voyage  la luc amused himself at intervals with discoursing and pointing out the situations of considerable ports on the coast and the mouths of the rivers that after wandering through provence disembogue themselves into the mediterranean the rhone however was the only one of much consequence which he passed on this object though it was so distant that fancy perhaps rather than the sense beheld it clara gazed with peculiar pleasure for it came from the banks of savoy and the wave which she thought she perceived had washed the feet of her dear native mountains the time passed with mingled pleasure and improvement as la luc described to his attentive pupils the manners and commerce of the different inhabitants of the coast and the natural history of the country or as he traced in imagination the remote wanderings of rivers to their source and delineated the characteristic beauties of their scenery  after a pleasant voyage of a few days the shores of provence receded and that of languedoc which had long bounded the distance became the grand object of the scene and the sailors drew near their port they landed in the afternoon at a small town situated at the foot of a woody eminence on the right overlooking the sea and on the left the rich plains of languedoc gay with the purple vine la luc determined to defer his journey till the following day and was directed to a small inn at the extremity of the town where the accommodation such as it was he endeavored to be contented with  in the evening the beauty of the hour and the desire of exploring new scenes invited adeline to walk la luc was fatigued and did not go out and clara remained with him adeline took her way to the woods that rose from the margin of the sea and climbed the wild eminence on which they hung often as she went she turned her eyes to catch between the dark foliage the blue waters of the bay the white sail that flitted by and the trembling gleam of the setting sun when she reached the summit and looked down over the dark tops of the woods on the wide and various prospect she was seized with a kind of still rapture impossible to be expressed and stood unconscious of the flight of time till the sun had left the scene and twilight threw its solemn shade upon the mountains the sea alone reflected the fading splendor of the west its tranquil surface was partially disturbed by the low wind that crept in tremulous lines along the waters whence rising to the woods it shivered their light leaves and died away adeline resining herself to the luxury of sweet and tender emotions repeated the following lines sunset soft over the mountains purple brow meek twillight draws her shadows gray from tufted woods and valleys low lights magic colors steal away yet still amid the spreading gloom resplendent glow the western waves that roll over neptunes coral caves a zone of light on evnings dome on this lone summit let me rest and view the forms to fancy dear till on the oceans darkened breast the stars of evening tremble clear or the moons pale orb appear throwing her line of radiance wide far over the lightlycurling tide that seems the yellow sands to chide no sounds over silence now prevail save of the dying wave below or sailors song borne on the gale or oar at distance striking slow so sweet so tranquil may my evening ray set to this world  and rise in future day   adeline quitted the heights and followed a narrow path that wound to the beach below her mind was now particularly sensible to fine impressions and the sweet notes of the nightingale amid the stillness of the woods again awakened her enthusiasm to the nightingale child of the melancholy song o yet that tender strain prolong her lengthened shade when evening lings from mountaincliffs and forests green and sailing slow on silent wings along the glimmering west is seen i love over pathless hills to stray or trace the winding vale remote and pause sweet bird to hear thy lay while moonbeams on the thin clouds float till over the mountains dewy head pale midnight steals to wake the dead far through the heavens aetherial blue wafted on springs light airs you come with blooms and flowers and genial dew from climes where summer joys to ream o welcome to your longlost home child of the melancholy song who love the lonely woodlandglade to mourn unseen the boughs among when twilight spreads her pensive shade again thy dulcet voice i hail o pour again the liquid note that dies upon the evening gale for fancy loves the kindred tone her griefs the plaintive accents own she loves to hear thy music float at solemn midnights stillest hour and think on friends for ever lost on joys by disappointment crossed and weep anew loves charmful power then memory wakes the magic smile the impassioned voice the melting eye that will not the trusting heart beguile and wakes again the hopeless sigh her skill the glowing tints revive of scenes that time had bade decay she bids the softened passions live  the passions urge again their sway yet over the longregretted scene thy song the grace of sorrow throws a melancholy charm serene more rare than all that mirth bestows then hail sweet bird and hail thy pensive tear to taste to fancy and to virtue dear   the spreading dusk at length reminded adeline of her distance from the inn and that she had her way to find through a wild and lonely wood she bade adieu to the siren that had so long detained her and pursued the path with quick steps having followed it for some time she became bewildered among the thickets and the increasing darkness did not allow her to judge of the direction she was in her apprehensions heightened her difficulties she thought she distinguished the voices of men at some little distance and she increased her speed till she found herself on the sea sands over which the woods impended her breath was now exhausted  she paused a moment to recover herself and fearfully listened but instead of the voices of men she heard faintly swelling in the breeze the notes of mournful music  her heart ever sensible to the impressions of melody melted with the tones and her fears were for a moment lulled in sweet enchantment surprise was soon mingled with delight when as the sounds advanced she distinguished the tone of that instrument and the melody of that wellknown air she had heard a few preceding evenings from the shores of provence but she had no time for conjecture  footsteps approached and she renewed her speed she was now emerged from the darkness of the woods and the moon which shone bright exhibited along the level sands the town and port in the distance the steps that had followed now came up with her and she perceived two men but they passed in conversation without noticing her and as they passed she was certain she recollected the voice of him who was then speaking its tones were so familiar to her ear that she was surprised at the imperfect memory which did not suffer her to be assured by whom they were uttered another step now followed and a rude voice called to her to stop as she hastily turned her eyes she saw imperfectly by the moonlight a man in a sailors habit pursuing while he renewed the call impelled by terror she fled along the sands but her steps were short and trembling  those of her pursuers strong and quick  she had just strength sufficient to reach the men who had before passed her and to implore their protection when her pursuer came up with them but suddenly turned into the woods on the left and disappeared  she had no breath to answer the inquiries of the strangers who supported her till a sudden exclamation and the sound of her own name drew her eyes attentively upon the person who uttered them and in the rays which shone strong upon his features she distinguished m verneuil  mutual satisfaction and explanation ensued and when he learned that la luc and his daughter were at the inn he felt an increased pleasure in conducting her thither he said that he had accidentally met with an old friend in savoy whom he now introduced by the name of mauron and who had prevailed on him to change his route and accompany him to the shores of the mediterranean they had embarked from the coast of provence only a few preceding days and had that evening landed in languedoc on the estate of m mauron adeline had now no doubt that it was the flute of m verneuil and which had so often delighted her at leloncourt that she had heard on the sea  when they reached the inn they found la luc under great anxiety for adeline in search of whom he had sent several people anxiety yielded to surprise and pleasure when he perceived her with m verneuil whose eyes beamed with unusual animation on seeing clara after mutual congratulations m verneuil observed and lamented the very indifferent accommodation which the inn afforded his friends and m mauron immediately invited them to his chateau with a warmth of hospitality that overcame every scruple which delicacy or pride could oppose the woods that adeline had traversed formed a part of his domain which extended almost to the inn but he insisted that his carriage should take his guests to the chateau and departed to give orders for their reception the presence of m verneiul and the kindness of his friend gave la luc an unusual flow of spirits he conversed with a degree of vigor and liveliness to which he had long been unaccustomed and the smile of satisfaction that clara gave to adeline expressed how much she thought he was already benefited by the voyage adeline answered her look with a smile of less confidence for she attributed his present animation to a more temporary cause  about half an hour after the departure of m mauron a boy who served as waiter brought a message from a chevalier then at the inn requesting permission to speak with adeline the man who had pursued her along the sands instantly occurred to her and she scarcely doubted that the stranger was some person belonging to the marquis de montalt perhaps the marquis himself thought that he should have discovered her accidentally in so obscure a place and so immediately upon her arrival seemed very improbable with trembling lips and a countenance pale as death she inquired the name of the chevalier the boy was not acquainted with it la luc asked what sort of a person he was but the boy who understood little of the art of describing gave such a confused account of him that adeline could only learn he was not large but of the middle stature this circumstance however convincing her it was not the marquis de montalt who desired to see her she asked whether it would be agreeable to la luc to have the stranger admitted la luc said by all means and the waiter withdrew adeline sat in trembling expectation till the door opened and louis de la motte entered the room he advanced with an embarrassed and melancholy air though his countenance had been enlightened with a momentary pleasure when he first beheld adeline  adeline who was still the idol of his heart after the first salutations were over all apprehensions of the marquis being now dissipated she inquired when louis had seen monsieur and madame la motte  i ought rather to ask you that question said louis in some confusion for i believe you have seen them since i have and the pleasure of meeting you thus is equalled by my surprise i have not heard from my father for some time owing probably to my regiment being removed to new quarters  he looked as if he wished to be informed with whom adeline now was but as this was a subject upon which it was impossible she could speak in the presence of la luc she led the conversation to general topics after having said that monsieur and madame la motte were well when she left them louis spoke little and often looked anxiously at adeline while his mind seemed laboring under strong oppression she observed this and recollecting the declaration he had made her on the morning of his departure from the abbey she attributed his present embarrassment to the effect of a passion yet unsubdued and did not appear to notice it after he had sat near a quarter of an hour under a struggle of feelings which he could neither conquer or concal he rose to leave the room and as he passed adeline said in a low voice do permit me to speak with you alone for five minutes she hesitated in some confusion and then saying there were none but friends present begged he would be seated  excuse me said he in the same low accent what i would say nearly concerns you and you only do favor me with a few moments attention he said this with a look that surprised her and having ordered candles in another room she went thither  louis sat for some moments silent and seemingly in great perturbation of mind at length he said i know not whether to rejoice or to lament at this unexpected meeting though if you are in safe hands i ought certainly to rejoice however hard the task that now falls to my lot i am not ignorant of the dangers and persecutions you have suffered and cannot forbear expressing my anxiety to know how you are now circumstanced are you indeed with friends  i am said adeline m la motte has informed you  no replied louis with a deep sigh not my father  he paused  but i do indeed rejoice resumed he o how sincerely rejoice that you are in safety could you know lovely adeline what i have suffered  he checked himself  i understood you had something of importance to say sir said adeline you must excuse me if i remind you that i have not many moments to spare  it is indeed of importance replied louis yet i know not how to mention it  how to soften  this task is too severe alas my poor friend  who is it you speak of sir said adeline with quickness louis rose from his chair and walked about the room i would prepare you for what i have to say he resumed but upon my soul i am not equal to it  i entreat you to keep me no longer in suspense said adeline who had a wild idea that it was theodore he would speak of louis still hesitated is it  o is it  i conjure you tell me the worst at once said she in a voice of agony i can bear it  indeed i can  my unhappy friend exclaimed louis o theodore  theodore faintly articulated adeline he lives then  he does said louis but  he stopped   but what cried adeline trembling violently if he is living you cannot tell me worse than my fears suggest i entreat you therefore not to hesitate  louis resumed his seat and endeavoring to assume a collected air said he is living madam but he is a prisoner and  for why should i deceive you i fear he has little to hope in this world  i have long feared so sir said adeline in a voice of forced composure you have something more terrible than this to relate and i again entreat you will explain yourself  he has every thing to apprehend from the marquis de montalt said louis alas why do i say to apprehend his judgment is already fixed  he is condemned to die  at this confirmation of her fears a deathlike paleness diffused itself over the countenance of adeline she sat motionless and attempted to sigh but seemed almost suffocated terrified at her situation and expecting to see her faint louis would have supported her but with her hand she waved him from her and was unable to speak he now called for assistance and la luc and clara with m verneuil informed of adelines indisposition were quickly by her side  at the sound of their voices she looked up and seemed to recollect herself when uttering a heavy sigh she burst into tears la luc rejoiced to see her weep encouraged her tears which after some time relieved her and when she was able to speak she desired to go back to la lucs parlour louis attended her thither when she was better he would have withdrawn but la luc begged he would stay  you are perhaps a relation of this young lady sir said he and may have brought news of her father  not so sir replied louis hesitating  this gentleman said adeline who had now recollected her dissipated thoughts is the son of the m la motte whom you may have heard me mention  louis seemed shocked to be declared the son of a man that had once acted so unworthily toward adeline who instantly perceiving the pain her words occasioned endeavored to soften their effect by saying that la motte had saved her from imminent danger and had afforded her an asylum for many months adeline sat in a state of dreadful solitude to know the particulars of theodores situation yet could not acquire courage to renew the subject in the presence of la luc she ventured however to ask louis if his own regiment was quartered in the town  he replied that his regiment lay at vaceau a french town on the frontiers of spain that he had just crossed a part of the gulf of lions and was on his way to savoy whither he should set out early in the morning  we are lately come from thence said adeline may i ask to what part of savoy you are going  to leloncourt he replied  to leloncourt said adeline in some surprise  i am a stranger to the country resumed louis but i go to serve my friend you seem to know leloncourt  i do indeed said adeline  you probably know then that m la luc lives there and will guess the motive of my journey  o heavens is it possible exclaimed adeline  is it possible that theodore peyrou is a relation of m la luc  theodore what of my son asked la luc in surprise and apprehension  your son said adeline in a trembling voice your son  the astonishment and anguish depictured on her countenance increased the apprehensions of this unfortunate father and he renewed his question but adeline was totally unable to answer him and the distress of louis on thus unexpectedly discovering the father of his unhappy friend and knowing that it was his task to disclose the fate of his son deprived him for some time of all power of utterance and la luc and clara whose fears were every instant heightened by this dreadful silence continued to repeat their questions  at length a sense of th e approaching sufferings of the good la luc overcoming every other feeling adeline recovered strength of mind sufficient to try to soften the intelligence louis had to communicate and to conduct clara to another room here she collected resolution to tell her and with much tender consideration the circumstances of her brothers situation concealing only her knowledge of his sentence being already pronounced this relation necessarily included the mention of their attachment and in the friend of her heart clara discovered the innocent cause of her brothers destruction adeline also learned the occasion of that circumstance which had contributed to keep her ignorant of theodores relationship to la luc she was told the former had taken the name of peyrou with an estate which had been left him about a year before by a relation of his mothers upon that condition theodore had been designed for the church but his disposition inclined him to a more active life than the clerical habit would admit of and on his accession to this estate he had entered into the service of the french king  in the few and interrupted interviews which had been allowed them at caux theodore had mentioned his family to adeline only in general terms and thus when they were so suddenly separated had without designing it left her in ignorance of his fathers name and place of residence  the sacredness and delicacy of adelines grief which had never permitted her to mention the subject of it even to clara had since contributed to deceive her  the distress of clara on learning the situation of her brother could endure no restraint adeline who had commanded her feelings so as to impart this intelligence with tolerable composure only by a strong effort of mind was now almost overwhelmed by her own and claras accumulated suffering while they wept forth the anguish of their hearts a scene if possible more affecting passed between la luc and louis who perceived it was necessary to inform him though cautiously and by degrees of the full extent of his calamity he therefore told la luc that though theodore had been first tried for the offense of having quitted his post he was now condemned on a charge of assault made upon his general officer the marquis de montalt who had brought witnesses to prove that his life had been endangered by the circumstance and who having pursued the prosecution with the most bitter rancour had at length obtained the sentence which the law could not withhold but which every other officer in the regiment deplored  louis added that the sentence was to be executed in less than a fortnight and that theodore being very unhappy at receiving no answers to the letters he had sent his father wishing to see him once more and knowing that there was now no time to be lost had requested him to go to leloncourt and acquaint his father with his situation  la luc received the account of his sons condition with a distress that admitted neither of tears or complaint he asked whether theodore was and desiring to be conducted to him he thanked louis for all his kindness and ordered post horses immediately  a carriage was soon ready and this unhappy father after taking a mournful leave of m verneuil and sending a compliment to m mauron attended by his family set out for the prison of his son the journey was a silent one each individual of the party endeavored in consideration of each other to suppress the expression of grief but was unable to do more la luc appeared calm and complacent he seemed frequently to be engaged in prayer but a struggle for resignation and composure was sometimes visible upon his countenance notwithstanding the efforts of his mind  chapter xix and venomed with disgrace the dart of death seward we now return to the marquis de montalt who having seen la motte safely lodged in the prison of d  y and learning the trial would not come on immediately had returned  his villa on the borders of the forest where he expected to hear news of adeline it had been his intention to follow his servants to lions but he now determined to wait a few days for letters and he had little doubt that adeline since her flight had been so quickly pursued would be overtaken and probably before she could reach that city in this expectation he had been miserably disappointed for his servants informed him that though they traced her thither they had neither been able to follow her route beyond nor to discover her at lions this escape she probably owed to having embarked on the rhone for it does not appear that the marquiss people thought of seeking her on the course of that river  his presence was soon after required at vaceau where the court martial was then sitting thither therefore he went with passions still more exasperated by his late disappointment and procured the condemnation of theodore the sentence was universally lamented for theodore was much beloved in his regiment and the occasion of the marquiss personal resentment toward him being known every heart was interested in his cause  louis de la motte happening at this time to be stationed in the same town heard an imperfect account of his story and being convinced that the prisoner was the young chevalier whom he had formerly seen with the marquis at the abbey he was induced partly from compassion and partly with a hope of hearing of his parents to visit him the compassionate sympathy which louis expressed and the zeal with which he tendered his services affected theodore and excited in him a warm return of friendship louis made him frequent visits did every thing that kindness could suggest to alleviate his sufferings and a mutual esteem and confidence ensued  theodore at length communicated the chief subject of his concern to louis who discovered with inexpressible grief that it was adeline whom the marquis had thus cruelly persecuted and adeline for whose sake the generous theodore was about to suffer he soon perceived also that theodore was his favored rival but he generously suppressed the jealous pang this discovery occasioned and determined that no prejudice of passion should withdraw him from the duties of humanity and friendship he eagerly inquired where adeline then resided she is yet i fear in the power of the marquis said theodore sighing deeply o god  these chains  and he threw an agonizing glance upon them louis sat silent and thoughtful at length starting from his reverie he said he would go to the marquis and immediately quitted the prison the marquis was however already set off for paris where he had been summoned to appear at the approaching trial of la motte and louis yet ignorant of the late transactions at the abbey returned to the prison where he endeavored to forget that theodore was the favored rival of his love and to remember him only as the defender of adeline so earnestly he pressed his offers of service that theodore whom the silence of his father equally surprised and afflicted and who was very anxious to see him once again accepted his proposal of going himself to savoy my letters i stongly suspect to have been intercepted by the marquis said theodore if so my poor father will have the whole weight of this calamity to sustain at once unless i avail myself of your kindness and i shall neither see him nor hear from him before i die louis there are moments when my fortitude shrinks from the conflict and my senses threaten to desert me  no time was to be lost the warrant for his execution had already received the kings signature and louis immediately set forward for savoy the letters of theodore had indeed been intercepted by order of the marquis who in the hope of discovering the asylum of adeline had opened and afterward destroyed them  but to return to la luc who now drew near vaceau and whom his family observed to be greatly changed in his looks since he had heard the late calamitous intelligence he uttered no complaint but it was too obvious that his disorder had made a rapid progress louis who during the journey proved the goodness of his disposition by the delicate attentions he paid this unhappy party concealed his observation of the decline of la luc and to support adelines spirits endeavored to convince her that her apprehensions on this subject were groundless her spirits did indeed require support for she was now within a few miles of the town that contained theodore and while her increasing perturbation almost overcome her she yet tried to appear composed when the carriage entered the town she cast a timid and anxious glance from the window in search of the prison but having passed through several streets without perceiving any building which corresponded with her idea of that she looked for the coach stopped at the inn the frequent changes in la lucs countenance betrayed the violent agitation of his mind and when he attempted to alight feeble and exhausted he was compelled to accept the support of louis to whom he saintly said as he passed to the parlour i am indeed sick at heart but i trust the pain will not be long louis pressed his hand without speaking and hastened back for adeline and clara who were already in the passage la luc wiped the tears from his eyes they were the first he had shed as they entered the room i would go immediately to my poor boy said he to louis yours sir is a mournful office  be so good as to conduct me to him he rose to go but feeble and overcome with grief again sat down adeline and clara united in entreating that he would compose himself and take some refreshment and louis urging the necessity of preparing theodore for the interview prevailed with him to delay it till his son should be informed of his arrival and immediately quitted the inn for the prison of his friend when he was gone la luc as a duty he owed those he loved tried to take some support but the convulsions of his throat would not suffer him to swallow the wine that he held to his parched lips and he was now so much disordered that he desired to retire to his chamber where alone and in prayer he passed the dreadful interval of louiss absence  clara on the bosom of adeline who sat in calm but deep distress yielded to the violence of her grief i shall lose my dear father too said she i see it i shall lose my father and my brother together adeline wept with her friend for some time in silence and then attempted to persuade her that la luc was not so ill as she apprehended  do not mislead me with hope she replied he will not survive the shock of this calamity  i saw it from the first adeline knowing that la lucs distress would be heightened by the observance of his daughters and that indulgence would only increase its poignancy endeavored to arouse her to an exertion of fortitude by urging the necessity of commanding her emotion in the presence of her father this is possible added she however painful may be the effort you must know my dear that my grief is not inferior to your own yet i have hitherto been enabled to support my sufferings in silence for m la luc i do indeed love and reverence as a parent  louis meanwhile reached the prison of theodore who received him with an air of mingled surprise and impatience what brings you back so soon said he have you heard news of my father louis now gradually unfolded the circumstances of their meeting and la lucs arrival at vaceau a various emotion agitated the countenance of theodore on receiving this intelligence my poor father said he he has then followed his son to this ignominious place little did i think when last we parted he would meet me in a prison under condemnation this reflection roused an impetuosity of grief which deprived him for some time of speech but where is he said theodore recovering himself now he is come i shrink from the interview i have so much wished for the sight of his distress will be dreadful to me louis when i am gone  comfort my poor father his voice was again interrupted by sobs and louis who had been fearful of acquainting him at the same time of the arrival of la luc and the discovery of adeline now judged it proper to administer the cordial of this latter intelligence  the glooms of a prison and of calamity vanished for a transient moment those who had seen theodore would have believed this to be the instant which gave him life and liberty when his first emotions subsided i will not repine said he since i know that adeline is preserved and that i shall once more see my father i will endeavor to die with resignation he enquired if la luc was there in the prison and was told he was at the inn with clara and adeline adeline is adeline there too  this is beyond my hopes yet why do i rejoice i must never see her more this is no place for adeline again he relapsed into an agony of distress  and again repeated a thousand questions concerning adeline till he was reminded by louis that his father was impatient to see him  when shocked that he had so long detained his friend he entreated him to conduct la luc to the prison and endeavor to recollect fortitude for the approaching interview  when louis returned to the inn la luc was still in his chamber and clara quitting the room to call him adeline seized with trembling impatience the opportunity to enquire more particularly concerning theodore than she chose to do in the presence of his unhappy sister lewis represented him to be much more tranquil than he really was adeline was somewhat soothed by the account and her tears hitherto restrained flowed silently and fast till la luc appeared his countenance had recovered its serenity but was impressed with a deep and steady sorrow which excited in the beholder a mingled emotion of pity and reverence how is my son sir said he as he entered the room we will go to him immediately  clara renewed the entreaties that had been already rejected to accompany her father who persisted in a refusal tomorrow you shall see him added he but our first meeting must be alone stay with your friend my dear she has need of consolation when la luc was gone adeline unable longer to struggle against the force of grief retired to her chamber and her bed  la luc walked silently toward the prison resting on the arm of lewis it was now night a dim lamp that hung above showed them the gates and louis rung a bell la luc almost overcome with agitation leaned against the postern till the porter appeared he enquired for theodore and followed the man but when he reached the second court yard he seemed ready to faint and again stopped louis desired the porter would fetch some water but la luc recovering his voice said he should soon be better and would not suffer him to go in a few minutes he was able to follow louis who led him through several dark passages and up a flight of steps to a door which being unbarred disclosed to him the prison of his son he was seated at a small table on which stood a lamp that threw a feeble light across the place sufficient only to show its desolation and wretchedness when he perceived la luc he sprung from his chair and in the next moment was in his arms my father said he in a tremulous voice my son exclaimed la luc and they were for some time silent and locked in each others embrace at length theodore led him to the only chair the room afforded and seating himself with louis at the foot of the bed had leisure to observe the ravages which illness and calamity had made on the features of his parent la luc made several efforts to speak but unable to articulate laid his hand upon his breast and sighed deeply fearful of the consequence of so affecting a scene on his shattered frame lewis endeavored to call off his attention from the immediate object of his distress and interrupted the silence but la luc shuddering and complaining he was very cold sunk back in his chair his condition roused theodore from the stupor of despair and while he flew to support his father louis ran out for other assistance  i shall soon be better theodore said la luc unclosing his eye the faintness is already going off i have not been well of late and this sad meeting unable any longer to command himself theodore wrung his hand and the distress which had long struggled for utterance burst in convulsive sobs from his breast la luc gradually revived and exerted himself to calm the transports of his son but the fortitude of the latter had now entirely forsaken him and he could only utter exclamation and complaint ah little did i think we should ever meet under circumstances so dreadful as the present but i have not deserved them my father the motives of my conduct have still been just  that is my supreme consolation said la luc and ought to support you in this hour of trial the almighty god who is the judge of hearts will reward you hereafter trust in him my son i look to him with no feeble hope but with a firm reliance on his justice la lucs voice faultered he raised his eyes to heaven with an expression of meek devotion while the tears of humanity fell slowly on his cheek  still more affected by his last words theodore turned from him and paced the room with quick steps the entrance of louis was a very seasonable relief to la luc who taking a cordial he had brought was soon sufficiently restored to discourse on the subject most interesting to him theodore tried to attain a command of his feelings and succeeded he conversed with tolerable composure for above an hour during which la luc endeavored to elevate by religious hope the mind of his son and to enable him to meet with fortitude the aweful hour that approached but the appearance of resignation which theodore attained always vanished when he reflected that he was going to leave his father a prey to grief and his beloved adeline for ever when la luc was about to depart he again mentioned her afflicting as an interview must be in our present circumstances said he i cannot bear the thought of quitting the world without seeing her once again yet i know not how to ask her to encounter for my sake the misery of a parting scene tell her that my thoughts never for a moment leave her that  la luc interrupted and assured him that since he so much wished it he should see her though a meeting could serve only to heighten the mutual anguish of a final separation  i know it  i know it too well said theodore yet i cannot resolve to see her no more and thus spare her the pain this interview must inflict o my father when i think of those whom i must soon leave for ever my heart breaks but i will indeed try to profit by your precept and example and show that your paternal care has not been in vain my good louis go with my father  he has need of support how much i owe this generous friend added theodore you well know sir  i do in truth replied la luc and can never repay his kindness to you he has contributed to support us all but you require comfort more than myself  he shall remain with you  i will go alone  this theodore would not suffer and la luc no longer opposing him they affectionately embraced and separated for the night  when they reached the inn la luc consulted with louis on the possibility of addressing a petition to the sovereign time enough to save theodore his distance from paris and the short interval before the period fixed for the execution of the sentence made this design difficult but believing it was practicable la luc incapable as he appeared of performing so long a journey determined to attempt it louis thinking that the undertaking would prove fatal to the father without benefiting the son endeavored though faintly to dissuade him from it  but his resolution was fixed  if i sacrifice the small remains of my life in the service of my child said he i shall lose little if i save him i shall gain every thing there is no time to be lost  i will set off immediately  he would have ordered post horses but louis and clara who was now come from the bedside of her friend urged the necessity of his taking a few hours repose he was at length compelled to acknowledge himself unequal to the immediate exertion which the parental anxiety prompted and consented to seek rest  when he had retired to his chamber clara lamented the condition of her father  he will not bear the journey said she he is greatly changed within these few days  louis was so entirely of her opinion that he could not disguise it even to flatter her with a hope she added what did not contribute to raise his spirits that adeline was so much indisposed by her grief for the situation of theodore and the sufferings of la luc that she dreaded the consequence  it has been seen that the passion of young la motte had suffered no abatement from time or absence on the contrary the persecution and the dangers which had pursued adeline awakened all his tenderness and drew her nearer to his heart when he had discovered that theodore loved her and was beloved again he experienced all the anguish of jealousy and disappointment for though she had forbade him to hope he found it too painful an effort to obey her and had secretly cherished the flame which he ought to have stifled his heart was however too noble to suffer his zeal for theodore to abate because he was his favored rival and his mind too strong not to conceal the anguish this certainty occasioned the attachment which theodore had testified toward adeline even endeared him to louis when he had recovered from the first shock of disappointment and that conquest over jealousy which originated in principle and was pursued with difficulty became afterward his pride and his glory when however he again saw adeline  saw her in the mild dignity of sorrow more interesting than ever  saw her though sinking beneath its pressure yet tender and solicitous to soften the afflictions of those around her  it was with the utmost difficulty he preserved his resolution and forbore to express the sentiments she inspired when he farther considered that her acute sufferings arose from the strength of her affection he more than ever wished himself the object of a heart capable of so tender a regard and theodore in prison and in chains was a momentary object of envy  in the morning when la luc arose from short and disturbed slumbers he found louis clara and adeline whom indisposition could not prevent from paying him this testimony of respect and affection assembled in the parlour of the inn to see him depart after a slight breakfast during which his feelings permitted him to say little he bade his friends a sad farewell and stepped into the carriage followed by their tears and prayers  adeline immediately retired to her chamber which she was too ill to quit that day in the evening clara left her friend and conducted by louis went to visit her brother whose emotions on hearing of his fathers departure were various and strong  chapter xx it is only when with inbred horror smote at some base act or done or to be done that the recoiling soul with conscious dread shrinks back into itself mason we return now to pierre de la motte who after remaining some weeks in the prison of d  y was removed to take his trial in the courts of paris whither the marquis de montalt followed to prosecute the charge madame de la motte accompanied her husband to the prison of the chatelet his mind sunk under the weight of his misfortunes nor could all the efforts of his wife rouse him from the torpidity of despair which a consideration of his circumstances occasioned should he be even acquitted of the charge brought against him by the marquis which was very unlikely he was now in the scene of his former crimes and the moment that should liberate him from the walls of his prison would probably deliver him again into the hands of offended justice  the prosecution of the marquis was too well founded and its object of a nature too serious not to justify the terror of la motte soon after the latter had settled at the abbey of st clair the small stock of money which the emergency of his circumstances had left him being nearly exhausted his mind became corroded with the most cruel anxiety concerning the means of his future subsistence as he was one evening riding alone in a remote part of the forest musing on his distressed circumstances and meditating plans to relieve the exigencies which he saw approaching he perceived among the trees at some distance a chevalier on horseback who was riding deliberately along and seemed wholly unattended a thought darted across the mind of la motte that he might be spared the evils which threatened him by robbing this stranger his former practices had passed the boundary of honesty  fraud was in some degree familiar to him  and the thought was not dismissed he hesitated  every moment of hesitation increased the power of temptation  the opportunity was such as might never occur again he looked round and as far as the trees opened saw no person but the chevalier who seemed by his air to be a man of distinction summoning all his courage la motte rode forward and attacked him the marquis de montalt for it was him was unarmed but knowing that his attendants were not far off he refused to yield while they were struggling for victory la motte saw several horsemen enter the extremity of the avenue and rendered desperate by opposition and delay he drew from his pocket a pistol which an apprehension of banditti made him usually carry when he rode to a distance from the abbey and fired at the marquis who staggered and fell senseless to the ground la motte had time to tear from his coat a brilliant star some diamond rings from his fingers and to rifle his pockets before his attendants came up instead of pursuing the robber they all in their first confusion flew to assist their lord and la motte escaped  he stopped before he reached the abbey at a little ruin the tomb formerly mentioned to examine his booty it consisted of a purse containing seventy louis dors of a diamond star three rings of great value and a miniature set with brilliants of the marquis himself which he had intended as a present for his favorite mistress to la motte who but a few hours before had seen himself nearly destitute the view of this treasure excited an almost ungovernable transport but it was soon checked when he remembered the means he had employed to obtain it and that he had paid for the wealth he contemplated the price of blood naturally violent in his passions this reflection sunk him from the summit of exultation to the abyss of despondency he considered himself a murderer and startled as one awakened from a dream would have given half the world had it been his to have been as poor and comparatively as guiltless as a few preceding hours had seen him on examining the portrait he discovered the resemblance and believing that his hand had deprived the original of life he gazed upon the picture with unutterable anguish to the horrors of remorse succeeded the perplexities of fear apprehensive of he knew not what he lingered at the tomb where he at length deposited his treasure believing that if his offense should awaken justice the abbey might be searched and these jewels betray him from madame la motte it was easy to conceal his increase of wealth for as he had never made her acquainted with the exact state of his finances she had not suspected the extreme poverty which menaced him and as they continued to live as usual she believed that their expenses were drawn from the usual supply but it was not so easy to disguise the workings of remorse and horror his manner became gloomy and reserved and his frequent visits to the tomb where he went partly to examine his treasure but chiefly to indulge in the dreadful pleasure of contemplating the picture of the marquis excited curiosity in the solitude of the forest where no variety of objects occurred to renovate his ideas the horrible one of having committed murder was ever present to him  when the marquis arrived at the abbey the astonishment and terror of la motte for at first he scarce knew whether he beheld the shadow or the substance of a human form were quickly succeeded by apprehension of the punishment due to the crime he had really committed when his distress had prevailed on the marquis to retire he informed him that he was by birth a chevalier he then touched upon such parts of his misfortunes as he thought would excite pity expressed such abhorrence of his guilt and voluntarily uttered such a solemn promise of returning the jewels he had yet in his possession for he had ventured to dispose only of a small part that the marquis at length listened to him with some degree of compassion this favorable sentiment seconded by a selfish motive induced the marquis to compromise with la motte of quick and inflammable passions he had observed the beauty of adeline with an eye of no common regard and he resolved to spare the life of la motte upon no other condition than the sacrifice of this unfortunate girl la motte had neither resolution or virtue sufficient to reject the terms  the jewels were restored and he consented to betray the innocent adeline but as he was too well acquainted with her heart to believe that she would easily be won to the practice of vice and as he still felt a degree of pity and tenderness for her he endeavored to prevail on the marquis to forbear precipitate measures and to attempt gradually to undermine her principles by seducing her affections he approved and adopted this plan the failure of his first scheme induced him to employ the stratagems he afterward pursued and thus to multiply the misfortunes of adeline  such were the circumstances which had brought la motte to his present deplorable situation the day of trial was now come and he was led from prison into the court where the marquis appeared as his accuser when the charge was delivered la motte as is usual pleaded not guilty and the advocate nemours who had undertaken to plead for him afterward endeavored to make it appear that the accusation on the part of the marquis de montalt was false and malicious to this purpose he mentioned the circumstance of the latter having attempted to persuade his client to the murder of adeline he farther urged that the marquis had lived in habits of intimacy with la motte for several months immediately preceding his arrest and that it was not till he had disappointed the designs of his accuser by conveying beyond his reach the unhappy object of his vengeance that the marquis had thought proper to charge la motte with the crime for which he stood indicted nemours urged the improbability of one mans keeping up a friendly intercourse with another from whom he had suffered the double injury of assault and robbery yet it was certain that the marquis had observed a frequent intercourse with la motte for some months following the time specified for the commission of the crime if the marquis intended to prosecute why was it not immediately after his discovery of la mo and if not then what had influenced him to prosecute at so distant a period  to is nothing was replied on the part of the marquis for as his conduct on this point had been subservient to his designs on adeline he could not justify it but by exposing schemes which would betray the darkness of his character and invalidate his cause he therefore contented himself with producing several of his servants as witnesses of the assault and robbery who swore without scruple to the person of la motte though not one of them had seen him otherwise than through the gloom of evening and riding off at full speed on a cross examination most of them contradicted each other their evidence was of course rejected but as the marquis had yet two other witnesses to produce whose arrival at paris had been hourly expected the event of the trial was postponed and the court adjourned  la motte was reconducted to his prison under the same pressure of despondency with which he had quitted it as he walked through one of the avenues he passed a man who stood by to let him proceed and who regarded him with a fixed and earnest eye la motte thought he had seen him before but the imperfect view he caught of his features through the duskiness of the place made him uncertain as to this and his mind was in too perturbed a state to suffer him to feel an interest on the subject when he was gone the stranger inquired of the keeper of the prison who la motte was on being told and receiving answers to some farther questions he put he desired he might be admitted to speak with him the request as the man was only a debtor was granted but as the doors were now shut for the night the interview was deferred till the morrow  la motte found madame in his room where she had been waiting for some hours to hear the event of the trial they now wished more earnestly than ever to see their son but they were as he had suspected ignorant of his change of quarters owing to the letters which he had as usual addressed to them under an assumed name remaining at the post house of auboin this circumstance occasioned madame la motte to address her letters to the place of her sons late residence and he had thus continued ignorant of his fathers misfortunes and removal madame la motte surprised at receiving no answers to her letters sent off another containing an account of the trial as far as it had proceeded and a request that her son would obtain leave of absence and set out for paris instantly as she was still ignorant of the failure of her letters and had it been otherwise would not have known whither to have sent them she directed this as usual  mean while his approaching fate was never absent for a moment from the mind of la motte which feeble by nature and still more enervated by habits of indulgence refused to support him at this dreadful period  while these scenes were passing at paris la luc arrived there without any accident after performing a journey during which he had been supported almost entirely by the spirit of his resolution he hastened to throw himself at the feet of the sovereign and such was the excess of his feeling on presenting the petition which was to decide the fate of his son that he could only look silently up and then fainted the king received the paper and giving orders for the unhappy father to be taken care of passed on he was carried back to his hotel where he awaited the event of this his final effort  adeline mean while continued at vaceau in a state of anxiety too powerful for her long agitated frame and the illness in consequence of this confined her almost wholly to her chamber sometimes she ventured to flatter herself with a hope that the journey of la luc would be successful but these short and illusive intervals of comfort served only to heighten by contrast the despondency that succeeded and in the alternate extremes of feeling she experienced a state more torturing than that produced either by the sharp sting of unexpected calamity or the sullen pain of settled despair  when she was well enough she came down to the parlour to converse with louis who brought her frequent accounts of theodore and who passed every moment he could snatch from the duty of his profession in endeavors to support and console his afflicted friends adeline and theodore both looked to him for the little comfort allotted them for he brought them intelligence of each other and whenever he appeared a transient melancholy kind of pleasure played round their hearts he could not conceal from theodore adelines indisposition since it was necessary to account for her not indulging the earnest wish he repeatedly expressed to see her again to adeline he spoke chiefly of the fortitude and resignation of his friend not however forgetting to mention the tender affection he constantly expressed for her accustomed to derive her sole consolation from the presence of louis and to observe his unwearied friendship toward him whom she so truly loved she found her esteem for him ripen into gratitude and her regard daily increase  the fortitude with which he had said theodore supported his calamities was somewhat exaggerated he could not sufficiently forget those ties which bound him to life to meet his fate with firmness but though the paroxysms of grief were acute and frequent he sought and often attained in the presence of his friends a manly composure from the event of his fathers journey he hoped little yet that little was sufficient to keep his mind in the torture of suspense till the issue should appear  on the day preceding that fixed for the execution of the sentence la luc reached vaceau adeline was at her chamber window when the carriage drew up to the inn she saw him alight and with feeble steps supported by peter enter the house from the languor of his air she drew no favorable omen and almost sinking under the violence of her emotion she went to meet him clara was already with her father when adeline entered the room she approached him but dreading to receive from his lips a confirmation of the misfortune his countenance seemed to indicate she looked expressively at him and sat down unable to speak the question she would have asked he held out his hand to her in silence sunk back in his chair and seemed to be fainting under oppression of heart his manner confirmed all her fears at this dreadful conviction her senses failed her and she sat motionless and stupefied  la luc and clara were too much occupied by their own distress to observe her situation after some time she breathed a heavy sigh and burst into tears relieved by weeping her spirits gradually returned and she at length said to la luc it is unnecessary sir to ask the success of your journey yet when you can bear to mention the subject i wish   la luc waved his hand  alas said he i have nothing to tell but what you already guess too well my poor theodore  his voice was convulsed with sorrow and some moments of unutterable anguish followed  adeline was the first who recovered sufficient recollection to notice the extreme languor of la luc and attend to his support she ordered him refreshments and entreated he would retire to his bed and suffer her to send for a physician adding that the fatigue he had suffered made repose absolutely necessary would that i could find it my dear child said he it is not in this world that i must look for it but in a better and that better i trust i shall soon attain but where is our good friend louis la motte he must lead me to my son  grief again interrupted his utterance and the entrance of louis was a very seasonable relief to them all their tears explained the question he would have asked la luc immediately inquired for his son and thanking louis for all his kindness to him desired to be conducted to the prison louis endeavored to persuade him to defer his visit till the morning and adeline and clara joined their entreaties with his but la luc determined to go that night  his time is short said he a few hours and i shall see him no more at least in this world let me not neglect these precious moments adeline i had promised my poor boy that he should see you once more you are not now equal to the meeting i will try to reconcile him to the disappointment but if i fail and you are better in the morning i know you will exert yourself to sustain the interview  adeline looked impatient and attempted to speak la luc rose to depart but could only reach the door of the room where faint and feeble he sat down in a chair i must submit to necessity said he i find i am not able to go farther tonight go to him la motte and tell him i am somewhat disordered by my journey but that i will be with him early in the morning do not flatter him with a hope prepare him for the worst  there was a pause of silence la luc at length recovering himself desired clara would order his bed to be got ready and she willingly obeyed when he withdrew adeline told louis what was indeed unnecessary the event of la lucs journey i own continued she that i had sometimes suffered myself to hope and i now feel this calamity with double force i fear too that m la luc will sink under its pressure he is much altered for the worse since he set out for paris tell me your opinion sincerely  the change was so obvious that louis could not deny it but he endeavored to sooth her apprehension by ascribing this alteration in a great measure to the temporary fatigue of traveling adeline declared her resolution of accompanying la luc to take leave of theodore in the morning i know not how i shall support the interview said she but to see him once more is a duty i owe both to him and myself the remembrance of having neglected to give him this last proof of affection would pursue me with incessant remorse  after some farther conversation on this subject louis withdrew to the prison ruminating on the best means of imparting to his friend the fatal intelligence he had to communicate theodore received it with more composure than he had expected but he asked with impatience why he did not see his father and adeline and on being informed that indisposition withheld them his imagination seized on the worst possibility and suggested that his father was dead it was a considerable time before louis could convince him of the contrary and that adeline was not dangerously ill when however he was assured that he should see them in the morning he became more tranquil he desired his friend would not leave him that night these are the last hours we can pass together added he i cannot sleep stay with me and lighten their heavy moments i have need of comfort louis young as i am and held by such strong attachments i cannot quit the world with resignation i know not how to credit those stories we hear of philosophic fortitude wisdom cannot teach us cheerfully to resign a good and life in my circumstances is surely such  the night was passed in embarrassed conversation sometimes interrupted by long fits of silence and sometimes by the paroxysms of despair and the morning of that day which was to lead theodore to death at length dawned through the grates of his prison  la luc mean while passed a sleepless and dreadful night he prayed for fortitude and resignation both for himself and theodore but the pangs of nature were powerful in his heart and not to be subdued the idea of his lamented wife and of what she would have suffered had she lived to witness the ignominious death which awaited her son frequently occurred to him  it seemed as if a destiny had hung over the life of theodore for it is probable that the king might have granted the petition of the unhappy father had it not happened that the marquis de montalt was present at court when the paper was presented the appearance and singular distress of the petitioner had interested the monarch and instead of putting by the paper he opened it as he threw his eyes over it observing that the criminal was of the marquis de montalts regiment he turned to him and inquired the nature of the offense for which the culprit was about to suffer the answer was such as might have been expected from the marquis and the king was convinced that theodore was not a proper object of mercy  but to return to la luc who was called according to his order at a very early hour having passed some time in prayer he went down to the parlour where louis punctual to the moment already waited to conduct him to the prison he appeared calm and collected but his countenance was impressed with a fixed despair that sensibly affected his young friend while they waited for adeline he spoke little and seemed struggling to attain the fortitude necessary to support him through the approaching scene adeline not appearing he at length sent to hasten her and was told she had been ill but was recovering she had indeed passed a night of such agitation that her frame had sunk under it and she was now endeavoring to recover strength and composure sufficient to sustain her in this dreadful hour every moment that brought her nearer to it had increased her emotion and the apprehension of being prevented seeing theodore had alone enabled her to struggle against the united pressure of illness and grief  she now with clara joined la luc who advanced as they entered the room and took a hand of each in silence after some moments he proposed to go and they stepped into a carriage which conveyed them to the gates of the prison the crowd had already began to assemble there and a confused murmur arose as the carriage moved forward it was a grievous sight to the friends of theodore louis supported adeline when she alighted she was scarcely able to walk and with trembling steps she followed la luc whom the keeper led toward that part of the prison where his son was confined it was now eight oclock the sentence was not to be executed till twelve but a guard of soldiers was already placed in the court and as this unhappy party passed along the narrow avenues they were met by several officers who had been to take a last farewell of theodore as they ascended the stairs that led to his apartment la lucs ear caught the clink of chains and heard him walking above with a quick irregular step the unhappy father overcome by the moment which now pressed upon him stopped and was obliged to support himself by the bannister louis fearing the consequence of his grief might be fatal shattered as his frame already was would have gone for assistance but he made a sign to him to stay i am better said la luc o god support me through this hour and in a few minutes he was able to proceed  as the warder unlocked the door the harsh grating of the key shocked adeline but in the next moment she was in the presence of theodore who sprung to meet her and caught her in his arms before she sunk to the ground as her head reclined on his shoulder he again viewed that countenance so dear to him which had so often lighted rapture in his heart and which though pale and inanimate as it now was awakened him to momentary delight when at length she unclosed her eyes she fixed them in long and mournful gaze upon theodore who pressing her to his heart could answer her only with a smile of mingled tenderness and despair the tears he endeavored to restrain trembled in his eyes and he forgot for a time every thing but adeline la luc who had seated himself at the foot of the bed seemed unconscious of what passed around him and entirely absorbed in his own grief but clara as she clasped the hand of her brother and hung weeping on his arm expressed aloud all the anguish of her heart and at length recalled the attention of adeline who in a voice scarcely audible entreated she would spare her father her words roused theodore and supporting adeline to a chair he turned to la luc my dear child said la luc grasping his hand and bursting into tears my dear child they wept together after a long interval of silence he said i thought i could have supported this hour but i am old and feeble god knows my efforts for resignation my faith in his goodness  theodore by a strong and sudden exertion assumed a composed and firm countenance and endeavored by every gentle argument to sooth and comfort his weeping friends la luc at length seemed to conquer his sufferings drying his eyes he said my son i ought to have set you a better example and practiced the precepts of fortitude i have so often given you but it is over i know and will perform my duty adeline breathed a heavy sigh and continued to weep be comforted my love we part but for a time said theodore as he kissed the tears from her cheek and uniting her hand with that of his fathers he earnestly recommended her to his protection receive her added he as the most precious legacy i can bequeath consider her as your child she will console you when i am gone she will more than supply the loss of your son  la luc assured him that he did now and should continue to regard adeline as his daughter during those afflicting hours he endeavored to dissipate the terrors of approaching death by inspiring his son with religious confidence his conversation was pious rational and consolatory he spoke not from the cold dictates of the head but from the feelings of a heart which had long loved and practiced the pure precepts of christianity and which now drew from them a comfort such as nothing earthly could bestow  you are young my son said he and are yet innocent of any great crime you may therefore look on death without terror for to the guilty only is his approach dreadful i feel that i shall not long survive you and i trust in a merciful god that we shall meet in a state where sorrow never comes where the son of righteousness shall come with healing in his wing as he spoke he looked up the tears still trembled in his eyes which beamed with meek yet servent devotion and his countenance glowed with the dignity of a superior being  let us not neglect the awful moments said la luc rising let our united prayers ascend to him who alone can comfort and support us they all knelt down and he prayed with that simple and sublime eloquence which true piety inspires when he rose he embraced his children separately and when he came to theodore he paused gazed upon him with an earnest mournful expression and was for some time unable to speak theodore could not bear this he drew his hand before his eyes and vainly endeavored to stifle the deep sobs which convulsed his frame at length recovering his voice he entreated his father would leave him this misery is too much for us all said he let us not prolong it the time is now drawing on  leave me to compose myself the sharpness of death consists in parting with those who are dear to us when that is passed death is disarmed  i will not leave you my son replied la luc my poor girls shall go but for me i will be with you in your last moments theodore felt that this would be too much for them both and urged every argument which reason could suggest to prevail with his father to relinquish his design but he remained firm in his determination i will not suffer a selfish consideration of the pain i may endure said la luc to tempt me to desert my child when he will most require my support it is my duty to attend you and nothing shall withhold me  theodore seized on the words of la luc  as you would that i should be supported in my last hour said he i entreat that you will not be witness of it your presence my dear father would subdue all my fortitude  would destroy what little composure i may otherwise be able to attain add not to my sufferings the view of your distress but leave me to forget if possible the dear parent i must quit for ever his tears flowed anew la luc continued to gaze on him in silent agony at length he said well be it so if indeed my presence would distress you i will not go his voice was broken and interrupted after a pause of some moments he again embraced theodore  we must part said he we must part but it is only for a time  we shall soon be reunited in a higher world  o god thou see my heart  thou see all its feelings in this bitter hour  grief again overcame him he pressed theodore in his arms and at length seeming to summon all his fortitude he again said we must part  oh my son farewell for ever in this world  the mercy of almighty god support and bless you  he turned away to leave the prison but quite worn out with grief sunk into a chair near the door he would have opened theodore gazed with a distracted countenance alternately on his father on clara and on adeline whom he pressed to his throbbing heart and their tears flowed together and do i then cried he for the last time look upon that countenance  shall i never  never more behold it  o exquisite misery yet once again  once more continued he pressing her cheek but it was insensible and cold as marble  louis who had left the room soon after la luc arrived that his presence might not interrupt their farewell grief now returned adeline raised her head and perceiving who entered it again sunk on the bosom of theodore  louis appeared much agitated la luc arose we must go said he adeline my love exert yourself  clara  my children let us depart  yet one last  last embrace and then  louis advanced and took his hand my dear sir i have something to say yet i fear to tell it  what do you mean said la luc with quickness no new misfortune can have power to afflict me at this moment do not fear to speak  i rejoice that i cannot put you to the proof replied louis i have seen you sustain the most trying affliction with fortitude can you support the transports of hope  la luc gazed eagerly on louis  speak said he in a faint voice adeline raised her head and trembling between hope and fear looked at louis as if she would have searched his soul he smiled cheerfully upon her is it  o is it possible she exclaimed suddenly reanimated  he lives he lives  she said no more but ran to la luc who sunk sainting in his chair while theodore and clara with one voice called on louis to relieve them from the tortures of suspense  he proceeded to inform them that he had obtained from the commanding officer a respite for theodore till the kings farther pleasure could be known and this in consequence of a letter received that morning from his mother madame de la motte in which she mentioned some very extraordinary circumstances that had appeared in the course of a trial lately conducted at paris and which so materially affected the character of the marquis de montalt as to render it possible a pardon might be obtained for theodore  these words darted with the rapidity of lightning upon the hearts of his hearers la luc revived and that prison so lately the scene of de spair now echoed only to the voices of gratitude and gladness la luc raising his clasped hands to heaven said great god support me in this moment as thou have already supported me  if my son lives i die in peace  he embraced theodore and remembering the anguish of his last embrace tears of thankfulness and joy flowed to the contrast so powerful indeed was the effect of this temporary reprieve and of the hope it introduced that if an absolute pardon had been obtained it could scarcely for the moment have diffused a more lively joy but when the first emotions were subsided the uncertainty of theodores fate once more appeared adeline forbore to express this but clara without scruple lamented the possibility that her brother might yet be taken from them and all their joy be turned to sorrow a look from adeline checked her joy was however so much the predominant feeling of the present moment that the shade which reflection threw upon their hopes passed away like the cloud that is dispelled by the strength of the sun beam and louis alone was pensive and abstracted  when they were sufficiently composed he informed them that the contents of madame de la mottes letter obliged him to set out for paris immediately and that the intelligence he had to communicate intimately concerned adeline who would undoubtedly judge it necessary to go thither also as soon as her health would permit he then read to his impatient auditors such passages in the letter as were necessary to explain his meaning but as madame de la motte had omitted to mention some circumstances of importance to be understood the following is a relation of the occurrences that had lately happened at paris  it may be remembered that on the first day of his trial la motte in passing from the courts to his prison saw a person whose features though imperfectly seen through the dusk he thought he recollected and that this same person after inquiring the name of la motte desired to be admitted to him on the following day the warder complied with his request and the surprise of la motte may be imagined when in the stronger light of his apartment he distinguished the countenance of the man from whose hands he had formerly received adeline  on observing madame de la motte in the room he said he had something of consequence to impart and desired to be left alone with the prisoner when she was gone he told de la motte that he understood he was confined at the suit of the marquis de montalt la motte assented  i know him for a villain said the stranger boldly  your case is desperate do you wish for life  need the question be asked  your trial i understand proceeds tomorrow i am now under confinement in this place for debt but if you can obtain leave for me to go with you into the courts and a condition from the judge that what i reveal shall not criminate myself i will make discoveries that shall confound that same marquis i will prove him a villain and it shall then be judged how far his word ought to be taken against you  la motte whose interest was now strongly excited desired he would explain himself and the man proceeded to relate a long history of the misfortunes and consequent poverty which had tempted him to become subservient to the schemes of the marquis till he suddenly checked himself and said when i obtain from the court the promise i require i will explain myself fully till then i cannot say more on the subject  la motte could not forbear expressing a doubt of his sincerity and a curiosity concerning the motive that had induced him to become the marquiss accuser  as to my motive it is a very natural one replied the man it is no easy matter to receive ill usage without resenting it particularly from a villain whom you have served  la motte for his own sake endeavored to check the vehemence with which this was uttered i care not who hears me continued the stranger but at the same time he lowered his voice i repeat it  the marquis has used me ill  i have kept his secret long enough he does not think it worth while to secure my silence or he would relieve my necessities i am in prison for debt and have applied to him for relief since he does not choose to give it let him take the consequence i warrant he shall soon repent that he has provoked me and it is fit he should  the doubts of la motte were now dissipated the prospect of life again opened upon him and he assured du bosse which was the strangers name with much warmth that he would commission his advocate to do all in his power to obtain leave for his appearance on the trial and to procure the necessary condition after some farther conversation they parted  chapter xxi drag forth the legal monster into light wrench from his hand oppressions iron rod and bid the cruel feel the pains they give  leave was at length granted for the appearance of du bosse with a promise that his words should not criminate him and he accompanied la motte into court  the confusion of the marquis de montalt on perceiving this man was observed by many persons present and particularly by la motte who drew from this circumstance a favorable presage for himself  when du bosse was called upon he informed the court that on the night of the twentyfirst of april in the preceding year one jean daunoy a man he had known many years came to his lodging after they had discoursed for some time on their circumstances daunoy said he knew a way by which du bosse might change all his poverty to riches but that he would not say more till he was certain he would be willing to follow it the distressed state in which du bosse then was made him anxious to learn the means which would bring him relief he eagerly inquired what his friend meant and after some time daunoy explained himself he said he was employed by a nobleman who he afterward told du bosse was the marquis de montalt to carry off a young gir from a convent and that she was to be taken to a house at a few leagues distant from paris i knew the house he described well said du bosse for i had been there many times with daunoy who lived there to avoid his creditors though he often passed his nights at paris he would not tell me more of the scheme but said he should want assistants and if i and my brother who is since dead would join him his employer would grudge no money and we should be well rewarded i desired him again to tell me more of the plan but he was obstinate and after i had told him i would consider of what he said and speak to my brother he went away  when he called the next night for his answer my brother and i agreed to engage and accordingly we went home with him he then told us that the young lady he was to bring thither was a natural daughter of the marquis de montalt and of a nun belonging to a convent of ursalines that his wise had received the child immediately on its birth and had been allowed a handsome annuity to bring it up as her own which she had done till her death the child was then placed in a convent and designed for the veil but when she was of an age to receive the vows she had steadily persisted in refusing them this circumstance had so much exasperated the marquis that in his rage he ordered that if she persisted in her obstinacy she should be removed from the convent and got rid of any way since if she lived in the world her birth might be discovered and in consequence of this her mother for whom he had yet a regard would be condemned to expiate her crime by a terrible death  du bosse was interrupted in his narrative by the council of the marquis who contended that the circumstances alleged tending to criminate his client the proceeding was both irrelevant and illegal he was answered that it was not elevant and therefore not illegal for that the circumstances which threw light upon the character of the marquis affected his evidence against la motte du bosse was suffered to proceed  daunoy then said that the marquis had ordered him to dispatch her but that as he had been used to see her from her infancy he could not find in his heart to do it and wrote to tell him so the marquis then commanded him to find those who would and this was the business for which he wanted us my brother and i were not so wicked as this came to and so we told daunoy and i could not help asking why the marquis resolved to murder his own child rather than expose her mother to the risque of suffering death he said the marquis had never seen his child and that therefore it could not be supposed he felt much kindness toward it and still less that he could love it better than he loved its mother  du bosse proceeded to relate how much he and his brother had endeavored to soften the heart of daunoy toward the marquiss daughter and that they prevailed with him to write again and plead for her daunoy went to paris to await the answer leaving them and the young girl at the house on the heath where the former had consented to remain seemingly for the purpose of executing the orders they might receive but really with a design to save the unhappy victim from the sacrifice  it is probable that du bosse in this instance gave a false account of his motive since if he was really guilty of an intention so atrocious as that of murder he would naturally endeavor to conceal it however this might be he affirmed that on the night of the twentysixth of april he received an order from daunoy for the destruction of the girl whom he had afterward delivered into the hands of la motte  la motte listened to this relation in astonishment when he knew that adeline was the daughter of the marquis and remembered the crime to which he had once devoted her his frame thrilled with horror he now took up the story and added an account of what had passed at the abbey between the marquis and himself concerning a design of the former upon the life of adeline and urged as a proof of the present prosecution originating in malice that it had commenced immediately after he had effected her escape from the marquis he concluded however with saying that as the marquis had immediately sent his people in pursuit of her it was possible she might yet have fallen a victim to his vengeance  here the marquiss council again interfered and their objections were again overruled by the court the uncommon degree of emotion which his countenance betrayed during the narrations of du bosse and de la motte was generally observed the court suspended the sentence of the latter ordered that the marquis should be put under immediate arrest and that adeline the name given by her foster mother and jean daunoy should be sought for  the marquis was accordingly seized at the suit of the crown and put under confinement till adeline should appear or proof could be obtained that she died by his order and till daunoy should confirm or destroy the evidence of de la motte  madame who at length obtained intelligence of her sons resdence from the town where he was formerly stationed had acquainted him with his fathers situation and the proceedings of the trial and as she believed that adeline if she had been so fortunate as to escape the marquiss pursuit was still in savoy she desired louis would obtain leave of absence and bring her to paris where her immediate presence was requisite to substantiate the evidence and probably to save the life of la motte  on the receipt of her letter which happened on the morning appointed for the execution of theodore louis went immediately to the commanding officer to petition for a respite till the kings further pleasure should be known he founded his plea on the arrest of the marquis and showed the letter he had just received the commanding officer readily granted a reprieve and louis who on the arrival of this letter had forborne to communicate its contents to theodore lest it should torture him with false hope now hastened to him with this comfortable news  hapter xxii low on his funeral couch he lies no pitying heart no eye afford a tear to grace his obsequies gray on learning the purpose of madame de la mottes letter adeline saw the necessity of her immediate departure for paris the life of la motte who had more than saved here is the life perhaps of her beloved theodore depended on the testimony she should give and she who had so lately been sinking under the influence of illness and despair who could scarcely raise her languid head or speak but in the faintest accents now reanimated with hope and invigorated by a sense of the importance of the business before her prepared to perform a rapid journey of some hundred miles  theodore tenderly entreated that she would so far consider her health as to delay this journey for a few days but with a smile of enchanting tenderness she assured him that she was now too happy to be ill and that the same cause which would confirm her happiness would confirm her health so strong was the effect of hope upon her mind now that it succeeded to the misery of despair that it overcame the shock she suffered on believing herself a daughter of the marquis and every other painful reflection she did not even foresee the obstacle that circumstance might produce to her union with theodore should he at last be permitted to live  it was settled that she should set off for paris in a few hours with louis and attended by peter these hours were passed by la luc and his family in the prison  when the time of her departure arrived the spirits of adeline again forsook her and the illusions of joy disappeared she no longer beheld theodore as one respited from death but took leave of him with a mournful presentiment that she should see him no more so strongly was this presage impressed upon her mind that it was long before she could summon resolution to bid him farewell and when she had done so and even left the apartment she returned to take of him a last look as she was once more quitting the room her melancholy imagination represented theodore at the place of execution pale and convulsed in death she again turned her lingering eyes upon him but fancy affected her sense for she thought as she now gazed that his countenance changed and assumed a ghastly hue all her resolution vanished and such was the anguish of her heart that she resolved to defer her journey till the morrow though she must by this means lose the protection of louis whose impatience to meet his father would not fuffer the delay the triumph of passion however was transient soothed by the indulgence she promised herself her grief subsided reason resumed its influence she again saw the necessity of her immediate departure and recollected sufficient resolution to submit la luc would have accompanied her for the purpose of again soliciting the king in behalf of his son had not the extreme weakness and lassitude to which he was reduced made traveling impracticable  at length adeline with a heavy heart quitted theodore notwithstanding his entreaties that she would not undertake the journey in her present weak state and was accompanied by clara and la luc to the inn the former parted from her friend with many tears and much anxiety for her welfare but under a hope of soon meeting again should a pardon be granted to theodore la luc designed to fetch adeline from paris but should this be refused she was to return with peter he bade her adieu with a fathers kindness which she repaid with a filial affection and in her last words conjured him to attend to the recovery of his health the languid smile he assumed seemed to express that her solicitude was vain and that he thought his health past recovery  thus adeline quitted the friends so justly dear to her and so lately found for paris where she was a stranger almost without protection and compelled to meet a father who had pursued her with the utmost cruelty in a public court of justice the carriage in leaving vaceau passed by the prison she threw an eager look toward it as she passed its heavy black walls and narrowgrated windows seemed to frown upon her hopes  but theodore was there and leaning from the window she continued to gaze upon it till an abrupt turning in the street concealed it from her view she then sunk back in the carriage and yielding to the melancholy of her heart wept in silence louis was not disposed to interrupt it his thoughts were anxiously employed on his fathers situation and the travelers proceeded many miles without exchanging a word  at paris whither we shall now return the search after jean daunoy was prosecuted without success the house on the heath described by du bosse was found uninhabited and to the places of his usual resort in the city where the officers of the police awaited him he no longer came it even appeared doubtful whether he was living for he had absented himself from the houses of his customary rendezvous some time before the trial of la motte it was therefore certain that his absence was not occasioned by any thing which had passed in the courts  in the solitude of his confinement the marquis de montalt had leisure to reflect on the past and to repent of his crimes but reflection and repentance formed as yet no part of his disposition he turned with impatience from recollections which produced only pain and looked forward to the future with an endeavor to avert the disgrace and punishment which he saw impending the elegance of his manners had so effectually veiled the depravity of his heart that he was a favorite with his sovereign and on this circumstance he rested his hope of security he however severely repented that he had indulged the hasty spirit of revenge which had urged him to the prosecution of la motte and had thus unexpectedly involved him in a situation dangerous  if not fatal  since if adeline could not be found he would be concluded guilty of her death but the appearance of daunoy was the circumstance he most dreaded and to oppose the possibility of this he employed secret emissaries to discover his retreat and to bribe him to his interest these were however as unsuccessful in their research as the officers of police and the marquis at length began to hope the man was really dead  la motte mean while awaited with trembling impatience the arrival of his son when he should be relieved in some degree from his uncertainty concerning adeline on his appearance he rested his only hope of life since the evidence against him would lose much of its validity from the confirmation she would give of the bad character of his prosecutor and if the parliament even condemned la motte the clemency of the king might yet op rate in his favor  adeline arrived at paris after a journey of several days during which she was chiefly supported by the delicate attentions of louis whom she pitied and esteemed though she could not love she was immediately visited at the hotel by madame la motte the meeting was affecting on both sides a sense of her past conduct excited in the latter an embarrassment which the delicacy and goodness of adeline would willingly have spared her but the pardon solicited was given with so much sincerity that madame gradually became composed and reassured this forgiveness however could not have been thus easily granted had adeline believed her former conduct was voluntary a conviction of the restraint and terror under which madame had acted alone induced her to excuse the past in this first meeting they forbore dwelling on particular subjects madame la motte proposed that adeline should remove from the hotel to her lodgings near the chatelet and adeline for whom a residence at a public hotel was very improper gladly accepted the offer  madame there gave her a circumstantial account of la mottes situation and concluded with saying that as the sentence of her husband had been suspended till some certainty could be obtained concerning the late criminal designs of the marquis and as adeline could confirm the chief part of la mottes testimony it was probable that now she was arrived the court would proceed immediately she now learnt the full extent of her obligation to la motte for she was till now ignorant that when he sent her from the forest he saved her from death her horror of the marquis whom she could not bear to consider as her father and her gratitude to her deliverer redoubled and she became impatient to give the testimony so necessary to the hopes of her preserver madame then said she believed it was not too late to gain admittance that night to the chatelet and as she knew how anxiously her husband wished to see adeline she entreated her consent to go thither adeline though much harrassed and fatigued complied when louis returned from m nemcurs his fathers advocate whom he had hastened to inform of her arrival they all set out for the chatelet the view of the prison into which they were now admitted so forcibly recalled to adelines mind the situation of theodore that she with difficulty supported herself to the apartment of la motte when he saw her a gleam of joy passed over his countenance but again relapsing into despondency he looked mournfully at her and then at louis and groaned deeply adeline in whom all remembrance of his former cruelty was lost in his subsequent kindness expressed her thankfulness for the life he had preserved and her anxiety to serve him in warm and repeated terms but her gratitude evidently distressed him instead of reconciling him to himself it seemed to awaken a remembrance of the guilty designs he had once assisted and to strike the pangs of conscience deeper in his heart endeavoring to conceal his emotions he entered on the subject of his present danger and informed adeline what testimony would be required of her on the trial after above an hours conversation with la motte she returned to the lodgings of madame where languid and ill she withdrew to her chamber and tried to obliviate her anxieties in sleep  the parliament which conducted the trial reassembled in a few days after the arrival of adeline and the two remaining witnesses of the marquis on whom he now rested his cause against la motte appeared she was led trembling into the court where almost the first object that met her eyes was the marquis de montalt whom she now beheld with an emotion entirely new to her and which was strongly tinctured with horror when du bosse saw her he immediately swore to her identity his testimony was confirmed by her manner for on perceiving him she grew pale and a universal tremor seized her jean daunoy could no where be found and la motte was thus deprived of an evidence which essentially affected his interest adeline when called upon gave her little narrative with clearness and precision and peter who had conveyed her from the abbey supported the testimony she offered the evidence produced was sufficient to criminate the marquis of the intention of murder in the minds of most people present but it was not sufficient to affect the testimony of his two last witnesses who positively swore to the commission of the robbery and to the person of la motte on whom sentence of death was accordingly pronounced on receiving this sentence the unhappy criminal fainted and the compassion of the assembly whose feelings had been unusually interested in the decision was expressed in a general groan  their attention was quickly called to a new object  it was jean daunoy who now entered the court but his evidence if it could ever indeed have been the means of saving la motte came too late he was reconducted to prison but adeline who extremely shocked by his sentence was much indisposed received orders to remain in the court during the examination of daunoy this man had been at length found in the prison of a provincial town where some of his creditors had thrown him and from which even the money which the marquis had remitted to him for the purpose of satisfying the craving importunities of du bosse had been insufficient to release him meanwhile the revenge of the latter had been roused against the marquis by an imaginary neglect and the money which was designed to relieve his necessities was spent by daunoy in riotous luxury  he was confronted with adeline and with du bosse and ordered to confess all he knew concerning this mysterious affair or to undergo the torture daunoy who was ignorant how far the suspicions concerning the marquis extended and who was conscious that his own words might condemn him remained for some time obstinately silent but when the question was administered his resolution gave way and he confessed a crime of which he had not even been suspected  it appeared that in the year      daunoy together with one jacques martigny and francis balliere had waylaid and seized henry marquis de montalt halfbrother to phillipe and after having robbed him and bound his servant to a tree according to the orders they had received they conveyed him to the abbey of st clair in the distant forest of fontangville here he was confined for some time till farther directions were received from phillipe de montalt the present marquis who was then on his estates in a northern province of france these orders were for death and the unfortunate henry was assassinated in his chamber in the third week of his confinement at the abbey  on hearing this adeline grew faint she remembered the m s she had found together with the extraordinary circumstances that had attended the discovery every nerve thrilled with horror and raising her eyes she saw the countenance of the marquis overspread with the livid paleness of guilt she endeavored however to arrest her fleeting spirits while the man proceeded in his confession  when the murder was perpetrated daunoy had returned to his employer who gave him the reward agreed upon and in a few months after delivered into his hands the infant daughter of the late marquis whom he conveyed to a distant part of the kingdom where assuming the name of st pierre he brought her up as his own child receiving from the present marquis a considerable annuity for his secrecy  adeline no longer able to struggle with the tumult of emotions that now rushed upon her heart uttered a deep sigh and fainted away she was carried from the court and when the confusion occasioned by this circumstance subsided jean daunoy went on he related that on the death of his wife adeline was placed in a convent from whence she was afterward removed to another where the marquis had destined her to receive the vows that her determined rejection of them had occasioned him to resolve upon her death and that she had accordingly been removed to the house on the health daunoy added that by the marquiss order he had misled du bosse with a false story of her birth having after some time discovered that his comrades had deceived him concerning her death daunoy separated from them in enmity but they unanimously determined to conceal her escape from the marquis that they might enjoy the recompense of their supposed crime some months subsequent to this period however daunoy received a letter from the marquis charging him with the truth and promising him a large reward if he would confess where he had placed adeline in consequence of this letter he acknowledged that she had been given into the hands of a stranger but who he was or where he lived was not known  upon these depositions phillipe de montalt was committed to take his trial for the murder of henry his brother daunoy was thrown into a dungeon of the chatelet and du bosse was bound to appear as evidence  the feelings of the marquis who in a prosecution stimulated by revenge had thus unexpectedly exposed his crimes to the public eye and betrayed himself to justice can only be imagined the passions which had tempted him to the commission of a crime so horrid as that of murder  and what if possible heightened its atrocity the murder of one connected with him by the ties of blood and by habits of even infantine association  the passions which had stimulated him to so monstrous a deed were ambition and the love of pleasure the first was more immediately gratified by the title of his brother the latter by the riches which would enable him to indulge his voluptuous inclinations  the late marquis de montalt the father of adeline received from his ancestors a patrimony very inadequate to support the splendor of his rank but he had married the heiress of an illustrious family whose fortune amply supplied the deficiency of his own he had the misfortune to lose her for she was amiable and beautiful soon after the birth of a daughter and it was then that the present marquis formed the diabolical design of destroying his brother the contrast of their characters prevented that cordial regard between them which their near relationship seemed to demand henry was benevolent mild and contemplative in his heart reigned the love of virtue in his manners the strictness of justness was tempered not weakened by mercy his mind was enlarged by science and adorned by elegant literature the character of phillipe has been already delineated in his actions its nicer shades were blended with some shining tints but these served only to render more striking by contrast the general darkness of the portrait  he had married a lady who by the death of her brother inherited considerable estates of which the abbey of st clair and the villa on the borders of the forest of fontangville were the chief his passion for magnificence and dissipation however soon involved him in difficulties and pointed out to him the convenience of possessing his brothers wealth his brother and his infant daughter only stood between him and his wishes how he removed the father has been already related why he did not employ the same means to secure the child seems somewhat surprising unless we admit that a destiny hung over him on this occasion and that she was suffered to live as an instrument to punish the murderer of her parent when a retrospect is taken of the vicissitudes and dangers to which she had been exposed from her earliest infancy it appears as if her preservation was the effect of something more than human policy and affords a striking instance that justice however long delayed will overtake the guilty  while the late unhappy marquis was suffering at the abbey his brother who to avoid suspicion remained in the north of france delayed the execution of his horrid purpose from a timidity natural to a mind not yet inured to enormous guilt before he dared to deliver his final orders he waited to know whether the story he contrived to propagate of his brothers death would veil his crime from suspicion it succeeded but too well for the servant whose life had been spared that he might relate the tale naturally enough concluded that his lord had been murdered by banditti and the peasant who a few hours after found the servant wounded bleeding and bound to a tree and knew also that this spot was infested by robbers as naturally believed him and spread the report accordingly  from this period the marquis to whom the abbey of st clair belonged in right of his wife visited it only twice and that at distant times till after an interval of several years he accidentally found la motte its inhabitant he resided at paris and on his estate in the north except that once a year he usually passed a month at his delightful villa on the borders of the forest in the busy scenes of the court and in the dissipations of pleasure he tried to lose the remembrance of his guilt but there were times when the voice of conscience would be heard though it was soon again lost in the tumult of the world  it is probable that on the night of his abrupt departure from the abbey the solitary silence and gloom of the hour in a place which had been the scene of his former crime called up the remembrance of his brother with a force too powerful for fancy and awakened horrors which compelled him to quit the polluted spot if it was so it is however certain that the specter of conscience vanished with the darkness for on the following day he returned to the abbey though it may be observed he never attempted to pass another night there but though terror was roused for a transient moment neither pity or repentance succeeded since when the discovery of adelines birth excited apprehension for his own life he did not hesitate to repeat the crime and would again have stained his soul with human blood this discovery was effected by means of a seal bearing the arms of her mothers family which was impressed on the note his servant had found and had delivered to him at caux it may be remembered that having read this note he was throwing it from him in the fury of jealousy but that after examining it again it was carefully deposited in his pocketbook the violent agitation which a suspicion of this terrible truth occasioned deprived him for a while of all power to act when he was well enough to write he dispatched a letter to daunoy the purport of which has been already mentioned from daunoy he received the confirmation of his fears knowing that his life must pay the forfeiture of his crime should adeline ever obtain a knowledge of her birth and not daring again to confide in the secrecy of a man who had once deceived him he resolved after some deliberation on her death he immediately set out for the abbey and gave those directions concerning her which terror for his own safety still more than a desire of retaining her estates suggested  as the history of the seal which revealed the birth of adeline is rather remarkable it may not be amiss to mention that it was stolen from the marquis together with a gold watch by jean daunoy the watch was soon disposed of but the seal had been kept as a pretty trinket by his wife and at her death went with adeline among her clothes to the convent adeline had carefully preserved it because it had once belonged to the woman whom she believed to have been her mother  chapter xxiii while anxious doubt distracts the tortured heart  we now return to the course of the narrative and to adeline who was carried from the court to the lodging of madame de la motte madame was however at the chatelet with her husband suffering all the distress which the sentence pronounced against him might be supposed to inflict the feeble frame of adeline so long harrassed by grief and fatigue almost sunk under the agitation which the discovery of her birth excited her feelings on this occasion were too complex to be analyzed from an orphan subsisting on the bounty of others without family with few friends and pursued by a cruel and powerful enemy she saw herself suddenly transformed to the daughter of an illustrious house and the heiress of immense wealth but she learned also that her father had been murdered  murdered in the prime of his days  murdered by means of his brother against whom she must now appear and in punishing the destroyer of her parent doom her uncle to death  when she remembered the manuscript so fingularly found and considered that when she wept for the sufferings it described her tears had flowed for those of her father her emotion cannot easily be imagined the circumstances attending the discovery of these and papers no longer appeared to be a work of chance but of a power whose designs are great and just o my father she would exclaim your last wish is fulfilled  the pitying heart you wished might trace your sufferings shall avenge them  on the return of madame la motte adeline endeavored as usual to suppress her own emotions that she might sooth the affliction of her friend she related what had passed in the courts after the departure of la motte and thus excited even in the sorrowful heart of madame a momentary gleam of satisfaction adeline determined to recover if possible the manuscript on inquiry she learned that la motte in the confusion of his departure had left it among other things at the abbey this circumstance much distressed her the more so because she believed its appearance might be of importance on the approaching trial she determined however if she should recover her rights to have the manuscript sought for  in the evening louis joined this mournful party he came immediately from his father whom he left more tranquil than he had been since the fatal sentence was pronounced after a silent and melancholy supper they separated for the night and adeline in the solitude of her chamber had leisure to meditate on the discoveries of this eventful day the sufferings of her dead father such as she had read them recorded by his own hand pressed most forcibly to her thoughts the narrative had formerly so much affected her heart and interested her imagination that her memory now faithfully reflected each particular circumstance there disclosed but when she considered that she had been in the very chamber where her parent had suffered where even his life had been sacrificed and that she had probably seen the very dagger seen it stained with rust the rust of blood by which he had fallen the anguish and horror of her mind defied all control  on the following day adeline received orders to prepare for the prosecution of the marquis de montalt which was to commence as soon as the requisite witnesses could be collected among these were the abbess of the convent who had received her from the hands of daunoy madame la motte who was present when du bosse compelled her husband to receive adeline and peter who had not only been witness to this circumstance but who had conveyed her from the abbey that she might escape the designs of the marquis la motte and theodore la luc were incapacitated by the sentence of the law from appearing on the trial  when la motte was informed of the discovery of adelines birth and that her father had been murdered at the abbey of st clair he instantly remembered and mentioned to his wife the skeleton he found in the stone room leading to the subterranean cells neither of them doubted from the situation in which it lay hid in a chest in an obscure room strongly guarded that la motte had seen the remains of the late marquis madame however determined not to shock adeline with the mention of this circumstance till it should be necessary to declare it on the trial  as the time of this trial drew near the distress and agitation of adeline increased though justice demanded the life of the murderer and though the tenderness and pity which the idea of her father called forth urged her to avenge his death she could not without horror consider herself as the instrument of dispensing that justice which would deprive a fellowbeing of existence and there were times when she wished the secret of her birth had never been revealed if this sensibility was in her peculiar circumstances a weakness it was at least an amiable one and as such deserves to be reverenced  the accounts she received from vaceau of the health of m la luc did not contribute to tranquillize her mind the symptoms described by clara seemed to say that he was in the last stage of a consumption and the grief of theodore and herself on this occasion was expressed in her letters with the lively eloquence so natural to her adeline loved and revered la luc for his own worth and for the parental tenderness he had showed her but he was still dearer to her as the father of theodore and her concern for his declining state was not inferior to that of his children it was increased by the reflection that she had probably been the means of shortening his life for she too well knew that the distress occasioned him by the situation in which it had been her misfortune to involve theodore had shattered his frame to its present infirmity the same cause also withheld him from seeking in the climate of montpellier the relief he had formerly been taught to expect there when she looked round on the condition of her friends her heart was almost overwhelmed with the prospect it seemed as if she was destined to involve all those most dear to her in calamity with respect to la motte whatever were his vices and whatever the designs in which he had formerly engaged against her she forgot them all in the service he had finally rendered her and considered it to be as much her duty as she felt it to be her inclination to intercede in his behalf this however in her present situation she could not do with any hope of success but if the suit upon which depended the establishment of her rank her fortune and consequently her influence should be decided in her favor she determined to throw herself at the kings feet and when she pleaded the cause of theodore ask the life of la motte  a few days preceding that of the trial adeline was informed a stranger desired to speak with her and on going to the room where he was she found m verneuil her countenance expressed both surprise and satisfaction at this unexpected meeting and she inquired though with little expectation of an affirmative if he had heard of m la luc i have seen him said m verneuil i am just come from vaceau but i am sorry i cannot give you a better account of his health he is greatly altered since i saw him before  adeline could scarcely refrain from tears at the recollection these words revived of the calamities which had occasioned this lamented change m verneuil delivered her a packet from clara as he presented it he said beside this introduction to your notice i have a claim of a different kind which i am proud to assert and which which will perhaps justify the permission i ask of speaking upon your affairs  adeline bowed and m verneuil with a countenance expressive of the most tender solicitude added that he had heard of the late proceeding of the parliament of paris and of the discoveries that so intimately concerned her i know not continued he whether i ought to congratulate or condole with you on this trying occasion that i sincerely sympathize in all that concerns you i hope you will believe and i cannot deny myself the pleasure of telling you that i am related though distantly to the late marchioness your mother for that she was your mother i cannot doubt  adeline rose hastily and advanced toward m verneuil surprise and satisfaction reanimated her features do i indeed see a relation said she in a sweet and tremulous voice and one whom i can welcome as a friend tears trembled in her eyes and she received m verneuils embrace in silence it was some time before her emotion would permit her to speak  to adeline who from her earliest infancy had been abandoned to strangers a forlorn and helpless orphan who had never till lately known a relation and who then found one in the person of an inveterate enemy to her this discovery was as delightful as unexpected bt after struggling for  emotions that pressed upon her heart she begged m verneuil permission to withdraw till she could recover composure he would have taken leave but she entreated him not to go  the interest which m verneuil took in the concerns of la luc which was strengthened by his increasing regard for clara had drawn him to vaceau where he was informed of the family and peculiar circumstances of adeline on receiving this intelligence he immediately set out for paris to offer his protection and assistance to his newlydiscovered relation and to aid if possible the cause of theodore  adeline in a short time returned and could then bear to converse on the subject of her family m verneuil offered her his support and assistance if they should be found necessary but i trust added he to the justness of your cause and hope it will not require any adventitious aid to those who remember the late marchioness your features bring sufficient evidence of your birth as a proof that my judgment in this instance is not biassed by prejudice the resemblance struck me when i was in savoy though i knew the marchioness only by her portrait and i believe i mentioned to m la luc that you often reminded me of a deceased relation you may form some judgment of this yourself added m verneuil taking a miniature from his pocket this was your amiable mother  adelines countenance changed she received the picture eagerly gazed on it for a long time in silence and her eyes filled with tears it was not the resemblance she studied but the countenance  the mild and beautiful countenance of her parent whose blue eyes full of tender sweetness seemed bent upon here is while a soft smile played on her lips adeline pressed the picture to here is and again gazed in silent reverie at length with a deep sigh she said this surely was my mother had she but lived o my poor father you had been spared this reflection quite overcame her and she burst into tears m verneuil did not interrupt her grief but took her hand and sat by her without speaking till she became more composed again kissing the picture she held it out to him with a hesitating look no said he it is already with its true owner she thanked him with a smile of ineffable sweetness and after some conversation on the subject of the approaching trial on which occasion she requested m verneuil would support her by his presence he withdrew having begged leave to repeat his visit on the following day  adeline now opened her packet and saw once more the wellknown characters of theodore for a moment she felt as if in his presence and the conscious blush overspread her cheek with a trembling hand she broke the seal and read the tenderest assurances and solicitudes of his love she often paused that she might prolong the sweet emotions which these assurances awakened but while tears of tenderness stood trembling on her eyelids the bitter recollection of his situation would return and they fell in anguish on her bosom  he congratulated her and with peculiar delicacy on the prospects of life which were opening to her said every thing that might tend to animate and support her but avoided dwelling on his own circumstances except by expressing his sense of the zeal and kindness of his commanding officer and adding that he did not despair of finally obtaining a pardon  this hope though but faintly expressed and written evidently for the purpose of consoling adeline did not entirely fail of the desired effect she yielded to its enchanting influence and forgot for a while the many subjects of care and anxiety which surrounded her theodore said little of his fathers health what he did say was by no means so discouraging as the accounts of clara who less anxious to conceal a truth that must give pain to adeline expressed without reserve all her apprehension and concern  chapter xxiv  heaven is just and when the measure of his crimes is full will bare its red right arm and launch its lightnings mason the day of the trial so anxiously awaited and on which the fate of so many persons depended at length arrived adeline accompanied by m verneuil and madame la motte appeared as the prosecutor of the marquis de montalt and daunoy du bosse louis de la motte and several other persons as witness in her cause the judges were some of the most distinguished in france and the advocates on both sides men of eminent abilities on a trial of such importance the court as may be imagined was crowded with persons of distinction and the spectacle it presented was strikingly solemn yet magnificent  when she appeared before the tribunal adelines emotion surpassed all the arts of disguise but adding to the natural dignity of her air an expression of soft timidity and to her downcast eyes a sweet confusion it rendered her an object still more interesting and she attracted the universal pity and admiration of the assembly when she ventured to raise her eyes she perceived that the marquis was not yet in the court and while she awaited his appearance in trembling expectation a confused murmuring rose in a distant part of the hall her spirits now almost forsook her the certainty of seeing immediately and consciously the murderer of her father chilled her with horror and she was with difficulty preserved from fainting a low sound now ran through the court and an air of confusion appeared which was soon communicated to the tribunal itself several of the members arose some left the hall the whole place exhibited a scene of disorder and a report at length reached adeline that the marquis de montalt was dying a considerable time elapsed in uncertainty but the confusion continued the marquis did not appear and at adelines request m verneuil went in quest of more positive information  he followed a crowd which was hurrying toward the chatelet and with some difficulty gained admittance into the prison but the porter at the gate whom he had bribed for a passport could give him no certain information on the subject of his enquiry and not being at liberty to quit his post furnished m verneuil with only a vague direction to the marquiss apartment the courts were silent and deserted but as he advanced a distant hum of voices led him on still perceiving several persons running toward a staircase which appeared beyond the archway of a long passage he followed thither and learned that the marquis was certainly dying the staircase was filled with people he endeavored to press through the crowd and after much struggle and difficulty he reached the door of an antiroom which communicated with the apartment where the marquis lay and whence several persons now issued here he learned that the object of his enquiry was already dead m verneuil however pressed through the antiroom to the chamber where lay the marquis on a bed surrounded by officers of the law and two notaries who appeared to have been taking down depositions his countenance was suffused with a black and deadly hue and impressed with the horrors of death m verneuil turned away shocked by the spectacle and on enquiry heard that the marquis had died by poison  it appeared that convinced he had nothing to hope from his trial he had taken this method of avoiding an ignominious death in the last hours of life while tortured with the remembrance of his crime he resolved to make all the atonement that remained for him and having swallowed the potion he immediately sent for a confessor to take a full confession of his guilt and two notaries and thus established adeline beyond dispute in the rights of her birth and also bequeathed her a considerable legacy  in consequence of these depositions she was soon after formally acknowledged as the daughter and heiress of henry marquis de montalt and the rich estates of her father were restored to her she immediately threw herself at the feet of the king in behalf of theodore and of la motte the character of the former the cause in which he had risked his life and the occasion of the late marquiss enmity toward him were circumstances so notorious and so forcible that it is more than probable the monarch would have granted his pardon to a pleader less irresistible than was adeline de montalt theodore la luc not only received an ample pardon but in consideration of his gallant conduct toward adeline he was soon after raised to a post of considerable rank in the army  for la motte who had been condemned for the robbery on full evidence and who had been also charged with the crime which had formerly compelled him to quit paris a pardon could not be obtained but at the earnest supplication of adeline and in consideration of the service he had finally rendered her his sentence was softened from death to banishment this indulgence however would have availed him little had not the noble generosity of adeline silenced other prosecutions that were preparing against him and bestowed on him a sum more than sufficient to support his family in a foreign country this kindness operated so powerfully upon his heart which had been betrayed through weakness rather than natural depravity and awakened so keen a a remorse for the injuries he had once meditated against a benefactress so noble that his former habits became odious to him and his character gradually recovered the hue which it would probably always have worn had he never been exposed to the tempting dissipations of paris  the passion which louis had so long owned for adeline was raised almost to adoration by her late conduct but he now relinquished even the saint hope which he had hitherto almost unconsciously cherished and since the life which was granted to theodore rendered this sacrifice necessary he could not repine he resolved however to seek in absence the tranquillity he had lost and to place his future happiness on that of two persons so deservedly dear to him  on the eve of his departure la motte and his family took a very affecting leave of adeline he left paris for england where it was his design to settle and louis who was eager to fly from her enchantments set out on the same day for his regiment  adeline remained some time at paris to settle her affairs where she was introduced by m v  to the few and distant relations that remained of her family among these were the count and countess d  and the mon amand who had so much engaged her pity and esteem at nice the lady whose death he lamented was of the family of de montalt and the resemblance which he had traced between her features and those of adeline her cousin was something more than the effect of fancy the death of his elder brother had abruptly recalled him from italy but adeline had the satisfaction to observe that the heavy melancholy which formerly oppressed him had yielded to a sort of placid resignation and that his countenance was often enlivened by a transient gleam of cheerfulness  the count and countess d  who were much interested by her goodness and beauty invited her to make their hotel her residence while she remained at paris  her first care was to have the remains of her parent removed from the abbey of st clair and deposited in the vault of his ancestors daunoy was tried condemned and hanged for the murder at the place of execution he had described the spot where the remains of the marquis were concealed which was in the stoneroom already mentioned belonging to the abbey m v  accompanied the officers appointed for the search and attended the ashes of the marquis to st maur an estate in one of the northern provinces there they were deposited with the solemn funeral pomp becoming his rank adeline attended as chief mourner and this last duty paid to the memory of her parent she became more tranquil and resigned the ms that recorded his sufferings had been found at the abbey and delivered to her by m v  and she preserved it with the pious enthusiasm so sacred a relic deserved  on her return to paris theodore la luc who was come from montpelier awaited her arrival the happiness of this meeting was clouded by the account he brought of his father whose extreme danger had alone withheld him from hastening the moment he obtained his liberty to thank adeline for the life she had preserved she now received him as the friend to whom she was indebted for her preservation and as the lover who deserved and possessed her tenderest affection the remembrance of the circumstances under which they had last met and of their mutual anguish rendered more exquisite the happiness of the present moments when no longer oppressed by the horrid prospect of ignominious death and final separation they looked forward only to the smiling days that awaited them when hand in hand they should tread the flowery scenes of life the contrast which memory drew of the past with the present frequently drew tears of tenderness and gratitude to their eyes and the sweet smile which seemed struggling to dispel from the countenance of adeline those gems of sorrow penetrated the heart of theodore and brought to his recollection a little song which in other circumstances he had formerly sung to her he took up a lute that lay on the table and touching the dulcet chords accompanied it with the following words song the rose that weeps with morning dew and glitters in the sunny ray in tears and smiles resembles you when love breaks sorrows cloud away the dews that bend the blushing flower enrich the scent  renew the glow so loves sweet tears exalt his power so bliss more brightly shines by woe   her affection for theodore had induced adeline to reject several suitors which her goodness beauty and wealth had already attracted and whom though infinitely his superiors in point of fortune were many of them inferior to him in family and all of them in merit  the various and tumultuous emotions which the late events had called forth in the bosom of adeline were now subsided but the memory of her father still tinctured her mind with a melancholy that time only could subdue and she refused to listen to the supplications of theodore till the period she had prescribed for her mourning should be expired the necessity of rejoining his regiment obliged him to leave paris within the fortnight after his arrival but he carried with him assurance of receiving her hand soon after she should lay aside her sable habit and departed therefore with tolerable composure  m la lucs very precarious state was a source of incessant disquietude to adeline and she determined to accompany m v  who was now the declared lover of clara to montpelier whither la luc had immediately gone on the liberation of his son for this journey she was preparing when she received from her friend a flattering account of his amendment and as some farther settlement of her affairs required her presence at paris she deferred her design and m v  departed alone  when theodores affairs assumed a more favorable aspect m verneuil had written to la luc and communicated to him the secret of his heart respecting clara la luc who admired and esteemed m v  and who was not ignorant of his family connections was pleased with the proposed alliance clara thought she had never seen any person whom she was so much inclined to love and m v  received an answer favorable to his wishes and which encouraged him to undertake the present journey to montpelier  the restoration of his happiness and the climate of montpelier did all for the health of la luc that his most anxious friends could wish and he was at length so far recovered as to visit adeline at her estate of st maur clara and m v  accompanied him and a cessation of hostilities between france and spain soon after permitted theodore to join this happy party when la luc thus restored to those most dear to him looked back on the miseries he had escaped and forward to the blessings that awaited him his heart dilated with emotions of exquisite joy and gratitude and his venerable countenance softened by an expression of complacent delight exhibited a perfect picture of happy age  chapter xxv last came joys ecstatic trial they would have thought who heard the strain they saw in tempes vale her native maids amidst the festal sounding shades to some unwearied minstrel dancing while as his flying fingers kissed the strings love framed with mirth a gay fantastic round ode to the passions adeline in the society of friends so beloved lost the impression of that melancholy which the fate of her parent had occasioned she recovered all her natural vivacity and when she threw off the mourning habit which filial piety had required her to assume she gave her hand to theodore the nuptials which were celebrated at st maur were graced by the presence of the count and countess d  and la luc had the supreme felicity of confirming on the same day the flattering destinies of both his children when the ceremony was over he blessed and embraced them all with tears of fatherly affection i thank thee o god that i have been permitted to see this hour said he whenever it shall please thee to call me hence i shall depart in peace  long very long may you be spared to bless your children replied adeline clara kissed her fathers hand and wept long very long she repeated in a voice scarcely audible la luc smiled cheerfully and turned the conversation to a subject less affecting  but the time now drew nigh when la luc thought it necessary to return to the duties of his parish from which he had so long been absent madame la luc too who had attended him during the period of his danger at montpelier and hence returned to savoy complained much of the solitude of her life and this was with her brother an additional motive for his speedy departure theodore and adeline who could not support the thought of a separation endeavored to persuade him to give up his chateau and to reside with them in france but he was held by many ties to leloncourt for many years he had constituted the comfort and happiness of his parishioners they revered and loved him as a father  he regarded them with an affection little short of parental the attachment they discovered toward him on his departure was not forgotten either it had made a deep impression on his mind and he could not bear the thought of forsaking them now that heaven had showered on him its abundance it is sweet to live for them said he and i will also die amongst them a sentiment also of a more tender nature  and let not the stoic profane it with the name of weakness or the man of the world scorn it as unnatural  a sentiment still more tender attracted him to leloncourt  the remains of his wife reposed there  since la luc would not reside in france theodore and adeline to whom the splendid gaieties that courted them at paris were very inferior temptations to the sweet domestic pleasures and refined society which leloncourt would afford determined to accompany la luc and mon and madame verneuil abroad adeline arranged her affairs so as to render her residence in france unnecessary and having bade an affectionate adieu to the count and countess d  and to m amand who had recovered a tolerable degree of cheerfulness she departed with her friends for savoy  they traveled leisurely and frequently turned out of their way to view whatever was worthy of observation after a long and pleasant journey they came once more within view of the swiss mountains the sight of which revived a thousand interesting recollections in the mind of adeline she remembered the circumstances and the sensations under which she had first seen them  when an orphan flying from persecution to seek shelter among strangers and lost to the only person on earth whom she loved  she remembered this and the contrast of the present moment struck with all its force upon her heart  the countenance of clara brightened into smiles of the most animated delight as she drew near the beloved scenes of her infant pleasures and theodore often looking from the windows caught with patriotic enthusiasm the magnificent and changing scenery which the receding mountains successively disclosed  it was evening when they approached within a few miles of leloncourt and the road winding round the foot of a stupendous cragg presented them a full view of the lake and of the peaceful dwelling of la luc an exclamation of joy from the whole party announced the discovery and the glance of pleasure was reflected from every eye the suns last light gleamed upon the waters that reposed in crystal purity below mellowed every feature of the landscape and touched with purple splendor the clouds that rolled along the mountain tops  la luc welcomed his family to his happy home and sent up a silent thanksgiving that he was permitted thus to return to it adeline continued to gaze upon each wellknown object and again reflecting on the vicissitudes of grief and joy and the surprising change of fortune which she had experienced since last she saw them her heart dilated with gratitude and complacent delight she looked at theodore whom in these very scenes she had lamented as lost to her for ever who when found again was about to be torn from her by an ignominious death but who now sat by her side her secure and happy husband the pride of his family and herself and while the sensibility of her heart flowed in tears from her eyes a smile of ineffable tenderness told him all she felt he gently pressed her hand and answered her with a look of love  peter who now rode up to the carriage with a face full of joy and of importance interrupted a course of sentiment which was become almost too interesting ah my dear master cried he welcome home again here is the village god bless it it is worth a million such places as paris thank st jacques we are all come safe back again  this effusion of honest peters joy was received and answered with the kindness it deserved as they drew near the lake music sounded over the water and they presently saw a large party of the villagers assembled on a green spot that sloped to the very margin of the waves and dancing in all their holiday finery it was the evening of a festival the elder peasants sat under the shade of the trees that crowned this little eminence eating milk and fruits and watching their sons and daughters frisk it away to the sprightly notes of the tabor and pipe which was joined by the softer tones of a mandolin  the scene was highly interesting and what added to its picturesque beauty was a groupe of cattle that stood some on the brink some half in the water and others reposing on the green bank while several peasant girls dressed in the neat simplicity of their country were dispensing the milky feast peter now rode on first and a crowd soon collected round him who learning that their beloved master was at hand went forth to meet and welcome him their warm and honest expressions of joy diffused an exquisite satisfaction over the heart of the good la luc who met them with the kindness of a father and who could scarcely forbear shedding tears to this testimony of their attachment when the younger part of the peasants heard the news of his arrival the general joy was such that led by the tabor and pipe they danced before his carriage to the chateau where they again welcomed him and his family with the enlivening strains of music at the gate of the chateu they were receivd by madame la luc and a happier party never met  as the evening was uncommonly mild and beautiful supper was spread in the garden when the repast was over clara whose heart was all glee proposed a dance by moonlight it will be delicious said she the moonbeams are already dancing on the waters see what a stream of radiance they throw across the lake and how they sparkle round that little promontory on the left the freshness of the hour too invites to dancing  they all agreed to the proposal  and let the good people who have so heartily welcomed us home be called in too said la luc they shall all partake our happiness there is devotion in making others happy and gratitude ought to make us devout peter bring more wine and set some tables under the trees peter flew and while chairs and tables were placing clara ran for her favorite lute the lute which had formerly afforded her such delight and which adeline had often touched with a melancholy expression claras light hand now ran over the chorus and drew forth tones of tender sweetness her voice accompanying the following air now at moonlights fairy hour when faintly gleams each dewy steep and vale and mountain lake and bower in solitary grandeur sleep when slowly sinks the evening breeze that lulls the mind in pensive care and fancy loftier visions sees bid music wake the silent air bid the merry merry tabor sound and with the fays of lawn or glade in tripping circlet beat the ground under the high trees trembling shade now at moonlights fairy hour shall music breathe her dulcet voice and over the waves with magic power call on echo to rejoice   peter who could not move in a sober step had already spread refreshments under the trees and in a short time the lawn was encircled with peasantry the rural pipe and tabor were placed at claras request under the shade of her beloved acacias on the he margin of the lake the merry notes of music sounded adeline led off the dance and the mountains answered only to the strains of mirth and melody  the venerable la luc as he sat among the elder peasants surveyed the scene  his children and people thus assembled round him in one grand compact of harmony and joy  the frequent tear bedewed his cheek and he seemed to taste the fullness of an exalted delight  so much was every heart roused to gladness that the morning dawn began to peep upon the scene of their festivity when every cottager returned to his home blessing the benevolence of la luc  after passing some weeks with la luc m verneuil bought a chateau in the village of leloncourt and as it was the only one not already occupied theodore looked out for a residence in the neighborhood at the distance of a few leagues on the beautiful banks of the lake of geneva where the waters retire into a small bay he purchased a villa the chateau was characterized by an air of simplicity and taste rather than of magnificence which however was the chief treat in the surrounding scene the chateau was almost encircled with woods which forming a grand amphitheatre swept down to the waters edge and abounded with wild and romantic walks here nature was suffered to sport in all her beautiful luxuriance except where here and there the hand of art formed the foliage to admit a view of the blue waters of the lake with the white sail that glided by or of the distant mountains in front of the chateau the woods opened to a lawn and the eye was suffered to wander over the lake whose bosom presented an evermoving picture while its varied margin sprinkled with villas woods and towns and crowned beyond with the snowy and sublime alps rising point behind point in awful confusion exhibited a scenery of almost unequalled magnificence  here contemning the splendor of false happiness and possessing the pure and rational delights of a love refined into the most tender friendship surrounded by the friends so dear to them and visited by a select and enlightened society  here in the very bosom of felicity lived theodore and adeline la luc  the passion of louis de la motte yielded at length to the powers of absence and necessity he still loved adeline but it was with the placid tenderness of friendship and when at the earnest invitation of theodore he visited the villa he beheld their happiness with a satisfaction unalloyed by any emotions of envy he afterward married a lady of some fortune at geneva and resigning his commission in the french service settled on the borders of the lake and increased the social delights of theodore and adeline  their formal lives afforded an example of trials well endured  and their present of virtues greatly rewarded and this reward they continued to deserve  for not to themselves was their happiness contracted but diffused to all who came within the sphere of their influence the indigent and unhappy rejoiced in their benevolence the virtuous and enlightened in their friendship and their children in parents whose example impressed upon their hearts the precepts offered to their understandings  finis
