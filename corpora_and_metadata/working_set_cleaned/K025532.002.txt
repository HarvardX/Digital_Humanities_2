arundel  by the author of the observer  vol ii  london printed for c dilly in the poultry mdcclxxxix  arundel letter li lady louisa g to lady jane s i have kept faith with my father and given sir george revel another hearing he has just left me  i believe the silly man thought to dazzle me by the finery of his person for he was most sumptuously dressed that timidity and embarassment which a real lover would have felt in his predicament he did not even affect for he approached me with a gay complacent air and in a kind of raillying tone opened the conversation as follows   i hope lady louisa i have now the honor to approach you in a more favorable moment than when we last met at the opera i flatter myself i am indebted to your voluntary good will for this happiness and that i am not too presumptuous in supposing your sentiments have changed in my favor  i must own to you i felt my heart rise against him for the manner even more than the matter of this speech and i had so strong a propensity to humble his selfassurance as well as to shorten a disagreeable conversation that i immediately replied to him in these words  sir george revel if you want that generous indignation which naturally revolts from every favor that is extorted from the bestower i am sorry to discover that the only valuable attribute which belongs to pride is that which you do not possess  i perceive madam by this sample of your severity that whatever pride i may be possessed of i shall have occasion for it all some pride i must of necessity have had or i could never have aspired to address the finest woman in the world with a spirit the most implacable  suppose then you was to waste no more time upon that implacable spirit for though you may not be inclined to consult my repose yet it is to be presumed you have some consideration for your own  all the consideration in life for both my adorable lady louisa for yours in the first place to whose enjoyments i am prepared to dedicate every thing that fortune can purchase or pleasure bestow to my own in the second degree because you are all that i desire on earth and without you i must be miserable  you are master of my time sir george i must hear whatever you are pleased to say  yes madam you took a very early opportunity of telling me this interview was extorted from you you did not suffer me to indulge the hope that you had been assenting to it you let me know betimes that i am not the object of your present inclinations and your eyes directed me to find out my rival but so mean a rival is not worth my notice whilst i am looking up to lady louisa i cannot pay attention to the worm that is crawling in the dust i must believe that my devotion and assiduities will in the end prevail and as no inferior beauty can satisfy my ambition whilst i have fortune and pretensions to aspire to your ladyship i shall persevere in spite of all repulses to adore you  you have again taken upon you without any license to point out an imaginary rival which as a creature merely of your own brain you have my free leave to describe as you please but believe me sir george revel it is very possible for me to decline the honor of your addresses and yet be without the plea of any other attachment  ah madam i am under no difficulty to account for your prejudices against me i know how apt we are to contract the habits and opinions of those we live with i cannot forget that your ladyship has a mother who dismissed me from her doors i can recollect whom she employed in that honorable office and i must not wonder if the mothers favorite is the daughters passion  your insinuations i now replied savor so strongly of a purposed insult that they would warrant me in an immediate disavowal of any further intercourse or conversation with you but the character of my mother is not to be glanced at even in the slightest manner without a full investigation of the falsehoods upon which you ground those insinuations  falsehoods do you call them is it not notorious to all the world   what i demanded what is notorious to all the world  the partiality of lady g to her creature arundel  i now rose from my seat and whilst my heart swelled with indignation  i will not consent said i to hold any further discourse with the defamer of my mother and as it is for her sake only that i have endured this interview so i now protest that until you have atoned to her until i see her in this very house restored to her family and hear from her own lips that she is heartily and sincerely reconciled to you and joins her authority with my fathers for compelling me to another conference which i think will not hastily happen no force nor persuasion not a thousand deaths if it were possible to suffer them shall prevail with me to commit myself to your company any more  with these words i abruptly left him to his meditations and retiring to my chamber gave a vent to my full heart and having in part discharged the burden by the relief of tears i resort to this consolatory task and pour forth the sorrows of my soul into the ear of a friend  farewell letter lii arundel to charles mortlake i am setting out for arundelhouse from which i shall write to you and give you an account of the works going on at the parsonage  as i know you have full occupation for the present at cambridge and must have some time to prepare yourself and take leave of your friends i wish you not to think of coming into kent till you hear from me that things are in some state of readiness for your reception  alas my dear charles i blush when i recollect the vain and idle hope which like a cloud has shrunk from my embrace the postscript of my last letter if you have it to refer to will explain to you what i mean that vision did not appear at lady trevilles there was no angel form for my sight no angel voice for my ear the phantom which in my dream i saw which with my hands i handled and which in my imagination i caressed whilst tears of love and tenderness fell from her melting eyes is vanished into air  nor is this all  such things might pass away and yet hope might be left behind instead of which despair supplies her place for i hear with horror that the assassin of my peace has been permitted to renew his visits  the demons of ambition avarice and revenge have seized the fathers heart and he is driving an ingenuous mind upon the precipice of ruin a noble nature will be sacrificed by the sentence of an arbitrary parent  my heart bleeds with sorrow  why should i disguise the truth  it burns with indignation  shall i repent of the chastisement which i gave lord g i disdain such meanness i will rather glory in the share i had when the temple of this dagon was tumbled to the ground though my hopes are crushed beneath its ruins in the fall  i will resort to the country and there i will strive to solace an aching heart by the placid occupation of embellishing a beautiful spot in which it has been my happy chance to plant a virtuous and beloved friend  farewell letter liii lady jane s to lady louisa g thou art made for love my sweet louisa and love is made for thee and still you make bad work between you what are you puzzling about do not you see that arundel doats upon you do not you know that you dote upon him what do you want to know more shall fathers and mothers and aunts and cousins sit in council upon my affections will they bear the misery of my disappointment shall they direct the motions of my heart you have compromised with your father so would not i you have promised not to communicate with the man you love so would not i you have consented to receive the stale addresses of the man you abhor i would not do it if it was to save the whole species  how much to be preferred is my pride and my poverty before your wealth and your humility  thank heaven scotland is still the land of matrimonial liberty i love my brother  my god how i love him he is my last support in life my best my only friend but was he to attempt to check the tide of my affections he might as well turn the current of the winds stem the flow of the ocean or beat back the emanation of the sun and whelm the world in darkness by the breath of his mouth  that sir george revel is my aversion i never saw him but no matter it is enough for me that he had the cowardly principle to draw his sword upon an unarmed man had he the wealth of the world and all the outward graces that ever centered in the human form i would whistle him down the wind though i am a beggar recollect i am a beggar ennobled by the blood of scottish kings i will marry honor in rags but i will have no commerce with a miscreant though in a robe of state  i much doubt my dear louisa if at this moment i have a fair scottish pound which i can truly call my own and independantly command to bestow where i will the clothes that cover and the meal that feeds me are my brothers but as i share his purse i share his blood i will do no wrong to either nor shall any one do wrong to me i can defend my own honor i am competent also to make my own choice my hero will support me with his life but he will never think of overruling me by his will  arundel is a noble fellow the man who feared not to provoke the father whilst he admired the daughter is a man to my hearts content and i know no authority which nature has given to a parent that can oblige me to adopt his resentments when they spring from meanness or prevent me from admiring that principle which is founded in honor  your arundel is the nephew of my arundel of that glorious creature who perhaps at this moment is bleeding in his countrys service and with my gallant hero by his side vollying the british thunder on our enemies and has he not an hereditary claim upon my heart ah my dear louisa had you my spirit of rebellion added to your propensity to the tender passion all this combustion would have been avoided and one resolute step strait forwards would have saved thousands which you have now to take through crooked paths and roundabout roads before you shall arrive weary and jaded at the end of your journey  if love assails me which he has not yet thought fit to do to any serious porpose i will make a short battle of it he shall not waste my strength with maneuvers for i will put the affair to issue at once it is to this resolution i am now indebted for having brought a lovesuit to its conclusion which might else have been as tedious as a suit in chancery for my gentleman was one of those prudential worldlyminded dealers who wait for better times and look so closely to what is called the main chance as to let all other chances go by them without thinking them worth attention i am speaking of sir adam crichton whom you remember dancing after me all last winter in london and a pretty dance i led him fortune threw him in my way again at edinborough and being a person whom few women could look upon with indifference i confess i was not displeased to find him renew his addresses with more ardor than at the first  many days had not passed in this manner when sir adam took his opportunity of making certain honorable proposals to me declaring in all due phrase and emphasis proper to a lover that his fate depended on my answer he could not survive a refusal the happiness of his life nay his very life itself was in this moment to be decided he trembled for the issue yet he flattered himself i was too noble to have encouraged him to hope only to plunge him in disappointment and despair whilst this rhapsody was going on he kept his eyes fixed upon me and as i was certainly not displeased to see so handsome a lover at my feet he no sooner perceived the impression he had made on a soft silly heart which never learnt to play the hypocrite than catching me in his arms as if already in possession of his prize he rapturously exclaimed  my life my soul oh let me hope that smile consents oh suffer your transported lover thus to welcome the auspicious omen thus to seal our happy union with a fond embrace   a thought now struck me naturally enough you will say as my lover was a scottish man that in the midst of these raptures he might possibly be in a mistake as to his own disinterestedness for as a vulgar error had gone out in our country that i was to inherit my aunt selkirks fortune it was not impossible but this worthy gentleman might have fallen into the trap which one or two of his predecessors had stumbled over in time past and therefore i thought it best to make a clear field before we proceeded to further action by removing all such stumbling blocks out of his way  a few words sufficed to assure him that i was to all intents and purposes a complete beggar and until jupiter sent another golden shower from the skies likely so to remain to the end of my days as sir adam was a wise and prudent man in the main though his ideas had been a little subtilized just now by the heat of his imagination i believe he would have been heartily glad to have dispensed with all the raptures of his late embrace had he even clasped the goddess venus in his arms and though it was life or death with him but a minute before whilst my aunt selkirk was behind the curtain yet now it was pretty clear there were some things dearer to him than life itself and if i had not smiled quite so tenderly upon him he would have struggled hard to survive the disappointment of his hopes in short at that moment i much doubt if he would not rather have taken my aunt selkirk herself in his arms for the next embrace than poor needy lady jane  figure to yourself some greedy contractor in the very moment of driving his bargain with the minister for the plunder of the public presented by that minister with an order for refunding the peculations he had amassed and you may form some idea of sir adams countenance at this instant  i must take some credit to myself for resisting a certain malicious impulse which tempted me to indulge a little raillery at his expense but charity prevailed over contempt and as i saw enough to convince me i was in company with a very sordid fellow methought the sooner i was rid of such society the better  i suspect my good sir adam said i we are both in a mistake just now you in supposing me not so poor as i really am i in believing you more disinterested than in fact you are let us therefore content ourselves with the discovery we have mutually made of each others disposition i am satisfied you could have liked me if it had been your interest so to do you are satisfied i could have liked you if you had not preferred your interest thus then the account stands between us  you have offered marriage and taken an embrace by way of earnest and in pledge of faith take your offer back again i release you from it and as for the embrace much good may it do you let it pass my aunt selkirk is in the fault of that therefore you may return it to her the first time you meet or to any other rich old dowager like her whose moneybags may tempt you to bestow it on their owner  exit sir adam he is off good man my life my soul my idol  all those charming words are vanished into air and your poor solitary jane remains like her poor solitary tree  to wail the winter of her hopes apropos to that tree my dear louisa would you believe that in my visit to it this evening as the sun was setting under the western mountains i encountered a slipshod sybil under its branches in the very act of meagre inspiration chaunting out the following doleful ditty to the tune of rosline castle i took the words from her mouth and as you are well acquainted with the strain i send you the sybils ditty which you may apply to the tune supposing the first stanza to be my question and the last your answer to it observing only that the two last lines of each stanza are to be repeated in the strain  i what means this languor tell me why thy bosom draws this heaving sigh art thou deserted or betrayed say who can wrong thee gentle maid is thy love absent or unkind what anguish racks louisas mind ii if you would know what prompts this sigh enquire of time and bid him fly bid him stretch all his pinions out to bring the lagging hours about and when with the dear youth i am blessed then let time stop and take his rest farewell letter live lady louisa g to the countess of g alas my dearest mother to what extremities have i been driven since our last unhappy parting  my father though divested of his office and no longer courting parliamentary support is not divested of his partiality for sir george revel he resents my behavior to him in a very high degree and has again broke out into the bitterest invectives against you and mr arundel for being in a combination against him and even hinted with indignation i repeat it to you that you engaged mr arundel in a preconcerted quarrel with sir george that by dispatching him out of the way you might make an opening for your favorite as he calls that gentleman to carry on a design which he pretends to believe you had formed of marrying him to me  inveterate against him for the speech he made in parliament of which the town yet rings with applause he keeps no measures in his resentment but throws out certain insinuations which no one who had not bidden farewell to truth and delicacy could have suggested and which with just abhorrence i forbear to mention  in conclusion he drove me to the painful alternative either to admit sir george revel to renew his addresses or to be excluded from any farther correspondence or communication with you i submitted to receive the visits of that odious man again for this is temporizing only  but if i would consent to his proposals and close with the full wishes of my deluded father then i might effect a reconciliation in my family then i might restore a banished mother to her home his arms should be open to receive you and all be peace and harmony again  the selffame day presented me with the sight of my unwelcome visitor sir george abject as he is to sue to me who had before discarded him still he could not so keep down his proud spirit as tamely to endure the slights i put upon him at last he gave a loose to his audacious tongue charging me with having attached my heart to some more happy rival and presuming to say i had contracted that attachment by copying your ladyship in your prepossession for a certain favorite plainly pointing at mr arundel  this insolent insinuation stung me to the quick and whilst my blood boiled with indignation i declared to him no force should prevail over me to admit the man into my presence who dared to revile the character of my mother it was on your account i plainly told him that i then suffered his visit and until he had completely atoned to you for his calumnious insinuation till i saw you again reinstated in your family and received from your lips an assurance of reconciliation i would never see him more whatever i might undergo from the displeasure of my father  with this denunciation i abruptly left him and here the matter rests at present  and now my beloved my indulgent mother what remains but that i open all my heart to you amidst all the falsehoods this calumniator uttered still i must acknowledge he is fatally too right in one conjecture  ah madam it is my hard fate to love and to despair a secret passion preys upon my heart my health sinks under it would you know the real source of all those strange vicissitudes those incoherencies by which my spirits have been agitated for some time past date your account of them from the very hour in which i first encountered the allconquering eyes of arundel  you know him well you with cooler observation have more nearly contemplated the perfection of his character the charms of his person i am the victim of a hopeless passion and lost without redemption if necessity did not now extort it from me it had still remained a secret even from you but as i foresee you will be applied to by sir george revel very speedily not improbably by my father himself it would be unjust not to apprize you of the real situation of my heart at the same time it would be ungenerous to convey a wish that you should sacrifice a moment that is now the crisis of your reconciliation to any unavailing efforts in my desperate cause no my dearest mother make your peace with my father and leave me to struggle with my fate  the breach between him and arundel is now become incurable no circumstances can ever move him to espouse the cause of one so hostile so obnoxious one whom he has offended and by whom he is offended beyond reparation at the same time no passion however strong no treatment however severe shall drive me upon clandestine desperate measures which though the precedents already numerous were multiplied by numbers more i never will resort to  return therefore in peace and be once more in the bosom of your family i will gladly pay the ransom for your deliverance and shall glory in my sufferings if i must be made the victim of compulsion if my father obstinately bent upon his purpose will drag me to the altar he shall shortly after have the task of carrying me to the grave  farewell letter lv the countess of g to lady louisa g rent with ten thousand agonizing sensations a mothers bleeding heart blesses and bids adieu to her beloved child  may that protecting being to whose throne my supplications shall ascend in your behalf direct and graciously support you in this dangerous crisis i can no longer help you the only duty i can now perform is to remove a stumbling block from your path the only offering i can make is to bless and to pray for you  yet before i totally resign the duties of a parent and secede from a world which i renounce to an asylum where i shall be sheltered from the malice and even from the remembrance of my oppressors i leave with you my solemn exhortation and protest against your marriage with that worthless revel  mark me louisa if ever you consent to yield your hand to him and stamp your conscience with a lie before the altar of your god expect the vengeance you deserve  was your father now before me i should not hold back a tittle of the truth which i utter judge then if we can reunite judge if our meeting would not blow these flames into a fiercer heat and own with me it is the wisest kindest measure i can take in this extremity to avoid an interview by concealing myself in some foreign country from his search  and now it only remains as the last maternal duty which is left me to speak to you of arundel  ah why would you conceal from me your passion for the most engaging the most amiable of men alas my child why would you not confide to me the very first emotions he created in your heart but let that pass late as your confession is i thank you for it from my soul and with the same sincerity of heart i seal your choice with my most absolute consent and sanctify it with my ardent prayers for its success  in his virtue you will find a guide in his courage a protector in his arms a blessing to him i bequeath you he alone deserves you with him you will be happy  more i might add much more would not exhaust the topic but let this suffice  farewell letter lvi arundel to the countess of g arundelhouse were i to follow the impulse of my heart upon the receipt of your most flattering letter the person not the pen of arundel would have the happy office of expressing to you my sensibility of your goodness and giving vent to a devoted heart that overflows with gratitude frown not most exalted of your sex if i presume to add  with affection  let me recollect what i was till you condescended to regard me with kindness to foster me by your compassion to transplant me into the soil where i have flourished by your favor consider me in the next place as i now am a man who by nature am endowed with the warmest feelings of the heart by gratitude inspired with every ardent emotion whilst i am only meditating on your bounty how then shall i command myself when present with you when i shall see your eyes suffused with tears and the purest bosom in creation laboring with sighs will not my spirit be in arms to avenge those wrongs that have provoked your sorrows had nature formed me of less penetrable stuff or not compounded you with every tender grace with every soft expressive character of female loveliness i might control my temper though i pitied your afflictions as it is my desperation might only aggravate your sufferings and the resentment of your lord that i have now drawn upon myself alone might then be directed with accumulated malice against you  there is such venom in some hearts against you and so ready are they to seize the smallest opening for giving vent to it that i declare to you i scarce dare to turn my eyes much less my steps toward that quarter of the country where you inhabit the poison is prepared an opportunity is only wanting to administer it  having stated this i remain at your command danger is only terrible to me as it affects you if you who are armed in innocence set it at defiance i who am all devotion hold every thing but your commands beneath my notice  farewell letter lvii the countess af g to arundel yes arundel i adopt your counsel my eyes are open to my danger and we meet no more  though my affection for you why should i not own what you must have discovered yes let me say though my affection for you were inconsiderate enough to brave all consequences yet i cannot bear the thought of sacrificing you and that selfdenial which perhaps is insufficient for my own preservation for yours becomes unconquerable  i conjure you by all that is sacred to man not to stir a step toward me this day tomorrow i shall be out of your reach my abode will not be known to you nor to my family it will not be in england  start not at this measure for it is a necessary one you will see all my motives and admit the justice of them when i disclose to you a secret which is of the last importance both to your peace of mind and to my own  louisa loves you  now arundel have i not reason for what i do that i may yield up every wish of my heart and transfer them all entire and unperverted to the happiness of my child and to the completion of her future union with the object of her love i retire to secret solitude and healing meditation  if i did not know louisas worth i could not bring myself to form a wish that she may be yours but believe me arundelfor i declare it to you in the fullness and sincerity of my heart a nobler nature is not to be found en earth she is generous in the best sense of the word of a clear and candid spirit pure in principle but alive to all the tender passions to excess i speak to you without reserve there is your only danger it is there you must apply your strictest guard to you i consign a trust you if heaven grants my prayer will fill that place which hard necessity now forces me to recede from  in this and all things else i rely upon your honor faithfulness and discretion if i recover my tranquillity in the retirement to which i am going you shall hear from me again if not farewell for ever  letter lviii the earl to the countess of g lady louisa having consented to restore peace and harmony to her family by yielding to a renewal of sir george revels addresses with a reference to your ladyship for your voice and acquiescence in the matter nothing is now wanting to put that most desirable match in train but your concurrence and advice you have it therefore now in your power in the same instant to establish your daughter in a most enviable situation open my arms to welcome you once more into the hearts of your family and for ever annihilate all differences between us  as there have been some unlucky misunderstandings between you and sir george revel which ought now to be put an end to that gentleman proposes waiting upon you in person as a mark of his respect and i will not doubt of your receiving his compliment in such a manner as shall lay the foundation of a lasting cordiality between you for the time to come  g  letter lix the countess to ths earl of g the conditions of my consenting to louisas union with sir george revel would be very tempting if i were not satisfied that her happiness would thereby be sacrificed to our reconciliation in this persuasion i will never selfishly yield that consent which is to make her miserable but on the contrary do in the most solemn manner protest against the match  l g  letter lx sir george revel to the earl of g some business having occurred which may probably detain me a day or two from town i beg leave to report to your lordship the event of my expedition into kent  on my arrival at the house which lady g had inhabited i was informed by a servant that she had just left it to return no more i desired to know to what place she had removed he could not tell where his lady was gone he had been paid his wages and was discharged perceiving he was a clownish country fellow i offered him money if he would inform me of the truth he persisted in the same answer i asked him who accompanied his lady on her journey a maidservant was in the postchaise with her and one man attended on horseback nobody else was of the party did he know any body who could inform me where she was gone as i had business of importance he knew nobody who could give me that information he was sure none of his fellow servants had been in the secret else he should have known it from them upon recollection he said perhaps the gentleman for whom he had a letter might be able to tell upon asking the name of the gentleman for whom he had the letter he said it was arundel and that he had the letter then in his charge which he was ordered to carry to arundelhouse and deliver with his own hands  a thought then struck me to ask him if he knew the person of mr arundel and the fellow saying he did not i thought it an allowable fraud in such a case to tell him that was very true else he would have known he was now speaking to that very person for i was mr arundel and had come purposely to enquire for the letter which i was in expectation of upon which i slipped a few pieces into his hand and got possession of the letter  as there seems some mystery in this correspondence with your lady and mr arundel knowing the terms your lordship is upon with that ungrateful gentleman i hope i shall not incur your displeasure by the means i took for intercepting a letter which may very possibly explain some particulars you may wish to be informed of and at least discover where it is she has removed to i now enclose it to your lordship sealed and entire as i received it that you may open it or not as you see fit  it does not become me to be officious in matters of family concern and i hope your lordship will believe i am the last person to offend your delicacy in that respect but i cannot avoid a remark upon the time which mr arundel chose for going into the country neither is it to be overlooked that her ladyship chose a residence within a few miles of this gentlemans house is it to be supposed that he is not in the secret of this sudden measure which had it been the measure of any other person than of lady g i should take the liberty to call an absolute elopement but if i could have doubted of his knowledge of the scheme from the respect which i am inclined to bear to every member of your lordships family i could not now have persisted in my incredulity since the discourse i have held with lady gs servant and the facts which he has related to me with such an air of natural simplicity as will not suffer me to doubt of his veracity  if lady g has written confidentially and explicitly to your lordship all things may be well and for that reason i forbear to trouble you with the deposition of this domestic evidence for the present but if this is not done to your satisfaction i should presume it will be proper to enquire into facts and hear the man himself for which purpose i shall keep him in my hands till i am further informed of your pleasure  farewell letter lxi the earl of g to sir george revel nothing could be more fortunate than your intercepting that letter which has revealed a plot of the darkest and most diabolical nature i entreat of you to come to me directly that we may consult how to traverse this insidious proceeding i shall reserve the letter for our meeting let it suffice for the present when i inform you with no less indignation than horror that our very worst conjectures are too fully verified and that my castoff secretary has been conspiring with my castoff wife to seduce the affections of my daughter and violate the honor of my family by mixing my blood with that of a fellow whom i detest above every thing that walks the earth  farewell letter lxii arundel to charles mortlake an event has taken place so distressing to my mind that it has incapacitated me for writing to you till this moment lady g who had retired to a small house in this neighborhood where she lived in solitude ever since her separation is gone suddenly out of england without communicating to any of her friends what place she purposes to fix upon for her retreat let your mind form no conjectures upon this step but such as shall put the purest of all possible constructions upon her ingenuous and noble conduct she is a sainted being and it would be a sin unpardonable to attaint her character the overbearing temper of her husband the just abhorrence which she entertains for sir george revel and the protest she has solemnly made against her daughters union with that wretch whom lord g adopts with so much eagerness are amongst the chief reasons for her secession wherever she shall go whilst virtue is the care of heaven she must experience its peculiar protection  the pleasing employment i have found at the parsonage in preparing it for your reception has been a happy resource at this time when my spirits have been heavily oppressed i flatter myself you will find it a very comfortable abode when the works which i have set a going are completed as your predecessor left behind him an admirable collection of books well chosen and in fine condition i have agreed to purchase them of his heir and a proper person is now making a catalogue and valuation of them i shall take the liberty however to reverse the order of your apartments and promote them to better quarters for which purpose i am converting the best parlour into a library and by some alterations and additions shall make it a spacious and very pleasant room for its windows command the river arundelhouse and park a beautiful view of the country bounded by a very bold and lofty horizon the variety of cultivation under your eye the hopgrounds appleorchards arable meadow and wood lands and the charming river glittering through the landscape make it quite enchanting on the north side of your house stands the church which through a vista of evergreens by which it is encompassed presents its venerable tower to your view the rest of the edifice is concealed to the south your garden falls off by an easy declivity to the river and your library windows enjoy this aspect as you tell me you have taken a course of lectures at our physicgardens i shall hope you will be a florist and here you will find both soil and sun to set your genius at work i hope you will find something in hand that will serve for a beginning for i have turned my uncles head gardener and some laborers into the vineyard with full powers to do all that the time will allow you must complete and shape the whole i have been lucky enough to get you a very excellent fellow to manage every thing without doors and take care of your glebe and stock of all sorts all the living creatures cows pigs and poultry which your predecessor died possessed of have a kind of claim to the tenure and i have accordingly continued them in their rights without disturbing one of them  your parishoners will be ready to receive you with cordial respect i have had the principal farmers with me and heard them discourse on the subject of their tithes which they are in hopes you will not make any advance upon this you know is always the first object in their thoughts and the only string that can disturb the harmony of your connection with them though i could safely pledge myself for the liberality of your sentiments yet in this particular i thought it best to be silent that the whole merit might be your own and not seem to spring from my influence with you in their favor we have had a cricketmatch in the park which my uncle dedicates to their amusement and sets apart a particular fine spot for the purpose i flatter myself you will not regret that this spot is exactly in the eye of your windows as i think a more cheerful spectacle cannot be seen in nature than a set of athletic youths all in action surrounded by a ring of spectators animated with the sports and shouting their applause at every turn and incident of the game  as you are a brother westminster and a waterman of course i shall send down a fouroared cutter from our friend roberts to navigate the silver medway and i promise myself many parties with you upon this delicious river i have it in meditation to get my uncle john to purchase me a sailing yacht when he comes home as we can row up to rochester and embark from thence upon expeditions to see the fleet and run through the downs to spithead and the isle of wight what a delightful excursion would it be to run down to his ship when it comes in and perhaps congratulate him and his brave crew upon the capture of some stout spaniard or frenchman anchored under his victorious stern heaven grant it may be so if victory is the meed of valor woe to the enemy on whose ribs his thunder shall be poured  rejoice with me my dear charles of a certainty my wish was breathed with a prophetic spirit i have an express this moment with an account of his having engaged two spanish men of war with his single line of battle ship supported by the young earl of s in a fortyfour gun frigate and after an obstinate fight having captured them both with an immense treasure in bullion on board from the havannah one of these was an eighty gun ship which fell to his share the other a sixty armed en flute and this was taken by the frigate i have no letters but the general ordered the gazette extraordinary to be sent to me by express it is a glorious account and what compleats my joy is that they are come in to st helens safe with their prizes in tow and both commanders as it should seem in health and unhurt the carnage on board the spaniards is very great and both captains are said to be mortally wounded my uncle has lost his first lieutenant and above two hundred men killed and wounded his letter over which i have wept and smiled by turns is a model of the oldfashioned sea style very laconic and modest toward himself but rapturous in praise of his own brave people and the behavior of his gallant comrade he speaks handsomely of his enemy and concludes with a very manly lamentation for the loss of his lieutenant and men who had the honor as his own words express it to perish gloriously  but why need i retail this to you when the gazette will be in your hands before this letter reaches them  i shall set out for london immediately and in truth there is no time to be lost for i have a very bad account of the poor general and this with other matters which weigh heavy on my heart sadly damps my joy  before i close my letter let me tell you that i could wish you would put yourself in motion for this place as soon as is convenient to you for though your own house may not be fit for you on account of the workmen who are in it you will find an apartment ready prepared for your reception at arundelhouse from whence you will not have more than half a miles walk to your own and as i cannot make any longer stay on the spot your eye will be very necessary to superintend what is going forward  i need not remind you to write to me immediately on your arrival my chaise is at the door  farewell letter lxiii lady louisa g to lady jane s all joy to my beloved friend your gallant brother has acquired both fame and fortune under the auspices of captain arundel what happy star is this that seems to shine with such peculiar favor on that illustrious name the nephew triumphs in eloquence the uncle conquers in arms all london is in a tumult of joy the same bonfires which blaze for the victory usher in the auspicious commencement of a new administration the overthrow is complete the whole cabinet is dissolved and not a wreck left behind my father does not fall alone this is his only consolation  i take for granted you will now come out of scotland to embrace and welcome your beloved hero i hear prodigious accounts of the treasure captured in the spanish prizes the breaches time has made in the fortune of your ancient house will be now repaired and the old castle itself feel a renovation of its pristine splendour above all things it delights me to reflect upon the mortification which your mercenary lover will experience wretch who puts no value on the treasures of the mind whose callous heart not the charms of the most lovely form can touch let him dig for happiness in the bowels of the earth let him ransack the veins of the mine for the virtues of the heart mean as he is i shall not wonder if he has the audacity to renew his addresses to you  i thank the poetic sybil for her song it sooths my melancholy i hope soon to meet her transformed into a young and blooming muse i will then salute her with the tune of rosline castle to her own pathetic words  my poor mother is gone suddenly from her house in kent and left england  alas i know not whither she has turned her exiled steps all is mysterious and sad sir george revel vainly hoping to make his peace set out in search of her but came too late she had departed that morning i believe he is still in the neighborhood something is on foot between him and my father but what i know not a cloud is gathering time will develope its contents i shall meet it with firmness  farewell letter lxiv the earl of g to sir george revel it is clear to me me dear sir george that this letter you intercepted is only one of a number that have passed between arundel and my wife to the same wicked and insidious purposes the prejudices their cabal has produced in my daughters mind are too stubborn to give way to gentle efforts these have been tried to no purpose and it is now time to take more lively measures for bringing her to a sense of her own happiness as well as of her duty to me  i say to you in confidence that my suspicions of arundel go to all possible lengths i believe he has been a traitor to me and the seducer of my wifes honor what else could be the purport of that secret correspondence which was carried on to the very moment of lady gs flight out of england what could provoke her to that flight except to pursue her scandalous commerce with more security in a foreign kingdom why does she conceal the place of her destination from her whole family arundel and only arundel is privy to it and thus the virulence of his nature will be gratified with a double revenge having corrupted my wife he will possess himself of my daughter  vengeance seize the villain such injuries are too deep oh that my age my rank and condition in life were not such as tie up my hands against taking personal revenge upon such a traitor  the curse of it is that this letter which you have stopped discloses nothing of their connection which can criminate him with my wife i insert a copy of it for your perusal  to francis arundel esquire i am this instant setting out but cannot depart without bidding you farewell  avail yourself with discretion of the intelligence i have imparted to you with respect to louisa do not provoke lord g to further resentment conciliate if it be possible a nature which though hard i hope is not impenetrable  above all things i conjure you avoid embarassments with sir george revel a spirit so inflated by prosperity and pride can ill brook disappointment  farewell  this is the letter a delicate method her ladyship takes of teaching him to cajole her husband how you stand with her is pretty clear and duly considerate she seems to be of the safety of her favorite what would i not give for the sight of that intelligence which respects louisa this plainly points to you the tenor of their correspondence where is that servant from whom you got the letter he might be a very useful man if we could fix strong circumstances of guilt upon arundel it is not in the nature of things that louisa could think of him but with loathing and abhorrence if you can work the truth out of that fellow i shall not shrink from it be the consequences what they may i am for fathoming this foul business to the very dregs  i have told louisa nothing of the intercepted letter nor shall i till i have further communication with you  farewell letter lxv sir george revel to the earl of g the servant you are so desirous of examining is now in my hands he is a stubborn unwilling informer but i am more ready to believe he speaks the truth from the pains it requires to extort it from him alas my lord it is a very black affair consult your heart a second time and consider well before you call upon me for the facts if you will follow my advice you will remain in voluntary ignorance  farewell letter lxvi the earl of g to sir george revel have i not already told you that i am prepared to meet the worst why will you dally with my patience as if i wanted resolution or still harbored an unmanly weakness for a guilty wife let me hear the fellows deposition  farewell letter lxvii sir george revel to the earl of g by a confession with difficulty obtained from lady gs servant it appears that an assignation was made and a meeting had in consequence within a certain grove at the bottom of her garden where there is a small pleasurehouse conveniently equipt for the purpose the person of mr arundel though he had attempted to disguise it was known to her ladyships london servant and from her my informer was certified as to his identity that he did actually come to the place appointed was admitted to your lady in the pleasurehouse and was there alone with her for the space of an hour to these facts he was himself a witness it seems her ladyship gave hushmoney to her woman who was privy to the assignation and she betrayed it as is the common practice of such gentry to this fellow who was her lover and no doubt in her good graces  and is it now possible the delicacy of lady louisas nature shall not revolt with horror from the seducer of a mothers virtue  i am aware this charge cannot be imparted to her without its coming to the knowledge of mr arundel her ladyship will probably put that out of question but let the guilty tremble i fear not his resentment my part in the business i am ready to avow as the investigator of truth i am fearless as to consequences in the character of your lordships friend and in hope of being honored with a still nearer name i am not only prepared but forward to face the worst of dangers that can result from the rage and desperation of a detected villain let him face me point to point other arguments i have held with him others i will hold no more the war of words is not my war in defending and proving by the logic of the schools i am not expert i have not lived with gownsmen the sword has been my study it was once my profession the more accursed he who drove me out of that profession  in three several affairs at home and abroad i have come off untouched and as many times left my antagonist on the ground so let it be with arundel to that fate i devote him  farewell p s as you may possibly require to see this man and receive his deposition from his mouth i have taken all possible pains to retain him for that purpose but the fellow fearful of the revenge which mr arundel or his friends might take means to execute against him would not be persuaded to utter a word till i promised him his free liberty upon declaring the truth of that he has availed himself and is out of my reach    letter lxviii the earl of g to sir george revel how shall i express my thanks to you for developing this dark and infamous affair at length the horrid truth comes out and the world which with its usual misjudging malignity has hitherto stamped my behavior to lady g with the false character of cruelty will now of force acknowledge the justice of my resentment and at the same time admire the mildness of it if once the infamy of that woman becomes public but whether i should carry the matter to that length or not is with me a very serious question i have had too much experience of the worlds way of judging in these affairs not to be aware that the husband always makes a very contemptible figure on the occasion people are very willing to find excuses in his conduct for the offending party and with this view take great pains to scrape together all the dirty stories they can collect on the score of retaliation in the mean time the broad shame stares him in the face and every body hoots the cuckold as he passes  now this is a degree of ignominy which i cannot stand neither is it to be presumed that i can have so strictly squared my actions by the rule of moral purity as to say that no breach of nuptial fidelity has occurred on my part this falls to the lot of few men to boast of and some things i am sensible have passed with me of too public a nature to be controverted lady g to do her justice has been a very discreet and prudent woman this affair only excepted she has been altogether so quiet and unofficious in her high station that she has made no enemies and many friends on the contrary i have been long held up to the public in an unpopular point of view and am now recently stripped of that power and place which would else be some protection to me stripped by the very hands of that political phenomenon who is the author of my shame and the object of the worlds unbounded flattery who at this very moment is conspicuously the favorite of fame and fortune is there an instance upon record of any young man starting forth on a sudden into such a career such an unexpected display of talents as to distance all our most admired and best established orators upon his very first essay in the house of force i must confess there is no such instance i protest to you my dear sir george with bitterness of heart i speak it it was his hand that first shook our fabric to the foundation and now mark his indignant spirit he refuses office he resists any share of the spoil destruction seize his pride he glories in his independance and in the revolution of a few months emerging from the obscurity of a college becomes the man of the people and the fine gentleman of the age all this while fortune showers down upon him her favors without ceasing sir francis arundel is now dying and his son by a chance blow is removed out of the course of succession that this nephew may inherit the family estate his other uncle goes out upon a cruise and the same happy chance throws a prize into his teeth that is the richest capture of the war in short the very winds conspire to waft wealth and prosperity into his arms and now if i were to bring my appeal against his treachery before the public prejudice would cry me down and whilst a few moralizing sentimentalists shook their heads at the account and silently condemned him the bulk of mankind would take part with him and all the fashionable world would speak scornfully of me and call him a very fine fellow for the gallantry of the deed  these are amongst the consequences which i foresee would ensue if we were to make the affair public and therefore as the secret is known only to you with you i would wish it to rest for the present at least and until i am compelled to draw it forth in my own defense  but as there is nothing which i more ardently desire than to have the honor of calling you my soninlaw nor any thing on this side hell which i so hate and abhor as this violator of my honor this incendiary who has abused the protection of my house for the traitorous purpose of seducing the affections of my only child there is no step i would not take to frustrate his evil intentions and promote your honorable ones  on my part there can be no repugnance to expose this infamous transaction to louisa but as i must thereby commit you i cannot take upon my conscience the consequences that may follow so that at all events i shall wait till i have the honor of seeing you then if it is done it must be your own act or which is the same thing i must communicate it at your special desire though i have all possible confidence in your courage and skill yet i am apt to think the fellow you will have to deal with does not want that spirit which will push him upon extremities at least he has those at his elbow who will prompt him to it for captain arundel and the earl of s are now in the same house with him  i am afflitted i confess but not surprised  i must regret the conditions by which the informer got his release had he been forthcoming the onus probandi would have laid on him you would have been clear of all responsibility by his secession the affair becomes personal i beseech you my dear sir george let not your zeal for my honor carry you beyond the bounds of prudence weigh the matter well i shall not let a syllable transpire till we meet  farewell letter lxix charles mortlake to arundel i take the first opportunity of informing you that i arrived at arundelhouse last night and found a very comfortable reception from the good old housekeeper who fulfilled your orders very faithfully and took great care of me  i think it a grand and venerable mansion and with the park and grounds about it i am quite in raptures this morning betimes i took my walk to the parsonage or rather to the rural palace which your lavish generosity is preparing for a very humble and unsuitable possessor in the name of wonder my dear arundel what do you take me for if i were as great as thomas a becket i might make bold to live in it but being only plain charles mortlake i am ashamed to look it in the face in truth i cannot conceive that any parson will be fit to inhabit it unless one of the blood royal shall in future time take orders and turn parish priest under your patronage your masterworkman showed me the plan he was upon and asked me if i had any additions to make to it i was then standing in the library like abon hassan in the caliphs apartment doubting whether i was awake or in a dream when the question rousing me from my reverie i stared the man full in the face  additions sir cried i i presume you mean retrenchments  pardon me sir replied he unless you have any improvements to propose we must exactly pursue mr arundels directions  be it so i answered execute his orders  and immediately i turned into the garden attracted by the most enchanting view that ever met my eyes  a noble river rolled at my feet beyond it the country took a gradual ascent expanding its various beauties in all the pride and wantonness of nature but what enraptured me most was to find it was not inanimate nature not simply groves lawns or river i was to feed my sight with but a prospect warm and alive with human habitations farms and cottages interspersed a scene glowing with rural happiness a landscape for the heart no less than for the eye  i stood and gazed  the contemplation overpowered me the torrent of thy bounty rushed upon my soul it was the resistless impulse of gratitude and the tears flowed from my eyes this is the gift of arundel i cried  deus nobis haec otia fecit  at this instant i was accosted by a venerable old man with silver locks who was superintending a set of laborers employed in beautifying and dressing the charming spot i was upon i readily understood he was your uncles gardener but instead of talking to me about the works he was engaged in with joy painted in his countenance he immediately broke forth  oh sir we have this instant got the news the glorious news and we hope you will give us leave to set the bells aringing in honor of captain johns victory by all means my good friend by all means i replied and let the people break off work and be merry and to make them so take this money in my purse let the whole village have a holiday the heart that is not warmed on such an occasion is not the heart of an englishman  sir replied he reverend sir i beg your pardon pray you be not offended at my boldness you are an honorable gentleman and a generous but how should you not seeing you are the friend of our young master  but indeed sir i must beg leave to return your money his honor has sent us down wherewithal to make a day of it there is meat to be dressed and beer to be drank enough for all the neighborhood i pray you sir let me not affront you nor get anger of my master  be satisfied my good friend i replied i will not intrude upon the generosity of your master he is my patron let him be yours also and let no other name have a share in the festivity of this day but the name of arundel  i beg your pardon sir replied the veteran we shall make bold to drink a health to our new rector and shall not forget your bounty though we dare not accept it  having said this he gave a signal to his men down at once fell spades houghs and pickaxes away flew the whole bevy at a word in the same moment out burst the hive from the housedoor carpenters bricklayers and laborers the bells began their peal six in number and to my great joy very musical the people shouted in chorus long live the brave captain arundel and all the noble family cried the old gardener  amen echoed my heart amen it now reechoes again  letter lxx arundel to charles mortlake i am delighted to hear of your holiday at arundel yesterday in the forenoon as i was walking to the admiralty upon enquiry after my uncle just as i was entering the court a large old tumbril of a coach with six horses and three postilions was driving to the gate two sailors were seated on the box in scarlet jackets and upon the roof two more in flowered cotton waistcoats with long silk handkerchiefs round their necks loose and fluttering in the wind i made one of a multitude which soon collected round the gate and immediately heard a cry of captain arundel for ever echoed by three cheers from the fellows aloft  my heart bounded with joy and i darted through the throng to the coachdoor which no sooner opened than out bolted my uncle john and in an instant i sprung into the heros arms with rapture i beheld him safe sound and in health he was accompanied by the young earl of s the captain of his brave frigate an old seaman with a wrapper round his head and two noble boys in midshipmens uniform as soon as we got into the hall which was a work of some time my uncle presented me to lord s crying out to me here frank i present you to a noble officer who is an honor to the navy of britain  then turning to lord s he added my lord i beg you will love this boy for my sake we embraced and if lord s felt the same emotions as i did our friendship is established for life my uncle then demanded if sir francis was alive and well alive i told him he was but little more he shook his head and cried the worse luck repeating it more than once  i told him in few words my situation with sir francis sinking however the catastrophe of my cousin  this seemed to please him much and he said if you are upon such terms all is well go home and leave us to do our business here tell my brother i shall come to dinner and bring my friend lord s with me these youngsters must scout away to their fathers and mothers naming two noble families which it seems they belonged to  immediately i left the place and hastening back to grosvenor square informed my uncle of my happy rencontre the gallant old general though in a very feeble state would be carried into the eatingparlour to receive his visitors at dinnertime and thanks be to god one day of true enjoyment was added to his life for his senses seemed to brighten with the pleasure and we passed some hours together of so superior a sort that even sickness and infirmity could not dash his joys  he insisted with my uncle that both himself and lord s should take up their lodging in his house this was readily accepted by him and at last agreed to by his lordship also and this morning i attended upon them both to the kings levee where i was witness to the very gracious reception which my sovereign gave to these deserving officers my uncle john whose athletic figure is more formed for the quarter deck than the court attracted every bodys eyes and considering it was a first performance acquitted himself to admiration you must picture to yourself a rough and martial figure above six feet high his head bald to the crown and a few gray curling locks in his neck with a deep cut across his forehead over which he wears a black patch and to this you must affix a face which defies the winds of heaven let them visit it as roughly as they may and such is my uncle john a majestic figure on his proper element but rather uncouth in a courtly circle when the royal hand was stretched out for the customary ceremonial the zealous hero fell on his knees and seizing it with more good will than grace saluted it with a smack not quite so loud as the morning gun yet smart enough to surprise the delicate nerves of the wellbred personages there assembled i confess it rather startled me but seeing it received with a smile of so much condescension and benevolence i was the better reconciled to the unusual cordiality which accompanied the performance in the dialogue of the scene the heros modesty was no less conspicuous than his ardor had been in the action of it that countenance which the enemies of his country could not compel to change its hue now colored at the gracious praises of his sovereign and was overspread with blushes that would not have disgraced the maiden cheek when first presented to the salute of majesty and my ears tingled whilst i heard him utter these words in reply to the many gracious speeches that had been made to him  sir your majestys goodness overrates my small deserts the humblest of your subjects has no honor to boast of but the honor of commanding a ships company in perfect discipline and bravely officered and i had been the most abject of beings if the gallant support i received from the earl of s my noble colleague had not inspired me to emulate his valor and jointly exert myself in the service of the most gracious sovereign on earth  i did not lose the look with which this was received it was more than words could have uttered it would have repaid the triumphs of a rodney or the discoveries of a cook  it was now in turn for the brave earl of s to receive those praises which the father of his people and the patron of merit knows so well to bestow i never saw a finer person than this young nobleman fashioned as if he had lived all his days in a court yet with all the manliness that marks the hero he seems formed for conquests over both the sexes he is of the noblest blood in scotland though the fortune of his house by a variety of events in time past has been so impaired as to leave him a very scanty inheritance for the support of his dignity he has served under my uncle from the time he went first to sea and seems to bear him all the duty and affection of a son he was promoted to a sloop for his gallantry in boarding an enemys ship when he was my uncles first lieutenant and this cruize was the first he had taken in the capacity of postcaptain the rich capture he has now made will restore the splendour of his family and furnish him the means of generosity to an only sister to whom he is most affectionately devoted he talks of her in raptures and seems to rejoice in his good fortune only as he may share it with her lady jane s is now on her road out of scotland and he expects her hourly sir francis tells me she is a most lovely girl the very image of his lordship and what endears her to me more than all the friend of my adored louisa  insolent  to dare to call her my louisa and yet believe me i would not barter the hope that now brightens in my prospect for all the treasures of the world  hear me only and then judge  last night lord s and i went to lady trevilles my good uncle john having performed his court ceremonies to his hearts content was so exhilarated on the occasion and made such frequent libations to his majestys health to the navy of old england and a string of seatoasts which he is humorously expert in together with all the manual accompaniments thereunto belonging that though he could not drive my lord and me beyond the verge of sobriety he fairly pushed us to the utmost edge of it so that i went to the good old ladys animated at least if not elevated and finding a party assembled according to custom for a little concert whom should my eyes encounter ready seated at the harpsichord but the cecilia the saint of harmony and my souls idol my divine louisa a lovers sight has the rapidity of lightning my eyes instantaneously caught her charming form and every other object became invisible to me  oh charles charles such a glowing blush mounted in her cheeks such a gleam of sunshine darted from her eyes and i saw my silent welcome in a smile of so much sweetness let me not boast too much if i presume to say of so much love that i was transported out of myself wild as i was and out of all government of discretion i flew to the enchanting object of my adoration with an enthusiasm that obeyed no forms and should certainly have dropped upon my knee at her feet if she had not been more quick to foresee and prevent my design than i was to execute it  mr arundel she cried in that tone of alarm which to the ear of sensibility communicates a volume in a word it was enough i recollected myself in the instant and her glove having fallen from her lap or more probably she having designedly dropped it the attitude i had devoted to other purposes was very aptly applied to a more ordinary act of common politeness enough however had passed to throw her into a confusion that whilst it made me blush for what she suffered perfectly enchanted me with the lovely manner of it  oh charles there was a magic in it that was irrresistibly charming she rallied me with such eyes she recovered herself with so much exquisite address and intuitively discovering all that was passing in my mind and no less quick in discerning the elevation of my spirits with an archness in her look and tittering at the same time she said to me half aloud  you have been dining mr arundel  then addressing herself to lord s she added  i think your lordship kissed hands today  yes madam said he and i expected to have seen arundel repeat the ceremony tonight  to so fair a sovereign i replied the adoration of the heart is the fitter service and i stand corrected  well well returned she if you are a loyal subject let me have a proof of your obedience by taking up your instrument at the word of command and gratifying this good company with the sound of it upon the word i flew to my post the charmer of all ears as well as eyes selected the very song she first performed at spring grove and whispering me as she arranged it on her desk said this song is become a great favorite with me i hope you will not like it the less for being an old acquaintance  but harkye mr arundel added she do not leave me in the passages for i am so fluttered i scarce know how to attempt it  by heaven i murmured in her ear by heaven you are an angel you have the beauty of an angel and the forbearance of one or you would order me out of the room  no no she answered we cannot part from you you have a plea for your good spirits i give you joy of your happiness you cannot possess more than i wish you  but hush  not another word so begin  if i was ever vain enough to approve of my own performance it was at this moment i supported her till i found she had the full command of her voice and then i only gave such occasional aids as added to its brilliancy nothing could exceed the style in which she sung every body was charmed every ear was feasted every eye seemed to gaze upon her with delight it was a circle of friends in perfect good humor with each other  of harmony in every sense of the word not a glance of envy not a scowl of jealousy to cloud the sunshine of the soul i never knew a moment of such heartfelt rapture  when the song was over lady louisa beckoned lord s to her and with a smile in which benevolence and beauty contended for the preeminence told him she had a little ballad written by a scottish muse a dear friend of his and here is adapted also to a scottish tune which she would give him for the sake of the author and then turning to me bade me take up my violin and make out an extemporary accompaniment to the old air of rosline castle she then began a little plaintive ballad which lady jane s had written beginning with the words  what means this languor tell me why thy bosom draws this heaving sigh  which though she addressed to maria i have a shrewd suspicion was a substitution of her own in place of louisa i filled up an accompaniment as well as i could impromptu and when the words were concluded went on with variations upon the motiva as the musicians call it which in the flow of spirits i then felt came spontaneously and with so free a fancy as well as execution that i really believe i acquitted myself very tolerably but whether it deserved praise or not the good humor of the audience bestowed it and the lovely louisa putting two enchanting hands together which if their delicacy could have provoked applause meant to bestow it i was so bewitched with the sweet sight of it that i could no longer resist the impulse but gently enclosing the beauteous captives within mine i again released them with an ardent kiss  summer never showered fresher roses on the vale of sharan than this saucy action spread upon her cheeks nay charles her very bosom took the dye and glittered through the gauze that shaded it  upon my word she said  and smiled a heavenly smile  sacred be the impression upon my lips for ever never shall they violate the purity of that celestial touch whilst they can utter breath i stand in wonder at myself whilst i reflect upon the deed i think the world could not have bribed me to attempt it at any preceding moment of my life i was certainly beside myself  a sudden tremor seized me fearing i had offended but oh my dear charles she cheared me with such a look how was it that i did not run delirious at the sight of it my hand shakes my very brain turns as i reflect upon it  i will remove this enchantress out of your sight  the scene presses to its exit lady treville had stepped up to her and in a whisper which was meant for me to overhear said my dear lady louisa you and your chaperon mrs courtenhall must do me the honor to sup i shall ask nobody but lord s and perhaps this scraper but that will be accordingly as he behaves it shall be quite a private party  ten thousand thanks to my good lady treville replied lady louisa i need not say how happy it would make me but it is impossible i am absent from home upon sufferance and perhaps added she turning her intelligent and soft eyes upon me i have already too far trespassed upon a forbidden pleasure i must be gone this instant  these words were uttered with a sigh which opened all my fate upon me and dashed my joys at once into sadness  desperate however against all appearances i followed her out of the room and offered my hand to conduct her down the stairs she accepted it most complacently nay she even seemed to have expected it and instead of speaking to her servants turned with me into the eating parlour which opened to the hall ah lady louisa said i as we entered i am shocked to think that i am the interdicted object which expels you from society suffer me i beseech you this instant to leave the house  not for the world she replied but without wasting more words upon a subject which i must not enlarge upon permit me to ask you if you have seen my mother for i understand you have been in her neighborhood  i told her i had not  could i tell where she was gone  i assured her i could not i understood it was out of england but i could form no guess at the place and i was sorry to perceive by her question that it was equally a secret from her  it is indeed she replied and as you cannot give me information i despair of it by any other channel for i confess to you i supposed you was in correspondence with her  there was something in her manner of saying this that determined me to be explicit as to the letters i had received from lady g as well as with respect to the other particulars she had enquired into i therefore said  upon my honor lady louisa i am totally without a guess where that excellent lady whose situation is so painful to my mind has thought fit to retire to i thought it due to the respect and gratitude i bear her to write to her before my coming into the country distantly to sound her inclinations if a visit might be acceptable to her this drew a short but very gracious answer from her ladyship in which she seemed to allow of it but upon my arrival at arundelhouse i thought it an attention which i owed to the peculiarity of her situation to write a second time submitting it to her discretion to reconsider of the proposal and i trust the real motives for my hesitation need not be justified to you but that they speak for themselves  to this she assented with a nod and i then concluded by telling her i had received an answer to this note in which lady g acquiesced in the propriety of those motives and informed me that she was going out of england without telling me where  i am glad you have told me this she replied because i think it not impossible i shall hear the story differently stated and i am determined to believe nothing to the contrary of what you have told me and now concluded she i am afraid i must take leave of you oh lady louisa i exclaimed and at the same time pressed her unresisting hand may i hope i have not offended you  heavens mr arundel offended me where was your observation if you could suspect it  i know you are all goodness condescension gentleness but the sudden joy of seeing you was too much for me you conquer every sense at once you are mistress over every heart  and yet there is but one mr arundel on which i wish to leave a lasting impression  the look she gave me pointed the application i had been insensible could i have missed it again i pressed my lips upon her hand and with faultering voice replied  am i too presumptuous lady louisa when i say your image is indelibly imprinted on my heart when i aspire to tell the most exalted of her sex that i dote upon you to distraction yes madam hopeless as i am unapproachable though you are an angel moving in a sphere above my reach still i will adore you still my prayers shall follow you and my devoted heart though fated to despair persist to love till the hand of death shall stop its motion  as i was pronouncing these words i felt a tear drop upon my hand when directing my eyes to the fount from which it fell i saw her beauteous countenance surrendered to the tenderest and fondest emotions as she stood in a posture inclining toward me i expected she would fall and was prepared to catch her in my arms but a sudden recollection seemed to awaken her and casting her eyes upon mrs courtenhall who was waiting in the room mr arundel she said if you really feel the love which you express you need not yield to the despair you seem to apprehend i never studied to disguise my feelings and you cannot fail to have discovered them interpret them therefore in the way most acceptable to yourself and believe me incapable of dissimulation on this you may depend that though i will never take a step in direct disobedience to a fathers authority i will not sacrifice my happiness in life to a compliance with his partiality for any man whom my heart cannot approve  so saying she turned hastily away and seeing me about to follow her to the door she bade me stay where i was till she was gone and taking hold of mrs courtenhalls arm hastened out of the room bestowing on me a look at parting that said farewell in a language that no eyes can speak so eloquently as hers  i rejoined the company up stairs who were too delicate to make the least remark upon my absence and after a little more music our party dispersed leaving nobody but lord s and myself with lady treville who was just telling his lordship that she hoped his sister would accept of an apartment in her house upon her arrival in town and that she had written a letter for that purpose to be given to her at hatfield where she would change horses when our attention being called off by a rapping at the door whilst we were protesting against the admission of so unseasonable a visitor who should enter the room but lady jane herself instantly she flew into her brothers arms who ran to her with equal transport  my archibald my hero she exclaimed thus may we ever meet thus may i ever glory in my brother  i marked her countenance it was illuminated with joy the fires that sparkled in her eyes would not admit a tear to quench them she was the very model of a roman sister congratulating a beloved brother on his triumph  again she clasped him in her arms and cried  well done my archibald well done and all this victory gained without a wound thank heaven that honor i can well away with  she now addressed herself to lady treville in a style of politeness that quite charmed me for this young lady charles has a peculiar grace in all she does which i cannot well describe to you when lady treville presented me to her she received me with a most sweet yet penetrating look which seemed to tell me she was no stranger to my ambitious love though she had scarce allowed herself to rest upon her journey she would not own to any fatigue and after we had supped her spirits were so gay and fresh and she had so many enquiries to make about the action so many civil things to say to the lady of the house and talked in so delightful a style of my adored louisa whilst she archly contrived to draw out my whole heart upon the subject that the minutes posted so fast away upon the wings of joy that time was totally forgotten by all but our good old hostess who was best acquainted with it and had most reason to remember it at length she brought us to a proper sense of lady janes repose and with an air of motherly authority in her lively goodhumoured manner cried out  be gone young men to your quarters be gone this moment though lady jane is a goddess she cannot live without sleep  farewell letter lxxi arundel to charles mortlake this morning at six oclock my bounteous benefactor closed his eyes for ever sir francis arundel is no more death whom he had so often braved in the field stole upon him unawares in his sleep and extinguished him without a groan few are the days i have lived with him and known him many and vast are the obligations i owe him he has been a dying man ever since the fatal event which bereft him of his son the happy day he passed with my uncle john on his arrival was the last enjoyment he had of his senses and except the time he accompanied me to the house of commons he has never been out of his doors since i have been with him  as his corpse must be interred in the family vault at arundel i shall come down to attend the funeral and that all things may be in proper order for that solemnity i intend to leave town tomorrow and shall be accompanied by my uncle john you will be so good to inform the housekeeper of this that she may provide accordingly and expect us by dinnertime  as soon as the funeral is over lord s has promised to come down to us and if we can prevail upon lady treville to accompany lady jane which i do not despair of they will be of the party should that take place you will have an opportunity of seeing old age and youth in their most amiable characters guard your heart well for if it is as open to love as it is to friendship and benevolence farewell to its tranquillity if you come within the glance of lady janes bright eyes  adieu letter lxxii lady jane s to lady louisa g was it not a most obliging act of lady treville to come with me hither by which i was enabled to accompany my brother and enjoy the society of some of the most amiable people living in one of the most delightful scenes  i am greatly struck with the natural beauties of this place and though the mansion is ancient yet it is in a stately style and the principal apartments are really very fine  the funeral was over before our arrival and the worthy general now sleeps with his ancestors his corpse was attended to the vault by the heir and captain arundel and the service performed by mr mortlake the new rector of this parish and the bosom friend of his patron mr arundels father now sir joseph declined being present either at the funeral or at the opening of the will i suspect he is a very unpleasant kind of being captain john informs me that the estate is a good nine thousand a year in land and he thinks the ready money cannot be less than twenty thousand pounds to the heir when all legacies are paid  and if you add to this said he the pickings of my old carcass when the fates have disposed of it frank will be a warm fellow  i have told my dear louisa how much i was pleased with the man of her heart at our first meeting i now find there is no less to love than to admire in him do you know louisa that lord s and i agree in thinking him extremely like you can i speak in higher commendation of his person than when i protest to you i am not conscious that i flatter him i must believe you are destined for each other oh that my dear louisa was here with us my poor head will be quite turned by the attentions which are paid me think only what a contrast to the dreary solitude of my native castle here am i queen regent of an empire which i trust is destined to a fitter as well as fairer sovereign every face i meet reflects the smile of benevolence upon me is it not the very quintessence of human happiness to be centered in the hearts of those we love to be embosomed in the society of the virtues  as sir francis had a wellregulated family of servants and lived in a style very suitable to his fortune our friend has very little trouble with his domestic arrangements the works he is carrying on at the parsonage house seem to be his principal occupation at present and for the present he turns a deaf ear to all projects for the embellishment of his own domain  it is the first object with me he said this morning as we were walking in the park to make mortlake happy in his situation as for this old mansion and its premises i will do nothing more than keep it in its present good repair till the time may come that i may consult a better taste than my own for the improvement of it then pausing for a few moments with a sigh he exclaimed  but what are these presumptuous hopes which i indulge ah lady jane i delude myself i do but walk in a vain shadow all the favors of fortune are but lost upon me i cannot enjoy them was ever man so courted by prosperity see how happiness solicits me look at those heroes  here he pointed to his uncle and my brother who were walking together arm in arm toward the river  how am i honored in calling one uncle and the other friend carry your eye up to that house which hangs over the river they are going to is it not a charming spot and how ought i to be blessed in the friend which possesses it what a delightful sensation do i feel when i contemplate that habitation and say within myself in that asylum i have placed the friend of my heart the gentlest kindest best of human beings oh lady jane if ever there was a faultless creature mortlake is the man  this methinks is blessing enough for any one persons share in life but as if fortune would never be weary of her favors to me she has added to her other gifts the happiness and honor which i am this moment enjoying with a friend as amiable as she is noble in whose heart i do not despair at humble distance to participate with my louisa herself  i give you his own flattering words my dear though i ought to blush for my assurance shall i proceed stand aside vanity and i will  yes lady jane he continued you have a womans feelings and an angels pity you can understand and commiserate the inquietudes of a heart so empassioned as mine is you can suffer me to talk of my souls idol you can hear me with patience and can allow for the extravagancies of a discourse which observes no order  but i will restrain myself he added let us join your brother  he and the old captain were at that instant very busily employed upon the launch of a new boat just arrived from london these heroes who had so lately triumphed over the flag of spain were stripped to their shirts and occupied in the humble office of tallowing the bottom of a wherry and so ardent were they both in their task that i doubt if the very odor of their work was not grateful to their nostrils a country fellow was standing by them gaping with surprise but totally out of employment as the weather is supremely fine we propose to go upon the medway this evening and under such command i should not tremble to encounter scylla and charybdis in all their poetical terrors  mortlake was standing on the opposite bank upon a terrace in his garden which butts against the river at the end of this terrace there is a landingplace where a little boat which serves to ferry him over the water was moored to the shore and as we approached we heard the old captain roaring out to the doctor as he calls him to push his boat across the stream and take the lady on board for that i was coming to visit him upon this summons he came over whereupon arundel and i stepped into the boat and though our worthy ferryman seemed to me to acquit himself very expertly yet this old son of the ocean kept jibing and jeering at him in his sea language every inch of the way standing all the while in his shirt with the sleeves tucked up to his elbows no hat upon his head and his bald pate shining in the sun a tremendous gash across his forehead plaistered over with a huge black patch and of so gigantic a form that it is no wonder he is terrible to his enemies when i declare even i who dote upon him could not survey his figure without trembling mr mortlake who delights in his humor kept up the water language with a great deal of pleasantry till he landed us at the foot of the stairs which lead to his terrace here in stepping out of the boat which was rather unsteady my foot slipped and i should certainly have had a very ugly fall upon the edge of the boat backwards if mortlake had not with great address caught me in his arms my dear brother whose eyes were upon me gave a loud shriek but when he saw me safe he called out to my preserver  well handled my brave fellow keep hold of what you have got you deserve her for your pains  whether it was this raillery of my brothers or the alarm of my danger or what else i know not but he had no sooner set me on my feet than the color went from his cheeks his whole frame trembled and if he had not squatted down upon the steps i think verily he would have fainted i confess to you i was very much touched with his sensibility and so was arundel  lord s ran down to the riverside and cried out  my dear mortlake i hope you are not hurt  by this time he was recovering and having assured my brother that no harm had befallen either of us we walked up the garden lawn to the house we entered the library by a glass door and in my life i was never so enchanted with the elegant simplicity and proportion of a room before by the preparations for the books it should seem the collection is considerable and i am told they are very well selected in short they are worthy both of the giver and receiver nobody can bestow with such a grace as arundel nobody can apply them to better purpose than mortlake we went over the house and i am charmed with every part of it the bedrooms a dressing room and drawing room are yet unfurnished and mr arundel said he had drawn me thither on purpose to avail himself of my taste in the choice of the papers and cottons of which he laid before me a variety of patterns help us out i beseech you lady jane said he for we college drones are but sorry judges in these matters  whilst i sat down to examine a large parcel of these samples one of the workmen called mr arundel out of the room and how it was i know not but i confess to you my dear louisa i felt a little queerish just now finding myself alone with a very handsome and a very young man in the awkward office of choosing beds and curtains whilst he was folding and unfolding and hovering about me so i fairly threw the work aside for the time and told him i would wait till mr arundel returned mortlake whose sensibility nothing can escape and who perhaps had not quite recovered his former agitation now blushed like scarlet and i have no doubt i looked silly enough for i confess my brothers words though probably spoken in mere pleasantry without meaning had put my heart into no small flutter in this situation we both stood silent for a time and irresolute what to say or do next on these occasions a woman generally is the first to find her tongue and i began to talk of the escape i had had and to thank him for his care and protection of me which i was afraid had occasioned him some pain or hurt which he did not own to  he assured me that he felt no pain but what arose from my danger and even the apprehension of any harm befalling me was more than he could bear  but we must not trust you to the boat any more added he and i will desire arundel to send for his carriage to take you home by the road i had now recovered from my embarassment and calling him back as he was going out of the room declared against the carriage telling him we should never hear an end of the old captains raillery if we gave the cause up so cowardly besides added i it would betray a want of confidence in my conductor which would be very ungrateful in me to do it is your conductor replied he who wants confidence in himself when he has such a treasure in his charge  nay answered i but what will my brother say to that if you desert a station which he commanded you to keep will not there be something like mutiny in that  ah madam he replied if lord s promotes me to an honor so infinitely above my merits how ought an humble man to act in such a case  i dare say said i lord s is too good a judge of merit not to know that humility is one of the surest marks which belong to it  mr arundel now returned and put a stop to a conversation that was growing rather serious we now passed a few minutes longer in the house took a walk round the garden and repassing the river found a carriage in waiting for us on the park side and so returned to the house together  immediately on my arrival a servant gave me the following letter which completely verifies your prediction  i venture to inform the most adorable of women that her ever faithful and most devoted admirer is waiting within a few paces of the house in anxious hope that he may be permitted to repeat his vows and pour out his full heart at her feet admit me most angelic lady jane to your presence let my eyes once more behold that object on which my heart doats to distraction and from which his affections have never strayed even for a moment when hard necessity compelled it to suspend its hope that necessity so lamented by your faithful lover is now removed not by any change in your fortune though even that i rejoice in but by a better disposition of my own affairs and i am now more impatient than ever to declare myself  most beloved of my soul your ever faithful and most fondly devoted adam crichton   as soon as i had read this curious epistle i took my brother aside and relating to him what had passed between sir adam and me at edenborough gave him the letter having perused it he cried out  the devil take the assurance of this fellow he deserves to be exposed for his meanness but however send him his answer and dismiss him and let it be explicit enough to silence him for the time to come for some of our countrymen jane are not easily put by from their point  i sat down immediately and wrote the following short answer  lady jane s presents her compliments to sir adam crichton and begs leave to decline the honor of any further correspondence with him upon the subject which his letter alludes to   this i dispatched by his servant and hoped to hear no more of my lover when behold in less than the space of half an hour a servant announced him to mr arundel who seemed much surprised at the name of a visitor to whom he was a perfect stranger but as there was no hesitation to be made in point of politeness about receiving him orders were given to show sir adam crichton into the room lord s had just time to whisper a few words to mr arundel when the gentleman made his entrance into the room where we were all assembled the old captain and mortlake being just then engaged at the backgammon table and paying little attention to what was going forward as soon as sir adam had made his apologies to mr arundel which he performed with a great deal of civil circumlocution he asked leave to speak with me alone upon which my brother demanded if he had not had an answer from lady jane already he acknowledged to have received a short note but hoped i would yet indulge him with an opportunity of explaining himself upon this arundel and mortlake rose up and were preparing to leave the room but as i was resolute against any conversation with him i requested them to stay for that sir adam and i had no private business whatever lord s now addressed him in a serious tone as follows  sir adam crichton you have heard my sisters resolution and therefore i must on her behalf insist upon it that you do not press her with another word upon the subject upon these conditions if you choose to honor us with your company i think i may answer for my friend mr arundel that all civilities will be paid to sir adam crichton in his house  certainly if sir adam will do me that honor said mr arundel yet coolly enough  the old captain who did not understand a word of all this was bawling out to mortlake to resume his game at backgammon but in vain i never saw so restless a creature he was in all parts of the room by turns and never quiet in any observing this the commander grew out of patience and being totally in the dark and not over quick at seeing into the causes and reasons of things vociferated still louder crying out come come doctor bear a hand where the plague art capering to what the dickens is all this to thee dont run away from the game when i have a gammon in my tables  during this a perfect silence had reigned in our quarter whilst sir adams eyes had gone a progress round the room sometimes looking inquisitively at my brother then piteously at me then enviously at arundel honoring me as i believe with a suspicion that he had spied out a rival and very naturally concluding from the superiority he there beheld that his cause must be hopeless he rose at length from his chair without uttering a word made a very awkward bow and departed  mr arundel followed him to the hall door performing all the rights of hospitality with great politeness when the baronet as he was parting took courage and said  i perceive sir you are the happy man to which your friend made reply  i am indeed sir every body must be happy in the society of lady jane s  there is a declaration for you ah my poor forsaken louisa are you not heartbroken with jealousy  well lady jane said arundel as he returned to us with a smile upon his countenance your lover has made a notable discovery amongst us he has found out the happy man who has thrust him out of your heart  happy man indeed i replied and who may he be  look about you said he your lover is in the room  is he so cried the gallant veteran in a voice of thunder and starting from his seat very gallantly seized hold of my hand saying then i claim her for my prize and if any man is bold enough to dispute it with me let him come on i will burn sink and destroy him in an hurry  ah lady jane lady jane it is in vain to disguise it i saw the tender looks you gave me when i was in the elegant employ of tallowing the boats bottom come confess was not that the favorable moment i knew you could not stand this bald pate and black patch harkye doctor put in the banns and splice your bellropes for we will have a merry peal  the old mans raillery saved some certain embarassments that were visible amongst us and thus ended the adventure of sir adam crichton  farewell letter lxxiii lady jane s to lady louisa g i have had a lecture from lady treville this morning do you know my dear jane says she that you are making poor mortlake most completely in love with you now this i must chide you for because take notice though it may be sport to you it is death to him  but perhaps i do not mean to let him die  then what do you mean you giddy creature  any thing rather than incur your displeasure and give you just occasion for chiding me which if i was capable of playing the coquette with so excellent a creature i should richly deserve  the lord be good unto me my dear girl why he is a parson  very true and sir adam crichton is a baronet and i am an earls daughter and yet i can despise the man of money and admire the man of merit  well to be sure this is mighty fine and romantic but you are jesting with me all this while  pardon me my dear lady you have taken the very way to make me serious for if you are founded in your observation and i have really made the impression upon mortlakes heart which you suspect i have not that trivial mind to revolt from his profession or slight a virtuous man because devoted to the service of his god shall the color of a mans clothes or the cut of his hair disgust my vanity and decide against a character in which every perfection of heart and head every excellence of mind and person apparently unite if i am to consult my eye where can it rest upon a finer person than mortlakes if i am to be guided by my judgment can it direct me to a worthier choice  but a parsons wife my dear  only think of lady jane s young noble blooming beauteous the admiration of the whole town the pattern of all elegance and the soul of all societies  a parsons wife  and why not if lady jane prefers tranquillity to dissipation solid happiness to fleeting pleasures if lady jane prefers the blessings of the poor to the admiration of the town lady jane will not regret that she is no longer the soul of those societies which her soul cannot approve and though she does not mean to lessen her attentions to elegance yet as a pattern of it she would not wish to be distinguished whilst there are so many nobler patterns for her emulation  but your family my dear child your noble i may say your royal blood  then above all the earl your brother he will now expect to establish you in some great connection you saw with what indignity he spurned at the alliance of sir adam crichton what will he say to that of mortlake  you mistake my brothers motives for treating sir adams proposals with contempt the man not his alliance is contemptible my brother will not seek out matches of interest or ambition for me he is too honorable to wish to enslave my affections and he knows my spirit too well to attempt it the authority he holds with me is of my giving not of his exacting it springs from the love i bear him from the opinion i entertain of his judgment and the reverence i pay to his virtues but neither he nor any creature living or that ever did live shall prescribe to me in that important choice which is to decide the happiness or misery of my future days much less will i be swayed from my judgment by the despicable pride of family the sordid lure of interest or silly cry of fashion which looks no further than the surface of the man and cannot see the light of the soul if the body be habited in black  now then we are agreed concluded the old lady i have played a little harmless artifice upon you and have touched methinks upon every point that could probe the feelings of a woman of distinction circumstanced as you are had i found you tender in any part and shrinking from the touch i had trembled for your danger but you have even bettered my very best opinion and are more than ever dear to me  and now changing her tone and countenance in a moment she began to railly me about the simplicity of my dress which she said was all subtlety and contrivance that i might not awe a modest lover by appearances  and there in truth she was not out of her guess  i am sure she said this white linen surplice and vestal hood with all their chaste accompaniments are levelled at the parsonage but you are mistaken child in their effect instead of hiding they enhance your charms lady jane in her court dress is only a fine woman in this saintlike habit she is something more and though a heathen priest in the spirit of enthusiasm might prevail upon himself to sacrifice you as a victim at the altar no christian priest will ever venture to approach so spiritualized a being with the carnal ideas of love my life upon it the humble mortlake will not dare to approach you any otherwise than on his knees  and if he does approach me on his knees my dear lady i replied he will not find me so spiritualized as you seem to make me i have hitherto kept love at a distance or at best played with him as a child with her kitten when sir adam knelt at my feet i could have gone on with my needle and not pricked my fingers i could have counted the buttons upon his coat or numbered every curl in his hair he might have molded my hand between his till he was weary without putting my pulse out of its pace but oh heavens if a finger of this charming fellow does but touch my glove it sets my heart into a flutter and when he caught me in his arms as i was falling into the river how did i wish he would have taken my brother at his word and held me there for life  heyday heyday she cried stark staring mad already why this is next kin to love at first sight  well well such things may have been but they are too long past for me to remember them however since it is so you have no time to throw away choose your papers and your printed cottons and set the upholsterer to work as fast you can before he has done his job you will be ready for yours or i am mistaken  but come my dear let us go down to breakfast too much love upon an empty stomach is not good for the constitution  this learned dialogue had kept our tongues so long in motion that when we came into the breakfast room we found the gentlemen waiting for us and were saluted by the old captain with a whistle to the tune of the boatswain when he pipes all hands to the mess as i was about to seat myself at the table where i was to officiate mortlake ran with a chair for me though a man with more observation and less zeal might easily have found out there was no want of it i am afraid i had already sat down but you know a lady may have a preference for such a trifle as an odd chair and so to make short of a trifle i quitted my own and took his immediately my wicked brother cried out  mortlake there is promotion for you jane has shifted her flag and you have nothing to do but take post by succession  i can only say he did not avail himself of the hint but having full employment in combating my own embarassment i cannot give any account how mortlake disposed of his  after breakfast my brother drew me out into the garden and during our walk we had the following conversation  i flatter myself my dear jane now you have discarded your unworthy lover you mean to supply the vacancy in your heart with one more deserving  ah brother love you know is like death the necessary end it will come when it will come  and have you no hints and intimations of his approach at present  humph that is a trapping question methinks do you spy out any such  why to say the truth i suspect you have a little inclination to cross the water  aye but you see i stumbled in the passage  true but it was only to fall into a young mans arms it was so that william the norman stumbled upon english ground at his landing but remember it was a lucky omen for he conquered and took possession of the soil he fell on  and did you mean to make a case in point when you bid my preserver keep possession of what he had saved  upon my honor jane if you can see your happiness in humble life my pride will never stand in the way of it so you can but dwell with content whether it is in a palace or a parsonage i shall equally rejoice  perhaps i should not have said quite so much awhile ago but since i have now fortune sufficient to make you affluent with the man of your choice be his condition what it may if that mans mind and person if his temper understanding and manners are altogether such as you approve and love attracts your heart to his i should be base in the extreme were i to interpose a wish in bar of your affections no my dear sister let me rather prompt you to pursue your passion when it leads to an object so deserving nobility can never degrade itself by an alliance with virtue  there spoke my brother i exclaimed and at the same time clasped him in my arms  this it is to possess the soul of a hero but now deal freely with me my dear archibald i added and as my heart is open all its warmth and all its weakness as well known to you as the features of my face have you seen any thing in me have you discovered any thing in mortlake which seems to threaten future discontent between us have you any alarm for our happiness what is there in myself to correct what in him to disapprove and guard myself against  i will answer you sincerely and for yourself first  if i did not know you as i do i might suppose your character was ill adapted to the sober line of life in which he moves i might suppose your high and ardent spirit your vivacity and brilliant talents your elegance of manners mind and person were qualities that never could submit to a retired and humble destination but i know you better i have seen you in the solitude of fergus castle in the melancholy duty of an attendant on a dying grandmother lost to the world and to herself i have seen you patiently enduring the restraints of poverty and according yourself to the narrowest system of frugality without a murmur i know you have no pride but that of principle no contempt but of vice and meanness and though you have understanding figure and address to grace the highest rank in life vivacity to give them a display and passions to impel them into action yet i know your mind is so strong fortified with reason and your soul so firmly anchored in religion that i have had not the smallest doubt of your security  as for mortlake though i want no other test of his merit than the friendship which arundel entertains for him and though my education does not enable me to form any judgment of an understanding and knowledge so superior to what i can boast of yet of his heart i flatter myself i am entitled to speak of his candor modesty benevolence sweetness of temper i cannot fail to be a judge for they are as conspicuous as the light evident as truth itself his manners are of the purest sort and though not such as fashion adopts yet are they what the finest gentleman might make the model of his practice though his spirit is gentle it is as highly empassioned and as warm my sweet jane even as your own his soul is all benevolence his religion is philanthropy active liberal tolerating untainted by hypocrisy and not clouded by gloom but lively gay and social as to his external i can only say that a sweeter countenance and a finer person i have no where seen of that you must judge for yourself and if your eyes speak the language of your heart which i cannot doubt of they have told him in pretty plain terms what an interest he has there with respect to all the essentials of domestic happiness this most beautiful spot in which arundel has placed him the elegant and comfortable habitation he has provided for him the decent income he derives from his living the little paternal property he enjoys and your portion of that treasure which is only valuable to me as i can share it with you will put you so completely at your ease in point of fortune that i foresee nothing that can add to the happy prospect in your view but an event which i hope providence will bring to pass the union of your charming and beloved friend with the only man living who deserves her  that indeed i eagerly observed would be a consummation of my bliss that would make me supremely happy and surely we may presume that heaven which formed them for each other will complete its own designs by uniting them then indeed when friend is joined to friend from the terrace of my little garden with a joy unallayed by envy i shall survey the neighboring mansion where my louisa dwells with her beloved arundel united in the bonds of harmony with such a family how serene will be my life blessed in the affections of my husband my understanding enlarged by his instructions and my heart animated by his virtues think with what transport i shall meet my heroic brother returning from his wars with conquest having finished his career of glory and welcome him into the arms of peace weaving fresh laurels for his honored brow  here we were stopped in our dialogue by an elegant and graceful form habited in deep mourning who approached without observing us he was engaged in contemplating a miniature pourtrait which he held in his hand and on which his eyes were most lovingly fixed  need i say it was arundel need i add that the object of his contemplation was the copy of the fairest face in the creation the gift of my louisa to her faithful jane and her loan to this enamoured lover could i withhold from him this friendly solace of his meditations this reflection of an image imprinted on his heart i trust you will not think i have misused your favor by imparting it to him  ah lady jane he cried this was a daring painter  how could he look upon those eyes and live he then shut the shagreen case in which the picture is enclosed and returned it to me saying  i believe i have got this book by heart  i hope you will soon have the original in possession replied my brother you may then pursue your studies according to the publisher presumes his lordship alluded to the following passage nocturna versate manu versate diurna horaces instruction both by night and by day  oh heavenly hope replied arundel on which my imagination dwells how kindly you console me but when i ask myself on what foundation it is built how like the baseless fabric of a vision does it then appear though i am well assured that lady louisa will neither be persuaded nor compelled into a marriage with sir george revel yet how can i flatter myself that any future time or circumstance can reconcile the hostile mind of lord g to me he has not the gift of forgiveness nor i the art of hypocrisy where then is my hope  cannot you answer that query said my brother to me  in my own case i replied i could readily answer it in my friends i cannot the seeds of rebellion so rank in my nature in her pure mind take no root filial obedience in her is a principle she cannot violate nay i am persuaded she would sacrifice the happiness of her life or even life itself rather than transgress a duty which she regards as interdictory against her own inclinations though she may not admit it to be compulsory upon them  i conceive said arundel you have very correctly understood her rule of acting and i will as correctly conform to it be the event as fatal to my happiness as i fear it will be if i could persuade her to an act with which her gentle mind would reproach her it is what the world would not bribe me to attempt no i must submit i am neither capable of perverting her filial piety nor of conciliating her fathers rooted animosity at the same time i know my pretensions it is no vanity in me to say for it is no merit of my own which enables me to say it that if hereditary honors pass for any thing the name of arundel may stand upon the line with any name in europe weigh it it is as heavy conjure with it it will raise a spirit as soon as bourbon or nassau the fortune i inherit by the bounty of the deceased though not to be compared with sir george revels is such however as the parent of no lady could object to for as it is without adverting to other contingencies it more than trebles the estate which will devolve upon lady louisa with the barony that in failure of a son and heir goes to her the rest of his lordships estate is in close entail upon the male heir add to this that the generosity of my uncle john has opened other mines upon me which might tempt lord g if avarice were his ruling passion to stifle his resentment and wave all objections against me but i will neither consent to take the prize out of the victors generous hand who earned it nor will i so insult lord g as to suppose he can be bribed by any offers however splendid to relax from his hostility  oh my louisa what a man this is though nature cast him in a mould to strike our eyes with admiration at the very instant of beholding him yet she has endowed his mind with something so superior to external grace that every hour increases our esteem and love for my part i perfectly venerate him as a kind of being of a higher order i love him trust him converse with him without any of that timid reserve or holding back so natural to the shyness of our sex such is the delicacy of his nature that when alone with him i seem in company with my louisa i tender myself to him as a partner in his private meditations because i can perceive it sooths his mind to talk with me of his and my louisa taken from you in presence not in heart he finds relief in conversation which he knows full well can never weary me nor need we dread the languor of repetition when you are the subject in whom we can still find new charms new virtues to admire and praise without exhausting the supply that feeds us with variety  here i must break off as we are now going upon the river in the new wherry which our sea captains have put into perfect trim the afternoon is charming our commanders are waiting at the place of embarkation i hear the voice of lady treville summoning me to the party in the gayest and most exhilarating tone she stands on the lawn under my window arm in arm with arundel mortlake is waiting unengaged and casts up a wishful look in which amidst the modest diffidence that characters his face i can discern a faint and glimmering expectation the embryo of a hope that i shall destine him to the same friendly and familiar office  yes mortlake thou shall have thy hope my arm shall be supported upon thine nor one alone but both are ready to enfold thee my conscious heart acknowledges it cannot bestow a joy on thee greater than that which it receives by giving  farewell  i fly to him with such impatience that if he has eyes he must discover me ah me he has discovered me  i have given him a smile of assignation that has transported him i am betrayed  no matter i cannot counterfeit nor would i if i could  farewell letter lxxiv lady louisa g to lady jane s alas that mine should be the destiny to blast the happiness of those i love to put to hazard perhaps oh horror beyond thought to destroy a life far dearer to me than my own  arundel has been represented to me as the vilest of men must i add as the seducer the violator of my mothers honor the circumstances reported to me by my father originate from sir george revel and are simply these   a note from my mother to arundel written at the instant of her departure was intercepted by sir george revel on the spot who arrived at her house just after she had left it and found means to get this letter out of the servants hands who was entrusted to deliver it  this letter i saw in her own handwriting and read it myself  it is little else than a short adieu she wishes him not to aggravate lord g she conjures him to avoid fresh dissensions with sir george revel but she plainly hints at intelligence heretofore imparted to him by herself with respect to me  this is the whole of it and this alone would have been an attack i could easily enough have put by in silence had it not been followed by other circumstances fabricated by the very father of lies the author of all mischief for that wretch sir george revel pretends he has a deposition of the servant from whom he got the letter charging my guiltless mother with a criminal assignation and meeting with arundel in a certain building within a grove adjoining to her garden and asserting that of this meeting he was an eyewitness  such is my persuasion of the purity and honor of the parties concerned that had i no other grounds for disbelieving this abominable and malicious fiction i could not harbor a suspicion to their prejudice but when i call to mind the zeal with which she recommends my union with arundel and the prayers she offers up for its success is it in nature to suppose this accusation can be true is there a parent living so devoid of conscience if to the disgrace of human nature such a monster does exist it cannot be my mother another circumstance there is which stamps the horrid tale with falsehood the informer has disappeared and as the whole charge rests upon the hearsay evidence and veracity of sir george revel who does not deny that he connived at the fellows escape by promise previously engaged we are left to conclude that either no such informer exists and the entire story is a malicious fabrication of sir georges or else that there is such gross and palpable subornation in the case that the fugitive conscious of his perjury dares not abide the scrutiny nor meet the accused face to face  but all this while glaring as these circumstances are my father credits or pretends to credit the tale and the reputation of my innocent mother is to be blasted through the world whenever he thinks fit to appeal to it and divert the public odium from himself to her can this be suffered rather let me ask can it be prevented otherwise than by appealing to arundel and yet what horrors agonize my heart when i reflect upon the danger of that measure alas my friend this disappointed desperate man thirsts for his blood my fatal preference dooms him to the assassins sword i am the murderer of arundel  this is the diabolical plot which that wretch has been hatching in his journey into kent heaven forbid i should say my father is an accomplice in it truth compels me to own that he is the willing dupe of it to what purpose then should i be silent toward you or you toward arundel for if it comes not to his ears through my channel it will through my father who affects to credit it it will be charged upon him by that monster who avows it and provokes me to reveal it  were any one but myself the reporter of it to arundel how would he be assured of my entire rejection and abhorrence of the falsehood silence might give him a suspicion that i was base enough to doubt whereas i am prepared to give him full complete and unequivocal proof of confidence by making common cause with him and throwing myself resolutely into the arms of the very man whom they accuse yes arundel be this my refutation of the charge thus let me defend the slandered character of an innocent parent no other cause could justify me to myself for such a step but this makes disobedience virtue in the defense of innocence my spirit rises to a pitch that emulates even thy heroism my beloved jane  can the daughter wed with the corrupter of the mother this is their language my nature shudders at the thought  be this the test then of my confidence in arundel i will stake my soul upon his truth can i depose more strongly to his innocence oaths may be given for purposes friends have been perjured for friends but who ever drew such horrors on their head as i now invoke on mine upon the issue of this falsehood glaring as hell itself must be the lie that i would at such peril refute  exert yourself for a friend whose heart is rent with agonies consult your noble brother devise some means for preventing the effusion of blood dearer than that which flows from my afflicted heart say to arundel that i am ready to escape with him to that asylum of fond fugitives which till now i never dreamt of resorting to let him not delay a moment but come in secrecy to london our marriage will stamp the lie upon sir george there needs no more to blast his story arundel as my husband has answered his accuser fully there can be then no appeal to the sword the world will hoot the villain as he passes he will stand upon perpetual record a liar confuted and confessed  farewell letter lxxv lady jane s to lady louisa g i have no words that can express to you my indignation against that monster revel my feelings for the injured arundel or the just encomiums which are due to your heroic generous conduct  to the letter i enclose let me refer you for the grateful sentiments of a man whose whole soul is yours it seems to me as if he did not feel the venom of the accusation so transported is he with the proof of your acquittal of him of your confidence  oh generous louisa  of your unshaken love  if ever truth and honor inhabited the human heart it is in arundels they dwell unspotted uncontaminated  my gallant brother perfectly adores you his noble blood is all on fire and though he is my dearest hope on earth i am proud to lend him to the cause of arundel i see him inlist in his service without a sigh and i glory in the zeal and ardor of his friendship  they are gone forth  let me adjure you by the most earnest entreaties not to torture your too feeling anxious thoughts with imaginary terrors be patient stifle all enquiries whither they are gone and what they are about put up your prayers to the avenger of all wickedness confide in him and he will bring it to pass  i have a packet of papers sealed up and committed to me by arundel which if occasion requires i am bidden to deliver into your hands  it is at the joint request of all parties that i remain here under the protection of lady treville who kindly consents to stay with me captain arundel with mr mortlake now make up the relics of our late happy family  it was on the consideration of my abiding here that the veteran consented to remain behind his admiration of his beloved lady louisa rises to enthusiasm he raves as loudly in your praises as in the execrations which he vents against the wretch who has disturbed our peace on him he pours a torrent of contempt expressed in such an unintelligible ridiculous medley of sea phrases that it is scarce possible to keep my countenance though the few ideas to be collected from them are not always of the cleanliest sort  mortlake the mildest of all heavens creatures is for ever occupied in qualifying his fury or consoling my anxiety his pious and pacific nature argues thus  an honest man will never want the means of detecting falsehood and exposing a liar without resorting to those violent measures which wear the complexion of revenge rather than of justice if i hold up a villain to the worlds contempt it is all the punishment a villain can receive on earth but if i call him our and put my cause to the arbitration of the sword and if he boldly answers to the call i set a varnish on his crimes to screen him from contempt and the world whilst it acknowledges his resolution in the contest forgets or pardons the guilt that puts it into action  these are arguments which captain arundel would just as well comprehend if they were delivered in the hebrew language and accordingly he answers them as he would an enemy at sea who hailed him in an unknown tongue  from the mouth of his guns these again are as unintelligible to the pacific controverter of his opinions for being uttered in a language not to be found either amongst the living or the dead they cannot reach the intellects of mortlake who modestly retreats in silence from the field and leaves it to the louder disputant to spend his fury in the desert air  for my part though i have all the feelings of my sex about me i would not wish these generous friends to act but as they do for whilst i must in conscience admit the truth of mortlakes argument i cannot bring my heart to disapprove of arundels spirit  may heaven watch over them and you my more than ever dear louisa farewell  letter lxxvi arundel to lady louisa g enclosed in the above that the same assassin who attempted my life should now attempt my reputation i can well believe and perhaps if the malicious falsehood had been only aimed at me contempt had been its proper refutation but when a crime of the blackest dye is fabricated by a villain for the purpose of fixing it upon the spotless character of a defenseless absent lady and the husband of that lady is so grossly credulous or else so wilfully cruel as to give his sanction to the tale can i her only advocate desert her cause will even thy arms generous louisa shelter me from disgrace can cowardice find an asylum even in paradise itself  the informer if such a person exists who pretends to have been an eyewitness of a meeting which before god i solemnly declare never did take place must be called for and confronted in that case sir george revel will be no otherwise responsible than for the fidelity of his report and for an explanation of his motives in stopping the letter an action despicable and mean upon the face of it but if sir george will not or cannot produce his informer the charge rests upon assertion and can only be answered by assertion for where the person calumniated cannot confute the calumny by proving the negative nothing more seems to be in his power but to give it the flattest and fullest contradiction  and now what language can i employ to give expression to my gratitude for your unequalled generosity with what devotion i adore and love you my life and not my lips must prove that you are confident and that i am conscious of my innocence is a reflection that will arm me against all dangers but the world has its demands upon me still the honor of your injured mother my own and what is dearer than my own your honor my adored louisa calls upon me to stand forth in its defense and vindication let that happiness which you generously tender to me as present and immediate be my future prize and reward when truth shall have triumphed over falsehood when the defamer of virtue shall have received his merited chastisement and when it shall be in no ones power to say that i clandestinely took refuge in those arms whose earthly bliss like that of heaven itself is only to be earned by perseverance sufferings and trials  farewell thou all that is amiable and excellent heaven only knows how dear thou art to  arundel  letter lxxvii arundel to captain john arundel our noble friend lord s has had two fruitless interviews with sir george revel he will not nay i am persuaded he cannot produce the informer he is himself the author and contriver of the calumny  as for the intercepted letter it is so secondary a matter that lord s no longer dwelt upon it than served to represent the meanness of the transaction  it was demanded of sir george if he would accompany my friend to the house of lord g recapitulate the charge in his presence as he pretends to have heard it from the mouth of the informer meet the evidence which lord s was provided with for refuting the falsehood of the charge and upon that proof acknowledge himself to have been misinformed and deceived  he would accede to no one particular of this proposition he abided in his belief he retraced no one item of what he had said he would not produce the informer he repented not of having intercepted the letter but repented only of having ever in time past made an apology to a man whom it would have been a merit to have sent out of the world before he had committed such crimes as render him unfit to remain in it  you my dear uncle whose heart is the seat of honor can readily suggest to your own thoughts the alternative which must follow my noble friend has fulfilled this part of his commission as ably and as honorably as he had done the former part of it a few days absence from england will set us upon ground from which not even the royal authority can interdict us the name of arundel was not committed to me to be disgraced in my keeping nor shall the malice envy falsehood of this wretch escape my vengeance the vindication of a ladys character whom cruelty has exiled and malice defamed the refutation of a most infamous attack upon my honor and through me upon yourself upon the memory of my deceased benefactor upon all who wear or ever did wear the name of arundel are now at issue and if the weight of wrongs like these if the justice of a cause like mine cannot edge my sword and animate my heart what can they do my gallant uncle doubt it not fear not for me your own blood beats in my veins i have your heroic image in my minds eye and i depart secure of conquest  farewell letter lxxviii sir george revel to the earl of g i am just landed at oftend upon a little tour of pleasure where i am to have the honor of meeting a certain friend of yours on the confines of the austrian territory to settle a small matter in dispute between us that cannot so conveniently be adjusted upon english ground  i do not forget an apostrophe in one of your lordships letters to me whereby you lament your disability by age and rank from taking personal vengeance upon arundel from that moment i adopted your revenge and having once given him a taste of my sword i mean now to give him a full meal of it  sir john macarthy more an officer in the emperors service and my approved good friend attends me on this trip a better man whether as second or principal never stepped into a field the young earl of s accompanies arundel and in spite of all his blushing honors fresh upon him let him look well to himself he will not have to deal with spaniards in this business nor will he have barricades to screen him  the gentlemen are gone forward to their rendezvous and have left a note to say they shall have nobody in their suit but a surgeon and valet de chamber i shall send sir john before me to mark out the ground and agree upon preliminaries with the noble earl  the sword is to be our weapon  happy choice for me his scottish lordship was nationally precise in measuring our respective weapons if a workman is to be known by his tools i must confess that my antagonist sent me a respectable sample of his art it should be the instrument of a master but where can this academic have studied that noble science in its best school conceited pedant he little knows with whom he has to deal he rushes desperate on his own destruction few hours and short remain for him ere he shall be food for worms  when next i write to you this upstart favorite of fortune this emancipated dependant who arraigns your lordship in the senate forces you from the helm of the state seduces your revolted wife and even shakes the allegiance of your wavering daughter shall be no more  so much for arundel  farewell letter lxxix arundel to captain john arundel it is as i predicted justice has struck the blow the affair is over and sir george revel desperately wounded in two places can scarce be said to survive  the spot our seconds made choice of for our meeting was about a mile from the austrian barrier in the center of a small grove not above a hundred paces from the roadside where we left our carriages in waiting with a servant in each none but our respective seconds and surgeons accompanying us to the ground  it was between five and six in the morning when lord s and myself arrived upon the ground and in less than a quarter of an hour sir george appeared with his friend in the austrian uniform and a foreign regimental surgeon  when we were within a few paces of each other he stopped and i took off my hat to him which he returned in like manner with his throwing it however behind him to some distance at the same time seeing him do this i took for granted he was getting himself ready to set to without loss of time and thereupon began to strip myself to a linen waistcoat when addressing me by my name he cried out  hold a moment with your leave i desire the true grounds of my quarrel with you may be understood you are a rash presumptuous young man and it is to chastise your arrogance in aspiring to be my rival with lady louisa that i come hither as for your connection with lady g i have no concern with that but as it serves to give you an interest with her daughter and to convince you that i scorn to draw my sword in the support of an untruth i now tell you that the deposition of the footman is a fiction  as soon as he said this i called upon my friend lord s to take notice of his words and remember them i speak them for that very purpose replied he his lordship is welcome to make what use of them he sees fit i take away no ladys reputation i disdain it  certify what you now say and give it me under your hand i exclaimed and i am satisfied  no sir answered he it is for the vindication of my own character it is for the honor of truth i say this not for your satisfaction i have made one apology too many already and you shall never have another from me i am not come so far to make a childish business of it i am determined to correct your insolence and assert my own superior claim to lady louisa slight measures will not serve me your temerity has chosen a weapon i am master of that and only that shall now decide upon our lives and our pretensions  having so said he threw off his coat and waistcoat and both drawing our swords at the same instant we advanced upon each other as men determined to conquer or to die  he did himself no more than justice i what he said he was indeed a master of his weapon and having some advantage of the higher ground pressed upon me so fiercely and at the same time kept so strong a guard that i found it necessary to give back for a while and wait his onset on the defensive in this way i continued to foil him so frequently that he began to lose his temper which sir john macarthy more observing called to him to fight more coolly for which he was taken up pretty smartly by my friend the earl of s who warned him to be silent at this moment with a vehement oath he made a homethrust at my breast which i contrived to pass over my shoulder and in the instant pushed my sword through his body closing in upon him with the same motion he reeled with the blow and in falling caught hold with his left hand and pulled me to the ground upon him i held fast of his right wrist so that he could not use his sword which he struggled to recover from my gripe in the same moment i heard the clashing of swords over my back as i laid upon the body of my antagonist and found our seconds were engaged i sprung upon my legs and quitting hold of sir george whom i believed to be expiring extricated my sword from his body and rushed between them his surgeon now ran up to him thinking him to be dying but he raising himself nimbly on his legs called out to him to be gone and i had by this time parted our seconds sir george revel once more attacked me with the fury of a desperate man in his last moments his countenance was horrible he yelled with agony and fought like one that was frantic whilst the blood spouted from his wound still there was discretion in his madness for his art had not deserted him to the last and his attack for a short time was more dangerous than ever i commanded myself so far as to spare him upon two or three openings for i wished not to give him another wound but selfpreservation put me upon other measures and coming suddenly within his guard i lodged my point in his right breast passing it clear through the flesh of his sword arm and pinning it as it were to his ribs his weapon dropped from his hand and he fell backwards on the ground at his length crying out he was killed  his second ran to him and supported him till the surgeon came up he discharged greatly from the mouth and then closing his eyes fell back and as i thought in that moment expired i entreated i implored sir john not to think of renewing any disagreement with my friend and that more blood might not be spilt upon a quarrel that by the evidence of the dying man which he himself had heard him deliver might have been atoned for without these fatal consequences i called upon mr l    my surgeon and requested him to give his assistance to the dying man this he very readily complied with and the foreign surgeon soon discovering how much more expert he was than himself resigned the chief part of the work to him and acted rather as an assistant than principal applauding him in very high terms all the while the operation was indeed like magic the sluices were staunched the wounds were bound up and a reviving cordial was administered almost at the same instant the wounded man opened his eyes and gave signs of coming to his senses  i conjure you sir cried mr l on your life do not attempt to speak or stir be perfectly quiet and i am not out of hope to save you  my chaise let down at the back and had conveniences to serve as a litter which my friendly surgeon had contrived for me in london on the mattrass we laid sir george revel and so conveyed him through the little grove to the chaise in waiting our valets assisting us in carrying him whilst this was in operation we discovered a good deal of blood on the sleeve of lord ss right arm and upon examination found it proceeded from a slight puncture in the flesh this also my surgeon dressed upon the spot and now sir john macarthy more perceiving that his sword had wounded him in the scuffle gallantly cried out  the great god forbid that i should draw blood from the veins of a british officer whilst i have life give me your hand my sweet boy and may you live to fight your countrys battles and conquer like a brave fellow as you are for by my faith and soul you have enemies enough and to spare the devil fire them all without my turning against you  lord s readily shook hands with him and thus to my great satisfaction a reconciliation took place between them  when we had placed sir george revel in the chaise we had two miles to the next village and the surgeons seemed to think it doubtful if he could bear the carriage so far there was a house within sight at the bottom of one of the avenues in the grove where we fought which by its situation and appearance seemed to belong to the owner of the place and as it was so near at hand mr l advised us to apply for admission there as no time was to be lost sir john macarthy more immediately mounted one of our servants horses and in a few minutes returned to tell us that he had succeeded in obtaining a reception for the wounded gentleman and his surgeons but that the lady of the house recommended it to me and my second to get within the barrier as fast as we could  as sir georges danger was so pressing and his surgeon very anxiously solicited the assistance of mr l i consented to release him upon his assuring me that no harm could befall lord s whose wound was perfectly safe and would want no dressing till the next morning when at farthest he would not fail to be with us having appointed therefore our place of meeting in the town of  lord s and i drove off in sir george revels chaise leaving him in mine to the care of the surgeons and his friend sir john who slowly proceeded with him down the avenue toward the house  being now safely lodged at ostend and by the blessing of providence unhurt except by my anxiety for sir george i send this to you by express hoping that it will set your mind entirely at rest especially as i can assure you lord s is in no manner of danger from the wound in his arm which though slight prevents him for the present from using his pen we shall wait the event of a day or two and then set out for england  farewell letter lxxx the earl of s to the earl of g though i write with difficulty having a slight wound in my right arm i gladly make the effort to inform your lordship that sir george revel before he entered into action with mr arundel declared in my hearing voluntarily and explicitly that the information he pretended to have received from lady gs footman respecting an interview between her ladyship and mr arundel was a fiction  this declaration i myself heard and though the hopeless situation of sir george revel affords little chance of his living to repeat it i pledge my sacred honor to your lordship that i am a witness to its being made for the truth of which i may appeal not only to the party accused but to sir john macarthy more who was present as sir georges second and mr l who accompanied my friend as his surgeon and whose character and integrity are well known to your lordship  justice has decided for arundel who has conquered without a wound  letter lxxxi lady jane s to lady louisa g i send you a copy of arundels letter to his uncle which will inform you of the successful termination of an affair that has i hope been kept secret from you till the receipt of this  what a dreadful punishment has fallen on the head of that injurious desperate man sir george revel society will have nothing to regret at his death and yet i cannot help wishing for his recovery if it were only in consideration of arundel who no doubt will be greatly pained at sending an unprepared impenitent being out of the world  how will your heart alternately be filled with terrors and with transports whilst you read this narrative amidst its feelings for your own beloved hero i persuade myself you will feel a sympathetic emotion of pity and applause for mine also whose generous blood has flowed in the service of his friend  i am sure there is a passage in the enclosed that will give you peculiar satisfaction i allude to the acknowledgment which that unhappy wretch made before he began the combat this i think will be admitted by lord g himself as decisive for the exculpation of your injured mother and if there is nothing strikes you in the narrative as improper for your fathers eye which i presume there is not you will have a fair opportunity of vindicating a parents character and doing justice to an innocent man at the same time but of this you are the best judge and no doubt will govern yourself as time and season may accord with circumstances  it is now sunshine and fair weather once again in our little circle the brave old seaman has strove to put a good countenance upon the time since his nephews absence but in spite of all his blustering many a deep sigh found its way and a heavy cloud upon his brow betrayed the inward sadness of his soul the joy of his heart now overflows at his eyes and he is for ever conning over his nephews letter he has got a company of the farmers together in the stewards parlour and is at this moment sitting in a cloud of tobacco carousing over a huge bowl of punch and entertaining them with sea stories and adventures whilst the house echoes with their jollity  not so mortlake his pious transports are directed to the supreme dispenser of all blessings and the joy he feels on arundels safety is tinctured with a strong concern for his responsibility on sir george revels account whose lamentable situation he deeply commiserates  every day every hour the character of this extraordinary young man rises in my esteem  but i repress the volubility of my pen and wait till the happy intelligence of your health and peace of mind put the spring in motion  farewell letter lxxxii lady louisa g to lady jane s strong indeed must be your nerves my dear jane to copy such a narrative as you have enclosed to me mine yet tremble with horror at the perusal of it  what a savage animal is man how ferocious in his wrath how bloody in his resentments how terrible even in his death  i am haunted by a spectre horrible to look upon i see the figure of revel gashed with wounds and besmeared with blood his countenance is deformed with rage he stares frightfully upon me and his dying yells ring in my ears on the other hand i see arundel like a commissioned angel in the act to punish striking him to the earth benevolence beams from his eyes he gives the blow of justice with reluctance and drops a tear of pity on his fallen foe  what i have suffered in the dreadful interim since the receipt of arundels letter enclosed in yours words cannot utter my agonies were such as to alarm and melt my fathers heart his care of me has been tender in the extreme he endeavored to delude me out of my apprehensions but in vain the oppression that weighed down his own spirits was too visible to escape my notice it sufficiently informed me what was passing in his own mind the dreadful business in operation hung upon his conscience in his heart i am sure he acquitted my mother even before the confession of sir george revel put her innocence out of doubt  you will start when i tell you that in the anguish of my soul i disguised not any of its most secret affections but avowed my love for arundel openly and without reserve in his hearing  and he heard it not with patience only but with pity with complacence  i devoted myself by the most solemn vows to melancholy to despair to death itself if arundel survived not the impending conflict i exposed to my fathers sight the letter i had received from him and i made no scruple to declare the offer i had desperately tendered him of a clandestine marriage the horror which my father felt at this proposal was converted into admiration when he perused the letter wherein arundel so honorably declines the offer  this man cried he compels me to admire him  these words were as a signal to my eager spirit to break forth the torrent of my passion forced its way i wept entreated threw myself before his feet upon my knees and called aloud on heaven for its protection to arundel for its vengeance upon his murderer  in this instant arrived a letter from your brother to my father which announced the completion of my prayers the cause of justice was triumphant innocence was rescued from danger guilt devoted to death heavens hand was visible my grateful heart was overpowered by the vouchsafement it paused in reverence of the awful presence i sunk upon the floor and fainted in the effort of adoration  and now my jane do you demand of me if i sympathize with you in pity and applause of your heroic brother oh from my soul i love him  may victory attend him ever may same crown him with laurels fortune enrich him with spoils and for the generous blood he shed for arundel it is as dear to me as the drops that fell from my sad heart the fountain of my life is not more precious  dear to me also is that other thunderbolt of war that boisterous son of the ocean brave old uncle john nature has made him of precious materials though of rough workmanship in ancient time i am told our sea officers were in general such as captain arundel is now the modern class of which your noble archibald is a bright example are more courtly and no less courageous  as for that piece of human excellence who being your mortlake is mine also he seems born to put complainers out of countenance and show the world how pure a man may be that you have gained a treasure in his heart i can well believe that he will meet a blessing in your arms i am perfectly assured how the world may think fit to comment upon your choice will little concern you when you have turned your back upon its vain and foolish opinions if i thought that choice would be less happy for its being humble i should think you had made a sacrifice to the passion of the moment but i know your nature is superior to ambition envy avarice and every sordid propensity i join with your beloved earl in every trait and description of your character and subscribe my warmest wishes to his for your speedy union yours is a spirit of activity and fire it does not deal in delay convinced of his love for you and how indeed should that be doubted you must dissipate his timid diffidence and condescend to copy the example of a spirit far less heroic than your own that of your poor trembling louisa whom fear made bold and love inspired with resolution to offer her free heart to arundel you are now as it were alone with mortlake every hour you have him in your eye opportunity courts you and the time is your own are there no sequestered walks no shady groves no haunts propitious to the voice of love sure they would spring spontaneously where arundel inhabits where is the spot in which you met him honoring my poor resemblance with his flattering contemplation that spot must surely be auspicious to a lover at least for friendships sake if not for loves select it so may we date our happiness from the same individual lot of earth  oh jane should that be so should heaven consent to bless me also with the object of my souls fond affection i will pay that turf a tribute of my gratitude i will ornament it with an edifice and as my love almost amounts to idolatry i will indulge its superstition with a temple where the orphean hand of romney shall make the very walls alive and by the animating touches of his creative pencil consecrate the fabric to immortality  farewell letter lxxxiii lady jane s to lady louisa g begin your temple without loss of time mortlake and i have consecrated the spot to love and nothing is wanting for the ceremony of laying the foundationstone but the presence of the patroness  let us rear our fane according to the chaste simplicity of ancient greece let us keep the established orders to the purity of their text without any modern interpolations and to make them correspond to the characters of the happy pair whose union they record let the manly solidity of the doric support the female elegance of the ionic  give your favorite painter an ample and unbroken area for the display of his genius and as the temple is to be sacred to connubial love let him take the fable of psyche and her various labors for his subject consummating the whole with a magnificent composition of the wedding ceremony remember i bargain for a dome as well for the painters lights as for the solemnity of the edifice and in a sacristy apart from the fane let me have the pourtrait of my louisa simple unadorned caecilialike breathing harmony and inspiring love i recollect some lines addressed to the celebrated artist we are speaking of by a husband as instructions for the pourtrait of his wife which till arundel supplies you with better may serve the present purpose with the simple transposition of a name  remney thy chastest tints select to trace the matron beauties of louisas face dip thy bright pencil in caerulean dies and animate the canvass with her eyes paint if thou can my kiss upon her cheek give her a voice and bid the pourtrait speak catch her dear image from a husbands heart and draw her pure and faultless as thy art to confess the truth to you i had once begun to think that there was no such thing as love in my nature i had been often flattered by young men and sometimes pleased but i never liked any one well enough to suffer pain for his sake no admirer ever broke my rest by night or spoiled one meal in the day by overoccupation of my thoughts now mortlake on the contrary absolutely starved me into a liking for him a wild cat would have been tamed by the discipline he gave me i should have died of mere inanition in a few days if i had not made him sensible of my case but how to do this has been the task for the creature has none of that forward intuition which many of our fashionable sparks have in such prematurity that they pretend to spy out a ladys malady before she sickens he is so humble so diffident of his own skill that i despaired of making him even understand the symptoms how then my dear louisa could i expect a cure  some days went over my head before i could fairly talk down this same empty title of mine which stood like a proud porter at the door of his lips and never let a word make its passage that did not pay the tax which form and ceremony exact at last with much pains and labor i got a tack to my title and he began occasionally to say  dear lady jane on that hint i spoke and i kept more than pace with his familiarity by repaying him with  my dear mr mortlake  i had a kind of commission going on at the parsonage and we held frequent councils there in affairs of taste we rambled together all over the garden though it was not always to superintend the works that we went thither sometimes the boat instead of carrying us across the stream wafted us down to new scenes where the prospect tempted us to moor our vessel and make excursions into the country here our talk became tender and confidential we interchanged the stories of our lives which though not marked with extraordinary incidents drew our hearts nearer to each other and began to throw reserve aside wherever shade and solitude invited us to a temporary repose i was commodiously weary and we sat down together to rest ourselves nature has a thousand modest methods of explaining herself in these interesting situations the veriest novice in love will fall upon them instinctively and there wants no comment to the language of the eyes certain it is we lost no ground by these baitingplaces and it is my opinion we should have made a tedious journey of it without them  i am now coming to the consecrated spot where your future temple is to arise there is a hanging grove which flanks the current of the silver medway here the bank is steep and lofty and there is a kind of rough alcove shaped out of the cliff wherein is a matted bench which some of arundels predecessors have maliciously embowered with flowering shrubs which so invitingly surround it as to make it a perfect lovetrap from this very seat your arundel i make no doubt was returning when we surprised him within a few yards of it though we did not at that time discover it but as he has not yet put up a board in the suburban style to warn unwary intruders against mentraps and pits which the foot of curiosity may fall into poor mortlake and myself as any other undesigning souls might have done wandered heedlessly into the midst of it thinking no harm and behold there we were caught the river glided silently at our feet the breeze wafted odours and the birds chaunted their own festive hymeneals around us  this is a delicious retreat said mortlake you seem weary with your walk the sun is hot will you rest yourself in this shady seat  i saw my danger but i am of a family you know not much given to fear so i accepted the challenge and entered in nothing doubting i sat down on the matted bench whilst mortlake respectfully continued on his feet twas an awkward arrangement and methought we did not converse with ease in our different attitudes it was selfish withal so i invited him to sit down beside me now this spiteful bench was rather stinted in its measure for two sitters unless they were very close friends indeed in making room for him we were tumbled together i know not how and i saw his cheeks suffused with blushes to divert his embarassment and perhaps in some degree to relieve my own i began with an affected air of indifference to start a conversation about his affairs at the parsonage they seemed to have slipped his memory i am not sure he just then knew whereabouts the parsonage stood i talked about the disposal of the furniture which he had referred to my taste and began to fit the chambers one by one i might as well have talked to him of the chambers of king solomon his ideas could not stir a step beyond the matted bench  why you are lost my friend cried i what are you meditating upon he sighed and turned his eyes fondly upon me i had my answer without the cost of a word ah mortlake said i you have something at your heart which you will not confide to me  it is not fit i should he replied send me for ever from your sight but pity me and forgive  he was silent his agitation affected me it communicated itself to my heart i could not speak to him he rose from his seat and seemed hesitating if he should not leave me i gave him a look twas not a discouraging one and he sat down once more by my side  you do not treat me with your natural sincerity i said you do not hold me worthy of your thoughts  ah madam he replied the thoughts i entertain of your ladyship are such as my tongue cannot find words expressive enough to give utterance to i know too well my own unworthiness to discourse on such a subject and i respect your delicacy too much to attempt it meditation however is a privilege the humblest of mankind may enjoy and though my looks may too visibly betray what passes in my heart yet i hope you will not think i transgress against respect whilst i adore at humble distance and abstain from words  if you only flatter me with your eyes i answered such flattery will not be serious to either of us but if your heart approves of me i trust you do not think me proud mercenary or ambitious of these bad qualities i hope i have acquitted myself in part at least to your conviction for sir adam crichton is extremely rich and i am very poor he is noble withal as far as birth can ennoble him do you think then my ambition aspires yet higher you think rightly it aspires to character to understanding to the true affections of a virtuous heart on which i may repose my happiness and that once found what is the world to me  loveliest and best of all heavens works he rapturously exclaimed and dropping on his knee clasped both my hands in his oh pardon me he cried i know not what i do my passion is my master you are too noble to despise an humble creature at your feet who doats upon you even to distraction  here his voice faultered his head dropped upon my knees he hid his face between my hands and i felt the tears gushing from his eyes  rise rise said i and meet a heart as fond as tender as your own  oh heaven he exclaimed and falling into my arms which were opened to enfold him we sealed our faith with an embrace which love inspired and honor sanctified  yes my louisa these were joys indeed even now i feel the throbbing tumult at my heart silence and solitude the friends of love were all around us dissimulation avarice ambition dared not to profane the hallowed spot come then come hither with thine arundel here interchange your vows and on the twiceconsecrated ground erect the altar of connubial love  and now have i not obeyed the instructions in your last interesting letter your commands have precipitated my advances but let me tell you with what joy i see your prospect brighten as your father relents the courage truth and generosity of arundel must triumph at last may your next meeting be speedy and propitious should a happy reconciliation take place of which i have some joyous presentiments call to mind our mutual engagement to be present at each others marriage fulfill your promise if it be possible and grace your humble friend upon her nuptials if form will not allow of your being arundels guest we have an apartment at the parsonage which i flatter myself you would not be displeased with am i quite romantic to build any hopes upon this wishedfor favor heaven grant i may be speedily called upon to repay it your destiny my lovely friend will then devote you to a station splendid as affluence can make it where you will have room to exercise the generous virtues you possess it would afford me unspeakable delight to have you take a view of these enhanting scenes which long to hail you as their mistress oh that your father would indeed relent how happy we might be we should then live within the horizon of each others prospect you as becomes you in a lofty palace we in a private mansion decorated by your bounty and reflecting cheerfulness and grateful smiles upon our benefactors  farewell letter lxxxiv arundel to charles mortlake london though lord s will be the bearer of this who will give you the particulars of what has passed since the date of my last letter to my uncle i cannot excuse myself from writing to you as it is probable i may be detained in town some days to come and i have something more to say than can well be conveyed by word of mouth  my return to england was retarded by the anxious desire i had to wait the event of sir george revels wounds i thought his case without hope but i have now left him in a promising way to find his cure from the hand of time and the great skill of mr l who has consented to stay with him some time longer  by one of the most extraordinary incidents chance ever produced if indeed it ought to be ascribed to chance it so happened that the house in the wood to which he was conveyed from the ground we engaged on was the very house to which that virtuous exile lady g had retired i have not seen her nor had any correspondence with her by letter but i learn from sir john macarthy more that an old lady the widow of a certain baron polberg who was an intimate of her fathers is the present owner of that house and a small estate which lies about it with this lady she has kept up an occasional correspondence and done her many friendly offices since the death of the baron to this retirement she betook herself in her distress and with this old lady she boards living in the strictest privacy and totally sequestered from all other society  when sir george revel was brought in wounded and expiring she generously exerted herself for his relief and superior to all motives of resentment furnished him with every thing her care and assiduity could contribute toward his comfort and accommodation it is to the credit of human nature that sir george was not insensible to these acts of benignity and in token of his repentance seized the first moments in his power for dictating a full recantation of the charge he had laid against her this he addressed to lady louisa and transmitted to me by the hands of sir john macarthy more accompanied with a note of which the following is a copy  sir george revel transmits to mr arundel a paper addressed to lady louisa g which he desires him to peruse for his own satisfaction before he presents it to that lady he hopes this acknowledgment with the pain and danger he is now suffering will atone for all injuries   with this packet sir john delivered me a verbal message from lady g desiring me to hasten my return to england and assuring me every thing in her power should be done for the recovery of sir george revel having made a suitable reply to this message and written an answer to sir georges note lord s and i set out on our return  upon our arrival in london lord s was so good as to call upon lord g to explain to him the purport of the paper i was charged with from sir george revel and to know from his lordship if i was to have the honor of delivering this paper to lady louisa with my own hands or not lord g said he could hardly suppose a visit in his house would be very agreeable to me to which my friend replied that as the whole of a very infamous proceeding against me jointly with lady g was now laid open to his lordships full and perfect satisfaction he must take the liberty to remark it was but reasonable for me to expect some such acknowledgment on his part might assure me of his suspicions being done away and quiet my mind on a subject which had exposed me to so much unmerited danger and disturbance lord g very readily admitted that such an acknowledgment was due to me and that if i required it as an act of justice as such he could have no objection to comply with it but he doubted if lady louisa was well enough to leave her chamber an hour was then appointed for my coming and lord s returned to me with this report  i was punctual to the time and was immediately admitted to his lordship who received me courteously but with a good deal of embarassment in his manner he was alone and apologized for lady louisa who was too ill to leave her chamber i delivered sir george revels packet into his hands telling him it had been sent to me under a flying seal and showing him sir georges note wherein he desires me to peruse it and deliver it to its address he was pleased to say that such a deposition to the truth could not fail to be considered by him as a full and complete exculpation of the parties whom that unhappy man had so unjustly accused it was a foul transaction of which he should say the less as the guilty person had so dearly atoned for it with respect to his ladys conduct he confessed that her hasty escape out of england and the secrecy she observed on that occasion had been staggering circumstances in his opinion and he owned it put his credulity to some stretch to believe that the choice of a spot so near her residence and the conveying the wounded man to the very house itself were merely the effects of chance  in answer to this i assured his lordship in the most solemn manner that i was never once consulted in the choice of the ground which was pointed out to lord s by sir georges second who was a foreign officer and well acquainted with the country that for my own part i had not the most distant guess at the place lady g had chosen for her residence before this event happened and that neither myself nor lord s on my behalf had ever seen lady g entered her house or corresponded with her since my leaving england till the present moment and though the incident he alluded to was indeed a very extraordinary one yet i must observe to his lordship that providence oftentimes takes means as extraordinary for the vindication of innocence and the detection of guilt in this light i regarded the meeting of sir george revel and his muchinjured lady whose humanity extending itself even to her worst enemy in his distress wrought a happy change in that enemys heart by turning it to repentance and drawing forth a confession most seasonable for her justification and his lordships repose sensible that no one who had so abused your confidence i added could with any face aspire to your lordships alliance sir george revel has very properly understood his situation by withdrawing all pretensions to lady louisa which is the purport of the letter i have had the honor to deliver to you  mr arundel he replied whatever terms you and i may be upon now or hereafter yet on this occasion i desire you will once for all receive my full and unreserved declaration that i give perfect credit to your veracity and honor and i rejoice withal that you are returned in safety and unhurt  for this i thanked him and declared myself perfectly satisfied  he then demanded if i was leaving town and upon my saying i had some business at the admiralty on my uncles account which might detain me a day or two he was pleased to answer that he was glad of it and hoped it was a promotion to a flag which his gallant services so richly merited this was also very courteous on his part and i expressed my sensibility for his kind expressions informing him that i had strong reason to believe that promotion would take place  lord g now took up the packet i had delivered to him and observed that as i had apprized him of the contents the matter did not so press but that i might make my own opportunity for giving them in person to lady louisa and to confess the truth says he i have used a little deceit in not informing her of this meeting fearing that her spirits were not in a proper state to undergo the agitation it would give her i will therefore inform her of your arrival and she shall let you know when she is prepared to expect you  i requested him not to return sir georges letter to me but to give it to lady louisa in my absence as it would be a more delicate time for her to peruse it at her leisure and i gave him my most grateful thanks for the confidence he reposed in me by allowing me to hope for the happiness of paying my respects to lady louisa in person  he very handsomely replied that he did not think he should ever repent of any confidence he reposed in me having received so strong a proof of my very honorable conduct toward his daughter in an affair which she had confided to him and for which he held himself very seriously indebted to me  i stared with astonishment at these words which seemed so evidently to apply to a certain proposal i thought myself bound to decline but which i could not have believed lady louisa would have had the resolution to disclose to her father and i own i augured very inauspiciously from her so doing but the behavior of lord g was either very artificial or most extremely encouraging for we parted with smiles of complacency and a promise on his side that i should very soon hear from lady louisa when she would receive my visit  what can this mysterious behavior portend what am i to expect from this visit sanctioned as it is by the authority of her father has my declining her proposal been so misunderstood in its motives as to have excited her resentment against me and brought her to despise me for my want of spirit that would be hard indeed i ought not so to judge of her and yet how else can i account for her disclosing it to her father but as a peace offering on her part and a thorough renunciation of me for ever oh charles my heart is tortured by suspense i am in agony till my fate is decided  farewell letter lxxxv sir george revel to lady louisa g providence having so directed it that i should owe the little hopes i have of life to the humanity of the person whom i have most cruelly injured i eagerly embrace the first return of my senses to exonerate a guilty conscience by confessing to your ladyship that the stories which you have heard reported from the evidence of lady gs servant are falsehoods fabricated for the disingenuous purpose of detaching your affections from my late antagonist mr arundel to whose innocence this acknowledgment is no less due than to your noble and virtuous parent  this declaration is entirely voluntary and i freely made it on the field before we began the duel which has justly proved so fatal to me mr arundel would then have acquitted me if i would have consented to what i am now doing but jealousy and resentment had hardened my heart against a rival happier and more worthy than myself and my passion would not suffer me to listen to the plea of justice presuming on my skill i meditated to destroy him but the hand of heaven turned my purpose against myself  i now lie expiring as i believe on the bed which your mothers charity affords me with one wound through my body and two others in my breast and arm the agony of which is not half so racking as those remorseful horrors that afflict my mind tortured in my exit out of this world and trembling for my entrance into the next those horrors would be insupportable had not the same injured excellence whose hand reaches the cordial to my lips administered the like cordial to my soul by assuring me of her forgiveness  lest it should be suspected by any one that mr arundel had a hand in appointing me to this spot as knowing it to be the place of lady gs residence i do solemnly assure you that he had no voice in the appointment and that the place of our meeting was pitched upon by my second sir john macarthy more from his knowledge of the spot and acceded to by the earl of s on the behalf of mr arundel without any privity or suggestion on his part  if what seems so impossible to my expectations should nevertheless come to pass and by the favor of heaven i should in course of time recover from this deplorable situation it will be long before i shall revisit england many years must elapse and long absence from the scene of my disgrace must intervene before the wounds of my mind can be healed after these in my body have found their cure banish from your memory therefore the very name of revel and give your father my lord g to understand that the defamer of his wife is too sensible of his own demerit whatever he may think of it ever to aspire to be the husband of his daughter and though the ungenerous wound i once gave arundel is i trust atoned for by these i have received from him yet the injury i have attempted to do him in your thoughts and the justice due to a virtuous and elevated character compel me in conscience to declare that the man whom i had devoted to death as being loved by you is of all men living the only one who truly merits that most happy distinction  i dictate this to my friend sir john macarthy more and sign it with my own hand in presence of your noble mother and mr l who is known to you a very honorable man to whose skill and humanity i am infinitely indebted they are privy to the contents and will witness the authenticity of them sir john will carry it to mr arundel who is now at  and has remained there ever since our affair without one visit to this house to him it will be communicated and by him as i hope delivered into your hands  may heaven in him reward and bless you  farewell for ever letter lxxxvi lady jane s to lady louisa g i shall now give my dear louisa the conclusion of my life character and behavior then recommend myself to your prayers and prepare for execution  my brother came down to arundelhouse this day before dinner if i was writing a novel and not a history i would give you a pathetic description of our meeting and embraces in which i would float my page with a flood of tears that should almost threaten a second deluge  though my lover and i had come to a perfect understanding with each other i had reserved myself for the arrival of my brother without letting the old captain into the secret and as for his discovering it by the virtue of his own sagacity in love affairs there was not a chance on the tables i never saw a creature so commodiously blind deaf and incurious in my days  some sisters in my dependant situation would have been in a fine puzzle how to break a matter of this sort to some brothers on whom their dependence rested but i had no such difficulties to encounter with mine and if i had still i should have taken no other method than i did which was naturally to tell him in a very few words that mortlake and i had agreed upon a marriage  very well said my brother you have done right to please yourself and upon my soul jane i give you credit for a good eye for i dont know a finer young fellow in all england  pooh replied i dont be ridiculous do you think i choose by the eye  no no returned he mortlake is a very honest worthy lad withal and one i shall be proud to call my brotherinlaw may i die if i think you could have chosen better in the three kingdoms so there is an end of that the next thing is to set you up in the world with something to live comfortably upon and we must go to the spanish dollars for that the dons many thanks to em have provided you with a dower  hold there my dear generous brother i replied you and i shall not agree upon that bargain i must not forget if you do that the earl of s will require more to maintain him than the parsons wife and such i intend to be to all intents and purposes  but the brats said he must have something to maintain them and therell be no scarcity of them jane i cannot carry them all out to sea with me  well replied i the girls cannot be poorer than their mother was and if the boys are but as brave as their uncle they will fight through the world i warrant em  aye and conquer it too i hope he cried before they have done with it but all this is nothing to the purpose i shall say no more to you upon this subject brother mortlake and i will settle that affair between ourselves you have nothing to do but marry as fast as you can for captain arundel and i shall be brushing out again very speedily and i would fain see my dear sister safe moored before i loose the foresail  so saying the noble youth tenderly embraced me when before my heart could give a vent to the grateful sensations with which it glowed the call of the old captain broke up our conference and summoned us to the dinnerroom  there was something so pointedly engaging in the manner with which my brother took mortlake by the hand when he joined the company that it told more to my feelings than a volume of fine speeches could have expressed i remarked the effect it had upon mortlake and i am sure his feelings sympathized with mine joy glistened in his eyes all passed in silence but where is the poet that can find words for what that silence uttered oh how i detest a chattering finespoken sentamentalist give me the mute eloquence of the heart that only is the genuine language of love and benevolence  after dinner lady treville knowing that all things were well understood between my brother and me from a hint i had given her and loving at her heart as you well know a little goodnatured mischief began to question mortlake how his preparations went on at the parsonage observing that it was much too good a house for a single man and that it would now behove him to look out for a wife  this was hint enough for my brother who immediately closed in with it by saying he would answer for mortlake that he would take a wife of his recommending upon which the old captain loudly declared that he would venture a wager he named the lady for that it could be none other than the gunners daughter which it seems is a cant phrase for a dozen lashes at the gun  it is what i should have well deserved for my presumption said this amiable young man his face covered with blushes if ambition had any share in my affections or if i could have been daring enough to have grounded a hope upon that charming condescension which though i could not choose but admire i was not so bold as to approach  what is the man talking about cried the rough old seaman i cannot make out a word that he is saying  i dont know how you should said lady treville for he is talking about love  no no answered he that hook will not hold my lady i know too much of love to believe that love is a damned noisy quarrelsome companion the doctor there is as meek as moses love is all talk and bluster storm and tempest i have been in love myself and it always sets me a swearing because do you see it throws me out of my course and puts me upon the other tack now mortlake keeps on his way fair and easy nobody shall make me believe he is in love  perhaps some of the company may be of a different opinion replied she for instance there is lady jane i will refer the case to her  with all my heart cried the captain lady jane knows better things i will be judged by lady jane  agreed answered the good lady who so fit to decide upon mortlakes passion as she who inspires it  come my dear jane added my brother give sentence upon your friend  my sentence i replied will be passed upon myself for if he does not love i am of all women most miserable  mortlake was sitting next to me he sprung from his chair seized my hand and pressing it to his lips with an animation that even startled me  then i take heaven to witness he cried that my soul doats upon you my heart beats with love that cannot be uttered i do but live whilst you approve of me and every moment of my life shall be devoted to gratitude and love for the unspeakable blessing you have bestowed upon me  that is right cried the hearty old commander the mans as mad as a marchhare i give it up i give it up i dont say but what he is in love now but i will stand to what i did say that he was not in love before egad mortlake thou art an honest fellow a lad after my own heart if you could be in love with that charming creature and in your senses at the same time i would not own you for a man i told you all i knew what love was and here is my lady would have persuaded me out of my senses by the lord harry but i will make the dollars jump for this my dear dear boy he cried addressing himself to my brother i hope all this is to your good liking  to my very hearts content replied my beloved brother  then about she goes roared out the old blade a health to the happy couple harkye mortlake do it justice and i will stock your cellars for your life to come damn it archey you and i took the dons in the nick of time aye boy and well have another brush amongst them thank god we need not go far to find an enemy come wheel it about taking a full glass in his hand my dear dear lady jane you must let me love you like a child of my own like my own dear archibald like my own boy frank why the plague is not he here at this moment may all happiness befall you may you be blessed in the arms of an honest man for you are a noble generous lovely girl and i adore your spirit for throwing off that pigtailed puppy with his pouch full of money and taking this worthy fellow with a round curl and a black coat but a heart that is worth all the mines of peru  this is but coarse stuff you will say but it is honest and has served to hurry me out of all my embarrassments and now i have nothing to encounter but the eyes of arundel  oh send him to us with the fires of love and joy sparkling in their brightest luster but if you would complete the wish come with him yourself then where in all the world shall there be found a circle of such happiness as ours  the grotto awaits you mortlake and i do not fail to visit it and this evening i rambled thither by myself i had not long reposed myself in this enchanted spot before the selfsame sybil who accosted me under the tree of fergus visited me again in this distant solitude and with somewhat more of the poetic fury in her voice than the cold region of the north had inspired her with chanted forth the following stanzas   fast by the medways silver tide beneath the woodbines fragrant shade loves roving god by chance espied a rustic grot and thus he said   hail grot so silent and so sweet  impending over this glassy stream  be henceforth thou my favored seat  propitious to the lovers theme  here if the modest youth assays  with faultering lips to move the fair  in the cold damsels heart i will raise  a pity that shall grant his prayer  here if the stubborn maid shall spy  the melting tear his cheek bedew  i will launch an arrow from his eye  shall pierce her proud heart through and through  then wild and raging all amain  with her tormented bosoms smart  save me she will cry oh ease my pain  and draw this arrow from my heart  he with fond arms encircling round  shall press her to his faithful breast  and the same hand that gave the wound  shall lull its agonies to rest letter lxxxvii charles mortlake to arundel that partiality which you pronounced upon in its infancy has exceeded your warmest predictions lady jane has verified the character you gave her and those attentions which i thought could only be the effect of a little female vanity i now perceive sprung sincerely from the heart could i suppose that so much beauty youth and vivacity such high pretensions as she derives from rank family and condition could ever condescend to the humble lot in which i am placed and bid adieu to all the pleasures all the pride of life i must have had an unreasonable share of presumption to have thought of her any otherwise than i did but after you and her brother had left us i confess to you there were openings enough in her behavior to have inspired a man of less diffidence than myself with very flattering hopes our walks were longer and more frequent she was industrious to find out the most solitary places and our conversations became more serious and particular for a time indeed our mutual anxiety in your absence allowed of no reflections but upon the dreadful errand you were engaged in we did little else but mingle sighs and sorrows and neither party was qualified to act the comforter to the other as soon as the joyful tidings of your safety arrived though qualified with some little terrors for her beloved brother our spirits revived and as this was followed by further accounts which set her mind at ease about lord s our happiness was without alloy  anxious as i was to know my fate i am satisfied i should never have found resolution to declare myself had not her encouragement conspiring with a most tempting opportunity in a manner extorted it from me it was then very awkwardly brought out with so much trepidation and terror that it is my wonder how she could understand me but her generous heart disdained to make sport of my weakness and she had too much pity for my painful struggles to indulge herself in prolonging them in short my dear arundel i am confounded by my own good fortune and scarce believe the blessing i am possessed of the gallant earl of s has ratified his sisters humble choice with a liberality which we found it difficult to reduce within the bounds of moderation lady jane is surely the most disinterested as well as the most amiable of heavens creatures she says my income is affluence she has never been accustomed to she has laid down a plan for our domestic economy with the greatest precision and formed her little establishment of servants upon the scale of our moderate circumstances with every attention to our future comfort and content she has superintended every thing that is going forward at the parsonage and in furnishing and fitting the house as well as in the directions she has given about the works you put in motion without doors you will find she has been a frugal manager of your unlimited generosity the library is now completed and a charming room it is there are four excellent bedchambers and two with little dressingrooms and closets attached to them all furnished with the greatest neatness and simplicity her heart is set upon seeing lady louisa at our wedding which only waits your return to be fixed for an early day i am afraid to say how much i wish to see you lest i should provoke your friendship to comply with my desires at the expense of engagements more important and more interesting to your own immediate happiness  oh my dear arundel when shall i hear that heaven has turned the heart of that obdurate father who is now the sole bar to your happiness with your lovely lady louisa is there no hope of her complying with the wishes of lady jane alas i fear it is in vain to think of it time and patience will bring all things round providence has done wonders in your favor already continue to deserve its bounty and there is no doubt but you will be blessed  farewell letter lxxxviii arundel to charles mortlake soon after i had dispatched my last letter which left me in the utmost anxiety of mind i was surprised with a visit from lord g i was alone and had fallen into such a gloomy train of thoughts that i could not meet the sight of him without the greatest trepidation possessed as i was with the idea that he was come to pronounce sentence upon my hopes but when he drew forth a letter from his pocket and told me he was commissioned by lady louisa to present it to me methought i should have fainted at the instant it seemed as if the smile with which he delivered it was put on by malice to give a keener insult to my feelings and holding it unopened in my trembling hand  my lord said i if this letter which you have given me contains the fatal sentence which must extinguish the faint hope that hardly glimmers in my breast i do beseech you let me hear it from your lips and spare me the agony of a perusal which will throw me into such a situation as the bitterest enemy could not contemplate without pain and pity if my offenses against you and my presumption in aspiring to lady louisas favor deserve the punishment of a contemptuous refusal for the honor of humanity do not aggravate that punishment by taking on yourself the office of a tormentor and feasting your eyes with the agonies you inflict  upon my word mr arundel replied he i am not privy to the contents of that letter i have simply the honor of being her ladyships messenger but i am free to confess to you that it is an honor i should have declined if i could have supposed myself the bearer of any unwelcome news to you for i come hither with a heart very thoroughly disposed to make peace and if you will break the seal of my commission i shall be very much mistaken if it does not tally with my wishes  i opened the letter and immediately cast my eye upon these transporting words   welcome my beloved arundel i welcome you with a transport of joy which i am privileged to express to you my father who is your convert will be the bearer of this you triumph every way and my fond heart is the easiest of your conquests despise it not however but come to me without delay i die to see you heaven be praised for its protection of my arundel again i tell you come to me come without delay or you do not know what it is to love like your  louisa   my transport overpowered me i could not speak i could not restrain my tears i threw myself at the feet of lord g he raised me in his arms and tenderly embraced me  thus let us seal our peace for ever he cried henceforth let us be son and father louisa is your own  he would scarce suffer me to make him any reply much less to endeavor at expressing all my sensibility on this transporting occasion i dare say he cried louisas letter is a very eager summons and you are no less eager to obey it and yet i am disposed to trespass on your attention for a very few minutes whilst i account to you for the sudden revolution which you discover in my mind toward you and for this you are in the first place indebted to louisas honorable sincerity in confessing to me that she had gone the length of offering you a clandestine marriage i own to you this was a step which i never apprehended she would take having passed her word to me against it but when no other means appeared to her of preventing your duel with sir george revel in the extremity of her distress no wonder if duty and even honor itself could not hold out against a superior passion and if any means appeared lawful to preserve a life so dear and so invaluable to her i therefore acquit her but at the same time i very highly respect you for the noble manner in which you declined her proposal but when i further understood that sir george revel had revoked his charge of which i was first informed by lord s and read the letter you brought to louisa which by so full a confession on his part entirely does away every shadow of suspicion that could remain in my mind with what justice could i any longer hold out against you or pretend to exercise that right in louisa to your disfavor which i owed singly to your honor and forbearance no mr arundel even though you had been without excuse for your public opposition to me which to my shame i must own is not the case yet under such circumstances injured as you had been by the falsest and basest accusations assaulted both in life and reputation by an assassin whom i blush to think was fostered and adopted by me unexceptionable in your family fortune and character master of the affections of my daughter in the most honorable manner and backed with the most zealous approbation of her mother what sort of man or rather monster must i have been to have opposed myself to such pretensions you have therefore free and unreserved access to my louisa write to her visit her pursue the dictates of your affection i cannot doubt your honor my confidence in you is established upon proof and as you are in absolute possession of the daughters heart i trust you will not refuse to be received into the fathers  no my lord i replied it is a tender which i accept with gratitude and will endeavor to deserve but i am so confounded with my good fortune that i am in the state of a man who is hastily awakened from a dream the impression of which he cannot speedily shake off nor recover senses enough to discern the objects that surround him i scarce believe my happiness to be real  trust me arundel he replied you will find no friend so zealous as a converted enemy and now he began to make enquiries about my stay in town and whether i would accompany lady louisa and him to spring grove to this i answered that i must go down to arundel house to take leave of my uncle john and lord s who would soon be ordered out to sea and who were there waiting with lady jane s and old lady treville in hourly expectation of my return  his lordship admitted the sufficiency of my plea and with a kind of slyness in his manner asked what was to become of lady jane when her brother went to sea i smiled at this and said i doubted if i was at liberty to answer his question come come said he your secret is not worth keeping she is going to be married out of hand to your friend mortlake you think yourself mighty cunning but for once i am beforehand with you  then said i lady louisa is a telltale i have just received a letter from mortlake and she i suppose has had one from the brideelect  she has so replied he and a strong demand upon her at the same time on the score of an old promise to be present at her wedding but how is this to be performed a country parsonage is seldom very capacious though i am told you have made this quite elegant and as for arundel house i suppose you would not admit louisa and me into that for the world  my lord answered i you are determined to overpower me with your kindness and condescension  i would willingly try if you will have better luck in your own house arundel than you have had in mine hitherto i think you are indebted to me for nothing but assassinations duels and calumnious charges let us see if we cannot repair these miscarriages by a peaceful meeting and a pleasant party at arundel house make me known to your gallant uncle let me be acquainted with this lucky friend of yours who is carrying off one of the finest and liveliest young women of the age in the face of all the fine men of rank fortune and fashion who would never think of taking orders to make their way with a handsome girl of high distinction who in the name of wonder would suppose the church to be the road to preferrment of that sort  i cannot wonder at your lordships question as you are not acquainted with the person and qualities of my friend mortlake and perhaps take measure of lady jane by the general standard of her contemporaries but if you will fulfill the hopes you have given me by honoring me with your company at arundel house i do not doubt but a very short acquaintance with the object of her ladyships choice will convince you of the superior good sense she has shown in making it  well says he let us go and try our joint interest with louisa to persuade her to this journey if she acquits herself well as bridemaid it will be a good kind of rehearsal before she performs as principal but remember i condition for the violin give me music and i will not interrupt your love feed my ears well and i shall not quarrel with you for the rest of your entertainment you are but a young housekeeper and i condition against being feted postpone that till louisa presides at your table and then we shall know whom to blame if the establishment is not according to form and order  now therefore mortlake announce this to your souls better part tell it to the whole worthy circle let them share in the felicity of your friend i shall follow this letter close at the heels yet i write because even moments should be anticipated when they are charged with tidings of such joy whisper my good housekeeper in the ear and let her set her brooms and mops in motion press forward the works at your own house with vigor and incense the chamber that is destined to receive you to the arms of your beloved  oh charles charles what will become of you and me can we outlive our transports we have not lowered our constitutions to that cold blood which the stale hackneyed sensualists of this voluptuous town reduce themselves to we never wasted natures genial fount never unstrung her bow nor to the loathed embrace of harlots prostituted our manly vigor even our hearts will offer up their maiden oblations to the respective goddesses of their idolatry we never loved before hereafter we shall never cease to love  i shall send down express the best pianoforte i can purchase i am determined also to hang the late lady arundels dressing room and bedchamber afresh for my divine louisa to repose in for this purpose i shall dispatch a small squadron of nimble artists from hence who will decorate it in a trice the bed to which those heavenly those enchanting limbs are to be committed shall not be quite unworthy of the jewel it encases i will keep it sacred and untouched till she revisits again i will kneel to it as before a consecrated altar and there i will offer up my prayers to heaven for blessings multiplied upon her head  oh heaven and earth what raptures have i been now receiving she loves me charles beyond the power of love to speak of lord g for which kind act may my grateful lips ever bless and praise him sent me up alone to her chamber i found her all impatience ecstacy and love she sprung with open arms to my embrace passion like here is disdains reserve a soul so noble spurns at all the petty forms of coy dissimulation words had disgraced her feeling tears were her better eloquence and transports my more flattering welcome how long i held her in my arms let those who could have numbered moments so employed declare i cannot guess at time in which my senses were entranced upon her unresisting lips i sealed my gratitude i left my soul  at length she murmured out  oh arundel no more support me to my chair i bore her in my arms the nerves of love are strong as the nemaean lions nerves i placed her on the seat then threw myself upon my knees and with my arms around her waist supported my almost lifeless charmer hanging her sweet head and drooping like a lily when her spirits had in some degree subsided and she began to recover she drew forth a locket richly set containing her own miniature to which she had affixed a ribband and began to fasten it round my neck i suffered her to complete her work then clasping her hands and pressing them with the present they contained to my grateful lips smothered them with kisses  i now gently solicited to know when i might be blessed with the divine original  this day this hour this instant she replied but now contain yourself be prudent for my sake if it be possible i love you but too well come talk to me of some more quiet subject but not a word of your affair beyond sea my heart cannot bear it tell me about mortlake and my charming jane dear girl how i adore her there is a heart my arundel i am sure the object of her choice deserves her i know he is possessed of every manly virtuous and engaging quality because he is your chosen friend i therefore boldly pronounce him worthy of his happiness but why do i anticipate a pleasure i am so soon to enjoy i am coming down to visit you shall i be welcome arundel i think you will not turn me from your doors  but i might ramble thus for ever and i have already said enough to satisfy you of my happiness if i write more i shall be with you before you can have read my letter through  farewell letter lxxxix the countess to the earl of g as the solitude to which your discarded wife has retreated is by an extraordinary chance now become known to you i think that you should also know the motives for my coming hither  whilst our wishes for the disposal of our daughter in marriage were so opposite to each other and you suspected me of taking an active part against sir george revel there appeared to me no step so likely to remove those suspicions as totally to seclude myself from all communication with my family  when i thus broke from the dearest tie in nature and sacrificed to your repose the tender affections of a mother i fondly thought i might escape your censure though i did not flatter myself with the hopes of your approbation but i was not suffered to remain in quiet oblivion even in this solitude i was still to be the mark and butt of malice a new accusation was started against me by an unhappy man who has dearly atoned for his injustice i took my accuser into my house covered with wounds and at the last gasp of life the compunctions of a guilty conscience the terrors of impending death and gratitude for my unmerited attentions conspired to produce that confession which i hope has reached your hand and brought such conviction with it as you can no longer withstand  i have now a claim upon your justice for restoring me to my family from which you cruelly expelled me and if this is in your meditation to do i must plainly tell you that so long as you persist in excluding mr arundel you exclude me if i am innocent can he be guilty the same atonement is due to both and i reject every offer of reconcilement which does not include him husbands have been known to pardon guilty wives and many have received a penitent offender into their family again but pardon is not so readily extended to the partner of their guilt and no man lives who would contaminate his blood by marrying the daughter to the seducer of the mother let this then be the test of my innocence and your complete persuasion of it bestow your daughter upon the man she loves by one generous act you will give happiness to your child bring a blessing on yourself make a friend of him whom you have injuriously treated and heal the wounded heart of a wife who returns to you on these conditions or returns no more  letter xc the earl to the countess of g i have received your letter and you are obeyed mr arundel has this day obtained my full consent and approbation for as speedy a marriage with our daughter as circumstances will admit his conduct has been in all respects that of a man of perfect honor and in making this sacrifice of my private resentments i have done no more than i ought to do upon conviction of my being the first aggressor with this aggravation of the affront i put upon him that i then regarded him in the light of a dependant  i flatter myself you will not doubt that an acknowledgment like this can only be the result of a strict selfexamination and to this i am now indebted for a serenity of mind and temper which i never before experienced  the savage attack sir george revel made upon mr arundel in consequence of what passed at spring grove and the unjust grounds of that bloody rencontre which took place between them wherein your reputation was traitorously attempted could not fail to open my eyes to the real character of the man whom i so zealously and blindly abetted the dreadful chastisement his guilt has received from the hand of arundel the very extraordinary incident of his being carried at the point of death to your house and the confession which the terrors of his situation in that crisis extorted from his conscience are all events combined as it should seem by the very hand of heaven and the reflections they have awakened in my mind have effectually turned it to the truth i now see your innocence i feel your sufferings and i detest myself for the cruel wrongs i have done you as the character of sir george revel sinks upon the review that of arundel rises in my esteem can i then refuse my daughter to such a man supported too by such an advocate as yourself and beloved by louisa to a degree beyond example could i have held out against her love against your solicitation and against his merits i had been indeed obdurate add to this that such is now his establishment in point of fortune reputation and pretensions of all sorts that i shall be found to have consulted our daughters interest in this match not less than her happiness his family is of the noblest in the kingdom and the best recommendation i can give of my own is that it has in times past branched from the root of the arundels  all this while here is the gallant earl of s his friend and second who in point of pedigree would not vail his bonnet to the bourbons sees his sister lady jane bestow herself upon a country parson and applauds her choice young mortlake arundels intimate is the happy man he is settled in arundels own parish who has established him there in a very good living and fitted up a parsonagehouse for him and lady jane which i hear is one of the most elegant things upon a moderate scale in all england this young brideelect has been some time with her brother living at arundel house and there she commenced her acquaintance with mortlake who has the character of a most amiable and excellent young man louisa and i are to be present at the wedding which is to take place in a few days and we shall be entertained in mr arundels house he is setting out for the country directly and we shall go down a day or two before the wedding and immediately after the ceremony set out for spring grove where arundel has promised to accompany us his uncle john and lord s are to set out at the same time to take command of their ships and thus we shall leave the bride and bridegroom to themselves which i think is very well planned for their comfort and repose  i need not attempt to tell you how very much our dear ardent girl is in love with this engaging young man you know her disposition well and can paint it to yourself much less can i describe to you her agonies whilst he was absent upon that dreadful errand heaven forbid i should ever behold her such a spectacle again nothing you can conceive will exceed it sure no human creature ever loved as she does i think two more perfect creatures were never cast in human mould i contemplate their forms with wonder and delight and i declare to you i find a sympathetic kind of likeness in their features which seems to mark them out as destined for each other it was a transport to behold them kneeling before me her hand in his and both their countenances animated with joy and gratitude i blessed them in your name as well as my own i raised them and embraced them in my arms then taking our child by the hand i desired arundel to receive her as a pledge of future friendship never to cease between us i described her to him as she is a creature formed in the extreme of all that is generous in nature ardent in affection and benevolent in soul i beseeched of him to guard a spirit so open and defenseless from the dangers of a crafty and designing world to cherish her with his love and counsel her with his understanding to her i said in few words  daughter i have bestowed you upon the man of your heart remember what is due to his honor to your own to mine to your absent mothers  in this moment i experienced a new delight superior to any i had ever known the delight of giving happiness to a beloved child the gratitude of these young people was a passion that like their love defies description and now have i deserved your pardon can you withhold from me that pity and forgiveness you bestowed on revel will you not return to me in the mean time as you have made arundels marriage a previous condition i shall expedite it without much regard to the tardy proceedings of the law i may promise myself not to be opposed by louisa in this for i think of all loves votaries she is the truest i hope to conclude the affair at spring grove in a few days after our return from the wedding of lady jane in the interim i send this to you by our faithful old servant davison and i pray you to keep him with you as i am shocked to reflect how poorly you must be waited upon  your virtue my excellent louisa has been tried and purified like gold in the fire my unworthiness of so great a blessing has deprived me of many happy days but i am at last awakened to an understanding of you and myself whilst the vanity and bustle of office engrossed my worldly thoughts your modest unassuming character scarce attracted my attention a revolution which i no longer lament has put an end to all ambitious pursuits and left me in a situation more favorable to reflection henceforth my pursuits shall be addressed to worthier objects and the first of these will be to regain your good opinion and esteem  louisa shall write to you from arundel house and send you all particulars i send you a letter of credit upon the bank of mess puysieux and co at ostend which you will make use of without limitation as your occasions may require  i shall be impatient till i hear from you again  farewell letter xci lady louisa to the countess of g arundel house i am happy in confirming to my dearest mother the happy tidings which my father sent by the conveyance of davison every thing which has since occurred convinces me of the entire revolution which his mind has undergone with respect to you and mr arundel at the same time nothing can exceed his tenderness and kindness to me  we arrived at the place whence this is dated yesterday in the forenoon mr arundel met us on horseback about three miles from the house and conducted us through his grounds and a fine avenue cut through a noble wood by a private road this is really a grand place the park is bold and romantic the river quite delightful and the house far beyond what i expected from the owners account of it it is old and irregular but very capacious and contains some noble apartments which are more striking to me than all our modern elegance my father is in raptures particularly with a collection of family portraits in the hall and gallery many of which are by vandyke and other capital masters which you know are quite his passion  nothing ever equalled the respectful and cordial reception arundel gave my father when he met our coach he dismounted from his horse came up to the window and welcomed us with the most grateful transports we presented him our hands both which he saluted in the manner so peculiarly his own my fathers with a filial devotion mine with a lovers ardour  upon our entering the hall he embraced my father in presence of the company who had there arranged themselves to receive us something he said which i lost in my hurry of spirits but i heard the words  you have made this a joyful house my lord  lady jane s lady treville and my ever honored lord s met us in the hall if i say that i flew into the arms of my beloved jane i scarce exceed the truth my father seconded me with a gallantry that quite charmed me  i ever admired you lady jane henceforward i adore you were the words with which he addressed her  to the gallant earl i whispered in a murmuring voice  oh my lord s my heart is too full to thank you may heaven reward your generous friendship  all the world must love arundel he replied you alone deserve him  we were now ushered into a stately old room fitted with norway oak and hung with pictures where the majestic figure of the brave john arundel presented itself to our awestruck eyes like one of the colossal heroes of ancient days or it might be john of gaunt himself as arundel was leading me by the hand to present me to him i protest my knees knocked together and my heart trembled within me for his gigantic stature and martial air with a tremendous gash across his forehead which has no hair to shelter it would be too terrible to approach if nature had not thrown a gleam of benevolence over his countenance which seems to say to the pigmies of creation  come near i will not harm you  he took my quivering hands in his raised them to his lips whilst he stooped to kiss them and whilst the big tears coursed one another down his manly cheek  god almighty bless you my dear lady he exclaimed you are a lovely creature by the lord nephew francis she is as beautiful as an angel  pardon my vanity my dear mother for repeating his words i give them to you as characteristic of the man and tell you things naturally as they passed  one instance of arundels elegant attention to me i must not omit upon entering the apartment appropriated to my use i perceived it had been newly furnished for the occasion with silk hangings disposed in a most brilliant and striking taste after a fashion which was new to me being drawn up in folds something like the draperies of a tent the bed in partilar was one of the most beautiful things i have ever seen in my antiroom and on my dressingtable there was every thing for use and ornament that art and nature could supply not forgetting a profusion of the sweetest flowers which he knows i am so fond of over the chimney he had hung a most enchanting saint cecilia divinely conceived and executed by our romney a masterpiece of modern art  after trifling a little at my lookingglass and a few repairs which a dusty journey had made necessary i came down to the company and in a few minutes after mortlake entered the room janes lovely face was scarlet on the occasion arundel flew to him as much to relieve his modest embarrassment as to present him to lord g and me which he did with that graceful sweetness inseparable from his minutest actions but on this occasion it was peculiarly conspicuous not a word was uttered by him or me when we were presented to each other but the first view i caught of his face opened all the character of his mind it is a countenance of the most touching cast it cannot be called an unempassioned humility that prevails in it and yet there is such a sweet and almost feminine submission in his eyes that you would think no injuries could rouse him it is in truth the emanation of an angels mind and when he smiles it is benevolence itself his mouth and teeth are exquisite i cannot praise them more than by telling you they are a counterpart of arundels his voice soft tender and melodious and an expression in his features as various and changeable as can well be imagined in short i give jane all the credit in the world for he is elegantly and indeed very finely formed in his person of a manly make and becoming stature and when his eyes glanced upon her i was well convinced they were no idle engines in the hands of love  that gay soul old lady treville did the honors of the table at dinner which was admirably well served and attended i never saw my father in such spirits he was in raptures with the old captain whom for the future we are to call by a higher title for after the cloth was removed and a health or two was gone round arundel presented him with a paper which announced his promotion to a rear admirals flag and at the same time appointed him to take command of a squadron fitting for immediate service in which the earl of s is to have a lineofbattle ship under his old commander the old lady at the head of the table with the gallantry of a frenchwoman threw her glove to the admiral and bid him tackle that to his flag and beware how he parted with the favors of a lady it was a fair challenge and the veteran did not flinch it for he started from his seat marched to the head of the table saluted the old lady and the younger ones in turn then sat down in great state and with a loud voice jovially cried out  now let the enemies of great britain keep their distance for by the lord i am invincible  then turning to lord s exclaimed  what say you my brave archibald which was accompanied with a hearty shake of the hand and other sea ceremonies and endearments which i cannot explain in short he is the life and soul of our circle but it requires a proper share of nerves to relish his conversation for he talks as loud as if he was in a storm and his laugh is a perfect feudejoie he has a thousand seatricks which he practices upon lord s and a set of jokes ready made for the occasion that i dare say have a great deal of humor in their own language but to me were perfectly unintelligible arundel manages him with great address but lord g is so devoted to him that he only studies how to please him and indulge his humor he doats upon jane and calls her daughter and in truth has proved himself a father to her noble brother his generosity to the betrothed couple has already shown itself in a great cargo of wines and various articles of housekeeping which has made its appearance at the parsonage  the afternoon being delicious we made a little excursion on the medway in a fouroared wherry rowed by the admirals and lord ss servants who are of the amphibious sort and as it should seem part of their crew the admiral took the helm and kept roaring to them all the way from behind us not without a due proportion of such phrases as had novelty at least to recommend them we cut through the water at a prodigious rate and as we passed under mortlakes terrace it was with joy i surveyed the charming spot where my fair friend is destined to reside with one of the most amiable of men we did not land but returned the more expeditiously as arundel was impatient to give my father his promised treat of a little music tomorrow morning we intend to devote to a more particular view of that delicious spot which arundel has embellished with so much fondness and with such elegance of taste  upon our return to the house we found a room prepared for our music with an admirable pianoforte new for the occasion and put in excellent tune and order by a man sent down from the maker for the purpose an elegant service of ices and other refreshments was set out the room the instrument arundels delightful accompaniment the joy of heart i then felt the sight of faces so dear to me their flattering applauses and my uncommon flow of health and spirits all conspired to call out my small powers to their best advantage arundel was orpheus himself his very eyes were melodious nothing but harmony was to be discovered in his countenance we took care to select my fathers favorites and we had the satisfaction to give him pleasure and content by every thing we undertook  when we retired to our apartments for the night arundel took the candles from the servant who was waiting in the hall to light me to my chamber and asked me if he might not be honored by that office my father seeing this cried out  by all means by all means my girl keep him to his duty whereupon i permitted it and he walked before me into my dressing room from which my servant instantly retired and i found myself alone with him  i cannot behave so ill to you in your own house i said as not to ask you to sit down  he immediately threw himself at my feet  in what words shall i thank you my souls idol for this happy day was ever man so honored or so blessed oh my louisa how shall i deserve this goodness my heart overflows with love and gratitude  i tenderly beseeched him to arise i raised him from the ground  arundel i replied my heart is so entirely yours you possess so wholly every thought every movement in my mind and my confidence in you is so unbounded that i keep no reserve before you know then there does not live a creature so devoted as i am to my arundel for you alone i live yours only i am and ever will be you are the unrivalled master of my affections  ah my beloved mother do you tremble for your fond empassioned daughter tremble not i beseech you his delicacy did not permit him to stay another minute may all good angels watch over you he cried may your dreams be happy farewell i must attend upon your father  i have now given you a circumstantial journal of our first day the next morning when we met at breakfast mortlake attended to conduct us to the parsonage the weather was divinely fine and arundel and i had had a little walk in the garden where we had amused ourselves with projecting alterations and improvements the carriages attended at the door to convey us to the riverside and we ferried over the stream to a landingplace at the foot of mortlakes terrace which brought us by a regular ascent up a very beautiful sawn to the house which we entered by a glass door that opens into a library elegantly fitted and completely furnished with books which i understand is a very fine collection this is absolutely a most enchanting room and not the less so in my eyes for containing a halflength portrait of arundel over the chimney admirably painted by gainsborough there are upon the same floor an eatingparlour drawing room and a little dressing room for the master of the house above stairs are four bedchambers and two dressingrooms janes apartment which she is to take possession of tomorrow this being the eve of her wedding day is furnished with great taste and simplicity her dressingtable displayed some elegant tokens of her brothers liberality and my father having very kindly desired i would provide myself with some wedding token for my friend and given me a very handsome sum for the purpose i left upon the table an enamelled watch with chain and trinkers of the best pattern and workmanship i could purchase in london which the dear girl flattered me by accepting in the most gracious manner mortlake seemed extremely pleased with it and my arundel above measure this happy couple are completely established by the liberality of their friends they have a small but seemingly wellchosen family of houseservants and are stocked with every thing without doors as well as within which can be necessary for their comfort every thing in and about the house was finished at arundels expense their plate linen and equipage were given them by lord s and the admiral has stored their cellars they have a very neat and modest postchaise with a pair of horses and jane who is an admirable rider has a favorite mare for the sidesaddle which her beloved purchased in the neighborhood all these things we saw not omitting the minutest article judge with what transport i surveyed this prelude to their happiness but you can have no idea of the effect it had upon my father oh my dear madam he is a new man and he seems as if he was transplanted into a new world  where have i been he cries all this while and what have i been doing this is happiness this is the true ambition what a phantom have i been following  he observed to me in a whisper that this was the very house in the world to charm you above all the palaces of the great oh that she was here present added he and then he declared to me that as soon as he was blessed with your society again he would retire to the country new model his family by reducing the scale and dispose of his house in town and if you approved of it of his villa also he is charmed with mortlake and applauds lady jane to the skies as we were walking down the garden toward the river on our return he drew me aside to express how delighted he was with the scene of happiness he had been surveying and what joy it gave him to reflect that i should have such an amiable couple for my near neighbors and inseparable friends he then asked me if i approved of his requesting mortlake to come to spring grove to perform a ceremony for me and arundel which he hoped would take place in a few days i said that i supposed arundel would settle that with his friend  no no he replied you may depend upon it he will not entrench upon the ladys prerogative in that particular but there can be no doubt of its being a most acceptable choice to him and therefore with your leave i will make the request both to mortlake and lady jane the first opportunity i have of speaking to them apart i hope they will not much regret the trouble of a short journey upon such an occasion but upon second thoughts added he perhaps it is a compliment that in the first place should be offered to sir joseph arundel though i suspect there is not the greatest harmony in that quarter however i will consult with arundel before i take any step in the matter indeed if my old tutor the dean had been now living i know not how i could have passed him over but his death leaves me free from any other obligations and by the way louisa i have now a donative to dispose of which his decease has vacated that would exactly fit this amiable young man and being one of those douceurs in the church which are not attended with the cure of souls it can in no case detach him from his residence here what say you to this my dear you have all been making wedding presents may i not throw in mine amongst the rest had i been in office i must have attended to the demands of interest now it is in my power to indulge the impulse of friendship  is not this a most pleasing instance of a mind awakened to its genuine sensibility can i give you a better proof of a temper happily reformed oh my beloved mother providence will repay your sufferings there is happiness yet in store for you the hour i hope is approaching fast when i shall press you to my grateful heart and feel the pressure of your fond protecting arms with what tenderness did my arundel talk of you this morning as we conversed together in our walk before breakfast it is not in my power to convey to you the one half of what he said with any justice to his sentiments and if i could repeat his words it would be impossible to repeat his manner which is so peculiarly his own i must not however omit to tell you that amongst other kindnesses he offered to bring me to you as soon as we were married for the purpose of escorting you home and i should add that my father has signified his intention of coming to you in person as soon as that event has taken place tell me therefore if it will be agreeable to you that arundel and i should accompany him on the journey be assured it will afford us unfeigned pleasure  i must now bring my journal to a conclusion because i make a point of dating from this place and our departure is fixed for tomorrow immediately after the wedding that we may reach spring grove before night arundel goes with us and my father brought his coach that we might have his company by the way when our ceremony has taken place we shall set off for arundel house  oh heavens my dear mother my heart palpitates with alarms which i cannot describe yet arundel is tender there is mercy in his eyes i love i dote upon him to distraction why should i dread what i so much desire why am i in these terrors  you know my friend jane amongst a thousand other agremens has a talent for poetry you have seen some specimens of her verses when i was in mortlakes library this morning as my father was expatiating upon the charms of retirement and tranquillity in such a delightful spot mortlake secretly put into my hand a copy of the following little poem addressed to solitude which with great difficulty he had persuaded jane to let him transcribe  i give these lines to your ladyship said he assured that you will prize them for the sake of the beloved author  i send them to you my dear mother as i think the general sentiment is of that moral and contemplative cast that will harmonize with your feelings in your present solitude  to solitude o solitude to whose serene abode the hermit flies to commune with his god where buried in some deep and silent glen shuddering he quits the guilty haunts of men with thee and the dear partner of my life far far

killed a noble gentleman sir george revel in a duel your going into a foreign country to evade the laws which obtain in your own mark the deliberation of the act and show how unworthy you are to be a member of that legislative body who should jointly and severally protect the peace and order of the state from which you have made yourself a voluntary outlaw  i hear withal that your quarrel with the deceased whose blood is upon your conscience arose from a vain competition you entered into with him for the favor of a certain noble heiress great indeed must have been your presumption and only to be equalled by your absurdity give me leave to say when you could aspire to the daughter of the earl of g whom you repaid for patronizing you in poverty by a most virulent opposition to him when by the wheel of fortune you had been thrown into parliament  what notions must you have entertained of your own consequence when you could propose yourself as a rival to sir george revel and where must have been your senses when the way you took to recommend yourself to the daughter was by offering insults to the father  the bloody triumph you have had may be matter of exultation to you and your uncle john and other ferocious companions who make war their trade and glory in the slaughter of their fellow creatures but to me who am a preacher of peace it is horrible in the extreme and it becomes my melancholy duty as a parent to make an effort however hopeless for awakening your conscience to a sense of these enormities beseeching heaven to turn your heart to repentance and avert the judgment which must otherwise overtake you  so prays your unhappy father joseph arundel  letter xciii francis to sir joseph arundel arundel house that i have been compelled into a duel with sir george revel is true but that i have his blood upon my conscience is not a fact as that gentleman is out of danger from his wounds neither will i believe were i at liberty to explain all the motives which necessitated me to meet his sword that even you would condemn me for the consequences had they been as fatal as you suppose  surely sir it is the part of every one who judges another to hear before he condemns and i humbly conceive that paternal justice is not singly exempt from that obligation yet i have repeatedly fallen under your sentence upon information only i shall therefore be silent from appeal and leave my character to speak for itself when you are disposed to think more favorably of me it shall be from conviction of facts and not from pleas and remonstrances on my part  it may very well appear presumptuous in me to aspire to the daughter of the earl of g and yet if the success of that presumption is any answer to the charge of absurdity which you impute to me you will find it in the letter which i have the honor to enclose to you from the father of that lady  i am etc etc  letter xciv the earl of g to sir joseph arundel if you are as sensible of the unparalleled merits of your excellent son as every one who knows him is you will allow that i have great cause to pride myself in the hope i entertain of being soon to participate with you in the honor and happiness of calling him son  the love which my daughter conceived for this amiable youth from the first day she saw him the very high opinion which lady g has ever had of his character and the very delicate and honorable manner in which he has behaved toward me and mine under circumstances the most trying cruel and unjust from which nothing but his own true courage and the hand of providence over his life could have protected him have all conspired to open my eyes to his uncommon merit and to rouse me from a delusion i reflect upon with shame and remorse  as you and i have been old friends i hope this alliance will not make us less cordial than before but i must ingenuously say this will entirely depend upon the measure of your affection to a most excellent son for i should think it unpardonable if you who are his father by nature should love him less than i who am only his father by law  i have the honor to be sir etc etc  letter xcv captain john to sir joseph arundel brother joseph though i am your younger brother and understand myself well enough to know i cannot argue with you in the way of learning yet i believe i know a little of what is called common sense and i hope i am not totally ignorant of what is called common justice though i am as you say one of those ferocious people who make war their trade  i dont know what you mean by a trade brother but i hope it is a trade i need not be ashamed of and as for what i have earned by it which is no trifle i let you know that i intend to leave it all to your son unless you can point out to me any honester or worthier man in the king of englands dominions  as ferocious as you may think me i hope i have more human nature in my heart than to write to my son if i had one as you have wrote to frank before you find fault brother joseph why dont you stop to find where the fault lies i believe that is justice and i am mistaken if it is not christianity into the bargain  i dont mean to offend you do you see whereby i am brushing out to sea again and like enough may never let eyes on you again therefore take what i say in good part for i am a plain man and neither mean to flatter or affront any man much less a brother  frank is a going to be married to my lady louisa g and i am sorry i cannot wait to see the last hand put to the job but as war is a trade you know brother it is a trade that must be followed or lost however i have left my blessing with him and my will into the bargain neither of which will i hope do him any harm if i dont live to come back again i dont find fault with your preaching peace brother francis and i cannot see why you should be angry with me for following war when i am bid to do it in the defense of my country if it was not for some of us ferocious animals who venture our lives for old england i question if you peaceable folks would have a church over your heads to say your prayers in  farewell brother joseph i have wrote you a monstrous long letter but take it in good part when you preach up peace remember to practice it bless god for the good son he has given you and add a little ejaculation when you are about it for  your ferocious though affectionate brother john arundel  letter xcvi lady louisa g to the countess of g spring grove yesterday was the auspicious day that united lady jane to her beloved mortlake and transported me to this place with my beloved arundel we all attended the happy couple to the altar where the ceremony was performed by a neighboring clergyman an old friend of the house of arundel jane deported herself with all the fortitude and composure in the world and made her responses audibly and firmly not quite so her espoused and as for poor me i trembled most incontinently and whenever my eye caught a glimpse of arundel there were no bounds to my tremor awful as the ceremony is in itself and more particularly so as it appeared to me when deciding upon the fate of a beloved friend yet to my shame i confess i was more than once most sadly put to it to keep my countenance when the old admiral roared out the responses so much above the keynote of the clerk and the rest of us who made up the congregation that i and even arundel himself were forced to cram our handkerchiefs into our mouths especially as the good man was not always very correct and occasionally took some small liberties with the text particularly where the minister repeated  be unto them a tower of strength  the admiral sung out in a voice of thunder as if he was upon his own quarter deck from the face of all our enemies  at which moment i am persuaded he had a sideway hit at the french and spaniards for his voice was not only particularly exalted but there was an energy in his tone which convinces me he had them in his thoughts he had a large folio prayer book spread before him and a huge pair of spectacles on his nose which made him as irresistible to the sight as to the hearing  after the ceremony was over we repaired to the parsonage where an elegant little collation was set out in the library and here with tears of joy i embraced and congratulated my beloved lady jane mortlake lord s and the admiral were setting off for london as well as ourselves so that we all parted from the bride and bridegroom at the same moment alas the fortitude which my poor jane had exerted at the altar here forsook her at the moment when she found herself perhaps for the last time which heaven avert in the arms of her beloved brother  oh my dear dear archibald she cried may the god of all mercies preserve thee from death and give thee victory in battle go my hero go to certain conquest and let not my fond weakness unman thee thy sister shall pray for thee mortlake shall put up his prayers to that gracious being whose blessing is upon us in this moment of our union and who will not refuse the petitions of his faithful servant  and oh my father and my friend she added throwing her arms round the neck of the gallant admiral who stooped to embrace her may you return with fresh laurels to the joy of your friends here present and to the glory of your country she now threw herself down on the couch whilst tears such as heroes shed fell from the eyes of the departing warriors  let us seize this moment and be gone said my father mr mortlake we beg you will stay with your lady and take no further notice of us  the word was instantly obeyed by all arundel took my hand the admiral put his arm under the earls and my father led the way we threw ourselves without ceremony into our respective carriages and were whirled away with a rapidity which those who have not traveled post in england have no idea of  thus is grief compounded in our brightest joys and the cup of blessing is for ever dashed with tears  my father first broke silence by desiring us to take our own conversation without regarding him as he should amuse himself with his own thoughts and reflections upon the scenes he had left behind without interrupting us in our discourse consider yourselves my dear children said he as man and wife elect talk over your own little projects follow your own inclinations your endearments your fondnesses to each other as if nobody was present or at most an old nurse who will only drop a salt tear over your caresses and chuckle at the happiness of her beloved bantling  having so said he took the hand of arundel and drew him to that side of the coach where i was seated by myself stretching himself over the back seat at the same time in an attitude as if he was going to sleep  my sweet louisa says arundel since your father is no longer present i must give some vent to my heart by telling you how deeply it is affected by his goodness to us both the honor he has done me by this visit the confidence he reposes in me on all occasions and the happiness he has showered upon me in blessing me with all my soul holds dear on this side heaven have raised emotions in my heart that i shall never be in a capacity of doing justice to you my charmer must find occasion for telling him how truly i revere and love him i know no other way of expressing my gratitude to him but by my everlasting devotion to his lovely daughter  my father took my hand and joining it to arundels tenderly pronounced a blessing upon us and as my head reclined on arundels shoulder contemplated us with a look of infinite sensibility and affection we then by degrees fell into discourse upon the happy event of the morning and of janes solemn and composed behavior at the altar with which my father was greatly struck but owned that the admirals responses put his muscles to the trial he demanded of me if i thought i could stand the office as heroically as she did i shook my head and arundel smiled upon me he then began to praise her to the skies for her noble qualities and declared he was never more affected than by her manner of parting from her brother my father was no less warm in his encomiums upon mortlake which made arundels fine eyes glisten with delight we talked over their whole establishment and my father was in raptures whilst he expatiated on the paradise as he called it in which they were placed saying to arundel with a smile  the only fault i can find with you son arundel is that you are too rich  this put me in mind of janes address to solitude which i sent you in my last letter and having a copy in my pocketbook i made arundel read the lines aloud by such an audience the beloved author was sure to be applauded  we next amused ourselves with planning projects of improvements at arundel house in which i stiffly contended for the ancient lares which to my taste were infinitely more venerable than all the extravagancies of modern foppery in brick and plaster something i allowed might be admitted without violating their prerogative but still i thought the line was to be followed which they pointed out and in this arundel agreed with me my father observed that he seemed to be very well established in point of servants and for his part he could not see any occasion he had to increase them arundel acknowledged that he did not think it could add to our happiness to be encumbered with a very numerous suite of idlers and seemed to apply to me for my opinion in the matter i told him that my notions of domestic economy had been formed upon your lessons and instructions repeatedly imprinted on my thoughts and confirmed by what little judgment and experience i could boast of so that i was at no loss to express myself without hesitation on the subject i set out by saying that as i wished to acquit myself as became the mistress of his family it was the first point with me to have my household upon such a scale as i could completely superintend and manage if i had a parcel of superfluous and idle people about me how could i undertake for this i would wish my husband in the first place to take an exact computation of his income clear and unencumbered as it came into his hands upon that computation i would have him lay down his general scale of expense and regulate every article of it as far as could be done upon previous calculation upon this there ought to be a considerable balance for contingencies of various sorts such as building improving bounties and a long list of unforeseen demands upon his taste or charity beyond this income be it what it may i would on no account suffer my expenses to go wherever they threatened to exceed it the reform must be immediate and effectual for there could be no peace in my mind while his fortune was diminishing and the greater that fortune was the greater would be my self reproach for so inexcusable a waste of it that mere parade i detested from my heart and next to gaming i held electioneering as a most unjustifiable and senseless profusion of property that i took the opportunity now to say in the most peremptory manner and i hoped my father who heard me say it would not discommend me for it that i would absolutely not consent to accept a single diamond from the hands of arundel  here arundel stared and my father nodded assent with a smile of approbation  as for plate i perceived he had enough of it and equipage to please me must be as simple and unpretending as possible i wished to rival no lady pure or impure in the splendour of her carriage i was too proud to pique myself upon such distinctions for the merit of which i was to resort to longacre the chief part of our time money and attention would i hoped be addressed to the country and there i should wish to be carrying on a constant and gradual improvement rather than a rapid and expensive one not only as it would be a lasting pleasure to us who were occupied in it but as it would give a more permanent employment to our laborious poor of them i should be ambitious of collecting a colony about me lodged in comfortable cottages within my eye and not driven into holes and corners of the earth to make room for my unsocial and tyrannical ideas of monopolizing a whole country for what is falsely called ornament and prospect their habitations would be the best ornament of my prospect their population my pride and the contemplation of their comforts my reward  here arundel in an ecstacy of joy threw his arms round my neck and smothered me with kisses my father clapped his hands as it were involuntarily together and exclaimed aloud that is right my dear arundel she challenges your love  these tender and encouraging caresses prompted me to proceed yet further and i resumed my discourse in substance as follows  regularity in hours is essential to the good order and comfort of a family in the country there is no excuse for not conforming to it neither can i by any means approve of those fine people who adopt their london hours in their country houses putting their neighbors who visit them either out of their own habits and customs or which is worse teaching them to copy bad examples and so corrupting the simplicity of manners so well becoming their condition and fortune this is a thing that i abominate it is founded in affectation of high life the very people who adopt it suffer by it it is unsocial insulting and ridiculous in the extreme no one can contend that it is a better distribution of a day in summer which is generally the season when the rich retire into the country to rise in the hear of the forenoon take our exercise in the midday and dedicate the refreshing hours of evening to the indolence and luxury of the table surely such an arrangement of hours is the reverse of every thing that pleasure would teach us were we to consult no other guide but there are a thousand other reasons against it which are aggravations of its absurdity as for my table i would cautiously avoid that overbearing splendour which seems more calculated to display my own consequence than to contribute to the comfort of my guests i would wish to do nothing that should pique my neighbors of inferior fortune into emulation or provoke their envy i would keep an uniform table in which comfort should be chiefly considered and elegance by no means overlooked all should be welcome and set dinners as much a possible avoided my supreme social delight would be to engage such a party of amiable and entertaining people within my own family circle as would make the hours that we passed within doors both lively and improving men and women of elegant minds people of talents eminent artists respectable foreigners pleasant and goodnatured companions who have the faculty of exhilarating our convivial hours are those whose society i should covet and the happy case with which we have at last learnt to live with each other under the same roof would leave me still at my leisure for all the demands which the care of my family might have upon me in the mean time upon this system i do not see any opening in a man of fortunes time for the insipid dissipations of a listless life for the desperate resource of gaming for the perpetual hurry of journies from place to place for the whim of a racehorse or even the din of a pack of hounds what an endless fund of amusing occupation is there in a domestic farm whilst my husband superintended the more interesting concerns of stock and cultivation i could find perpetual employment in the smaller departments and i think there is nothing would give me such health and pleasure as to be so engaged i should regret the day when i was to quit my dairy for london and the drawing room  and now methinks i must have pretty well wearied you both with my reveries  they were so polite as to assure me they were by no means tired of listening to me and arundel with an air of the greatest sincerity protested that he had set down every word in his memory and would faithfully adhere to it by adopting my system with the strictest conformity to every rule  thus my dear mother our time insensibly passed away whilst we were rapidly approaching to our journeys end which set us safely down at spring grove before the darkness overtook us where after a night of happy repose in which the events of the day were compounded into a dream wherein my happiness was painted afresh in all the wild and glowing colors of romantic fancy i arose to execute this pleasing task and then to realize the visions of the night by flying into the arms of love and arundel  farewell letter xcvi arundel to charles mortlake spring grove uxorious mortlake if thou can spare a moment from the enchanting arms of thy adored wife give your ear to a lover happy in his approach to the blessing he is eagerly expecting and yet tantalized by that happiness from not having possessed it as thou have thine i will not long entrench upon thy transports  to a married ear i can say more than i would commit to the inflammable brain of a bachelor as thou wast a day or two ago  this lovely creature charms me into phrenzy i am in a state of mental intoxication with the fondness she bestows upon me i have a thousand minds to tell her fairly that i cannot that i will not bear it what does she think of me oh heavens she thinks neither of me nor of herself how should i expect mercy when she has none for her own feelings we must be married without the conveyancers the law crawls like the tortoise we fly toward the goal like the nimble hare in the fable  carry not my allusion any further mortlake for we will not halt by the way at least if human resolution can hold out against more than human beauty against more than human passion  there now she will not let me write to thee  look where it comes again  was that all you came for  oh louisa thou have a soul of love embodied in the most attractive form of beauty  enchantress siren witch why did you put on that alluring dishabille why did you dispose your auburn locks in those ensnaring ringlets what means that negligent simplicity that halfdiscovering halfconcealing veil that only hides the surface not the shape of your swelling bosom the very model of perfection into which my senses sink even on the very sight she has set my hand a trembling and i cannot proceed  oh heavens the angel form is here again and now she comes to dictate to me i am to take up my pen and write whilst she hovers over me  it is impossible my charming louisa whilst you stand within my reach in that alluring attitude if you mean me to be your scribe you must not come within the glance of my eyes post yourself in that chair behind me and then begin with your instructions  you are to tell lady jane mortlake that louisa cannot write to her and yet she expects to be written to  so much for her ladyships modesty  she demands of me if i have not something to say to you about your coming hither  ah what a blunder have i committed that was only a hint for my private ear and not to be committed to yours  she blushes to the eyes and insists upon my striking it out for it alludes to our wedding which i must plainly tell you stands for this day sennight so now you must concert with lady jane accordingly i own i wish it very sincerely and if without particular inconvenience to your lady or yourself you could comply with my request i should be happy that the friend of my heart would tie that indissoluble band which i mean to keep for ever sacred and inviolate this is in substance what the lovely blushes on the cheeks of my louisa mean to dictate to me you who have seen them know their eloquence and i dare believe will not prove yourself insensible to their persuasion  when i ask her what she has else in charge to her beloved friend she says she will trust me with no more messages and bids me leave off writing  what must i do what would you do in the like case  obey friendship give place o love what a monopolizer art thou  farewell letter xcviii lady jane mortlake to lady louisa g in the maidenish simplicity of my heart i promised you a long letter but i must break my word with you out of all the many injunctions which you laid upon me i can obey one only and that is  literally to write and no more i know my dear louisa will be in a pet with me but i will leave it to time to apologize for my indolence before many days come to an end you may have sympathetic motives for acquitting me  i am sure mr mortlake will obey the call of his friend and come to you at spring grove when the happy day is fixed but i rather think i must forego the undertaking especially as you will come down to arundel house on the day of your marriage and to that resolution i would advise you to adhere  but is this the languid style i should use to my louisa no i will not close my letter till i assure you gratefully assure you every prospect of happiness opens upon me  excess of it you know my dear will overpower the spirits and even force us to put on the very symptoms of sorrow i am charmed with every thing about me external comforts surround me in abundance but i have that within which passes show these are but the symphonies if i may so call them the accompaniments of that superior strain of harmony which breathes in every look action and endearing movement of my beloved mortlake such a heavenly temper beams upon me such a gay serene and placid mind affections so inexpressibly tender such love such ardour oh my louisa what a treasure am i blessed with in this inestimable man as for his understanding it seems to me like an exhaustless mine of the purest ore he and your matchless arundel have not misspent the early morning of their life in dissipation and intemperance but with a prudent forecast have been storing up resources for the evening of their day for the night wherein no one can work  in a very few days i hope i shall begin to apportion out my time upon system and regulate both my little family and myself i do not mean to engross my husbands hours so entirely as not to leave him a part of the day in which his library shall be unapproachable by me i should be unpardonable were i to break in upon duties of so serious a nature as belong to his function and to which he is so conscientiously devoted his studies therefore have a claim upon him which i shall hold as sacred and those hours i shall pass in my domestic employments and when they do not call upon me in such reading as he shall recommend for instruction or amusement but when in addition to those resources i cast my eyes upon those neighboring turrets which will soon be occupied by the friend of my heart what is there wanting to complete my prospect what but to merit a continuance of these blessings by gratitude to the god who bestows them  farewell letter xcix sir joseph arundel to the earl of g the respect with which i have ever looked up to your lordship and the elevated rank in which you stand would never have permitted me to think of an alliance with your family but as the most improbable of all events had not your letter informed me that an union between your amiable noble daughter and my son is likely soon to take place under the sanction of your consent and good liking  my lord i am at a loss what words to use upon this occasion i cannot deny that i have seen some particulars of mr arundels conduct with an eye of displeasure and i have given him my fatherly reproof accordingly of this sort have been his deportment in parliament and his duel with sir george revel i confess i wrote harshly to him on those topics but i will not be obstinate against conviction i may have been misinformed nay more than that i may have erred in judgment but my intentions have been sincere you are pleased to take his defense very warmly upon yourself and your words must ever have the greatest weight with me stronger proof cannot be given of the confidence you have in him than that you have thought him worthy of being honored with the hand of lady louisa your only child this is a testimony as honorable to him as it is unexpected by me and above all hope of mine  my lord i am a sequestered man and move in a very private sphere a title indeed has descended upon me but it has descended empty it did not please my brother francis living or dying to take any notice of me and i am given to understand by my brother john that no part of his spoils are likely to be bestowed on me these accumulations center in my son his fortune is ample and independent and therefore as he does not want my help i the less wonder at the contempt he shows for my opinion or advice it is from your lordship i learn the honor and happiness which await him  but though i have thus detached myself from the world and all its ambition yet i am a man and have the feelings of a man and consistently with those feelings it will be impossible for me to present my neglected person at the haughty doors of that unbrotherly mansion whose owner never permitted me to enter them nor gave me the welcome i had a right to expect this i flatter myself will appear so natural to your lordship that you will allow it a sufficient excuse for my seeming omission if i do not pay that respect to lady louisa in her married state which as your lordships daughter i have ever entertained for her  i have the honor to be etc etc joseph arundel  letter c mortlake to arundel i have received your summons and shall fly to obey it with every ardent wish with every anxious prayer for your happiness it is my lot to have been the object of the marriage ceremony before i have been the performer of it in right of my function may the commencement be auspicious  my dear arundel it is now the first time in my remembrance that whilst writing to you i have paused upon my pen and found that my mind would not furnish words to supply it the fact is my imagination is locked up by repletion so many grateful thoughts throng and press upon it at the same moment that language cannot extricate them you have showered down benefits upon your friend so fast that though i am in no danger of forgeting them i am in no capacity of particularizing them wherever my eye goes it meets some remembrancer of your friendly generosity if i survey my house if i walk into my garden if my sight is directed to my church i say within myself o arundel these are thy works but there is yet another object on whom my eyes rest with peculiar fondness one dear to my sight and in her person lovely of whom i can with truth pronounce this blessing is the gift of arundel  and as thy gift i will preserve and prize it i will lodge it in my heart cherish it with unabating fondness love watch and tenderly protect it yes may the god whom i adore forsake me when i wrong that excellence the condescending sweetness of whose generous nature stooped to the humble mute admirer who only sighed at a distance and whilst aspiring to nothing more than pity gained her love and what a treasure is that love what a combination of charms are met together beauty that would have attracted all beholders without the aid of mental excellencies a mind that would have won all hearts without the help of personal attractions  there was a mystery in old times which the superstition of the initiated keep sacred from all ears there is a mystery of modern times which its own nonsense secures against discovery but those joys to which i have been admitted my dear arundel are undiscoverable because they can never be described  i find myself with a companion in whose society no hour of the day can be heavy her lively genius gives a novelty to every subject and we mutually instruct each other she tells me of the world as it is i inform her of the world as it has been it gives me inexpressible delight to find that her spirits are not damped by retirement and the teteatete of a husband on the contrary their gaiety increases every day and i may truly say we have never waked but to a joyful morning the temporary depression she felt upon parting from her beloved brother is long since at an end and her buoyant mind rises superior to those gloomy and unsocial thoughts which deal in melancholy predictions and feed their spleen with horrors of their own painting she on the contrary sees all futurity in its brightest light and by the force of a sanguine fancy meets her gallant hero returning with fresh laurels to her arms and feasts upon the idea  as for me who by one of the most rapid transitions of fortune am of a sudden transplanted from college rooms and the twentieth part of a bedmakers attendance to the possession of an elegant house and a family of servants what should i have done without her help things which no time would have brought to my understanding she sees and comprehends in a moment it is incredible with what facility she arranges her domestic matters and though every order is given with the most perfect sweetness of temper yet there is no trifling with her commands the strictest obedience is exacted and of course obtained the machine now put in motion by her guiding hand goes on mechanically and with correct regularity and for my part i shall be totally out of employ unless i keep some little land in my hands which my lovely friend advises me to do she is accomptantgeneral of my finances and has furnished herself with a huge vellum book and all the apparatus of a clerk which i should never have thought of and suffered accordingly she says our income will amply suffice for our establishment and leave some loose money for unforeseen occasions on the balance but i had no opportunity of talking with you about the very kind offer which lord g made me of a donative of l  00 per annum that has lately elapsed i was really so oppressed with bounty from all hands that i did not know what answer to make him when i ought in gratitude to have said a great deal i must rely upon you to help me out by telling him what an awkward animal i am when my friends confound me with their goodness and at the same time be sure to say in the most sincere and natural way to his lordship that i must believe he has a number of expectants who look up to him for favors and whose long attendance has given them far better claims upon his patronage than i can pretend to if therefore he has any one of these in his eye i beseech him to pass me over and my gratitude will still be paid to his good wishes but if on the contrary his desire to do a grace to you in the person of your friend prevails against all other claims i then beg of him to add a further grace to his bounty by bestowing it upon her from whom i derive every pretension and to whom i owe every blessing in life and let her by whose hand i am raised and on whose smiles i live appropriate to her private purse that which to me would be a superfluity in gods name what am i what right have i to be thus caressed by fortune i already sink under the blessings i enjoy my own unworthiness flies in my face and i tremble for the trials which prosperity may expose me to i am determined arundel to humble myself even below what i am by nature there is nobody but yourself and my dearest lady jane to whom i dare give a vent to the happiness of my heart for fear my exultation should be mistaken for insult to my country neighbors and particulary to my brethren of the cloth i am resolved nothing shall escape me to provoke their ill opinion of me as a man intoxicated by good fortune or to put them upon enquiring how i merited what has befallen me in short my dear friend i have called myself to a strict account and find i have no chance for preserving the favor of providence but to humble myself with double diligence before god and man and to pray for support under the most dangerous of all trials the trial of unmerited prosperity  lady jane was desirous upon her wedding day to give some little bounty to the poor of the parish and consulted me upon it i showed her a little book in which i had minuted down the particulars of all the needy families the number ages and sex of their children with the occupation condition and necessities of their parents i had the satisfaction to see she was very much pleased by this account which she considered as an instance of my attention to the duties of a parish priest she was at the trouble of copying my list and has begun her visitation in consequence of it i perceive i shall have nothing to do but write sermons and preach them in their ears on a sunday for my weekly duty will be in better hands  arundel i repeat to you my resolution of never quitting the flock which you have put under my care i will not make your bounty a steppingstone to my ambition and of this i took an early opportunity to apprise lady jane without which explanation i thought it would have been dishonorable to have entered into engagements with her i need not say that her noble and disinterested nature approved of my resolution  i perceive i shall have a great passion for my garden not only because you have made it so alluring and beautiful but because lady jane seems to have a strong attachment to it and it is an amusement in which i can have her company and participation as for the library having now pretty well reconnoitred the whole of it i must really consider it as a very select and wellchosen collection of books in good condition and of the best sort we for the present inhabit no other room as the prospect it commands is so charming  lady jane bids me say that she shall accompany me to spring grove though she wrote doubtfully of it to lady louisa we shall be with you in the evening before the happy day  farewell letter ci the countess to the earl of g your letter has given peace to an afflicted heart and if i pause upon the pleasing invitation it contains these are my reasons the retirement to which i have for some time devoted myself and the melancholy scene that has been under my review whilst sir george revel was in the house with me have with other conspiring causes lest impressions on my spirits which will probably disqualify me for the rest of my life from returning to that public station your rank and fortune may require me to appear in with a mind alienated from the splendour of high life and faculties incapacitated for stepping forward upon the conspicuous stage of the great world i think it just to apprise you that i am no longer equal to the undertaking reflection has cut so deep into my heart that nothing but the soothing scenes of tranquillity and privacy can perfectly restore it dissipation would but open all its wounds  let me not deceive you nor give occasion for future discontent when you find yourself betrayed by pity into a step which you have cause to repent of it is enough for me to know myself acquitted in your thoughts to hear that my beloved child is happy and now and then to find myself in the kind remembrance of those who are dear to me place me in some quiet retreat where i may pass my days in that obscurity for which nature designed me and if ever that happy period shall arrive when your heart is sated with worldly pleasures and pursuits turn to my solitude seek your humble friend and my arms shall be open to receive and welcome you to purer and more peaceful scenes than those you leave behind you  trust me my lord there is no worldly honor could befall you to give me half the joy i take in hearing you have conquered your resentments against arundel it was a noble effort and you have subdued the worst enemies to your peace that can haunt the human breast anger and suspicion i read the account of your visit to arundel house with tears of joy and gratitude accept the thanks the praises of a wife to whom your happiness and welfare are infinitely valuable you have been employed in the heavenly office of dispensing blessings to all around you you have saved your child from misery and disgrace and healed a mothers broken heart these my dear lord are glorious actions these reflections may be dwelt upon with lasting delight these honors can never be taken from you  i thank you for your kind attention to me in sending davison he is a good creature and has been of great use and comfort to me the money he brought with him is so much more than my occasions call for that i shall have no demand to make upon the credit you have given me at ostend this supply in the mean time has enabled me to show some little marks of my gratitude to madame polberg which have been very seasonable to the worthy creature and have added much to the few comforts left for her in this life you knew the baron when he was in england and it was under your administration he was employed by his court in a secret and confidential commission to ours as she states his case it must have been extremely hard for the business having failed through no miscarriage or fault of his the poor baron never could obtain indemnification for his charges and having wearied out his health and exhausted his fortune in a fruitless solicitation at vienna he died and left his disconsolate widow in very narrow circumstances you have flattered me with the hopes of coming to me after the wedding unless i prevented you by setting out upon davisons arrival this i was strongly tempted to do that i might prevent your trouble but great as was my joy when i received such instances of your returning kindness my health and spirits were still unequal to the undertaking for to say the truth i am far from well a low fever hangs about me and i take little rest or nourishment come to me therefore my dear lord and repay yourself by a double piece of charity for i think you may be able to do madame polberg a service with the imperial minister by stating the case of the baron as it came under your cognizance and it is to be hoped that your testimony will assist her suit for obtaining justice thus you shall at once receive the widows blessing and the grateful thanks of your devoted wife your presence may repel this secret enemy that saps my health if i see you happy and well pleased with me the smile of kindness will repair a broken spirit but if i hear that your retirement from office and the happy marriage of louisa have weaned your heart from the unprofitable pursuits of ambition and if i find you disposed to seek for peace and tranquillity in domestic life and that a town house and a suburban villa can no longer detach you from the venerable seat of your ancestors all complaints will vanish before such a blessed revolution and there will be no bounds to my joy and thankfulness then i will return with you most gladly from that moment my whole heart will be yours and every hour of my life shall be dedicated to the delightful task of pleasing and of serving you then we shall live again in our children our youth shall be renovated in theirs in the contemplation of louisas and arundels nuptial happiness we shall find a perpetual feast to our souls and perhaps enjoy the further felicity of seeing a young generation arise from the union of two noble families heirs of the virtue beauty and generosity of their parents  letter cii the countess to lady louisa g all joy to my beloved child your mother who fled to this solitary dwelling with no better hope than to secret herself from calumny and unkindness has found it a scene of busy revolutions selected as it were by providence to perform its wonders in and by the most extraordinary coincidence of chances to bring the accuser face to face with the accused and extort confession from a guilty heart under the terrors of impending death  what unexpected happiness has followed the discovery of that wicked plot how much beyond all hope was the preservation of that desperate man the least of whose wounds seemed to take away all chance of life how adorable was the divine grace which inspired him with repentance and moved him to make atonement for his crimes by a clear complete and explicit confession who could have believed that your fathers heart would have been so converted from its resentment and turned upon the sudden with such benignity toward arundel what remained for you but to waste your life in bewailing his obduracy or else to have sunk your character by precipitating yourself into a clandestine marriage against the protest of your parent hapless alternative and yet where was your hope but in the choice of these difficulties  when behold at once in the most unexpected moment the hand of heaven is laid upon your fathers heart the quickening touch revives that conscience which seemed dead within him the regenerate spirit of mercy inspires him with new feelings peace and reconciliation take place arundel is adopted my prayers are granted and my child is blessed  now louisa i conjure you by your gratitude to that beneficent power which has brought these mighty things to pass let these reflections never fade in your mind remember what it is you owe a debt that your whole life can never overpay be dutiful affectionate and tender to your father remember what he has done for you call to mind what daggers he has drawn from your bosom and strike not a thorn though the slightest and least painful into his cherish him in his age pity him in his infirmities sooth him in those listless hours when life becomes a load let him be ever welcome to your doors open your arms to receive him though he bring no mirth or gaiety with him and make allowances for the dullness of that evening which is too apt to close the day that has been sacrificed to ambition though his mind may decay let not your charity lose its vigor and let the daughters hospitality be the parents asylum  in my letter to your father i took the liberty of hinting to him how blessed i should be if he could detach his mind from worldly pursuits and take this opportunity of his recess from office to seek tranquillity in the country let me entreat you to cooperate with my wishes and as your influence is great to exert it for his happiness grant for a moment that he was reinstated in his former post what can he gain by it not any new accession of dignity for what is that honor of whose instability he has had such recent experience and if he seeks it without obtaining it a fruitless pursuit does but sink his character and disgrace his politics on the contrary if he avails himself of his dismission from public affairs and without impatience or repining takes up the respectable character of an independent nobleman all mankind will give him credit for the disintestedness of his past services and not impute them to the greediness of power but to a patriot zeal for his countrys good  as for your own conduct in a married state the lessons which i should have repeated have been so faithfully remembered by you and so aptly applied that you have anticipated all i had to say on that subject those rules are now become your own and i trust you will never want perseverance in following what your reason adopts  in mr mortlake and lady jane you will have the best neighbors in the world and i flatter myself they will both contribute to your happiness and themselves enjoy it the specimen you sent me of her poetry pleased me much and the subject still better than the execution of it i beg you will present to them my most cordial congratulations  mr arundel has so long commanded every good and zealous wish of my heart that it would be but idle ceremony to repeat them now as the husband of my louisa he will have my warmest affection but i must beseech both him and you not to think of coming hither as you kindly offered no my dear that is a sacrifice i will by no means allow you to make and lest what i have said may not be sufficient to divert you from it remember that i positively forbid it as my health is somewhat impaired i think it not improbable i shall try a winter in the south of france to which i am advised and have the offer of all necessary passports for the purpose let me hope i shall then return to you with better spirits and a more established state of health  sir george revel is gone to bareges from which place he has written me a letter full of acknowledgments and i am well pleased to hear that he advances in his recovery it will be long before he returns to england  i had almost forgot a circumstance which i should more properly have mentioned in my letter to your father but i desire you will tell him that upon observing what you say to him and mr arundel about diamonds i shall be extremely happy with his approbation to transfer my jewels to you and i do earnestly request he will consent to my desire i delivered them into his hands when i left london and i hope he will deliver them into yours god bless you my dear child  farewell letter ciii sir george revel to the countess of g bareges a heart so penetrated with your goodness as mine is cannot resist the impulse of gratitude though i fear there is a degree of presumption in thus repeating to you my thanks or supposing that it can be in any degree interesting to you to hear that i reached this place with less pain and fatigue than i expected and that i find myself much benefited since my arrival  i saw with the deepest concern a very sensible alteration in your health whilst your charity was employed in restoring mine the gentleman who will have the honor of waiting upon you with this letter dr ramsay of edenborough is returning to his own country having received his cure from these salutary waters let not this small but zealous effort offend you and pardon me if i have availed myself of the opportunity for tendering to you the advice of a person so eminent in his profession and so ardent to serve you you have been under providence the preserver of my life could i be the happy instrument of adding but one hour of health to yours how blessed should i be  i have the honor to be etc etc george revel  letter civ lady louisa arundel to the countess of g spring grove i am just returned from the church where before a crowd of spectators arundel and your happy daughter have joined their hands and interchanged their wedded vows before the altar the mild serenity of arundels countenance the pious harmony of mortlakes voice who performed the solemn office and the chearing looks of my father and lady jane supported me through the most awful moment of my life they tell me i acquitted myself with much propriety i hope the wife of arundel will ever do so  the first commands my husband lays upon me are to assure you of his most respectful devotion and i obey him with a heart that overflows with filial as with conjugal affection  i am etc etc louisa arundel p s my father writes to you we are setting off for arundel house    letter cv the earl to the countess of g i dispatch my servant le maitre with the joyful intelligence of our beloved daughters marriage on which event i congratulate with you most cordially and most affectionately  the week that arundel has passed here endears him to me above measure never did i contemplate a character more truly amiable and i flatter myself i am now received into his heart he did not give himself so wholly up to lover like dalliances as to exclude me from his attentions but on the contrary i had many hours in private with him and in these friendly conferences he opened to me the whole state of his affairs and it was with pleasure i found him perfect master of them and thoroughly disposed to confine himself to such a scheme of living as will for ever secure him from exceeding them i must do louisa the justice to say that it is her plan or rather yours which he has adopted in its full extent so solid an understanding as his will never depart from rules so essential to domestic comfort and so conformable to right reason  the bride and bridegroom set off in their postchaise for arundel house soon after the ceremony was over but i requested mr mortlake and lady jane to pass the day with me which they very charitably consented to and great comfort they afford me thereby for they are lovely people  i am now a solitary being upon earth till your friendly and forgiving heart shall receive me once again and for ever to that virtuous that blessed asylum i am hastening impatient to atone to you for all your cruel sufferings and to approve myself a fond and faithful husband for the rest of our days  every thing in your letter except the account of your health which heavily afflicts me meets my perfect approbation believe me on my word louisa i have taken a last leave of all the vanity and ambition of this world and devote myself to you and those endearing ties which wrap our hearts together i have at last got sight of tranquillity and made acquaintance with true happiness and peace of heart shall i forfeit their acquaintance never the reform you point out i have already put in motion and my agent has instructions to set my house in town to sale the same shall be done by this villa if you recommend it but as it was once a favorite with you i postpone its sentence till you give final judgment upon it i have no holdings toward it compared to the superior claim of my hereditary residence it is but as a mistress to a lawful wife and i shall throw it off without a sigh upon a close review of my domestics i find a parcel of spoilt puppies fit for little else but furnishing the hall of a ministers house and i have accordingly bequeathed them to the public not choosing to annex such lumber to a sober family upon a country establishment we will have no such fellows about us arundels servants have been all drilled by the late general and are in perfect discipline they are not a numerous corpse but they are well trained and move with the regularity of machines i offered him our town house if he had been disposed to have exchanged it for his own but he says it is too large and stately and will have nothing to do with it you would be charmed with the modest simplicity of their equipages he is fond of horses but does not seem to have that passion for the stable which young men of his age are so apt to have his ruling passion is that which sympathizes with our louisas a mutual love possesses them wholly as for our dear doting girl though you well know and have often trembled for the uncommon sensibility of her heart and its proneness to the tenderest of all affections still you can form no guess at the excessive fondness every look each word and every action express for the beloved of her soul i can speak only of what i have seen and doubtless she has put some check upon herself in my company what i have not seen can be only matter of conjecture and as her darlings sensations seem to the full as quick as her own i am apt to think for both their sakes i have not married them an hour too soon though our deeds are far from completed arundel would not take a guinea from my hands upon the marriage as he knew i did not overabound in cash i forced a thousand pounds upon louisa out of which she bought a few and but a few articles of apparel as for pinmoney she rejected the idea with abhorrence the rents of the estate which with the barony of g go to louisa in case i die without heir male i have turned over to arundel and the reform i have made and shall further make in my establishment will more than answer to that defalcation of my income so that you and i shall be more than rich enough for all the dignified enjoyments of life and liberally provided for the charities of it as for these beloved creatures i only fear they will be wealthy to a surfeit  i am only waiting for news of their safe arrival and then i shall set out by the way of margate and ostend between which there is a pacquetboat that passes under the emperors colors i shall have no one but a servant with me as i am prepared to find you in a very small house and beseech you not to hurry your spirits about preparations for me the humblest diet and the meanest lodging will be preferable to all earthly splendors in my estimation if you greet me with the smile of approbation and forgiveness and if i am so blessed as to find you recovering of that indisposition you complain of and which has raised a thousand anxious alarms in my bosom  le maitre has orders to meet me at ostend with an account of your health and what other commands you may please to give him in obedience to your wishes i have searched out some papers relative to baron polbergs negotiation in england which i flatter myself will be of use to the widows cause the imperial prime minister is a very noble gentleman and a lover of justice i dont despair of rendering madame polberg some services if her case is rightly stated  farewell letter cvi arundel to the earl of g arundel house i snatch a hasty moment to assure your lordship of our safe arrival and in early evening we were considerably less time upon the road than when we came up with you for our carriage was light and the postboys were peculiarly alert our dear louisa says she has not only felt no fatigue by the way but scarce believes she has performed a journey as her mind was not upon the road but with the happy companion who was seated by her side that charming glow so natural to her spirits has never abated even she herself was never half so beautiful as at this moment judge then what she is there is a luster in her eyes too dazzling to look upon what an angel have you bestowed upon me excuse the incoherence of my letter for i write to you a few words at a time as i can prevail with myself to take off my eyes from her enchanting person i am persuaded that even saint anthony could not have recollected himself in her presence how then should i keep any composure of thoughts or style whilst she is playing abou tthe room  we are alone and in the pictureroom where my venerable forefathers hang by the wall gravely contemplating their enamoured happy descendant and am i mistress of this house she says will these grave personages acknowledge me as one of their family am i an arundel  and then she makes a solemn obeisance to the old cardinal at the upper end of the room which you contend to be a titian what can i do with such a playful such an enchanting creature it is impossible to proceed  now she has run to the pianoforte and begins to sing oh heavens with what expression she is irresistible she masters all the senses at once what can i say my dear my generous lord all that is left of me is yours  farewell letter cvii lady louisa arundel to lady jane mortlake how do you my lady jane i hear your ladyship is just arrived and i conceive it to be an indispensable punctilio in country manners to enquire after my neighbors and put them to the trouble of a letter though they live at next door is the conscience of your beloved at peace within itself does he repine at the mischief he committed yesterday on the person of his friend or does he feel as if he had done no mischief at all me he has blessed beyond the bounds of human happiness and whilst i continue to feel and endeavor to deserve the blessing he has pronounced surely he will not repent of having pronounced it if unabating love fidelity and devotion to my arundel are good securities for the conduct of a wife to them i appeal without any fear of forfeiture  do not think i write to entice you from your house the very evening of your arrival i hope to morrow we shall dine together here at our oldfashioned hour in the mean time arundel and i are not tired of each others company oh my sweet jane my dear bridal sister how i long to embrace you and interchange with you those warm and grateful effusions of the heart which happiness like ours inspires had i been told before i married arundel that my love for him would admit of an increase i should have spurned at the idea now i find it had been truly said for he is ten times dearer to me than ever surely my affection is of a softer quality the fires that love had lighted in my heart now melt it and whilst my eyes dwell on his engaging form the tears instinctively flow from them and though i smile i weep he is now out of the room giving some orders to his servants else i could not write so composedly as i do tell me my jane are not your sensations like mine methinks they are for though you did not quite confess so much in words your looks were true interpreters of a most tender heart i have seen your animated features more alive but never did you look so charming as at spring grove  thank heaven i have not brought arundel a farthing for it is my glory to owe every thing to him what a wretch should i have been had i suffered him to deck me out with diamonds and now behold my generous mother wishes me to take here is i pause upon that offer for what are all such things to me the jewel of my husbands heart is all i covet to possess gross indeed would be my error were i so to disgrace myself with your disinterested example before me no jane i will be moderate in all things but my love and humble as simplicity itself there is nothing i more abhor than the idea of being a fine bride and i neither affect to be popular with the milliners nor to be made the subject of a puffing paragraph in a silly newspaper  but i am writing you a long letter and we are to meet tomorrow let me beg you will come an hour before dinner or at least send your dearer half to me for i want to consult his judgment there is one thorn in the filial heart of my beloved arundel which i would fain attempt to draw you will easily perceive that it points to his father that unfeeling envious parent has declared to lord g that he cannot think of entering this house which so late belonged to his deceased brother with whom he was at enmity and who totally overlooked him in his will now it occurs to me that i might write to this sir joseph and if mr mortlake does not dissuade from the undertaking and will help me in the execution of it a womans hand when armed with a weapon of his bestowing may strike a hard blow upon a callous heart and perhaps awaken it to some sense of shame at least if nothing better can be done apprize your dear husband of this and let him turn it in his thoughts but do not let him suppose i can think of sending any letter to sir joseph without showing it first to arundel and having his sanction for the attempt  farewell letter cviii the earl of g to lady louisa arundel i write to you from the house of madame polberg where i arrived the day before yesterday and had the satisfaction to find your dear mother in a fair way to recover though far from well she had begun to receive great benefit from the prescriptions of a doctor ramsay of edenborough who was then with her and who being on his return from bareges had been sent thither by sir george revel and i confess it was a mark of grateful attention to his benefactress which gave me a very pleasing impression  i will not awaken your sensibility by a description of our meeting further than to tell you in general words that it was as tender and affecting as my penitence and her forgiveness could make it i flatter myself the anguish of her mind is now healed and that she credits me for the sincerity of the professions i have made to her indeed i have both the evidence of her looks and the assurances of her physician to convince me of the very favorable alteration in her health and spirits in the short time i have been with her notwithstanding this i shall not have the happiness of bringing her home with me immediately as dr ramsay very earnestly advises her to winter in the south of france and i believe it will be decided for montpelier as soon as i can procure the proper passports of which there is no doubt  this unforeseen journey will oblige me to throw some trouble on your dear husband to whom i shall take the liberty of addressing certain powers and commissions for the regulation of my affairs at home particularly as to the sale of my house in grosvenor square and also of my villa at spring grove both which we have jointly determined to dispose of i must likewise desire him to forward the presentation to mr mortlakes donative which i left in the hands of my worthy agent mr green of lincolns inn  this is the compleatest solitude that can well be imagined it is early morning and yet i have had the melancholy curiosity to visit the ever memorable spot in the center of the adjoining wood where your beloved husband like heavens avenging minister struck pride and calumny to the ground it was a scene to call forth all the feelings of my heart conscience did not pass it over lightly i humbled myself to the earth and poured forth my thanksgivings to that merciful being who has vouchsafed to shower such blessings on his undeserving creature  farewell the editor to the reader candid and friendly reader these letters which i have presented to thee hoping they may serve to amuse an hour or two of thy leisure have been collected and arranged by me with some pains in the series as they now stand but when the principal correspondents were married and the two brides became neighbors letterwriting no longer was their concern they had other business upon their hands but though i cannot for this reason gratify thy curiosity with their epistolary correspondence yet if what thou have read of their past story should interest thee to be told of their succeeding prosperity in the married state i have the pleasure to inform thee that their domestic happiness has known no interruption  arundel and his charming lady are as much in love with each other as ever they have strictly adhered to that rational plan they set out with and are beloved and blessed by all their neighbors rich and poor by gradual improvements they have beautified their place to a very high degree from the superfluities of their income louisas gardens flowerhouses dairy and poultry are the admiration of the whole neighborhood arundels farmhouses cottages woods and grounds are the talk of the country and happy are those tenants and laborers who live under him he is a very respectable member of parliament but no partisan upon all great questions he is sure to be found in his place and nobody is better heard in the house but as to taking office i believe there are few things he is more adverse to lady louisa has brought him four fine children and if i am rightly informed his family consists of two boys and two girls  the reverend mr mortlake and lady jane are wedded to their delicious retirement and if there is happiness on earth this amiable couple is in the enjoyment of it the harmony of their friendship with the house of arundel has gone on without check or abatement for the hateful spirit of envy cannot sow discord in such hearts as they are possessed of they are adored by their parishioners and beloved by all who know them lady jane is the happy mother of five beautiful children who with the little arundels make a charming group of playfellows  the earl and countess of g after passing a winter in the south of france came home the best of friends and are retired to their country seat where they constantly reside except when they make a visit to their beloved connections at arundel house the mind of that amiable lady being healed of all its sorrows she has recovered her health and spirits and lord g declares he has at last discovered wherein true happiness consists  admiral john arundel having fought the good fight has laid himself up for the peace in a snug little tenement within a few miles of his nephew which he has fitted up as near as possible to the model of his ships cabin where he enjoys himself after his own humor it is a joyful holiday to all the children when he comes over to arundel house as there is no such playfellow in the world as uncle john  the gallant earl of s having cleared his paternal estate from encumbrances and put it into good condition with part of the sum he gained by his captures has married a miss dormer who is a very amiable and accomplished lady she is neice to old lady treville and the hon mrs dormer and will inherit their forturnes which are very considerable  sir joseph arundel has paid the debt of nature but not before he had seen his errors and reconciled himself to his worthy son by a visit to arundel house where he was received with great kindness and respect  sir george revel is at last returned to england not more perfectly healed of his wounds than by them he is in all respects a reformed man and has married a lady of a noble huguonot family in the south of france who promises to make him an excellent wife and to whom he seems very truly attached  and now kind reader if thou will allow a spare corner on thy shelf for these little volumes and not throw them by with disdain i hope they will repay thy courtesy some rainy evening when a trifling book may take its turn for want of better company or peradventure they may give thee a lift up a hill or through the sands when thy chaise is slowly dragged by a pair of weary posthorses horses and thy mind without something to feed upon would perchance be as weary as the beasts that draw thee at any time or in any temper though they may only lull thee into a placid nap so they amuse thy fancy and not offend thy morals trust me there does not live a man who will more truly rejoice to please thee than  thy devoted friend and servant r
