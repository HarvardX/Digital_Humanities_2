opposite burlingtonhouse piccadilly mdccxcix  to the reader the following tragedy which is now offered to the public from the pen of richard glover esquire author of leonidas is a sequel to the medea which has been performed at the theater royal drury lane with the greatest applause this piece was presented by him many years previous to his death to the celebrated mrs yates who passed the highest encomiums upon it but owing to the grandeur of the scenery and the expense required to bring it forward it was altogether laid aside and it has since that period been offered to the managers of both theaters who still have the same objection it is therefore only necessary to add that the public well knowing the authors talents have it in their power to judge of its merits or defects  july

wrinkling brow  melampus no deity am i but one of earths degenerate sons like thee  orontes then dare thou dally with a kings impatience  melampus why rather dally with my own resentment which should chastise ingratitude and pride  orontes am i orontes do adoring vassals do princes crowd to thrust their splendid heads beneath my feet where am i  melampus in my power  orontes thou at my smile no transport did betray nor fear my frown  melampus thou look around in vain thy base adoring homagers are fled fled from the danger which my arm withstood they left their idol to the lions paw and now

to discover a trace of merit in the man i saved if thou have virtues sleeping in thy bosom attend with patience while i rouse their languor  orontes in admiration i suspend my voice  melampus to be a man and know himself is all man can attain whoever aspires to more is less than brute the lion whom i slew had he addressed me with his smarting paw and i extracted thence an irksome thorn would with mute thanks have licked my helpful hand thou just redeemed from deaths voracious maw did with rude insult thy protector greet does not that blood which trickles down thy arm denote thee frail this

within my tortured heart ye ramparts inaccessible which hold my hopes and joys ah never never more through your enchanted portals must i pass to view the queen of beauty o my friend to me the pomp of royalty is tedious the high repast is tasteless gems are saint persumes disgustful softest music harsh often as our god ascends his eastern hill and dips in darkness his returning wheels i sit and weep at these forbidden gates  melampus who is this fair one  orontes fair that ruling power whose beams yet tinge the shadowy plumes of evening in his meridian splendor is less bright the snowy luster of the moon less fair  melampus now if by wily stratagem or force i may assist thee   orontes will thou gallant stranger  melampus i will  orontes then swear forgive forgive my weakness how can i doubt thee  melampus on my sword i swear by every tie of honor and of truth   orontes that thou this high achievement wilt attempt that should this magic threshold yield thee passage thou will apply

the sun persormd his annual course since i was seated at a social feast since griefassuaging music lulled my ear and in my view the cheerful dance inspired since i have stretched me on no soster couch than earths cold surface or the unquiet deck with nights unfriendly moisture to contend with clamorous tempests and the beating rain no other pillow than some pointed crag beside that waters melancholy fall to broken slumber shall invite my head  orontes unequalled hardships livst thou to relate them will thou be still offended if a prince benignly try to sathom thy distress and raise thy head to comfort  melampus rest content my sword is thine my sorrow mine alone  orontes enough  madauces enough indeed of time is wasted prince thou do wnat some salutary hand we will transport thee

doomed to woe what is become of this unhappy king  madauces snatched from our sight by necromantic power now let us try what spot secure and tranquil this wilderness may yield us i will stand a watchful guardian over thy head to wave this awful rod and meditate some charm which may in silence bind the restless throat of nights shrill bird the lion of his rage the fell hyaena of her craft

the spirit on the battlement night is collecting all her sable skirts to fly the approaching dawn ye loitring nymphs hear from your caves your mountains woods and streams with awe receive the signal of my voice for preparation while in sounds of horror i rouse the victim from his rocky pillow illguided wanderer whose adventurous steps have passed these lonely confines did thou hope to rest concealed from me thy evil genius awake the raven with funcreal notes the screeching inmate of the moulderd oak the tigers yell invite thee to despair while my infernal cries their discord aid to pierce with dread thy enterprising soul which shall to vultures leave thy mangled frame in sight of these impenetrable walls  scene iv the spirit vanishes melampus and madauces melampus malignant voice thy threatnings i desy  madauces there spoke my hero like himself  melampus why surely thou could not think a phantom of the night could shake my longtryd firmness no madauces i sear no other than the direful image within me borne and planted on my heart all else apparclld in the blackest terrors the monsters brood the necromancers spell whatever the name of demogorgon draws from plutos borders i can face unmoved thou then whose mind delibrate age and science have clothed in wisdom give thy last instruction and my swift sword shall execute thy counsel  the voice of a nymph from behind the scene whence is this wanderer who defiles our groves with foul contagion from his perjured breath  second voice it is iolchian jason who forsworn betrayed his love the weak ungrateful jason who for creusa creons heir abandoned the wise medea offspring of the sun  third voice ye woods ye rocks ye hollowwinding shores ye caverns found the perjuries of jason  melampus i am revealed my echoed name disturbs the nymphs and fills their solitude with horror  madauces it is the cry of demons to consound thy resolution  melampus they declare me perjured speak they not truth madauces i am jason that impious salseone i betrayed medea who saved me from disnonour who subdued the colchian monsters blessed my toils with love and crowned my triumphs with the golden fleece i slew my children by her srantic hand oh my poor slaughtered boys your fathers falsehood gave birth to madness which destroyed you both  madauces aid not thy soes  melampus the bloody act was mine ye fiends divulge my parricide and treason blast with your taunting breath my strength my courage then rouse the desert that some tigers bowels may sepulcher my sorrow and my shame  madauces do thou forget the engagement to orontes does thy performance slacken  melampus no direct me to rash on danger  madauces summon thy attention last night when all was silent in the skies the moon then smiling on me i invoked and charmed a willing spirit from her orb by his fair guidance over the mead i plucked a flower which opens to her mystic beams and shuts its bosom in the blaze of day nine drops of precious moisture from this flower have blessed with safety thy anointed spear whose touch unbarring those enchanted gates from magic durance shall protect thy body and visionary forms of peril quell the rest thy manly conduct must accomplish now grasp the spear nor quit thy sinewy hold this once forsaken leaves thee to perdition  the voice of a fiend behind the scene how can the guilty prosper  second voice from his hand enervated by crimes the sword shall fall  third voice his spear shall break his corselet be unbracd the faithless heart no buckler shall defend  melampus fiends do you brave me o victorious deeds which heretofore have dignified my arm now rise in thought and animate my bosom while rending glory from the front of horror i add new luster to your splendid roll  scene v melampus and madauces melampus with his spear strikes the gates which open with a harsh sound and discover a centaur brandishing a mace and standing across the entrance melampus attacks the centaur who at the touch of the spear instantly vanishes the whole wall disappears at the same time and discovers a second wall and gate madauces now have thou proved the virtues of thy spear  melampus and will essay its energy again  he strikes the second gate which disappears with the whole wall leaving in view a craggy rock with a torrent of water down the middle and a hydra and griffin on the summit all vanish at the touch of the spear a third wall appears with a gulf of fire before it the fire is filled with fiends and a gigantic figure of death shaking a dart is planted between the gulf and the gate madauces these are illusive images of danger which perseverance will dissolve to air  scene vi melampus and madauces melampus strikes the figure of death which sinks with the fire melampus thus far successful i will try the temper of this third portal do thou see madauces yon cyclops rolling his presumptuous orb which glares defiance from his spacious front more lofty than the battlement by mars i will have entrance monster  the gate opening spontaneously admits melampus and is immediately shut against madauces scene vii madauces stay melampus i am excluded to a real so no airy spectre is he now exposed from me no succor can he find but prayers thou rising god whose comprehensive eye now over the bright horizon beams afresh and views the bravest of mankind in peril resent no longer thy medeas wrong compassionate the penitential jason and with the swiftness of thy rays direct his rapid javelin to the monsters heart looking attentively as on some distant object my eyes be steady luminous in gold dropped through the unclosing portals of the east a cloud low waving skims along the vale the fleecy radiance opens two bright forms descend and hither point their gliding course  scene viii madauces and two spirits one personating the god of riches the other hebe goddess of youth first spirit old colchian once attendant on medea sprung from that god who bursting from the east heard from his chariot thy ascending voice have thou forgot when jason pledged his faith and by her love obtained the golden fleece thou from her native phasis to the walls of treacherous corinth did her wandrings share thou best can witness to her grief and wrongs when jason lest her in a foreign clime forlorn unshelterd and espoused creusa thou saw the blood congenial with the sun flow from her infants by a mothers frenzy for guilty jason do thou lift thy voice the indignant god rejects the unseemly prayer by me delivers his sublime behests that thou assist his vengeance  madauces he may pierce this aged bosom with consuming rays and he will find it to medea true nor less to that poor penitent her husband  first spirit hear thy reward to animate thy duty i am the god of riches bliss of age come and behold the diamond emblaze my gorgeous hall the emerald the topaz the ruby shoot their mingling beams around  hebe sings trochaics hebe i of youth am goddess i can smooth a wrinkled cheek go possess unbounded treasure i will then thy prime renew  madauces i fathom now the impotent device for me your thinspun magic do you spread audacious demons under sacred forms of messengers from him who lights the world had thou to give with that infernal hand to plutus the treasures boasted by thy lying tongue could thou rekindle fire in icy veins to hebe thus should a look command you back to hell  the spirits vanish scene ix madauces what hollow sound beneath me gods i hear a subterraneous groan portending death the earth rocks under my supplanted feet  scene x after a horrible sound under the stage violent and repeated thunder and lightning above the battlements of the castle totter and fall the third wall disappears and discovers a beautiful garden with a magnificent palace madauces melampus prostrate on the ground with his spear and shield held fast orontes bending over him orontes my brave protector on the earth oh rise rise to a kings embraces and support  melampus rising orontes  madauces to melampus art thou safe  melampus i am my friend and do thou live orontes let me press thee to my transported bosom quick relate what fortune placed thee here  orontes thou first unfold thy wondrous acts which threw these ramparts down  madauces nor kill my age melampus with impatience  melampus two gates i forced admitted through the last ere yet beyond the entrance i could plant my feet secure impenetrable clouds enwrappd my forehead and a steep descent at once drew downward my reluctant steps compelled to trace a caverns black abyss three gorgon specter at the extremest depth rose from the gaping mould with livid brands whose glimmering sulphur on the clammy roof and sides presented to my sickening sight a hateful brood distilling poison round  orontes what has he suffered  madauces what surmounted hear  melampus amid this baleful scene a hideous voice roared through the dim vacuity i turned when lo the enormous cyclops striding down lancd with impatient rage his pointed beam which over my shoulder inoffensive flew then with extended arms and eager pace advanced to grasp me blindly driven by fury and my kind fortune on my spear he rushed i held it firm and felt the grating blade pierce his tough breast and vibrate in his heart whose groan redoubled horror through the cave  orontes what next  melampus with peals of subterraneous thunder as from her center heaved the earth convulsed and shook me prostrate  madauces such as now we found thee  melampus the swift transition to delights like these from earths cold entrails and unwholesome vapors to this pure sky and these delicious bowers i mark with wonder uninformd by knowledge  orontes my history alas is brief and sad by some strange power transported from the spot where last you saw me sainting i awoke beneath an arbours melancholy roof with nightshade clad with monumental yew and loathsome plants the foes to life and joy  melampus but thou were wounded by the lions claw  orontes my wound was healed a ghastly goblin stood full in my view a sentinel from hell all exclamations to discharge my grief even the complaints of disappointed love the cruel fiend denied me and with scorn mocked my imperial person when i mourned my black reverse from boundless power to thraldom when on the earth outstretchd thy limbs appeared how i was suffered to approach i know not nor yet how long in sreedom may continue to grace thy merit with a monarchs praise  melampus give none to me that recompense is due to him alone my counselor and guardian  orontes this poor old man what succor could he yield to thee who doubtless spring from earliest kings if not by some divinity produced  melampus shortsighted prince unexercisd in knowledge learn that of all endowments heaven bestows its richest boon is wisdom far excelling the flame of courage and the nerves of strength in me his wisdom triumphs he directs my sword and javelin had i gods for parents herculean vigor and the strength of atlas without this sage and venerable man i were inferior to the meanest reptile which crawls in darkness through a dungeons slime he too is righteous  his unerring heart no selfreproach torments  his tranquil thoughts no saddning care disquiets  but for me  madauces to melampus leaning upon him be wise melampus  melampus wisdom fled with virtue  orontes i see the demon  look he glares upon me assist me hero  shield me from these torments  madauces he cannot help thee  orontes to melampus whence this sudden change these agitations which embitter joy and blot thy luster  madauces question him no further thy presence now but irritates his pain  orontes i must retire the beckning fiend forbids my longer stay  scene xi madauces and melampus cassandane unseen by them appears in a grove cassandane appointed here i take my stand unseen  melampus my friend my second father whose wisdom guides me and whose art desends i proved the wonders of thy magic dew

sorcery of anguish and disenchant the bosom from despair that black magician in the mind  cassandane oh words to penetrate a marble heart  madauces my son why drops that sorrow to deform thy glory  melampus when i reflect how heaven and nature framed me with nerves and spirit for the hardiest toils with qualities endud me to secure felicity and praise then how my folly such gifts perverting to the lowest depths of misery has plunged me  i must weep  my very deeds this day excite distraction  madauces think where thou art  melampus where conquest gives me rule what shall control my anguish but thy friendship  madauces believe me half thy toils are yet to come  melampus then i revive  madauces remember thy engagement  melampus i do and will perform  madauces prepare and sollow  melampus i am prepared behold my javelin safe and in fresh perils shall my soul exult though like alcides i descend to hell or mix in combat with a giant race from those derived who shook the towers of jove  scene xii cassandane miraculous in valor more in grief to court new dangers does thy spirit swell yet could thy tongue from agony of heart ask if no plant affords some precious juice which might dispel the sorcery of anguish and disenchant the bosom from despair that black magician in the mind alas whoever thou art whatever be thy fault i will report thee in the words of pity thy own sad strain will mitigate resentment at thy intrusion to this seat of wonders which awe my mind and every sense confound  scene xiii cassandane and the genius of caucasus the genius sings cretics and trochaics to thy woes add not fear thou have aided her thou love serving her thou shall reap consolation and redress  cassandane thou known melodious comforter whose voice procured my entrance and in music smoothed the paths of terror do i hear again thy accents melt thou come not sure deputed to keep me longer absent from her sight i have performed the service she enjoined alone amid these miracles i shudder ah reconduct me to her guardian breast  she returns to the palace the spirit singing before her then vanishing at the gate as she enters end of the second act act iii scene i madauces and melampus madauces my art informs me that the utmost efforts of violence are tried less obvious mischief and thence more dangerous threatens wary conduct must now succeed to valor all around is dressed in soft delusion to dissolve the firmest heart in languor every bird tunes to deceitful melody his throat the odorous gales in whispers and the rills diffuse in warbles heartentrancing pleasures each fragrant myrtle may conceal a fiend and fate sit lurking in perfidious flowers  melampus let me attempt the palace  madauces something new and strange awaits thee i can pass no further my steps some hand invisible repels thou know how far that weapon can befriend thee but with internal fences may they prove like adamant against the power of woman secure thy heart the very sorm of beauty much more of yielding beauty armed with craft subdues the mighty and deceives the wise most frail least guarded when oppressed by sadness should that accustomed visitant approach thee just on the close of action oh endure till my return endure thy heavy thoughts but shun relief from beautys proffered joys or thou art lost  melampus than adamant more strong to fence my heart thy counsels i retain  madauces a power to mine superior drives me hence and stops my frozen tongue  scene ii melampus my friend is gone i stand alone this tried defense i hold and on my single conduct must rely now for the palace  scene iii melampus a large scroll inscribed with letters of fire appears in the air melampus vision strange and new i will confront thee with a stedsast eye and give those characters of fire a voice he reads retreat in safety ere that direful gate is thrown abroad thy enterprise pursued will end in cureless torment to thy mind he speaks that mind in torment exercised so long defies the menace and disdains retreat out of my way thou obsiacle of air he brandishes his spear and the scroll vanishes the palace is disclosed  the enchantress comes that rod denotes her potent arm that veil oershades a visage hateful to the sun yet majesty sustains her awful port and not unlike divinity she moves  scene iv melampus and the enchantress enchantress presumptuous man what art thou who have dared invade my barrier and molest my peace  melampus thou do behold thy conqueror proud woman that knowledge may suffice thee  enchantress art thou pure of blameless thoughts and unpolluted truth have thou never traced the devious paths of frailty they only whose unviolated faith no perjuries have stained can sojourn here for them alone these chaste abodes reveal their hidden treasures these harmonious choirs for them alone elysian music chaunt them to refreshing banks these fountains call with flowery odours virtuous toils to cheer  melampus whence is thy right to question me enchantress who do prosane the sanctity of virtue in her bright garb infernal arts to mask pure or impure commissioned i appear from sacred themis to redress the wronged whatever i am thy monsters i could tame thy losty bulwarks mix with empty air and dissipate their visionary guard  enchantress waving her wand while she is speaking see thou this gloom which overcasts the sky or feelst this sudden chilness in the air the myrtles wither and the roses fade at thy illboding sight reply who art thou death is ascending from his iron cell his arms are spread abroad even now they raise his house of terrors to enclose thee round yet will thou answer  the scene changes to the inside of a sepulcher melampus unappalld i stand and spurn this salse creation of thy spells in justice strong a victors right i claim and rather question thee hells impious agent why thou in base captivity retainst a hapless princess and this nations lord why grievst his bosom

thee thou prodigy of virtues wove with errors thou bear thy foc within thee not the touch of that anointed staff can there avail there is no plant affords the precious juice which may dispel the sorcery of anguish or disenchant the bosom from despair that black magician in the mind  melampus my words my own reflcctions has she leagued against me what then thou themis art my sovereign judge save one besides before whose injured feet my penitential spirit sues to break at these last words the enchantress turns aside and weeps but will thou power of equity permit the artifice of magic to assume thy holy semblance and arraign thy champion when scorning safety i refuse no hardship which may present me to the eye of mercy wretch as i am less hateful and deformed no no thou will not in thy righteous service i challenge heavens support enchantress hear art thou confounded then the gods are present does thy heart labor sorceress with sighs over thy defeated cruelty and art release the monarch and his captive princess nor to an outrage on thy sex provoke me  enchantress do thou defy me still  melampus i do by themis  she stamps on the ground and waves her wand a figure representing fame ascends bearing a mirror a hand in the air holds a taper enchantress bold as thou art by that infernal taper dare thou survey this mirror  melampus yes i dare and thou in dread this weapon may survey which braves the keenest rancour of thy charms  enchantress vain man that weapon has no other gift than to protect the body to the mind there is no guard but innocence draw nigh consider well in order as they rise these melancholy portraitures of truth reviving passed but sorrowful events this is iolcos where that first of vessels proud argo deepens with the weight of heroes sent to reclaim the golden fleece from colchis around their bark the wondering nereids float fame flies before them bounding over the surge see where they pass the euxines clashing jaws and there on colchis rest their toiling oars why do thou start  melampus i start  with admiration  the figure of fame sinks a second representing the god of love rises with a mirror enchantress lo here more lovely than his native tempe the youth who leads the argonautic band leaps to the shore a winged troop of loves around his head their purple torches wave while juno nuptial goddess looks from heaven and over his graces sheds celestial light him soon behold that trembling maid accosts the colors vary on her virgin cheek entranced she gazes credulous she hears her plighted vows her love to his she joins her aiding magic to his warlike arm her and the golden fleece a double prize he bears away there weeping from his deek behold her take an everlasting leave of friends of parents of her native dwelling to him entrusting all incurious man thou do not ask their names  melampus their names  enchantress that virgin was once the wise medea he is jason the brave the beauteous allsurpassing jason  melampus detested name  enchantress look up another scene requires thy notice the figure of love sinks a third representing time rises with a mirror there his fathers house receives them juno looks from heaven again to bless their nuptial bed  now view two children  fruit of his love  on her maternal lap note their disporting innocence he casts a tender look contentment seems to reign when all impairing time dissolves the ties of constancy and truth he quits iolcos see him in corinth wedding creons daughter why gush those sorrows from thy flooded eyes why burst those notes of anguish from thy soul why do thou rivet with convulsive grasp those hands together yet in deeper tones of heartfelt anguish must that bosom sound those eyes be deluged with a stronger tide those hands in sharper agony be wrung the figure of time sinks a fury ascends with a mirror look where to madness hurried by the furies the lost medea draws the murderous blade fresh from the reking bowels of her children melampus in consternation and horror lets fall his shield and spear she instantly lays her wand on his head he sinks down in a trance she throws herself upon him oh jason jason o ye faint remains of all which nature formed in man most lovely how is that visage worn how changed by care pale pale my hero is that seat of graces and all its luster dead alas sad ruin thou know not who enfolds thee and this kiss given in despite of junos stern command thou do not feel  thou sleepst  to me thou owst that rest so long forbidden to thy brow thy lance deserted gave thee to my wand that wand has saved thee thy medeas love once more has saved thee and denied access to swift distraction hovering over thy brain thunder i hear thee chiding goddess she rises yet no longer in these sepulchral shadows shall he lie
