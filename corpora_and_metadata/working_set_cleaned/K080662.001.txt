the natural history of british birds  the natural history of british birds or a selection of the most rare beautiful and interesting birds which inhabit this country the descriptions from the systema naturae of linnaeus with general observations either original or collected from the latest and most esteemed english ornithologists and illustrated with figures drawn engraved and colored from fine and living specimens  by e donovan f l s  in five volumes vol i  london printed for the author and for f and c rivington no    st pauls churchyard       advertisement this work being now completed we conceive our engagement with the subscribers is in every respect fulfilled and that it only remains to embrace this opportunity to repeat our thanks for their favors and in particular for the candor with which the supplementary part has been received  but in submitting the work to the public in general as an illustration of an important branch of british zoology it is incumbent on us to state briefly the nature and extent of the undertaking the information it contains and its peculiar advantages in this retrospective survey of the work we must advert to our former observations some similar remarks appeared at the conclusion of the fourth volume and we retrace those as they immediately relate to the outline of our design  ornithology as a science has undergone various alterations and improvements different authors have submitted their systems to the world and each has found its admirers and opponents nor has the unrivalled genius of linnaeus devised an arrangement in which those opposite opinions may be reconciled on the importance of ornithology in the great scale of animated nature no difference of opinion can prevail the beauty and elegance of the feathered race their pleasing and various melody their sagacity and tractable manners has been admired in every age and country and their unerring economy and instinct has ever engaged the attention of the moral philosopher the birds of this country are of plainer colors than those of warmer climates but they are not less interesting to the english naturalist if in some instances their beauty has little claim to our notice in others it excites our admiration and to the intelligent mind their beauty their singularities peculiar manners and economy are equally engaging they are the source of information and improvement to the practical ornithologist and of rational and agreeable amusement to every common observer of nature  at the commencement of this work it was our intention to form a complete history of british ornithology and to include figures of all the known birds amounting to more than two hundred and fifty species but we have since conceived it would be advisable to select only the more beautiful birds in addition to those which are interesting to the naturalist for a considerable number of the british species are so well known that their history would be tedious and the figures unnecessary in a work professedly designed to treat of the most remarkable species only not that we have entirely overlooked the common birds in several instances some of these are introduced also to point out their singular habits of life and other interesting peculiarities but in general we have endeavored to form an instructive as well as amusing illustration of this department of natural history  it will perhaps be contended that a complete collection of figures and descriptions of all the british birds would be more acceptable than any partial selection however comprehensive we admit the propriety of this objection but must observe that such addition would considerably increase the expense to the purchaser and scarcely contribute to his information on the other hand this work in its present limits may assist the researches of the uninformed naturalist and tend to promote a deeper and more extensive enquiry into this branch of science it embraces in one view the whole of those british birds that are scarcely known and of which the inquisitive reader under many circumstances may be desirous of information we have omitted many of those birds which constantly inhabit this country but have included all local species and in particular those whose haunts and breeding places are difficult of access and the birds in consequence little known the extensive marshes and lowlands in some parts of the kingdom are the retreats and breeding places of certain species those solitary kinds which retire to the depths and gloomy recesses of forests are rarely observed and many of those which seek the open plain for security elude our vigilance and are not better known but the rarest of the local kinds are of the rapacious and gallinaceous tribes which never leave their dreary solitudes their wilds and barren mountains in the north to visit the southern parts of great britain the migratory birds are numerous and include many well known species with others that are uncommonly scarce we have taken an extensive variety of the beautiful land birds that resort to this country occasionally from the south of europe and of the aquatic or webfooted tribe that are driven by the severity of the winter in the arctic regions to seek shelter on our shores history and tradition inform us of other birds that formerly inhabited these kingdoms but are now extirpated and these form an interesting sequel to this selection we cannot vindicate the propriety of introducing naturalized exotic species amongst these though they are arranged by our naturalists in the british ornithology and in some instances we have followed their authority for the sake of embellishment and variety  in the course of publication we have been fortunate in procuring specimens of many uncommon birds among the most remarkable are the rosecoloured ouzel roller little bittern waxen chatterer black woodpecker and in particular that rare and almost unknown species the wood chat  the rednecked grebe dartford warbler dusky lark longlegged plover egret and cock of the wood we could enumerate many other species highly important to the uninformed naturalist but we refer our readers for the general detail to the complete systematic arrangement annexed to this advertisement  in this systematic arrangement we have followed the systema naturae of linnaeus though we totally dissent from the opinion of that celebrated naturalist in his primary divisions of ornithology in every system the birds which inhabit the land only are separated from such as frequent the water this appears to be a natural method of forming two principal divisions of ornithology it was adopted by ray and approved by pennant and latham in the linnaean system those which inhabit the water are separated from the rest but the land birds are divided into two parts and the water birds are placed between them to avoid confusion we have adhered to this arrangement but we have also placed an index in the manner of pennant and latham at the conclusion of each volume  having endeavored to explain the nature and extent of this undertaking we submit the whole to the candor of the public and though not indifferent to the flattering testimony of approbation it has received in the course of five years publication we entreat indulgence for whatever may be thought exceptionable either in the outline of our undertaking the selection of species or the manner in which they are illustrated to our subscribers we shall not presume to address any apology as their opinion must be already decided the progressive manner in which the work has appeared has afforded every opportunity for critical examination for detecting error or discovering merit and we trust their continued patronage is some criterion of their approbation and of the general utility of our design  systematic arrangement of select british birds order i accipitres includes the falcon owl and shrike or butcher bird  falcon

known at that time in several parts of europe though unknown in britain more than a century after aldrovandus      it was included in a history of the birds of germany by j l frisch but even at that time was so rare with us that it was scarcely ascertained to be a native of britain and albin who seems to have possessed some knowledge of birds determines it as a native only on the authority of the information he received from others his history of birds was published in      therein he gives a figure of the male bird and says in the descriptions annexed these two birds male and female i bought of mr bland on tower hill who told me he had them from jutland i have been since informed by sir robert abdy that they are found in the saltmarshes in essex and by others that they are likewise in the fens in lincolnshire  he also observes that it receives the name beardmanica from the black tuft resembling a picked beard  edwards g edwardss not hist of birds vol     to london      etc refers it to the tribe of butcherbirds under the title of lanius minimus least butcherbird but linnaeus in his systema naturae reduced it to the parus genus and late writers have also determined it to the same family  its length from the tip of the bill to the end of the tail is six inches and a quarter the bill is thick and of a bright yellow color but fades immediately when the bird dies in the female it is rather dusky and the head which is of a fine gray in the male is of a brownish rust color spotted with black in the female indeed the female is immediately distinguished by the plainness of her plumage it neither possessing the beautiful purple color on the breast or the black tufts on the throat which characterizes the male the ventfeathers of the male are pale black of the female light brown as are the other parts of the belly  pennant in the british zoology says this species is found in the marshes near london we have seen it near gloucester it is also frequent among the great tracts of reeds near cowbit in lincolnshire where i suspect they breed  latham in his general synopsis  these birds are found in england but have hitherto been observed only in marshy situations where reeds grow on the seeds of which it feeds as well as small insects both of which have been found in their stomachs they are pretty frequent and in not inconsiderable quantities in the marshes among the reeds between erith and london and are again met with in suchlike places near gloucester as well as among the great tracts of reeds near cowbit in lincolnshire in all these places i make no doubt of their breeding as i know that they stay in the firstnamed parts the whole year the nest is not known for certain but i have seen one which was composed of very soft downy materials suspended between three reeds drawn together thought to be the work of that bird  they are also common in denmark and buffon supposes that a pair of these having escaped from the cage of the countess of albemarle have founded this colony in england this may have been the case in respect to those of erith being on the borders of the thames but will not so well account for their being elsewhere and i am inclined to think that they are indigenous to us and have been so ab origin and that it is merely owing to their frequenting such places only where the reeds grow that they have been so little known for as those birds never go farther than a few yards from the beds the reedbeds frequently cover many acres of ground these grow in the water so as to be overflowed at every tide and few persons ever go near them except in the time of cutting which they do in boats as except at very low tides one can scarce set a footstep within their boundaries  they have stood a greater chance which has really happened of not being earlier observed  kramer says the nest is built among the willows and is of the shape of a purse made of soft downy materials such as the down of the greater catstail typha latifolia lin  or that of the asp populus tremula lin  hanging the nest on a branch  what new light mr latham could throw on this subject is given in the supplement published in the year       i

part of the country evidently deserves for the singular beauty of its plumage the first place in a collection of interesting british birds it is a species however not merely confined to this kingdom but generally diffused over the greater part of the continent of europe  among the foreign birds which are referred to this genus are several species eminently distinguished for their rich and elegant coloring but the european jay is certainly superior in this particular to many exotics of the same family  its habits are known in a great degree to resemble those of the magpie which also belongs to the same genus it will devour with avidity cherries gooseberries raspberries or other fruits but in autumn and winter it feeds on acorns whence it long since derived the name pica glandaria it is not destitute of a carnivorous appetite as it frequently combats and devours small birds it also feeds on worms and insects  ablin in plate    vol   very accurately describes the jay he took his figure from which nearly corresponds with our specimen  its length from the point of the bill to the end of the tail was fourteen inches its breadth when the wings were extended twentyone inches and an half its weight seven ounces the bill dark ash color inclining to black strong near an inch and an half long the tongue black thin pellucid and cloven at the tip the irides of the eyes white near on the lower chap of the bill are two black spots on each side one the chin and lower part of the belly whitish else the breast and belly are of a mixed cinereous and red the rump above is white the back red with a mixture of blue the feathers on the crown of the head variegated with black and white  the sails of the wings are in number twenty of which the first is shorter by half than the second the fourth the longest being by measure six inches and a quarter the first or outermost is black the bottom or lower part white which is proper to it alone the six next following have their exterior vanes of an ash color the three next likewise but more obscure and mingled with blue being also marked toward their bottom with transverse black and white strokes the five succeeding have their exterior vanes half white half black viz the lower half white the upper black but so that each extremity of the white is terminated with blue the sixteenth in place of the white of the four precedent has transverse blue black and white spots the seventeenth is black having one or two blue spots the eighteenth is black with some little red the nineteenth red with the tip black the under sides of all the feathers of the wing are of a dark or dusky color the covertfeathers of the fifteen exterior sails are very beautiful being variegated or chequered with black white and lovely shining blue lines the rest of the covertfeathers being black  the tail is six inches and a quarter long consisting of twelve feathers wholly black except toward their roots under the rump there is something of a blue mingled with cinereous  the feet and toes are of a ferruginous dusky color the middle toe is the longest the outmost is equal to the back toe the lower joint of the outmost toe is joined to the middlemost the back claw is the greatest  the guts are twentyfour inches long the blind guts but half an inch it has a gall and a long spleen the stomach or gizzard not very fleshy and having its echinus wherein were found acorns etc  he adds the female differs little or nothing from the male either in bigness or color so that it is very difficult to know them asunder but after the publication of his first volume of birds he rectifies this error in a supplement which is prefixed to the work the following observations says he i received from dr derham after the descriptions were printed he has observed the cock jay plate    vol   to be somewhat bigger than the hen the feathers on the head to be blacker the stripes longer and the black and blue colors more elegant in the cock than in the hen  jays generally build in woods preferring a situation near the skirts the nest is composed of fibrous roots and young twigs erected on a base of several large sticks and is placed on the top of a thornbush or other underwood or between the first branches of low decayed trees the female lays five or six eggs of the size of a pigeons of a cinereous olive color marked with very pale brown spots the young jays remain with their parents till the next spring and at the pairing time they each choose his mate to propagate their future progeny  it is a restless and very quarrelsome bird makes a harsh chattering and screaming noise and is ever at variance not only with its own species but with every other inhabitant of the forest when deprived of liberty it may be taught to imitate the human voice but the original appearance of its plumage is so altered by confinement as scarcely to retain any of the beautiful colors which are so eminently conspicuous in the wild state  it is a native of denmark and of russia of scotland and of england but does not frequent the islands adjacent  latham says the jay i believe is not spread so far as many others of the genus as we do not hear of its inhabiting further south than italy and greece  this species is common in the woods both of russia and siberia but none beyond the lena arct zool  georgi mentions it as frequenting the lake baikal and

lancashire and derbyshire in those parts of the kingdom it is not very frequent in every other it is extremely rare  it is unnecessary for us to describe the many varieties that are known of this species in england the colors of its plumage varies considerably at different seasons of the year but such as are natives of foreign countries are again so dissimilar to ours that different authors have alternately described them as varieties or new species  the bird that latham describes was white on the outer web of the exterior tail feather the two exterior tail feathers of willoughbys bird was marked with white and on the contrary we have a specimen which does not exhibit the least trace of white on either the upper tail coverts are black and white mixed in some specimens in others they are wholly black and le gobemouche noir of brisson which is only another variety differs in having a mixture of gray on the upper parts the thighs brown and white and three of the exterior tail feathers white on the margins  a more pleasing variety than either is found in lorraine and brie it corresponds in size with those found in england but the white of the breast which terminates under the cheeks in the latter passes quite round the neck like a collar in the former this variety is called by buffon le gobemouche noir a collier hist des ois   p   0 pl    f     the plumage of the female is brown in those parts where the male is black it has no white on the forehead the white spot on the wing is more obscure and the under parts of the body is of a dusky white the male possesses only the full black during the summer as that season declines its plumage alters and it gradually assumes so perfectly the appearance of the female that he cannot be distinguished from her  the nest is usually built in the hole of a tree not very near the ground it is composed of fibers mixed with moss and contains six eggs it feeds on insects   plate xxiii sterna hirundo common tern anseres bill

tufts of rushes grass or moss near the water side they lay three or four eggs about an inch and three quarters in length of a dull olive color marked with irregular black spots and sprinkled with specks of an obscure brown in june the young birds are hatched in july and quit the nest soon after  they feed on small fish and water insects are very clamorous and daring and during the time of incubation will dart on any person who may pass by their nest though they should neither provoke nor disturb them  it appears to have all the actions over the water which the swallow has on land skimming and describing vast circuits over the surface of the waves when seeking its prey diving with intrepidity the instant it discovers it and instantly appearing again on the wing with the fish in its mouth notwithstanding the affinity of its actions with those of the swallow pennant in the british zoology has altered the name to tern a name he observes in a note these birds are known by in the north of england and which we substitute instead of the old compound one of seaswallow which was given them on account of their forked tails   plate xxiv sturnus cinclus waterouzel passeres bill conic
