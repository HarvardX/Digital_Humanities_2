poetae interdum urbani parcentis viribus atque extenuantis eas consulto hor advertisement the essay on man was intended to have been comprised in four books  the first of which the author has given us under that title in four epistles the second was to have consisted of the same number   of the extent and limits of human reason   of those arts and sciences and of the parts of them which are useful and therefore attainable together with those which are unuseful and therefore unattainable   of the nature ends use and application of the different capacities of men   of the use of learning of the science of the world and of wit concluding with a satyr against the misapplication of them illustrated by pictures characters and examples  the third book regarded civil regimen or the science of politics in which the several forms of a republic were to have been examined and explained together with the several modes of religious worship as far forth as they affect society between which the author always supposed there was the most interesting relation and closest connection so that this part would have treated of civil and religious society in their full extent  the fourth and last book concerned private ethics or practical morality considered in all the circumstances orders professions and stations of human life  the scheme of all this had been maturely digested and communicated to the l bolinbroke dr swift and one or two more and was intended for the only work of his riper years but was partly through ill health partly through discouragements from the depravity of the times and partly on prudential and other considerations interrupted postponed and lastly in a manner laid aside  but as this was the authors favorite work which more exactly reflected the image of his strong capacious mind and as we can have but a very imperfect idea of it from the disjecta membra poetae that now remain it may not be amiss to be a little more particular concerning each of these projected books  the first as it treats of man in the abstract and considers him in general under every of his relations becomes the foundation and furnishes out the subjects of the three following so that  the second book takes up again the first and second epistles of the first book and treats of man in his intellectual capacity at large as has been explained above of this only a small part of the conclusion which as we said was to have contained a satyr against the misapplication of wit and learning may be found in the fourth book of the dunciad and up and down occasionally in the other three  the third book in like manner reassumes the subject of the third epistle of the first which treats of man in his social political and religious capacity but this part the poet afterward conceived might be best executed in an epic poem as the action would make it more animated and the fable less invidious in which all the great principles of true and false governments and religions should be chiefly delivered in feigned examples in pursuance of this design he pland out a poem on the subject of the fabulous brutus the great grandson of aeneas whose first and predominant principle he makes to be benevolence from this ruling passion arises a strong desire to redeem the remains of his countrymen then captives amongst the greeks from slavery and misery and to establish their freedom and felicity on a just form of civil government he had seen how false policy and superstitions and vices proceeding from it had caused the ruin of troy and he was enabled to avoid the one by the lights his countrymen whom he had now gathered from their dispersion could afford him from their observations on the various policies of the grecian cities and to reform the other by the wisdom he himself had gained in italy where evander as we are told by virgil had reformed the reigning superstitions rex evandrus ait non haec sollemnia nobis vana superstitio veterumque ignara deorum imposuit  thus qualified for the office of legislation he puts to sea with a number of brave followers enters the atlantic ocean and after various traverses each of which produces some new lesson of politics he arrives in britain where having surmounted many successive difficulties which bring him still nearer and nearer to the point the poet aims at he at length establishes for his trojans that perfect form of civil government which it was our authors purpose to recommend the poem opens of which very few lines of the introduction only were written with brutus at the straits of calpe in sight of the ne plus ultra on herculess pillars debating in council whether he should enter the great ocean  the fourth and last book pursues the subject of the fourth epistle of the first and treats of ethics or practical morality and would have consisted of many members of of which the four following epistles were detached portions the two first on the characters of men and women being the introductory part

or members the first from   to    treats of the difficulties in coming at the knowledge and true characters of men  the second from    to     of the wrong means which both philosophers and men of the world have employed in surmounting those difficulties and the third from     to the end treats of the right means with directions for the application of them  i ver   yes you despise the man etc the epistle is introduced from   to    in observing that the knowledge of men is neither to be gained by books nor experience alone but by the joint use of both for that the maxims of the philosopher and the conclusions of the man of the world can separately but supply a vague and superficial knowledge and often not so much as those maxims are founded in the abstract notions of the writer and these conclusions are drawn from the uncertain conjectures of the observer but when the writer joins his speculation to the experience of the observer his notions are rectified into principles and when the observer regulates his experience on the general principles of the writer his conjectures advance into science such is the reasoning of this introduction which besides its propriety to the general subject of the epistle has a peculiar relation to each of its parts or members for the causes of the difficulty in coming at the knowledge and characters of men explained in the first will show the importance of what is here delivered of the joint assistance of speculation and practice to surmount it and the wrong means which both philosophers and men of the world have employed in overcoming those difficulties discoursed of in the second have their source here deduced which is seen to be a separate adherence of each to his own method of studying men and a mutual contempt of the others lastly the right means delivered in the third will be of little use in the application without the direction here delivered for though observation discovered a ruling passion yet without a philosophic knowledge of the human mind we may easily mistake a secondary and subsidiary passion for the principal and so be never the nearer in the knowledge of men but the elegant and easy form of the introduction equals the propriety of its matter for the epistle being addressed to a noble person distinguished for his knowledge of the world it opens as it were in the midst of a familiar converse which lets us at once into his character where the poet by affecting only to ridicule the useless knowledge of men confined to books and under the appearance of extolling only that acquired by the world artfully insinuates how equally defective this may be when conducted on the same narrow principle which is too often the case as men of the world are more than ordinarily prejudiced in favor of their own observations for the sake of the observer and for the same reason less indulgent to the discoveries of others  ver    there is some peculiar etc the poet enters on the first division of his subject the difficulties of coming at the knowledge and true characters of men the i cause of this difficulty which he prosecutes from    to    is the great diversity of characters of which to abate our wonder and not discourage our inquiry he only desires we would grant him  but as many sorts of mind as moss hereby artfully insinuating that if nature has varied the most worthless vegetable into above three hundred species we need not wonder at the like diversity in the human mind and if a variety in that vegetable has been thought of importance enough to employ the leisure of a serious enquirer much more will the same quality in this masterpiece of nature deserve our study and attention  ver    that each from other differs etc a second cause of this difficulty from    to    is mans inconstancy whereby not only one man differs from another but each man from himself  ver    add natures etc a third cause from  0 to    is that obscurity thrown over the characters of men through the strife and contest between nature and custom between reason and appetite between truth and opinion and as most men either through education temperature or profession have their characters warped by custom appetite and opinion the obscurity arising from thence almost universal  ver    our depths who fathoms etc a fourth cause from  0 to    is deep dissimulation and restless caprice whereby the shallows of the mind are as difficult to be found as the depths of it to be fathomed  ver    on human actions etc a fifth cause from    to    is the sudden change of his principle of action either on the point of its being laid open and detected or through mere inconstancy  ver    yet more the difference etc hitherto the poet has spoken of the causes of difficulty arising from the obseurity of the object he now comes to those which proceed from defects in the observer the first of which and a sixth cause of difficulty he shows from  0 to    is the perverse manners affections and imagination of the observer whereby the characters of others are rarely seen either in their true light complexion or proportion  ver    nor will lifes stream for observation etc the second of these and seventh cause of difficulty from    to    is the shortness of human life which will not suffer the observer to select and weigh out his knowledge but just to snatch it as it rolls rapidly by him down the current of time  ver    often in the passions etc we come now to the eighth and last cause which very properly concludes the account as in a sort it sums up all the difficulties in one from  0 to    namely that very often the man himself is ignorant of his own motive of action the cause of which ignorance our author has admirably explained when the mind says he is now quite tired out by the long conflict of opposite motives it withdraws its attention and suffers the will to be seized upon by the first that afterward obtrudes itself without taking notice what that motive is this is finely illustrated by what he supposes the general cause of dreams where the fancy just let loose possesses itself of the last image which it meets with on the confines between sleep and waking and on that eracts all its visionary operation yet this image is with great difficulty recollected and never but when some accident happens to interrupt our first slumbers then which proves the truth of the hypothesis we are sometimes able to trace the workings of the fancy backwards from image to image in a chain till we come to that from whence they all arose  ver    true some are open etc but now in answer to all this an objector as the author shows from  0 to    may say that these difficulties seem to be aggravated for many characters are so plainly marked that no man can mistake them and not so only in the more open and frank but in the very closest and most recluse likewise of each of which the objector gives an instance whereby it appears that the forbidding closeness and concealed hypocrisy in the one are as conspicuous to all mankind as the gracious openness and frank plaindealing of the other  the reader sees this objection is more particularly levelled at the doctrine of    our depths who fathoms and our shallows finds for it here endeavors to prove that both are equally explorable  ver    but these plain characters etc to this objection therefore our author replies from  0 to    that indeed the fact may be true in the instances given but that such plain characters are extremely rare and for the truth of this he not only appeals to experience but explains the causes of it   the first of which is the vivacity of the imagination for that when the bias of the passions is enough determined to mark out the character yet then as the vigor of the fancy generally rises in proportion to the strength of the appetites the one no sooner directs the bias than the other reverses it though strong the bent yet quick the turns of mind   a second cause is the contrariety of appetites which drawing several ways as avarice and luxury ambition and indolence etc they must needs make the same character inconsistent to itself and consequently inexplicable to the observer or puzzling contraries confound the whole   ver    or affectations etc   a third cause is affectation that aspires to qualities which neither nature nor education has given us and which consequently neither art nor use will ever render graceful or becoming on this account it is he well observes that affectation reverses the soul other natural passions may indeed turn it from that bias which the ruling one has given it but the affected passions distort all its faculties and cramp all its operations so that it acts with the same constraint that a tumbler walks upon his hands  ver    unthought of frailties etc   a fourth cause lies in the inequalities  the human mind which expose the wise to unexpected frailties and conduct the  to as unlooked for wisdom  ver    see the same man etc of all these four causes he here gives examples   of the vivacity of the imagination from    to       of the contrariety of appetites from    to  0    of affectation from    to  0  and   of the inequalities of the human mind from    to     ver    know god and nature etc having thus proved what he had proposed the premises naturally lead him into a moral reflection with which he concludes his first part namely that constancy is to be expected in no human character whatsoever but to be found only in god and his laws that as to man he is not only perpetually shifting and varying even while within the verge of his own nature but is frequently flying out into each extreme both above and below it now associating in good earnest with brutes and now again affecting the imaginary coversation of angels see essay on man ep ii   a bird of passage gone as soon as found now in the moon perhaps now under ground   ii ver    in vain the sage etc the author having shown the difficulties in coming to the knowledge and true characters of men enters now upon the second division of his poem which is of the wrong means that both philosophers and men of the world have employed in surmounting those difficulties he had in the introduction spoken of the absurd conduct of both in despising the assistance of each other he now justifies his censure by an examination of their peculiar doctrines and to take them in their own way considers them as they would be considered separately and first of the philosopher whose principal mistake is in supposing that actions best decipher the motive of the actor this he confutes from    to  0  by showing that different actions proceed often from the same motive whether of accident as disappointed views or of temperature as an adust complexion which he thus illustrates behold if fortune or a mistress frown etc in judging therefore of motives by actions the philosopher must needs be frequently misled because the passion or appetite which when impelling to action we call the motive may be equally gratified in the pursuit of quite different measures  ver  0  not always actions show the man etc the philosophers second mistake is that actions decipher the character of the actor this too the author confutes from     to     and as in correcting the foregoing mistake he proved that different actions often proceed from the same motive so here he proves that the same actions often proceeds from different motives thus a kind action he observes as commonly arises from the accidents of prosperity or fine weather as from a natural disposition to humanity a modest action as well from pride as humility a brave action as easily from habit or fashion as magnanimity and a prudent action as often from vanity as wisdom now the character being really determined by the motives and various nay contrary motives producing the same action the action can never decipher the character of the actor but further continues the poet if we attend to what has been said we shall discover another circumstance in the case that will not only make it extremely difficult but absolutely impracticable to decipher the character by the action and that is the discordancy of action in the same character a necessary consequence of the two principles proved above that different actions proceed from the same motive and that the same action proceeds from different motives  ver     but grant that actions etc if you will judge of man by his actions you are not to selected such only as you like or can manage you must fairly take all you find but when you have got these together they will prove so very discordant that no consistent character can possibly be made out of them what is then to be done will you suppress all those you cannot reconcile to the few capital actions which you choose for the foundation of your character but this the laws of truth will not allow of will you then miscall them and say they were not the natural workings of the man but the disguises of the politician but what will you get by that but the very reversing the best known character and making the owner of it the direct opposite of himself and this says our author the reasoning and philosophic historian has always been ready to do with the actions of great men of which he gives two famous instances in the life of caefar the conclusion from the whole is that actions do not show the man  ver     it is from high life etc the poet having done with the philosopher now turns to the man of the world whose first mistake is in supposing mens true characters may be known by their station this though a mere mobopinion is the opinion in fashion and cherished by the mob of all ranks therefore though beneath the poets reasoning he thought it deserving of his ridicule and the strongest was what he gives from     to     a naked exposition of the fact to which he has subjoined from   0 to     an ironical apology that as virtue is cultivated with infinitely more labor in courts than in cottages it is but just to set an infinitely higher value on it which says he with much pleasantry is most agreeable to all the fashionable ways of estimation for why do the connoisseurs prefer the lively color in a gem before that in a flower but for its extreme rarity and difficulty of production  ver     it is education forms etc this second mistake of the man of the world is more serious it is that characters are best judged of by the general manners this the poet confutes in a lively enumeration of examples from     to     which show that how similar or different soever the manners be by nature yet they are all new modeled by education and profession where each man invariably receives that exotic form which the mould he falls into is fitted to imprint the natural character therefore can never be judged of by these fictitious manners  ver     ask mens opinions etc the third mistake is in judging of mens characters by their opinions and turn of thinking but these the poet shows by two examples from     to     are generally swayed by interest both in the affairs of life and speculation  ver     judge we by nature etc the poet having gone through the mistakes both of the philosopher and man of the world turns now to both and from     to     jointly addresses them in a recapitulation of his reasoning against both he shows that if we pretend to disenvelope the character by the natural disposition in general we shall find it extremely difficult because this is often effaced by habit overswayed by interest and suspended by policy  if by actions their contrariety will leave us in utter doubt and uncertainty  if by passions we shall be perpetually misled by the mask of dissimulation  if by opinions all these things concur together to perplex the enquiry show us therefore says he in the whole range of your philosophy and experience the thing we can be certain of for to sum up all in a word manners with fortunes humors turn with climes tenets with books and principles with times we must seek therefore some other rout to the point we aim at  iii ver     search then the ruling passion etc and now we enter on the third and last part which treats of the right means of surmounting the difficulties in coming to the knowledge and characters of men this the poet shows is by investigating the ruling passion of whose origin and nature we may find an exact account in the second ep of the essay on man this principle he rightly observes from     to   0 is the clue that must guide us through all the intricacies in the ways of men to convince us of which he applies it from     to   0 to the most wild and inconsistent character that ever was which when drawn out at length in a spirit of poetry as rare as the character itself we see this principle unravels and renders throughout of one plain consistent thread  ver   0 yet in the search etc but here from  0  to     he gives one very necessary caution that in developing the ruling passion we must be careful not to mistake a subsidiary passion for the principal which without great attention we may be very liable to do as the subsidiary acting in support of the principal has frequently all its vigor and much of its perseverance this error has misled several both of the ancient and modern historians as when they supposed lust and luxury to be characteristics of caesar and lucullus whereas in truth the ruling passion of both was ambition which is so certain that at whatsoever different time of the republic these men had lived their ambition as the ruling passion had been the same but a different time had changed their subsidiary ones of lust and luxury into their very opposites of chastity and frugality it is in vain therefore says our author for the observer of human nature to six his attention on the workman if he all the while mistakes the scaffold for the building  ver     in this one passion etc but now it may be objected to our philosophic poet that he has indeed shown the true means of coming to the knowledge and characters of men by a principle certain and infallible when found yet by his own account of so difficult investigation that its counterfeit and it is always attended with one may be easily mistaken for it to remove this difficulty therefore and consequently the objection that arises from it the poet has given from     to     one certain and infallible criterion of the ruling passion which is this that all the other passions in the course of time change and wear away while this is ever constant and vigorous and still going on from strength to strength to the very moment of its demolishing the miserable machine that it has now at length overworked of this great truth the poet from     to the end gives various instances in all the principal ruling passions of our nature as they are to be found in the man of business the man of pleasure the epicure the parcimonious the toast the courtier the miser and the patriot which last instance the poet has had the art under the appearance of satyr to turn into the noblest compliment on the person to whom the epistle is addressed  notes ver  0 and yet  men may be read as well as books too much etc the poet has here covertly described a famous system of a man of the world the celebrated maxims of m de la rochefoucault which are one continued satyr on human nature and hold much of the ill language of the parrat the reason of the censure our authors system of human nature will explain  ver    and all opinions colors cast on life the poet refers here only to the effects in the essay on man he gives both the efficient and the final cause the first in the third ep     ever wit oblique had broke that steady light for oblique wit is opinion the other in the second ep     meanwhile opinion gilds with varying rays these painted clouds that beautify our days etc   ver    it may be reason but it is not man i e the philospher may invent a rational hypothesis that shall account for the appearances he would investigate and yet that hypothesis be all the while very wide of truth and the nature of things  ver    like following life through creatures you dissect you loss it in the moment you detect this simile is extremely beautiful to show the difficulty of discovering the operations of the heart in a moral sense he illustrates it by another attempt still more difficult the discovery of its operations in a natural for the seat of animal life being in the heart our endeavors of tracing it thither must necessarily

schemes of worldly policy cannot but confess that human affairs are ordered by some power extrinsical to acknowledge a god and his providence would be next to introducing a morality destructive of that public system which they think necessary for the government of the world they have recourse therefore to that ridiculous and absurd scheme of power which rules by no other law than fate or destiny the consideration of this perhaps was the reason that the poet to keep up decorum and to preserve the distinction between a patriot and a politician makes the sormer rely on providence for the

discretion in the conclusion of a long detail of the various characters of men for from this circumstance montagne and others have been bold enough to insinuate that morality is sounded more in custom and fashion than in the nature of things the speaking therefore of a moral law of god as having all the constancy and durability of his essence had an high expediency in this place  ver  0  the same

books and principles with times the poet had hitherto reckoned up the several simple causes that hinder our knowledge of the natural characters of men in these two fine lines he describes the complicated causes humors bear the the same relation to manners that principles do to tenets that is the former are modes of the latter our manners are warped from nature by our fortunes or stations

have used his judgment and pursued his speculations when he should have trusted to his experience  ver  0  and harder still flagitious yet not great it was indeed very hard when though this be the

we must observe that the lust of general praise made the person whose character is here so admirably drawn both extravagant and flagitious his madness was to please the fools women and fools must like

the appearance of irregularity in a comets motion is occasioned by the greatness of the force which pushes it round a very eccentric orb so it is the violence of the ruling passion that impatient for its object in the impetuosity of its course toward it is frequently hurried to an immense distance from it which occasions all that puzzling inconsistency of conduct we observe in it  ver     ambition was the vice pride vanity and ambition are such bordering and neighbourly vices and hold so much in common that we generally find them going together and therefore as generally mistake them for one

nothing so true etc the reader perhaps may be disappointed to find that this epistle which proposes the same subject with the preceding is conducted on very different rules of method for instead of being disposed in the same logical connection and filled with the like philosophical remarks it is wholly taken up in drawing a great variety of capital characters but if he would reflect that the two sexes make but one species and consequently that the characters of both must be studied and explained on the same principles he would see that when the poet had done this in the preceding epistle his business here was not to repeat what he had already delivered but only to verify and illustrate his doctrine by every view of that perplexity of nature which his philosophy only can explain if the reader therefore will but be at the pains to study these characters with any degree of attention as they are here masterly drawn one important particular for which the poet has artfully prepared him by the introduction will very forcibly strike his observation and that is that all the great strokes in the several characters of women are not only infinitely perplexed and discordant like those in men but absolutely inconsistent and in a much higher degree contradictory as strange as this may appear yet he will see that the poet has all the while strictly followed nature whose ways we find by the former epistle are not a little mysterious and a mystery this might have remained had not our author explained it at  0  where he shuts up his characters with this philosophical reflection in men we various ruling passions find in women two almost divide the kind those only fixed they first or last obey the love of pleasure and the love of sway if this account be true we see the perpetual necessity which is not the case in men that women lie under of disguising their ruling passion now the variety of arts employed to this purpose must needs draw them into infinite contradictions in those actions from whence their general and obvious character is denominated to verify this observation let the reader examine all the characters here drawn and try whether with this key he cannot discover that all their contradictions arise from a desire to hide the ruling passion  but this is not the worst the poet afterward from     to     takes notice of another mischief arising from this necessity of hiding their ruling passions which is that generally the end of each is defeated even there where they are most violently pursued for the necessity of hiding them inducing an habitual dissipation of mind reason whose office it is to regulate the ruling passion loses all its force and direction and these unhappy victims to their principles though with their attention still fixed upon them are ever prosecuting the means destructive of their end and thus become ridiculous in youth and miserable in old age  let me not omit to observe the great beauty of the conclusion it is an encomium on the lady to whom the epistle is addressed and artfully turns upon the fact which makes the subject of the epistle the contradiction of a womans character in which contradiction he shows that all the luster of the best character consists  and yet believe me good as well as ill womans at best a contradiction still etc ver   how many pictures the poets purpose here is to show that the characters of women are generally inconsistent with themselves and this he illustrates by so happy a similitude that we see the folly described in it arises from that very principle which gives birth to this inconsistency of character  ver      0 etc arcadias countess  pastora by a fountain  leda with a swan  magdalene  cecilia   attitudes in which several ladies affected to be drawn and sometimes

disbelieve out of fear  ver   0 or wanders heavndirected etc alluding and referring to the great principle of his philosophy which he never loses sight of and which teaches that providence is incessantly turning the evils arising from the follies and vices of men to general good  ver     cameleons who can paint in white and black there is one thing that does a very distinguished honor to the accuracy of our poets judgment of which in the course of these observations i have given many instances and shall here explain in what it consists it is this that the similitudes in his didactic poems of which he is not sparing and which are highly poetical are always chosen with such exquisite discernment of nature as not only to illustrate the particular point he is upon but to establish the general principles he would enforce so in the instance before us he compares the inconstancy and contradiction in the characters of women to the change of colors in the chameleon yet it is nevertheless the great principle of this poem to show that the general characteristic of the sex as to the ruling passion which they all have is more uniform than that in man now for this purpose all nature could not have supplied such another illustration as this of the chameleon for though it instantaneously assumes much of the color of every subject on which it chances to be placed yet as the most accurate virtuosi have observed it has two native colors of its own which amidst all these charges are never totally discharged but though often discolored by the neighborhood of adventitious ones still make the foundation and give a tincture to all those which from thence it occasionally assumes  ver     yet cloe sure etc the purpose of the poet in this character is important it is to show that the politic or prudent government of the passions is not enough to make a character amiable nor even to secure it from being ridiculous if the end of that government be not pursued which is the free exercise of the social appetites after the selfish ones have been subdued for that if though reason govern the heart be never consulted we interest ourselves as little in the fortune of such a character as in any of the foregoing which passions or caprice drive up and down at random  ver     one certain portrait  the same for ever   this is entirely ironical and conveys under it this

philosopher than for his exemplary life and pastoral charity as a parish priest  ver     but grant in public etc in the former editions between this and the foregoing lines a want of connection might be perceived occasioned by the omission of certain examples and illustrations to the maxims laid down and though some of these have since been found viz the characters of philomede atossa cloe and some verses following others are still wanting nor can we answer that these are exactly inserted  ver  0  the former part having shown that the particular characters of women are more various than those of men it is nevertheless observed that the general characteristic of the sex as to the ruling passion is more uniform  ver     this is occasioned partly by their nature partly their education and in some degree by necessity  ver          and where the lesson taught  is but to please can etc i cannot help observing the delicacy of the poets address in his manner of informing us what this pleasure is which makes one of the two objects of womans ruling passion he does it in an ironical apology for it arising from its being a pleasure of the beneficent and communicative kind and not merely selfish like those which the other sex generally pursues  ver     experience this etc the ironical apology continued that the second is as it were forced upon them by the tyranny and oppression

beam etc one of the great beauties observable in the poets management of his similitudes is the ceremonious preparation he makes for them in gradually raising the imagery of the similitude in the lines preceding by the use of metaphors taken from the subject of it  while what fatigues the ring flaunts and goes down an unreguarded thing and the civil dismission he gives them by the continuance of the same metaphor in the lines following whereby the traces of the imagery gradually decay and give place to others and the reader is never offended with the sudden or abrupt disappearance of it oh

parents simple prayer and gave you beauty but denied the pelf the poet concludes his epistle with a fine moral that deserves the serious attention of the public it is this that all the extravagances of these vicious characters here described are much inflamed by a wrong education and that even the best are rather secured by a good natural than by the prudence and providence of parents which

the crown the devil and the king divide the prize and sad sir balaam curses god and dies commentary ver   who shall decide etc the address of the introduction from   to    is remarkable the poet representshimself and the noble lord his friend as in a conversation philosophising on the final cause of riches you says our author  hold the word from jove to momus given but i who think more highly of our kind etc opine that nature etc as much as to say you my lord hold the subject we are upon as fit only for satyr i on the contrary esteem it a case of philosophy and profound ethics but as we both agree in the main principle that riches were not given for the reward of virtue but for very different purposes see essay on man ep iv let us compromise the matter and consider the subject jointly both under your idea and mine i e satyrically and philosophically  and this in fact we shall find to be the true character of this poem which is a species peculiar to itself and partaking equally of the nature of his ethic epistles and his satyrs as the best pieces of lucian arose from a combination of the dialogues of plato and the scenes of aristophanes this it will be necessary to carry with us if we would see either the wit or the reasoning of this epistle in their true light  ver    what nature wants etc having thus settled the terms of the debate before he comes to the main question the use of riches it was necessary to discuss a previous one whether indeed they are upon the whole useful to mankind or not which he does from  0 to    it is commonly observed says he from    to    that gold most commodiously supplies the wants of nature let us first consider the proposition in general both in matter and expression   as it regards the supply and this we shall find to be very unequal   as it regards the wants and these we shall see are very ambiguous under that term all our fantastic and imaginary as well as real wants being comprised hitherto the use is not very apparent let us in the second place therefore consider the proposition in particular or how gold supplies the wants of nature both in private and public life   as to private it aids us indeed to support life but it at the same times hires the assassin   as to society it may procure friendships and extend trade but it allures robbers and corrupts our acquaintance   as to government it pays the guards necessary for the support of public liberty but it may with the same ease bribe a senate to overturn it  the matter therefore being thus problematical the poet instead of formally balancing between the good and ill chooses to leave this previous question undetermined as tacitus had done before him where speaking of the ancient germans he says argentum et aurum propitii aut irati dii negaverint dubito and falls at once upon what he esteems the principal of these abuses public corruption  for having in the last instance of the use of riches in government spoken of venal senates he goes on to lament the mischief as desperate and remediless gold by its power to corrupt with secrecy defeating all the efforts of public spirit whether exerted in the courage of heroes or in the wisdom of patriots  it is true indeed continues the poet from    to    the very weight of the bribery has sometimes detected the corruption from the cracked bag the dropping guinea spoke etc but this inconvenience was soon repaired by the invention of paper credit whose dreadful effects on public liberty he describes in all the coloring of his poetry heightened by the warmest concern for virtue which now makes him willing to give up as it were the previous question in a passionate wish from    to    for the return of that encumbrance attendant on public corruption before the so common use of money  and pleased with this flattering idea he goes on from    to    to show the other advantages that would accrue from riches only in kind which are that neither avarice could contrive to hoard nor prodigality to lavish in so mad and boundless a manner as they do at present here he shows particularly in a fine ironical description of the embarras on gaming how effectually it would eradicate that execrable practice  but this whole digression from    to    has another very uncommon beauty for at the same time that it arises naturally from the last consideration in the debate of the previous question it artfully denounces in our entrance on the main question the principal topics intended to be employed for the dilucidation of it namely avarice profusion and public corruption  ver    since then my lord on such a world etc having thus ironically described the encumbrance which the want of money would occasion to all criminal excesses in the use of riches particularly to gaming which being now become of public concern he affects much regard to oh filthy check to all industrious skill to spoil the nations last great trade quadrille he concludes the previous question without deciding it in the same ironical manner since then my lord on such a world we fall what say you say why take it gold and all that is since for these great purposes we must have money let us now seriously inquire into its true use  ver    what riches give us etc he examines therefore in the first place from  0 to    i of what use riches are to ourselves what riches give us let us then enquire meat fire and clothes what more meat clothes and fire the mere turn of the expression here shows without further reasoning that all the infinite ways of spending on ourselves contrived in the insolence of wealth by those who would more than live are only these three things diversified throughout every wearied mode of luxury and wantonness  yet as little as this is adds the poet from    to    it is only to be had by the moderate use of riches avarice and profusion not allowing the possessors of the most exorbitant wealth even this little alas it is more than turner finds they give alas it is more than all his visions past unhappy wharton waking found at last but what is it you would expect them to give continues the poet from    to    would you have them capable of restoring those real blessings which men have lost by their vices or their villainies or of satisfying those imaginary ones which they have gotten by their irregular appetites and passions these sure the bad or foolish man cannot have the face to demand and those by the wise provision of nature riches are incapable of giving if he had  but now admit pursues our author from  0 to    that wealth might in some cases alleviate the unmerited miseries of life by procuring medicines both for the mind and body yet it is not to be thought it should operate like a charm while only worn about one yet this these poor men of pelf expect from it while avarice on the one hand witholds them from giving at all even to the doctor in extremity or vanity diverts the donation from a friend in life to the endowment of a cat or college at their death it is true riches might give the greatest of all blessings a virtuous consciousness of our having employed them as became the substitutes of providence to ease or emulate the care of heaven   0 in acts of beneficence and charity and this use is next to be considered  ver    to some indeed etc for now the poet comes in the second place to examine ii of what use riches are to others which he teaches as is his way throughout this poem by the abuse that stands opposed to it thus he shows from    to  0  that with regard to acts of beneficence the utmost heaven will grant to those who so greatly abuse its blessings is either to enrich some favorite bastard and so perpetuate their vice and infamy or else contrary to their intent a legitimate son they hated and so expose to public scorn and ridicule the defeat of their unnatural cruelty but with regard to acts of charity they are given up to so reprobate a sense as to believe they are then seconding the designs of heaven when they pursue the indigent with imprecations or leave them in the midst of their distresses unrelieved as the common enemies of god and man  ver  0  yet to be just etc having thus shown the true use of riches in a description of the abuse and how that use is perpetually defeated by profusion and avarice it was natural to enquire into the spring and original of these vices as the abuse they occasion must be well understood before it can be corrected the disposition therefore of his subject now calls upon him to come to the philosophy of it and he examines particularly into the motives of avarice but what is very observable he all along satyrically intermixes with the real motives several imaginary and those as wild as imagination could conceive this which at first sight might seem to vitiate the purpose of his philosophical inquiry is found when duly considered to have the highest art of design his business the reader sees was to prove that the real motives had the highest extravagancy nothing could more conduce to this end than the setting them by and comparing them with the most extravagant that the fancy itself could invent in which situation it was seen that the real were full as wild as the fictitious to give these images all the force they were capable of he first describes from     to     the real and a different imaginary motive in the same person and then from     to     an imaginary one and a real the very same with the imaginary in different persons this address the poet himself alludes to     less mad the wildest whimsy we can frame etc let me observe that this has still a further beauty arising from the nature of the poem which as we have shown is partly satirical and partly philosophical  with regard to the particular beauties of this disposition i shall only take notice of one where the poet introduces the fictitious motive of blunts avarice by a wizards prophecy at length corruption like a general flood so long by watchful ministers withstood shall deluge all and avarice creeping on spread like a lowborn mist and blot the sun etc see britain sunk in lucres sordid charms and france revenged on anne and edwards arms for it was the poets purpose in this poem to show that the main and principal abuse of riches arises from avarice  ver     all this is madness etc but now the sage who has confined himself to books which prescribe the government of the passions and never looked out upon the world where he might see them let loose and like miltons devils riding the air in whirlwind cries out all this is madness true replies the poet from     to     but this madness is a common one and only to be prevented by a severe attention to the rule laid down in the essay reason still use to reason still attend ep ii    for with the generality of men and without the greatest circumspection the ruling passion be it what it will the ruling passion conquers reason still but then continues he as wild as this passion appears by the sway of its overbearing bias it would be still more senseless had it no bias at all you have seen us here intermix with the real the most fantastical and extravagant that imagination could form yet even these are less extravagant than a ruling passion without a constant aim would you know the reason then listen to this important truth it is heaven itself that gives the ruling passion and thereby directs different men to different ends but these being exerted through the ministry of nature of whom the great bacon truly observes modum tenere nescia est aug scient l ii c    they are very apt to run into extremes to correct which heaven at the same time added the moderatrix reason not to take the ruling passion out of the hands and ministry of nature but to restrain and rectify its irregular impulses see essay ep ii     and seq and what extremes after this remained uncorrected in the administration of this weak queen    0 ep ii the divine artist himself has in his heavenly skill and bounty set to rights by so ordering that these of the moral like those of the natural world should even by the very means of their contrariety and diversity concur to defeat the malignity of one another extremes in nature equal good produce extremes in man concur to general use for as the various seasons of the year are supported and sustained by the reconciled extremes of wet and dry cold and heat so all the orders and degrees of civil life are kept up by avarice and profusion selfishness and vanity the miser being but the steward of the prodigal and only so much the more backward as the other is violent and precipitate this year a reservoir to keep and spare the next a fountain spouting through his heir   ver     old cotta shamed his fortune etc the poet now proceeds to support the principles of his philosophy by examples but before we come to these it will be necessary to look back upon the general ceconomy of the poem  in the first part to  0  the use and abuse of riches are satyrically delivered in precept from thence to     the causes of the abuse are philosophically inquired into and from thence to the end the use and abuse are historically illustrated in examples where we may observe that the conclusion of the first part concerning the misers cruelty to others naturally introduces the second by a satirical apology showing that he is full as cruel to himself the explanation of which extraordinary phenomenon brings the author into the philosophy of his subject and this ending in an observation of avarice and profusions correcting and reconciling one another as naturally introduces the third which proves the truth of the observation from fact and thus the philosophy of his subject standing between his precepts and examples gives strength and light to both and receives it reflected back again from both  he first gives us two examples from     to     of these opposite ruling passions and to see them in their full force taken from subjects as he tells us not void of wit or worth from such as could reason themselves as we see by     and seqq and  0  and seqq into the whole length of each extreme for the poet had observed of the ruling passion that wit spirit faculties but make it worse reason itself but gives it edge and power essay ep ii     old cotta therefore and his son afforded him the most happy illustration of his own doctrine  ver     the sense to value riches etc having now largely exposed the abuse of riches by example not only the plan but the philosophy of his poem required that he should in the same way show the use likewise he therefore calls for an example in which may be found against the prodigal the sense to value riches against the vain the art to enjoy them and against the avaricious the virtue to impart them when acquired this whole art he tells us may be comprised in one great and general precept which is this that the rich man should consider himself as the substitute of providence in this unequal distribution of things as the person who is to ease or emulate the care of heaven to mend the faults of fortune or to justify her graces and thus the poet slides naturally into the prosecution of his subject in an example of the true use of riches  ver     but all our praises why should lords engross rise honest muse   this invidious expression of the poets unwillingness that the nobility should ingross all his praises is strongly ironical their example having been given hitherto only to show the abuse of riches but there is great justness of design as well as agreeableness of manner in the preference here given to the man of ross the purpose of the poet is to show that an immense fortune is not wanted for all the good that riches are capable of doing he therefore chooses such an instance as proves that a man with five hundred pounds a year could become a blessing to a whole country and consequently that the poets precepts for the true use of money are of more general service than a bad heart will give an indifferent head leave to conceive this was a truth of the greatest importance to inculcate he therefore from     to     exalts the character of a very private man one mr j kyrle of herefordshire and in ending his description struck as it were with admiration at a sublimity of his own creating and warmed with sentiments of a gratitude he had raised in himself in behalf of the public the poet bursts out and what no monument inscription stone his race his form his name almost unknown then transported with indignation at a contrary object he exclaims when hopkins dies a thousand lights attend the wretch who living saved a candles end shouldring gods altar a vile image stands belies his features nay extends his hands i take notice of this description of the portentous vanity of a miserable extortioner chiefly for the use we shall now see he makes of it in carrying on his subject  ver     behold what blessings wealth to life can lend now see what comfort it affords our end in the first part of this epistle the author had shown from reason that riches abused afford no comfort either in life or death in this part where the same truth is taught by examples he had in the case of cotta and his son shown that they afford no comfort in life the other member of the division remained to be spoken to now see what comfort they afford our end and this he illustrates from     to     in describing the unhappy deaths of the last villers duke of buckingham and sir j cutler whose profusion and avarice he has beautifully contrasted the miserable end of these two extraordinary persons naturally leads the poet into this humane reflection however ludicrously expressed say for such worth are other worlds prepared or are they both in this their own reward and now as if fully determined to resolve this doubtful question he assumes the air and importance of a professor ready addressed to plunge himself into the very depths of theology a knotty point to which we now proceed  when on a sudden the whole scene is changed but you are tired i will tell a tale  agreed and thus by the most easy transition we are come to the concluding doctrine of his poem  ver     where londons column etc for the foregoing examples of prosusion and avarice having been given to show that misapplied wealth was not enjoyed it only remained to prove that in such circumstances wealth became the heaviest punishment and this was the very point to be concluded with as the great moral of this instructive poem which is to teach us how miserable men make themselves by not endeavoring to restrain the ruling passion though it be indeed implanted in the constitution of things while at the same time it is an answer to the latter part of the question say for such worth are other worlds prepared or are they both in this their own reward for the solution of which only this example was jocularly pretended to have been given  all this the poet has admirably supported in the artful construction of his fable of sir balaam whose character is so drawn as to let the reader see he had it in his power to regulate the ruling passion by reason as having in himself the seeds of integrity religion and sobriety these are gradually worked out by an insatiable thirst of wealth and this again through a false sense of his own abilities in acquiring it succeeded by as immoderate a vanity let me only observe farther that the author in this tale has artfully summed up and recapitulated those three principal mischiefs in the abuse of money which the satirical part of this poem throughout was employed to expose namely avarice profusion and public corruption  notes ver   opine a word sacred to controversy and high debate  ver  0 john ward of hackney esquire member of parliament being secuted by the duchess of buckingham and convicted of forgery was first expelled the house and then stood in the pillory on the   th of march      he was

fifty thousand pounds against ward but he set up prior conveyances of his real estate to his brother and son and concealed all his personal which was computed to be one hundred and fifty thousand pounds these conveyances being also set aside by a bill in chancery ward was imprisoned and hazarded the forfeiture of his life by not giving in his effects till the last day which was that of his examination during his consinement his amusement was to give poison to dogs and cats and see them expire by flower or quicker torments to sum up the worth of this gentleman at the several aeras of his

infirmities in the practice of every human vice excepting prodigality and hypocrisy his infatiable avarice exempted him from the first his matchless impudence from the second nor was he more singular in the undeviating pravity of his manners than successful in accumulating wealth for without trade or profession without trust of public money and without bribeworthy service he acquired or more

britain brings these are imperial works and worthy kings commentary epistle iv the extremes of avarice and profusion being treated of in the foregoing epistle this takes up one particular branch of the latter the vanity of expense in people of wealth and quality and is therefore a corollary to the preceding it is equally remarkable for exactness of method with the rest but the nature of the subject which is less philosophical makes it capable of being analyzed in a much narrower compass  ver   it is strange etc the poets introduction from   to    consists of a very curious remark arising from his intimate knowledge of nature together with an illustration of it taken from his observations on life it is this that the prodigal no more enjoys his profusion than the miser his rapacity it was generally thought that avarice only kept without enjoyment but the poet here first acquaints us with a circumstance in human life much more to be lamented viz that profusion too can communicate without it whereas enjoyment was thought to be as peculiarly the reward of the beneficent passions of which this seems to have the appearance as want of enjoyment was the punishment of the selfish  the phenomenon observed is odd enough but if we look more narrowly into this matter we shall find that prodigality when in pursuit of taste is only a mode of vanity and consequently as selfish a passion as even avarice itself and it is of the ordonance and constitution of all selfish passions when growing to excess to defeat their own end which is selfenjoyment but besides the accurate philosophy of this observation there is a fine morality contained in it namely that illgot wealth is not only as unreasonably but as uncomfortably squandered as it was raked together which the poet himself further insinuates in    what brought sir vistos illgot wealth to waste  he then illustrates this observation by diverse examples in every branch of wrong taste and to set their absurdities in the strongest light he in conclusion contrasts them with several instances of the true in the noble lord to whom the epistle is addressed this disposition is productive of various beauties for by this means the introduction becomes an epitome of the body of the epistle which as we shall see consists of general reflections on taste and particular examples of bad and good and his friends example concluding the introduction leads the poet gracefully into the subject itself for this lord here celebrated for his good taste was now at hand to deliver the first and fundamental percept of it himself which gives authority and dignity to all that follow  ver    often have you hinted to your brother peer a certain truth   and in this artful manner begins the body of the epistle  i the first part of it from    to    delivers rules for attaining to the magnificent in just expense which is the same in building and planting that the sublime is in painting and poetry and consequently the qualities necessary for the attainment of both must have the same relation    the first and fundamental he shows from    to    to be sense good sense which only is the gift of heaven and though no science fairly worth the seven and for that reason not only as it is the foundation and parent of them all and the constant regulator and director of their operations or as the poet better expresses it  of every art the soul but likewise as it alone can in case of need very often supply the offices of every one of them  ver    to build to plant etc   the next quality for dignity and use is taste and but the next for as the poet truly observes there is  something previous even to taste  it is sense and this in the order of things for sense is a taste and true conception of nature and taste is a sense or true conception of beautiful nature but we must first know the essences of things before we can judge truly of their qualities the business of taste therefore in the pursuit of magnificence is as the poet shows us from    to      to    to catch or lay hold on nature where she appears most in her charms   to    to adorn her when taken as best suits her dignity and quality that is to dress her in the light and modest habit of a virgin not load her with the gaudy ornaments of a prostitute this rule observed will prevent a transgression in the following which is not to let all its beauties be seen at once but in succession for that advantage is inseparable from a graceful and welldressed person   to    to take care that the ornaments be well suited to that part which it is your purpose to adorn and as in dressing out a modest fair which is the poets own comparision the colors are proportioned to her complexion the stuff to the embonpoint of her person and the fashion to her air and shape so in ornamenting a villa the rise or fall of waters should correspond to its acclivities or declivities the artificial hills or vales to its cover or exposure and the manner of calling in the country to the disposition of its aspect but again as in the illustration whatever be the variety in color stuff or fashion they must still be so suited with respect to one another as to produce an agreement and harmony in their assemblage so woods waters mountains vales and vistas must amidst all their diversity be so disposed with a relation to each other as to create a perfect symmetry resulting from the whole and this the genius of the place when religiously consulted will never fail to inform us of who as the poet says now breaks and now directs the intending lines paints as you plant and as you work designs and this is a full and complete description of the office of taste  ver    still follow sense etc but now when good sense has led us up to taste our fondness for the elegances of our new mistress oftentimes occasions us to neglect the plainness and simplicity of the old we are but too apt to forsake our guide and to give ourselves up solely to taste our authors next rule therefore   is still to follow sense and let it perpetually accompany us through all the works of taste still follow sense of every art the soul that is good sense should never be a moment absent from the works of taste any more than the soul from the body for just as the soul animates and informs every air and feature of a beauteous body so sense gives life and vigor to all the products of taste  ver    parts answring parts etc the particular advantages of the union of sense with taste he then explains from this verse to      that the beautiful parts which taste has laid out and contrived sense makes to answer one another and to slide naturally without violence into a whole   that many beauties will spontaneously offer themselves suggested from the very necessity which sense lays upon us of conforming the parts to the whole that no original invention of taste would have supplied   a third advantage is that you are then always sure to have nature on your side nature shall join you  the expression is important  sense being a right conception of nature and taste a right conception of beautiful nature when these are in conjunction nature can stand out no longer but presents herself to you without further pains or search  ver    without it proud versailles etc to illustrate this doctrine the poet next shows us from  0 to    that without this continued support of good sense things even of the highest taste and utmost magnificence such as the buildings of versailles the gardens of villario and the groves of sabinus which are the instances he gives all in a very little time come to nothing  and no wonder for the exercise of taste without sense is where something that is not beautiful nature is mistaken for it and ornamented as beautiful nature should be these ornaments there fore being destitute of all real support must be continually subject to change sometimes the owner himself will grow weary of them as in the case of villario and find at last that nature is to be preferred before them tired of the scene parterres and fountains yield he finds at last he better likes a field sometimes again the heir like sabinuss will be changing a bad taste for a worse one boundless green or flourished carpet views with all the mournful family of yews so that mere taste standing exposed between the true and false like the decent man between the rigidly virtuous and thoroughly profligate hated and despised by both can never long support itself and with this the first part of the epistle concludes  ii ver    at timons villa etc as the first part ended with exposing the works of taste without sense the second begins with a description from    to     of false magnificence without either sense or taste in the gardens buildings tablefurniture library and way of living of lord timon who in none of these could distinguish between greatness and vastness between regularity and form between dignity and fastus or between learning and pedantry but what then says the poet here resuming the great principle of his philosophy which these moral epistles were wrote to illustrate and consequently on which they are all regulated though heaven visits with a taste the wealthy fool and needs no rod  yet the punishment is confined as it ought and the evil is turned to the benefit of others for  hence the poor are clothed the hungry fed health to himself and to his infants bread the labrer bears what his hard heart denies his charitable vanity supplies   ver     another age etc but now a difficulty sticks with me answers an objector this load of evil still remains a monument of folly to future ages an encumbrance to the plain on which it stands and a nuisance to the neigbourhood around as filling it  with imitating fools for men are apt to take the example next at hand and aptest of all to take a bad one no fear of that replies the poet from     to     nothing absurd or wrong is exempt from the jurisdiction of time which is always sure to do full justice on it another age shall see the golden ear imbrown the slope and nod on the parterre deep harvests bury all his pride has pland and laughing ceres reassume the land for the prerogative of  time shall make it grow is only due to the designs of true taste joined to use and it is use alone that sanctifies expense and nothing but the sanctity of that can arrest the justice of time and thus

taste is full of examples of the false  iii ver     who then shall grace etc we come now to the third and last part from     to the end and as in the first the poet had given examples of wrongjudged magnificence in things of taste without sense and in the second an example of others without either sense or taste so the third is employed in two illustrious examples of magnificence in planting and building where both sense and taste highly prevail the one in him to whom this epistle is addressed and the other in the noble person whose excellent character bore so conspicuous a part in the foregoing who then shall grace or who improve the soil who plants like bathurst or who builds like boil where in the fine description he gives of these two species of magnificence he artfully insinuates that though when executed in a true taste the great end and aim of both be the same viz the general good in use or ornament yet that their progress to this end is carried on in direct contrary courses that in planting the private advantage of the neighborhood is first promoted till by time it rises up to a public benefit whose ample lawns are not ashamed to feed the milky heifer and deserving steed whose rising forests not for pride or show but future buildings future navies grow on the contrary the wonders of architecture ought first to be bestowed on the public bid harbors open public ways extend bid temples worthier of the god ascend bid the broad arch the dangerous flood contain the mole projected break the roaring main and when the public has been properly strengthened and adorned then and not till then the works of private magnificence may take place this was the order observed by those two great empires from whom we received all we have of this polite

profane and sacred history has ever been the more peculiar object of divine vengeance but awkward pride intimates such abilities in its owner as eases us of the apprehension of much mischief from it so that the poet supposes such a one secure from the serious resentment of heaven though it may permit fate or fortune to bring him into the public contempt and ridicule which his native badness of heart so well deserves  ver    the earl of burlington was then publishing the designs of inigo jones and the antiquities of rome by palladio  ver    and of one beauty many blunders make because the

both from their different natures and forms for the one being for holy service and the other only for civil amusement it is impossible that the profuse and lascivious ornaments of the latter should become the reverence retinue and sanctity of the other nor will any examples of this vanity of ornament in the sacred buildings of antiquity justify this imitation for those ornaments might be very suitable to a temple of bacchus or venus which would ill become the sobriety and purity of the present religion  again we should consider that the usual form of a theater would only permit the architectonic ornaments to be placed on the outward face whereas those of a church may be as commodiously and are more properly put within particularly in great and close pentup cities where the incessant driving of the smoke in a little time corrodes and destroys all outward ornaments of this kind especially if the members as is the common taste be small and little  ver  0 turn arcs of

of as they must feel for themselves though they will not see for the public  ver    often have you hinted etc something there is more needful than expense to convince a great man of so strange a paradox that taste cannot be bought even after it is paid for will need a very broad hint indeed especially when followed by another as strange that there is  something previous even to taste  it is

rather deifying the genius of the place in order to be consulted as an oracle has produced one of the noblest and most sublime descriptions of design that poetry could express where this genius while presiding over the work is represented by little and little as advancing from a simple adviser to a creator of all the beauties of improved nature in a variety of bold metaphors and allusions all rising one above another till they complete the unity of the general idea  first the genius of the place tells the waters or only simply gives directions then he helps the ambitious hill or is a fellow laborer then again he scoops the circling theater or works alone or in chief afterward rising fast in our idea of dignity he calls in the country alluding to the orders of princes in their

or bad as it happens one of which is sure to do its business and that soon therefore it is with great propriety he says that the terraces desert their walls which implies purpose and violence in their

the pencil and in the happy improvement of it by time to understand what is meant by supporting which is a term of art common both to planting and painting we must consider what things make the natural defect or weakness of a rude uncultivated plain and these are the having a disagreable flatness and the not having a proper termination but a wood rightly disposed takes away the one and gives what is wanting of the other  the parts unite the utmost which art can do when it does its full office is to give the work a consent of parts but it is time only that can make the union here spoken of there being the same difference between these as between a simple contract and a consummation so in painting the skill of the master can go no further in the chromatic part than to set those colors together which have a natural friendship and sympathy for each other but nothing but time can unite and incorporate their tints and strength of shade contends with strength of light and now the work becomes a very picture which the poet informs us of in the sublime way of poetical instruction by setting that picture before our eyes and not merely a picture but a perfect one in which the lights and shades not only bear a proportion to one another in their force which is implied in the word contends but are both at their height which the word strength signifies as the use of the singular number in the terms shade and light alludes to another precept of the art that not only the shades and lights should be great and broad but that the masses of the clairobscure in a groupe of objects

being wellcolourd shows this ornament not only to be very absurd but very odious too and has a peculiar beauty as in one instance of false taste viz an injudicious choice in imitation he gives in the epithet employed the suggestion of another which is an injudicious manner of it for those disagreeable objects which when painted give pleasure if colored after nature in relief become shocking as a toad or dead carcass in waxwork yet these things are the delight of all people of bad taste however the ornament itself pretends to science and would justify its use by antiquity though it betrays the most miserable ignorance of it the serpent amongst the ancients was sacred and full of venerable mysteries now things do not excite ideas so much according to their own natural impressions as by fictitious ones arising from foreign and accidental combinations consequently the view of this animal raised in them nothing of that abhorrence which it is wont to do in us but on the contrary very agreeable sensations correspondent to those foreign associations hence and more especially because the serpent was the peculiar symbol of health it became an extreme proper ornament to the genial rooms of the ancients while we who are strangers to all this superstition yet make ourselves liable to one much more absurd which is idolizing the very fashions that arose from it but if these pretenders to taste can so widely mistake it is no wonder that those who pretend to none i mean the verbal critics should a little hallucinate in this matter i remember when the short latin inscription on shakespeares monument was first set up and in the very style of elegant and simple antiquity the newspapers were full of these small critics in which the only observation that looked like learning was founded in this ignorance of taste and antiquity one of these critics objected to the word mors in the inscription because the roman writers of the purest times scrupled to employ it but in its stead used an improper that is a figurative word or otherwise a circumlocution but had he considered that it was their superstition of lucky and unlucky words which occasioned this delicacy he must have seen that a christian writer in a christian inscription acted with great judgment in avoiding so senseless an affectation of what he miscalls classical expression  ver     is this a

hands and diffuses expense more than a good one this recurs to what is laid down in book i epist     0    and in the epistle preceding this     etc  ver     and laughing ceres reassume the land the great beauty of this line is merely owing to the art of the poet by which he has so disposed a trite classical figure as not only to make it do it is common office of representing a very plentiful harvest but also to assume the image of nature reestablishing herself in her rights and mocking the vain efforts of false magnificence which would keep her out of them  ver       0 it is use alone that sanctifies expense and splendour borrows all her rays from sense here the poet to make the examples of good taste the better understood introduces them with a summary of his precepts in these two sublime lines for the consulting use is beginning with sense and the making splendour or taste borrow all its rays from thence is going on with sense after she has led us up to taste the art of this can never be sufficiently admired but the expression is equal to the thought this sanctifying of expense gives us the idea of something consecrated and set apart for sacred uses and indeed it is the idea under which it may be properly considered for wealth employed according to the intention of the great donor is its true consecration and the real uses of humanity were certainly first in his intention  ver         etc till kings  bid harbors open etc the poet after having touched upon the proper objects of magnificence and expense in the private works of great men comes to those great and
