arguments about the alteration of triennial elections of parliament in a letter to a friend in the country sir your last letter expresses your great concerns and fears about the design now on foot for the alteration of the act for the frequent meeting and calling of parliaments in one particular that is the changing the term for elections of parliament from three to more years and at the same time gives me an account of the several objections which make the greatest noise around you upon that subject the same fears and the same objections i find to be very common and very warmly propagated in all conversations here in town  for my self i acknowledge that it is with me in this case as it is in many others of importance the first surprise gave me the like uneasiness to what you express but i am very well satisfied that the most likely way to cure that uneasiness is to debate the matter as friends and to examine whether that surprise be the force of mere prejudice or of good judgment and for this i am very sure i am in one respect at least well qualified that as to my own private advantage or interest it is not of the least importance to me whether the parliament may with the consent of the king sit three years or seven years or twenty years i have no designs nor views no piques nor resentments to incline me one way or other and therefore if you will put your self into the same posture of mind we will if you please enter upon this subject  in all debates of this nature there are two principal points which will comprehend under them all other particulars the one is whether the thing proposed be lawful with regard to the nature of our constitution the other is whether it be expedient or useful to the good ends which ought always to be in the view of those who make laws  the lawfulness of the thing cannot be denied by any persons though never so great enemies to the doing it nor do i find amongst all the topics employed against it that any thing of moment is  against the right or authority of the  legislature to do it it is no more a fundamental of our constitution that a new parliament must be summoned every three years than at any other interval it is equally just as far as right and authority are concerned for the king lords and commons to six it for one term as for another and if it were not out of their right to make that great alteration which fixed it for three years it certainly cannot be out of their right to make a much less alteration by fixing it once more to another term  as to the sense and mind of the electors the truth of the matter is this they are supposed to have no other view in their choice of persons than to send such to parliament as they think best qualified by their estates wisdom and integrity to do whatever is to be done in parliament without regard to the time of their sitting there and there is no other end in the electing representatives but that they from time to time may make and alter laws in such manner as best to consult and promote the good of the whole community the very election is and must be supposed to empower the elected persons faithfully and impartially to do every thing that is necessary or expedient for the preservation and establishment of the common interest whether it falls in with the humors or opinions of the electors or not this brings us to the only point to be considered when any alteration of a former changeable law is proposed and that is whether all things considered it be expedient and useful  and of this as far as the time past is concerned experience is the best judge when a law has been long tried and the consequences and effects of it in a nation have been many years open and sensible it requires but little thought to judge whether it be best to continue it in every respect as it is or to model it anew and now if you please we will consider the effect the triennial elections have had amongst our selves at home and then it will be proper to think of the effect they have had and still must naturally have abroad  at home the least evil is that the tempers and spirits of men are put into a fermen and boiled up into a rage which never is cooled because the returns at which this rage is useful to some persons or other are so quick that it is not politic in such men to let it cease nor perhaps possible for them to make it cease even if they were willing to do so riots tumults mutual abuses odious nicknames personal affronts are kept alive and warm from three year to three year by men of design and dexterity in the management of other mens passions improved and heightened by such quick returns these are what we see and feel of the effects of it upon the temper of a nation that if ever it is ruined can be ruined by nothing but its divided affections and interests  besides this there could not be contrived a method more effectual to the debauchery of the subjects morals not only in one but in all respects than this has proved bribery known and open without a remedy which supposes a corruption of mind and naturally leads to an insensibility to every thing great and honorable and by degrees to a perfect disregard to every thing sacred and useful a scene of bestial intemperance encouraged and paid for in many places for fear friendship should cool if it be not kept hot by such methods  and the crimes that often accompany this need not be mentioned the least is a general disposition in men to leave the thoughts of diligence and industry in their business for the more agreeable entertainments of idleness and a luxurious beggary  i do not suppose or argue that this alteration of the term will put a full stop to this corruption of morals either as to bribery or to the other instances named but it is certain that the returns being not so quick the tempers of men must in the nature of things become much more easy to one another by degrees which is itself an advantage greatly to be valued it is certain that the scent of bribery cannot be so strong nor the avowal of it so constant when there is such an intermission and as for that neverceasing current of debauchery requisite for so frequent elections it must be this way interrupted and in a good degree broken into the crimes often accompanying it must diminish and the men brought up to laborious callings must exchange their idleness for industry and become much more useful to their families and the public  i mention not the ruin both of the estates and morals of gentlemen so frequently candidates at our elections they know best how well they can bear such evils and whether it tends to make themselves better patriots to their country or better fathers to their own families that they are to make their way by so quick returns of bribery and corruption  we have hitherto considered the ill effect of these evil consequences at home supposing them to terminate in the concerns of private men but this supposition is not to be continued for you will see presently that all these things have a visible influence upon the public the general topic amongst the adversaries of this alteration as well those who hate as those who love liberty truly so called is the seeming advantage of this part of the act to that great and lovely good i call it seeming because as it never was designed at first by many of the most zealous promoters of it for any thing but to cramp the endeavors of a good prince for the settling our liberties so it has never had any better lasting effect that way than they designed it should have but as i think visibly tends in its consequences to the destruction of our legal liberties the reason is short and plain nothing in the world can make men more supinely negligent of the public interest or dispose them more to receive their chains than a state of bribery corruption debauchery and idleness and this is the constant state of most of our electors merely through the quick returns and the pleasing prospect of elections the more lasting and uninterrupted this state is the less sensible are they of the evils it inclines them to they are by degrees brought to think the highest bidder to have the best right to their votes and will act in time agreeably to that thought whether the money be offered them from abroad or at home the little interruption to their vices and their expectations is the thing which makes the danger so great and this is owing to the frequent returns of elections at so short certain periods of time  nor does this argument touch the electors only but the elected also to a very great degree for as long as humane nature is capable of corruption as long as there is a probability or even a possibility of any part of mankind being induced to sell their country and their posterity for a present advantage to themselves so long it is evident to a demonstration that gentlemen who have by so frequent returns of chargeable elections exhausted their estate and impoverished their families will be much more likely to seek or to embrace opportunities of reimbursing themselves and preventing their own immediate ruin at the expense of the public liberty and security much more likely i say to act this part than if the term were made longer and if by that means they might hope to be at rest from expense for a much longer time  add to this that personal and partyrevenge which is of all others the most strong principle in the bulk of men never fails to actuate both the candidates and the electors if ever our ruin be effected it is too probable this will be the great engine of it and let every one judge whether any thing could be devised more likely either to raise or actuate or preserve that spirit in its keenness and bitterness than the triennial returns of elections and the expectation of them or whether any thing can give us any respite from that spirit and its fatal consequences but an alteration of those returns to a longer distance  there is another consideration very well worth mentioning on this subject which is the distribution of justice in the countries it is manifest that nothing has diverted the course of it from its proper current so much as the partyviews of men kept up to such a degree by the expected returns of frequent elections and that nothing can recall it again but some rest from those views which turned it aside men will not have the temptation and therefore not the inclination either to suspend justice or to act contrary to it in many of those instances in which now their constant hopes or fears actuated by the frequency of elections are too apt to draw them aside besides that when some intermission is given to the heats and quarrels of neighbors the occasions and opportunities of partiality or injustice must in good measure cease  the effects which i have now gone over are but too certain as they are the natural product of the passions of men in a divided nation and they are evils which will be by degrees at least very much abated by the present design  we have hitherto considered our triennial elections their influence upon us at home now let us consider what effect they have had and still naturally have abroad and here it must be remembered that we are a nation not separated in interest as we are in situation from the rest of europe we have enemies at home acting in concert with enemies abroad and friends abroad without regard to whose interests and alliances we must sooner or later become a sacrifice to those enemies we have a pretender to guard against many here are his professed friends and many more act either blindly or designedly with those who are so bearing a sensible part in their interests and ever encouraging or at least not discouraging them that which keeps up the views of those abroad who think it their concern to make us the scene of civil war if not a province to themselves under that pretender that i say alone which keeps up their views is the knowing they have friends here and the finding that these friends are never in despair but always representing their cause as promising well and that which keeps them in this temper is the constant expectation of new elections in which they hope for more but are certain at least of this advantage that our heats and hatreds and desire of revenge are still perpetuated and improved this is constantly represented abroad and with such success that they who wish evil to our happy establishment seem really to believe it and they who wish well to it receive impression enough from it to look upon us with diffidence as a people always fluctuating and uncertain it was this great disadvantage arising from our condition at home that brought king william to make a peace even against his own good judgment and his own great views for which nothing could be urged but that distress to which our wretched and uneasy state here had reduced his affairs and no wonder now if after that great unhappiness and what is still more dreadful after a late fatal experience the best friends we have abroad cannot be so confident of us as our interest makes it requisite they should be in a word our enemies both abroad and at home cannot be reduced even one step toward a state of despair in the methods we are in at present nor our best friends be thoroughly assured of our secure estate the former must look upon us still with a good degree of contempt and the latter with a great deal of uneasiness and diffidence till we have some resting time to settle not only the tempers but the affairs and the interests of this nation which never will be done as there is reason to fear as long as parliaments continue limited to the present term  this puts me in mind of another very material point which though absolutely necessary to procure us the confidence of our friends and to command respect from our enemies yet seems impossible to be effected without a greater steddiness of counsels a more uninterrupted application to public business and a more mature and disinterested deliberation than the experience we have had of frequent elections gives room to hope for this is the paying off the debts of the nation which must otherwise eat out the very vitals of the public and expose us to the greatest danger from such foreign powers as are using the most violent methods to be before hand with us in this signal advantage to work out this inveterate evil there appears but one method consistent with the faith of parliamentary securities which ought to be preserved inviolable and at the same time free from the odium of imposing new taxes on the country and in which consequently the landed and the monied interest would be likely to join without eithers thinking themselves in the least aggrieved this is to raise and support the public credit to such a height as may enable the government to borrow at a lower interest what may pay off such debts as carry a greater which was attempted last year but hindered by the rebellion now experience shows that public credit will be subject to perpetual fluctuations and inequalities or even fall to an ebb from whence it is next to impossible to make it reascend while the measures of one three years are liable to be unravelled and reversed by the three next succeeding and those again by the next and whilst under the shelter of frequent elections such tumults commotions and disorders are introduced as however opposite in themselves conspire in shaking the foundation of all government keep mens minds in suspense and make them look on every thing as precarious that is any ways involved with the public  after many enquiries i can meet with but one good event in favor of the triennial term for elections which a long experience has furnished us with and that is that it is supposed to have been the occasion of throwing out the destructive bill of commerce some gentlemen not daring to vote for it out of fear of their next elections but this you will see cuts both ways for as gentlemen may by accident not do a bad thing for fear of their next election so it is as plain that they may as often not do the most necessary good thing if it happens to be unpopular for the same fear so that this holds at least equally against that bill as for it but then many who knew those times will deny the fact and affirm that a multitude of little piques and great passions concurred in that affair and that the awe of electors happened at that time to have but little share in it private history would be useful to us upon this occasion but this we all saw in public that however that fear might then be supposed to work so far as to hinder those few gentlemen from openly espousing that fatal bill it did not work so far as to keep them immediately from entering into an address and voting for such methods as must have been as fatal as that bill it self if providence had not interposed what would it have availed us that the bill had not passed then if these designs at the same time on foot had prevailed and what does it avail to say that the triennial term did us that good supposing it so when it is plain it had not the power to preserve that good and that the same persons who seemed to fear it yet were induced to undo their own work and to enter into measures which must have ended in the same evils and indeed in universal destruction it signifies little therefore whether this was the great occasion of that lucky incident or not because it is plain it had not power enough to hinder the ill effects of that bill in another method nor would have hindered them had not something else intervened but supposing it had certainly that one particular so purely accidental cannot be set against a train of constant and too certain evil consequences which we feel every day we live these evil consequences are so many undeniablearguments for an alteration of it and weigh exceedingly and particularly at this juncture when all our happiness depends upon the firm establishment of our excellent king upon this throne when all our enemies at home and abroad visibly place their hopes in our disturbances owing to nothing so much as to the constant expectation of triennial elections when all our true friends both here and elsewhere wait with impatience to see our security firmly and thoroughly established when the going on with proper measures for such establishment has been unavoidably put off by the attention given to the rebellion and so the longer continuance of this parliament is become particularly necessary and when we all may observe if we please that though the rebellion be in great measure quelled yet the spirit of it is so far from being laid asleep that it walks about still even at noonday in defiance of all authority and with a strubborness never to be reduced to a settled despair without some such method as is now talked of  these particulars i say are so many undeniable arguments for an alteration of the term of years fixed in the act unless it shall appear that the objections against doing it are of more weight and importance those which i have been able to hear of together with such as you tell me are most talked of in the country we will now just run over  the most general objection and that which seems in reality to lie at the bottom of all the rest is that this step will be so unpopular among the electors and raise such a clamor all over the nation as must for ever sink the interest of those who have any share in promoting it to this i answer that it will wholly depend on the parliament it self to render this proceeding popular or unpopular by the right or wrong use they shall make of the prolongation thereby accruing to themselves if their afterbehaviour should be such as to show they had no wiser nor more generous view in making this alteration than merely to save themselves the hazard trouble and expense of a new election they must no doubt be content to reap the rewards of their selfishness by forfeiting all title to the future good will of their electors but if their zeal and industry for promoting the ease and safety of the nation shall appear to rise in proportion to the time allowed them for accomplishing the great work they have begun the end will sufficiently commend the means and the advantages arising to the whole kingdom from this change will easily reconcile it to all such with whom a good man ought ever to wish to maintain the character of popularity it will certainly be in the power of those who most apprehend the odium and unpopularity of this action to secure it from all possible misrepresentations by making use of the power it will bring with it to just and wise purposes to ease the debts to perfect the tranquillity and to perpetuate the peace of the nation raising money by taxes upon land windows soap or any thing else is always unpopular and always raises clamours when it is first resolved upon every thing that has been done for the security of his present majesty the suspending the habeas corpus act without which we must have been destroyed the granting him a power to raise and hire forces for his own and the nations defense the putting his friends into any possibility of consulting his safety and honor every particular of this sort has been represented all over the nation in such colors that it has been highly unpopular and been attended with great clamours but necessity and expedience are the things to be considered in all such points these will always make things pleasing to the true friends of the nation but in order to be popular with the kings enemies the first step he must take must be to lay down his crown and if his ministers be resolved to be moved by clamours they must resign their posts and yield up all power to those who wish to destroy them the only consideration is whether the nations affairs require a thing to be done when that is fixed popular or unpopular clamours or no clamours ought not to affect any farther than about the manner of doing it every thing that touches particular mens purses or retrenches from their luxury will generally be unpopular with those men but a little time makes such things easy when the public finds it is advantage in it and mens passions have had time to cool  another thing which i find generally shows it self at first hearing of the design is an uneasiness as if this were repealing the act when in truth i will venture to affirm that it is so far from that that it is indeed restoring it to its best design and making it effectual to all that good which was originally purposed and intended by any of those honest patriots who joined in the first framing of it the designs were that a king of england should not be without a parliament and that one and the same parliament should have a term fixed beyond which it should not be in the power of the prince to continue it and in both these respects the act will be left as it was all the difference is that the parliament then in being thought three years the proper term experience has assured us of a multitude of evils proceeding from so quick a return of elections and therefore in that part of the act and in that only is the alteration intended in order to remedy or abate those evils without bringing in greater  another reason against it is taken from a suspicion of some private and personal views in the kings ministers as if the whole aim were to establish themselves for so much longer time in their power but i observe that the same persons who make this objection generally contradict it by affirming that the ministers have nothing to fear and that this present design is wholly unnecessary because a court may be sure of another house of commons to their mind they must think the ministry very weak not to see this which is so plain that the influence of a court has hardly ever failed in this point though at the same time the gentlemen who make this objection are apt to insinuate the necessity of some measures for this purpose which cannot be very agreeable to an honest and incorrupt ministry however in the opinion of such as allow this it cannot be having a view to themselves but a general view to the nation at home and to the interest and glory of it abroad which engages the ministers in this design they who know the nature of such affairs judge the contrary that ministers as to their own private interest might more probably find their account in new parliaments than in one continued experience shows that the most courtly parliaments have turned uncourtly in their long sitting and therefore this design cannot be necessary for any private selfinterested views of their own because it is allowed that such ends if they have any might be served as well at least in the former method as in this they who find a biass in their minds against every thing proposed by a court let it be what it will should consider in this case whether it be not probable that the present views and designs are of a public nature rather than of a private and should act accordingly without prejudice or affection as they think it requisite or not for the establishment of the king and the nation and for the more effectual destroying all the hopes of the enemies of both  the most powerful objection of all is that the alteration now designed may make it much more likely that under a bad prince sometime or other arbitrary power may b brought in for the present i am sure we have nothing to fear we have now a king upon the throne whose s is fashioned to right and justice and whose great enquiry upon all occasions is what our constitution and what our laws require of him we have a prince in view to succeed him whose native honor and integrity guard him against all suspicion but i grant this may not always be our happiness either in possession or in prospect and therefore if this alleration could be proved i should be moved another way than i am at present there will be more time i acknowledge in any one particular parliament for attempts to be made that way but as i think not at all more likely to succeed on the contrary there is more likelihood that gentlem should by degrees become even ready to part with a constitution for which there must be such contention by bribery and all the arts of iniquity every three years than if it were otherwise and then again supposing a parliament chosen for three years only a prince resolutely bent upon doing it in a paliamentary way prepared with treasures and favors might make such attempts before that term be expired that none could resist who would not as certainly go on farther in their integrity one may venture to affirm that a parliament which keeps its integrity for three years will discourage the making any such attempts for the remaining four and to give an instance if i remember right the parliament which gave up the liberties of sweden gave that fatal stroke within the term of three years whenever a cour can be bad enough for such a design they will first take care at the time of election to set up persons capable of the same bad design and then there is no difference between three or seven years only here remember what i have before observed to you that the quick returns of triennal elections tend much more to that corruption bribery dissoluteness of manners as well as partyrevenge which pave the way to the loss of liberty than the longer term now proposed can do one might appeal to any who know the world whether it be not more probable as i have urged already that the elected gentlemen themselves impoverished by so frequent returns of their great charges will be inclined to listen to the offer made them with so pernicious a view than if the returns were not so frequent and besides this whether the influence that way from the powerful motive of partyrevenge will not have vastly more weight when it  roused and irritated and set on fire by so quick returns of contention than if it were otherwise and what is of great moment in my opinion since it is plain that every instance of wickedness and diviion tending to destruction is so heightened and inflmed by the quick returns of elections there must be much greater encouragement to a foreign enemy to interpose with his money to purchase our ruin in a triennial choice than in a septennial especially now before we are well settled upon that bottom which is the only foundation of our happiness it is well known how far the neighboring powers intermeddle in the elections of poland and germany and with how much success they send their agents and factors to them and what an abuse of liberty this corruption has introduced in those countries all the world can testify nor can we think the election of a british parliament so very indifferent a thing to some neighboring powers especially at certain junctures that they should think one or two hundred thousand pounds misapplied in purchasing votes to their mind and i can say that this is no whimsical supposition because i have my self seen an intercepted letter written from hence into france just before the last election by a friend to the pretender who had taken the oaths to king george plainly hinting both that such a thing was then expected from the king of france and that he did not doubt the success of it i think this alone is enough to allarm any true lover of his country in the present situation of our affairs and of those of all europe  there is one more objection i hear is often urged that we should have severely blamed such a design in the late administration nay that great horror was expressed at the very supposition of the thing at that time i grant this and that the horror was just and reasonable but upon what was this founded not upon the unlawfulness of the thing it self not upon the impossibility of it is ever being fit to be done but upon a too wellgrounded assurance that they who were then in power must have meant it whenever they did it for the same end to which their other acts tended and that was the utter ruin of the grandalliance and of all the hopes of our best friends abroad and the inspiring full vigor into the cause of france and the pretender this was the ground of all just dread upon that head had it been so that they had designed it manifestly for the firmer security of the protestant succession here and the greater support of the grand alliance abroad no true britain could have had ground of complaint but must have acknowledged if it tended and was nessary to so good ends that it was not only lawful but highly praiseworthy an instance parallel to it may quite take off the edg of this objection what honest mind would not have been filled with uneasiness and terror supposing they had then attmpted to suspend the habeas corpus act by which they might have confined all men of great capacity and influence whom they knew to be averse to their proceedings in favor of france but would this have been any argument why the friends of king george should not have secured him and the nation by such a suspension when made necessary by the treasonable practices of his avowed enemies or because we blame a thing lawful in it self when we see it designed for our  therefore must we be averse to a lawful thing designed and tending to our preservation this is the whole strength of that objection which yet i believe weighs with many for want of considering it  as for the late ministers i verily believe they designed no such thing and my reason for believing so is that they did not at all want it nay that it would have done them more hurt than good their designs were such as were to be managed solely by artifice the great engines they made use of for keeping up a spirit against all truth and right were those very mobbs riots and tumults which alone could keep a multitude in such a ferment as to make them admire and press for their own ruin they thought it their interest to govern by the passions of the crowd and were very peculiarly dextrous in the management of them they were possessed of the full cry and noise of the nation and likely in all probability so to continue this was a much surer hold to them and to their designs than the continuance of one and the same parliament and therefore they never attempted it but certainly as that same spirit which was then raised for the service of the pretender made it unnecessary for them so it being still alive and full of evil influences upon our happiness this makes it highly prudent in others to do that in order to suppress and extirpate it which they in their wisdom would not do for fear of quieting what they expected benefit from their security consisted in keeping up that vile spirit to the height it is the security of the king and his government to have a stop put to it and to remove every opportunity that may give fuel and encouragement to it as far as is consistent with the constitution and liberties of the nation  all these considerations put together have i confess wholly taken off my first surprise and the same considerations make me hope that all true friends to the king and to the public happiness which now depends entirely upon the firm establishment of the present royal family will not let their general suspicion or their particular biass have such power over them as to move them to join with their own enemies in a point in which if they should by any unforeseen accident have success i am confident they would very heartily as well as fruitlesly repe of their own proceedings when persons who have always shown themselves enemies to liberty and professors of the principles of slavery who have ever expressed a hatred of the revolution and of every thing built upon it and have ever been the supports of the popish and jacobite interest in these nations when such i say put on a zeal for liberty it is a moral demonstration that it is all a mckshew and that they themselves think quite otherwise of what they oppose than they would seem to think if it were really their opinion that the alteration now proposed would either help the cause which they have espoused or be any prejudice to a government which they hate i am very confident they would not enter into the opposition of it with that warmth and heat which they now profess but they foresee that their hopes must in proportion abate with those heats and disturbances which alone keep them alive and for this reason it is that they now take into their mouths the rds and topics which they have ever hitherto ridiculed and exploded in order to keep off the tng which they heartily hate the settlement of the present government in peace and quiet at home and in honor and glory abroad  and this is one very good reason why all who truly wish well to that settlement should unite in the alteration of that which is the chief if not the only thing left to keep up the spirits and designs of its enemies but if when it is in our power to put some stop to our present corruptions and distractions and to establish the glory of our king and the happiness of our country in a method perfectly confident with all our rights and liberties we are guided by the insinuations of those who hate us and refuse to do it we must thank our selves for all that follows it will lie at our door to answer for all the consequences of such a neglect from these with whom we join in it we have no returns to expect but contempt reproaches and insults  in fine i can consider the triennial return of our elections no otherwise than as what has made us and still continues us the most divided and most corrupted of nations what was at first by many contrived and still in its own nature tends to oppose the designs of the best kings and to promote those of the worst leading to an universal debauchery of the manners and tempers of the electors as well as to make the elected themselves weary enough of such perpetual contests and charge to incline some time or other to thoughts which would not otherwise find admittance influencing the people to think easily of becoming a prey to the highest bidder keeping up the spirits of our common enemies and creating diffidence and uneasiness in our best friends introducing and increasing all excesses of violence and mutual revenge serving a multitude of bad purposes which have a peculiar malignity at this particular juncture without having one good effect fit to be named in opposition to them and all this occasioned by the shortness of the interval allowed either to put an end to such evils or to cultivate any thing that is good to cure all these entirely nothing can perhaps be thought of but what would introduce greater to apply something that may put an end to some of them and abate and diminish the rest is a matter that deserves the regard of every good briton and i believe at this time nothing at all effectual can be thought of without an alteration of the triennial elections i am
