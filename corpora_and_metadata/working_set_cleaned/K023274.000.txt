prospects on the rubicon or an investigation into the causes and consequences of the politics to be agitated at the meeting of parliament  london printed for j debrett piccadilly mdcclxxxvii  preface an expression in the british parliament respecting the american war alluding to julius caesar having passed the rubicon has on several occasions introduced that river as the figurative river of war  fortunately for england she is yet on the peaceable side of the rubicon but as the flames once kindled are not always easily extinguished the hopes of peace are not so clear as before the late mysterious dispute began  but while the calm lasts it may answer a very good purpose to take a view of the prospects consistent with the maxim that he that goes to war should first sit down and count the cost  the nation has a young minister at its head fond of himself and deficient in experience and instances have often shown that judgment is a different thing to genius and that the affairs of a nation are but unsafely trusted where the benefit of experience is wanting  illustrations have been drawn from the circumstances of the war before last to decorate the character of the present minister and perhaps they have been greatly overdrawn for the management must have been bad to have done less than what was then done when we impartially consider the means the force and the money employed  it was then great britain and america against france singly for spain did not join till nearly the end of the war the great number of troops which the american colonies then raised and paid themselves were sufficient to turn the scale if all other parts had been equal france had not at that time attended to naval affairs so much as she has done since and the capture of french sailors before any declaration of war was made which however it may be justified upon policy will always be ranked among the clandestine arts of war assured a certain but unfair advantage against her because it was like a man administering a disabling dose overnight to the person whom he intends to challenge in the morning  prospects on the rubicon etc right by chance and wrong by system are things so frequently seen in the political world that it becomes a proof of prudence neither to censure nor applaud too soon  the rubicon is past was once given as a reason for prosecuting the most expensive war that england ever knew sore with the event and groaning beneath a galling yoke of taxes she has again been led ministerially on to the shore of the same delusive and fatal river without being permitted to know the object or the reason why  expensive preparations have been gone into fears alarms dangers apprehensions have been mistically held forth as if the existence of the nation was at stake and at last the mountain has brought forth a dutch mouse  whoever will heartily review the present national characters of england and france cannot but be struck with surprise at the change that is taking place the people of france are beginning to think for themselves and the people of england resigning up the privilege of thinking  the affairs of holland have been the bubble of the day and a tax is to be laid on shoes and boots so say the newspapers for the service of the stadtholder of holland this will undoubtedly do honor to the nation by verifying the old english proverb over shoes over boots  but though democrites could scarcely have forbore laughing at the folly yet as serious argument and sound reasoning are preferable to ridicule it will be best to quit the vein of unprofitable humor and give the cause a fair investigation but before we do this it may not be improper to take a general review of sdy political matters that will naturally lead to a better understanding of the subject  what has been the event of all the wars of england but an amazing accumulation of debt and an unparalleled burden of taxes sometimes the pretense has been to support one outlandish cause and sometimes another at one time austria at another time prussia and so on but the consequence has always been taxes a few men have enriched themselves by jobs and contracts and the groaning multitude bore the burden what has england gained by war since the year      only fifty years ago to recompense her for two hundred millions sterling incurred as a debt within that time and under the annual interest of which besides what was incurred before she is now groaning nothing at all  the glare of fancied glory has often been held up and the shadowy recompense imposed itself upon the senses wars that might have been prevented have been madly gone into and the end has been debt and discontent a sort of something which man cannot account for is mixed in his composition and renders him the subject of deception by the very means he takes not to be deceived  that jealousy which the individuals of every nation feels at the supposed designs of foreign powers fits them to be the prey of ministers and of those among themselves whose trade is war or whose livelihood is jobs and contracts confusion to the politics of europe and may every nation be at war in six months was a toast given in the hearing of the writer  the man was in court to the ministry for a job  ye gentle graces if any such there be who preside over human actions how must ye weep at the viciousness of man  when we consider for the feelings of nature cannot be dismissed the calamities of war and the miseries it inflicts upon the human species the thousands and tens of thousands of every age and sex who are rendered wretched by the event surely there is something in the heart of man that calls upon him to think surely there is some tender cord tuned by the hand of its creator that still struggles to emit in the hearing of the soul a note of sorrowing sympathy let it then be heard and let man learn to feel that the true greatness of a nation is founded on principles of humanity and that to avoid a war when her own existence is not endangered and wherein the happiness of man must be wantonly sacrificed is a higher principle of true honor than madly to engage in it  but independent of all civil and moral considerations there is no possible event that a war could produce either to england or france on the present occasion that could in the most distant proportion recompense to either the expense she must be at war involves in its progress such a train of unforseen and unsupposed circumstances such a combination of foreign matters that no human wisdom can calculate the end it has but one thing certain and that is increase of taxes the policy of european courts is now so cast and their interest so interwoven with each other that however easy it may be to begin a war the weight and influence of interfering nations compel even the conqueror to unprofitable conditions of peace  commerce and maritime strength are now becoming the fashion or rather the rage of europe and this naturally excites in them a combined wish to prevent either england or france increasing its comparative strength by destroying or even relatively weakening the other and therefore whatever views each may have at the commencement of a war new enemies will arise as either gains the advantage and continual obstacles ensue to embarrass success  the greatness of lewis the fourteenth made europe his enemy and the same cause will produce the same consequence to any other european power that nation therefore only is truly wise who contenting herself with the means of defense creates to herself no unnecessary enemies by seeking to be greater than the system of europe admits the monarch or the minister who exceeds this line knows but little of his business it is what the poet on another occasion calls   the pint where sense and nonsense join perhaps there is not a greater instance or the folly of calculating upon events than are to be found in treaties of alliance as soon as they have answered the immediate purpose of either of the parties they are but little regarded pretenses afterward are never wanting to explain them away nor reasons to render them abortive and if half the money which nations lavish on speculative alliances were reserved for their own immediate purpose whenever the occasion shall arrive it would be more productively and advantageously employed  monarchs and miniers from  or resentment often contemplate to themselves schemes of future greatness and set out with what appears to th the fairest prospect in the mean while the great wheel of time and fate revolves unobserved and something never dreamed of turns up and blasts the whole a few fancied or unprofitable laurels supply the absence of success and the exhausted nation is huzzad into new taxes  the politics and interests of european courts are so frequently varying with regard to each other that there is no fixing even the probability of their future conduct but the great principle of alliancing seems to be but little understood or little cultivated in courts perhaps the least of all in that of england  no alliance can be operative that does not embrace within itself not only the attachment of the sovereigns but the real interest of the nations  the alliance between france and spain however it may be spoken of as a mere family compact derives its greatest strength from national interest the mines of peru and mexico are the soul of this alliance were those mines extinct the family compact would most probably dissolve  there exists not a doubt in the mind of spain what part england would act respecting those mines could she demolish the maritime power of france and therefore the interest of spain feels itself continually united with france spain have high ideas of honor but they have not the same ideas of english honor they consider england as wholly governed by principles of interest and that whatever she thinks it her interest to do and supposes she has the power of doing she makes very little ceremoney of attempting but this is not all  there is not a nation in europe but what is more satisfied that those mines should be in the possession of spain than in that of any other european nation because the wealth of those mines sufficient to ruin europe in the hands of some of its powers is innocently employed with respect to europe and better and more peaceably distributed among them all through the medium of spain than it would be through that of any other nation this is one of the secret causes that combine so large a part of europe in the interest of france because they cannot but consider her as standing as a barrier to secure to them the free and equal distribution of this wealth throughout all the dominions of europe  this alliance of interest is likewise one of the unseen cements that prevents spain and portugal two nations not very friendly to each other proceeding to hostilities they are both in the same situation and whatever their dislikes may be they cannot fail to consider that by giving way to resentment that would weaken and exhaust themselves each would be exposed a prey to some stronger power  in short this alliance of national interest is the only one that can be trusted and the only one that can be operative all other alliances formed on the mere will and caprice of sovereigns or family connections uncombined with national interests are but the quagmire of politics and never fail to become a loss to that nation who wastes it present substance on the expectancy of distan returns  with regard to holland a man mus know very little of the matter not to know that there exists a stronger principle of rivalship between holland and england i point of commerce than prevails between england and france in point of power and therefore whenever a stadtholder of holland shall see it his interest to unite with the principle of his country and act in concert with the sentiments of the very people who pay him for his services the means now taken by england to render him formidable will operate contrary to the political expectations of the present day  circumstances will produce their own natural effects and no other let the hopes or expectations of man be what they may it is not our doing a thing with the design that it shall answer such or such an end that will cause it to produce that end the means taken must have a natural ability and tendency within themselves to produce no other for it is this and not our wishes or policy that governs the event  the english navigation act was levelled against the interest of the dutch as a whole nation and therefore it is not to be supposed that the catching at the accidental circumstances of one man as in the case of the present stadtholder can combine the interest of that country with this a few years perhaps a less time may remove him to the place where all things are forgotten and his successor contemplating his fathers troubles will be naturally led to reprobate the means that produced them and to repose himself on the interests of his country in preference to the accidental and tumultuous assistance of exterior power  england herself exhibits at this day a species of this kind of policy the present reign by embracing the scotch has tranquilized and conciliated the spirit that disturbed the two former reigns accusations were not wanting at that time to reprobate the policy as tinctured with ingratitude toward those who were the immediate means of the hanover succession the brilliant pen of junius was drawn forth but in vain it enraptured without convincing and though in the plenitude of its rage it might be said to give elegance to bitterness yet the policy survived the blast  what then will be the natural consequence of this expense on account of the stadtholder or of a war entered into from that cause search the various windings and caverns of the human heart and draw from thence the most probable conclusion for this is more to be depended upon than the projects or declarations of ministers  it may do very well for a paragraph in a newspaper or the wild effusions of romantic politicians or the mercenary views of those who wish for war on any occasion or on no occasion at all but for the sake of jobs and contracts to talk of french finesse or french intrigue but the dutch are not a people to be impressed by the finesse or intrigue of france or england or any other nation if there has been any finesse in the case it has been between the electorate of hanover the king of prussia and the stadtholder in which it is most probable the people of england will be finessed out of a sum of money  the dutch as is already observed are not a people open to the impression of finesse it is lost upon them they are impressed by their commercial interest it is the political soul of their country the spring of their actions and when this principle coincides with their ideas of freedom it has all the impulse a dutchman is capable of feeling  the opposition in holland were the enemies of the stadtholder upon a conviction that he was not the friend of their national interests they wanted no impulse but this whether this defect in him proceeded from foreign attachment from bribery or corruption or from the wellknown defect of his understanding is not the point of enquiry it was the effect rather than the cause that irritated the hollanders  if the stadtholder made use of the power he held in the government to expose and endanger the interests and property of the very people who supported him what other incentive does any man in any country require if the hollanders conceived the conduct of the stadtholder injurious to their national interest they had the same right to expel him which england had to expel the stuarts and the interference of england to reestablish him serves only to confirm in the hollanders the same hatred against england which the attempt of lewis the xivth to reestablish the stuarts caused in england against france therefore if the present policy is intended to attach holland to england it goes on a principle exceedingly erroneous  let us now consider the situation of the stadtholder as making another part of the question  he must place the cause of his troubles to some secret influence which governed his conduct during the late war or in other words that he was suspected of being the tool of the then british administration therefore as every part of an argument ought to have its weight instead of charging the french of intriguing with the hollanders the charge more consistently lies against the british ministry for intriguing with the stadtholder and endangering the nation in a war without a sufficient object that which the ministry are now doing confirms the suspicion and explains to the hollanders that collusion of the stadtholder against their national interests which he must wish to have concealed and the explanation does him more hurt than the unnecessary parade of service has done him good  nothing but necessity should have operated with england to appear openly in a case that must put the stadtholder on still worse terms with his countrymen had france made any disposition for war had she armed had she made any one hostile preparation there might then have been some pretense for england taking a step that cannot fail to expose to the world that the suspicions of the hollanders against the stadtholder were well founded and that their cause was just however unsuccessful has been the event  as to the consequence of holland in the scale of europe the great stake say some of the newspapers for which england is contending that is naturally pointed out by her condition as merchants for other nations her interest dictates to her to be a neutral power and this she always will be unless she is made war upon as was the case in the last war and any expectation beyond what is the line of her interest that is beyond neutrality either in england or france will prove abortive it therefore cannot be policy to go to war to effect that at a great expense which will naturally happen of itself and beyond which there is nothing to expect  let holland be allied with england or with france or with neither or with both her national conduct consequently arising out of her circumstances will be nearly the same that is she will be neutral alliances have such a natural tendency to sink into harmless unoperative things that to make them a cause for going to war either to prevent their being formed or to break any already formed is the silliest speculation that war can be made upon or wealth wasted to accomplish it would scarcely be worth the attempt if war could be carried on without expense because almost the whole that can be hoped at the risk and expense of a war is effected by their natural tendency to inactivity  however pompous the declarations of an alliance may be the object of many of them is no other than good will and reciprocally securing as far as such security can go that neither shall join the enemies of the other in any war that may happen but the national circumstances of holland operate to ensure this tranquillity on her part as effectually to the power she is not allied with as the engagement itself does to the power with whom she is allied therefore the security from circumstances is as good as the security from engagement  as to a cordial union of interest between holland and england it is as unnatural to happen as between two individual rivals in the same trade and if there is any step that england could take to put it at a still greater distance it is the part she is now acting she has increased the animosity of holland on the speculative politics of interesting the stadtholder whose future repose depends upon uniting with the opposition in holland as the present reign did with the scotch how foolish then has been the policy how needless the expense of endangering a war on account of the affairs of holland  a cordiality between england and france is less improbable than between england and holland it is not how an englishman feels but how a dutchman feels that decides this question between england and france there is no real rivalship of interest it is more the effect of temper disposition and the jealousy of confiding in each other than any substantial cause that keeps up the animosity but on the part of holland toward england there is over and above the spirit of animosity the more powerful motives of interested commercial rivalship and the galling remembrance of past injuries the making war upon them under lord norths administration when they were taking no part in the hostilities but merely acting the business of merchants is a circumstance that will not easily be forgotten by them on these reasons therefore which are naturally deduced from the operative feelings of mankind any expectation of attaching holland to england as a friendly power is vague and futile nature has her own way of working in the heart and all plans of politics not founded thereon will disappoint themselves  any one who will review the history of english politics for several years past must perceive that they have been directed without system to establish this it is only necessary to examine one circumstance fresh in the mind of every man  the american war was prosecuted at a very great expense on the publicly declared opinion that the retaining america was necessary to the existence of england but america being now separated from england the present politics are that she is better without her than with her both these cannot be true and their contradiction to each other shows a want of system if the latter is true it amounts to an impeachment of the political judgment of government because the discovery ought to have been made before the expense was gone into this single circumstance yet fresh in every mans mind is sufficient to create a suspicion whether the present measures are more wisely founded than the former ones and whether experience may not prove that going to war for the sake of the stadtholder or for the hope of retaining a partial interest in holland who under any connection can from circumstances be no more than a neutral power is not as weak policy as going to war to retain america  if england is powerful enough to maintain her own ground and consequence in the world as an independent nation she needs no foreign connection if she is not the fact contradicts the popular opinion that she is therefore either her politics are wrong or her true condition is not what she supposes it to be either she must give up her opinion to justify her politics or renounce her politics to vindicate her opinion  if some kind of connection with holland is supposed to be an object worthy some expense to obtain it may be asked why was that connection broken by making war upon her in the last war if it was not then worth preserving without expense is it now worth reobtaining at a vast expense if the hollanders do not like the english can they be made to like them against their wills if it shall be said that under the former connection they were unfriendly will they be more friendly under any other they were then in as free a situation to choose as any future circumstances can make them and therefore the national governing sentiment of the country can be easily discovered for it signifies not what or who a stadtholder may be that which governs holland is and always must be a commercial principle and it will follow this line in spite of politics interest is as predominant and as silent in its operations as love it resists all the attempts of force and countermines all the stratagem of control  the most able english statesmen and politicians have always held it as a principle that foreign connections served only to embarrass and exhaust england that surrounded by the ocean she could not be invaded as countries are on the continent of europe and that her insular situation dictated to her a different system of politics to what those countries required and that to be enleagued with them was sacrisicing the advantages of situation to a capricious system of politics that though she might serve them they could not much serve her and that as the service must at all times be paid for it could always be procured when it was wanted and that it would be better to take it up in this line than to embarrass herself with speculative alliances that served rather to draw her into a continental war on their account than extricate her from a war undertaken on her own account  from this discussion of the affairs of holland and of the inadequacy of holland as an object for war we will proceed to show that neither england nor france are in a condition to go to war and that there is no present object to the one or the other to recompense the expense that each must be at or atone to the subjects of either for the additional burdens that must be brought upon them i defend the cause of the poor of the manufactures of the tradesman of the farmer and of all those on whom the real burden of taxes fall  but above all i defend the cause of humanity  it will always happen that any rumor of war will be popular among a great number of people in london there are thousands who live by it it is their harvest and the clamor which those people keep up in newspapers and conversations passes unsuspiciously for the voice of the people and it is not till after the mischief is done that the deception is discovered  such people are continually holding up in very magnified terms the wealth of the nation and the depressed condition of france as reasons for commencing a war without knowing any thing of either of these subjects  but admitting them to be as true as they are false as will be hereafter shown it certainly indicates a vileness in the national disposition of any country that will make the accidental internal difficulties to which all nations are subject and sometimes encumbered with a reason for making war upon them the amazing increase and magnitude of the paper currency now floating in all parts of england exposes her to a shock as much more tremendous than the shock occasioned by the bankruptcy of the south sea funds as the quantity of credit and paper currency is now greater than they were at that time whenever such a circumstance shall happen and the wisest men in the nation are and cannot avoid being impressed with the danger it would be looked upon a baseness in france to make the distress and misfortune of england a cause and an opportunity for making war upon her yet this hedious infidelity is publicly avowed in england the bankruptcy of      was precipitated by the great credit which the funds then had and the confidence which people placed in them is ot credit making infinitely greater strides now than it made then is not confidence equally as blind now as at that day the people then supposed themselves as wise as they do now yet they were miserably deceived and the deception that has once happened will happen again from the same causes  credit is not money and therefore it is not pay neither can it be put in the place of money in the end it is only the means of getting into debt not the means of getting out otherwise the national debt could not accumulate and the delusion which nations are under respecting the extention of credit is exactly like that which every man feels respecting life the end is always nearer than was expected and we become bankrupts in time by the same delusion that nations become bankrupts in property  the little which nations know or are some times willing to know of each other serves to precipitate them into wars which neither would have undertaken had she fully known the extent of the power and circumstances of the other it may therefore be of some use to place the circumstances of england and france in a comparative point of view  in order to do this the accidental circumstances of a nation must be thrown out of the account by accidental circumstances is meant those temporary disjointings and derangements of its internal system which every nation in the world is subject to and which like accidental fits of sickness in the human body prevents in the interim the full exertion and exercise of its natural powers  the substantial basis of the power of a nation arises out of its population its wealth and its revenues to these may be added the disposition of the people each of these will be spoken to as we proceed  instances are not wanting to show that a nation confiding too much on its natural strength is less inclined to be active in its operations than one of less natural powers who is obliged to supply that deficiency by increasing its exertions this has often been the case between england and france the activity of england arising from its fears has sometimes exceeded the exertions of france reposing on its confidence  but as this depends on the accidental disposition of a people it will not always be the same it is a matter well known to every man who has lately been in france that a very extraordinary change is working itself in the minds of the people of that nation a spirit that will render france exceedingly formidable whenever its government shall embrace the fortunate opportunity of doubling its strength by allying if it may be so expressed for it is difficult to express a new idea by old terms the majesty of the sovereign with the majesty of the nation for of all alliances this is infinitely the strongest and the safest to be trusted to because the interest so formed and operating against external enemies can never be divided  it may be taken as a certain rule that a subject of any country attached to the government on the principles abovementioned is of twice the value he was before freedom in the subject is not a diminution as was formerly believed of the power of government but an increase of it yet the progress by which changes of this kind are effected requires to be nicely attended to  were governments to offer freedom to the people or to show an anxiety for that purpose the offer most probably would be rejected the purpose for which it was offered might be mistrusted therefore the desire must originate with and proceed from the mass of the people and when the impression becomes universal and not before is the important moment for the most effectual consolidation of national strength and greatness that can take place  while this change is working there will appear a kind of chaos on the nation but the creation we enjoy arose out of a chaos and our greatest blessings appear to have a confused beginning  therefore we may take it for granted that what has at this moment the appearance of disorder in france is no more than one of the natural links in that great chain of circumstances by which nations acquire the summit of their greatness the provincial assemblies already began in france are as full or rather a fuller representation of the people than the parliaments of england are  the french or as they were formerly called the franks from whence came the english word frank and free were once the freest people in europe and as nations appear to have their periodical revolutions it is very probable they will be so again the charge is already began the people of france as is before observed are beginning to think for themselves and the people of england resigning up the prerogative of thinking  we shall now proceed to compare the present condition of england and france as to population revenues and wealth and to show that neither is in a condition of going to war and that war can end in nothing but loss and most probably a temporary ruin to both nations  to establish this point so necessary for both nations to be impressed with a free investigation of all the matters connected with it is indispensible if therefore any thing herein advanced shall be disagreeable it must be justified on the ground that it is better to be known in order to prevent ruin than to be concealed when such concealment serves only to hasten the ruin on  of population the population of france being upwards of twentyfour millions is more than double that of great britain and ireland besides which france recruits more soldiers in swisserland than england does in scotland and ireland to this may likewise be added that england and ireland are not on the best terms the suspicion that england governs ireland for the purpose of keeping her low to prevent her becoming a rival in trade and manufactures will always operate to hold ireland in a state of sentimental hostilities with england  revenues the revenues of france are twentyfour millions sterling the revenues of england fifteen millions and an half the taxes per head in france are twenty shillings sterling the taxes per head in england are two pounds four shillings and two pence the national debt in france including the life annuities which are twofifths of the whole debt and are annually expiring at eleven years purchase is one hundred and fortytwo millions sterling the national debt of england the whole of which is on perpetual interest is two hundred and fortyfive millions the national debt of france contains a power of annihilating itself without any new taxes for that purpose because it needs no more than to apply the life annuities as they expire to the purchase of the other threefifths which are on perpetual interest but the national debt of england has not this advantage and therefore the million a year that is to be toward reducing it is so much additional tax upon the people over and above the current service  wealth this is an important investigation it ought therefore to be heard with patience and judged of without prejudice  nothing is more common than for people to mistake one thing for another do not those who are crying up the wealth of the nation mistake a paper currency for riches to ascertain this point may be one of the means of preventing that ruin which cannot fail to follow by persisting in the mistake  the highest estimation that is made of the quantity of gold and silver in britain at this present day is twenty millions and those who are most conversant with money transactions believe it to be considerably below that sum yet this is no more money than what the nation possessed twenty years ago and therefore whatever her trade may be it has produced to her no profit certainly no man can be so unwise as to suppose that increasing the quantity of bank notes which is done with as little trouble as printing of newspapers is nanational wealth  the quantity of money in the nation was very well ascertained in the years         and    by calling in the light gold coin  there were upwards of fifteen millions and a half of gold coin then called in which with upwards of two millions of heavy guineas that remained out and the silver coin made above twenty millions which is more than there is at this day there is an amazing increase in the circulation of bank paper which is no more national wealth than newspapers are because an increase of promissary notes the capital remaining unincreased or not increasing in the same proportion is no increase of wealth it serves to raise false ideas which the judicious soon discover and the ignorant experience to their cost  out of twenty miilions sterling the present quantity of real money in the nation it would be too great an allowance to say that one fourth of that sum which is five millions was in london but even admitting this to be the case it would require no very conjuring powers to ascertain pretty nearly what proportion of that sum of five millions could be in the bank it would be ridiculous to suppose it could be less than half a million and extravagant to suppose it could be two millions  it likewise requires no very extraordinary discernment to ascertain how immense the quantity of bank notes compared to its capital in the bank must be when it is considered that the national taxes are paid in bank notes that all great transactions are done in bank notes and that were a loan for twenty millions to be opened at the meetof parliament it would most probably be subscribed in a few days yet all men must know the loan could not be paid in money because it is at least four times greater than all the money in london including the bankers and the bank amount too in short every thing shows that the rage that overrun america for paper money or paper currency has reached to england under another name there it was called continental money and here it is called bank notes but it signifies not what name it bears if the capital is not equal to the redemption  there is likewise another circumstance that cannot fail to strike with some force when it is mentioned because every man that has any thing to do with money transactions will feel the truth of it though he may not before have reflected upon it it is the embarrassed condition into which the gold coin is thrown by the necessity of weighing it and by refusing guineas that are even standing weight and there appears to be but few heavy ones whether this is intended to force the paper currency into circulation is not here attempted to be asserted but it certainly has that effect to a very great degree because people rather than submit to the trouble and hazard of weighing will take paper in preference to money this was once the case in america  the natural effect of increasing and continuing to increase paper currencies is that of banishing the real money the shadow takes place of the substance till the country is left with only shadows in its hands  a trade that does not increase the quantity of real money in a country cannot be styled a profitable trade yet this is certainly the case with england and as to credit of which so much has been said it may be founded on ignorance or a false belief as well as on real ability  in amsterdam the money deposited in the bank is never taken out again the depositors when they have debts to pay transfer their right to the persons to whom they are indebted and those again proceed by the same practice and the transfer of the right goes for payment now could all the money doposited in the bank of amsterdam be privately removed away and the matter be kept a secret the ignorance or the belief that the money was still there would give the same credit as if it had not been removed in short credit is often no more than an opinion and the difference between credit and money is that money requires no opinion to support it  all the countries in europe annually increase in their quantity of gold and silver except england by the registers kept at lisbon and cadiz the two ports into which the gold and silver from south america are imported it appears that above eighty millions sterling have been imported within twenty years from      to      a period of fifteen years of peace the registered importations of gold and silver into lisbon and cadiz was seventy millions sterling besides what was privately landed  this has spread itself over europe and increased the quantity in all the countries on the continent yet twenty years ago there was as much gold and silver in england as there is at this time  the value of the silver imported into europe exceeds that of the gold yet every one can see there is no increase of silver coin in england very little silver coin appearing except what are called birmingham shillings which have a faint impression of king william on one side and are smooth on the other  in what is the profits of trade to show itself but by increasing the quantity of that which is the object of trade money an increase of paper is not an increase of national profit any more than it is an increase of national money and the confounding paper and money together or not attending to the distinction is a rock that the nation will one day split upon  whether the payment of interest to foreigners or the trade to the east indies or the nation embroiling itself in foreign wars or whether the amount of all the trade which england carries on with different parts of the world collectively taken balances itself without profit whether one or all of these is the cause why the quantity of money does not increase in england is not in this place the object of enquiry it is the fact and not the cause that is the matter here treated of  men immersed in trade and the concerns of a counting house are not the most speculative in national affairs or always the best judges of them accustomed to run risks in trade they are habitually prepared to run risks with government and though they are the first to suffer they are often the last to foresee an evil  let us now cast a look toward the manufactures a great deal has been said of their flourishing condition and perhaps a great deal too much for it may again be asked where is the profit if there is no increase of money in the nation  the woollen manufacture is the staple manufacture of england and this is evdently on the decline in some if not in all its branches the city of norwich one of the most populous cities in england and wholly dependant on the woollen manufacture is at this day in a very impoverished condition owing to the decline of its trade  but not to rest the matter on a general assertion or embarrass it with numerous statements we will produce a circumstance by which the whole progress of the trade may be ascertained  so long as thirty years ago the price paid to the spinners of wool was one shilling for twentyfour skains each skain containing five hundred and sixty yards this according to the term of the trade was called giving a shilling for a shilling a good hand would spin twelve skains which was sixpence a day  according to the increase of taxes and the increased price of all the articles of life they certainly ought now to get at least fifteen pence for what thirty years ago they got a shilling for but such is the decline of the trade that the case is directly the contrary they now get but ninepence for the shilling that is they get but nine pence for what thirty years ago they got a shilling for can these people cry out for war when they are already half ruined by the decline of trade and half devoured by the increase of taxes  but this is not the whole of the misfortunes which that part of the country suffers and which will extend to others the norfolk farmers were the first who went into the practice of manuring their land with marle but time has shown that though it gave a vigor to the land for some years it operated in the end to exhaust its stamina that the lands in many parts are worse than before they began to marle and that it will not answer to marle a second time  the manufactures of manchester birmingham and sheffield have had of late a considerable spring but this appears to be rather on speculation than certainty the speculations on the american market have failed and that on russia is becoming very precarious experience likewise was wanting to ascertain the quantity which the treaty of commerce with france would give sale to and it is most probable the estimations have been too high more especially as english goods will now become unpopular in france which was not the case before the present injudicius rupture  but in the best state which manufactures can be in they are very unstable sources of national wealth the reasons are that they seldom continue long in one stay the market for them depends upon the caprice of fashions and sometimes of politics in foreign countries and they are at all times exposed to rivalship as well as to change the americans have already several manufactures among them which they prefer to the english such as axes scythes sickles houghs planes nails etc window glass which was once a considerable article of export from england to america the americans now procure from other countries nearly as good as the english crown glass and but little dearer than the common green window glass  it is somewhat remarkable that so many pens have been displayed to show what is called the increase of the commerce of england and yet all of them have stopped short of the grand point that is they have gone no farther than to show that a larger number of shipping and a greater quantity of tonnage have been employed of late years than formerly but this is no more than what is happening in other parts of europe the present fashion of the world is commerce and the quantity increases in france as well as in england  but the object of all trade is profit and profit shows itself not by an increase of paper currency for that may be nationally had without the trouble of trade but by an increase of real money therefore the estimation should have ended not in the comparative quantity of shipping and tonnage but in the comparative quantity of gold and silver  had the quantity of gold and silver increased in england the ministerial writers would not have stopped short at shipping and tonnage but if they know any thing of the matter they must know that it does not increase and that the deception is occasioned by the increase of paper instead of money and that as paper continue to increase gold and silver will diminish poorer in wealth and richer in delusion  something is radically wrong and time will discover it to be putting paper in the room of money  out of one hundred millions sterling of gold and silver which must have been imported into europe from south america since the commencement of the peace before last it does not appear that england has derived or retains any portion of it  mr neckar states the annual increase of gold and silver in france that is the proportion which france draws of the annual importaion in to europe to be upwards of one million terling but england in the space of twenty years do not appear to have encreasod in any thing but paper currency  credulity is wealth while credulity lasts and credit is in a thousand instances the child of credulity it requires no more faith to believe paper to be money than to believe a man could go into a quart bottle and the nation whose credulity can be imposed upon by bottle conjuring can for a time be imposed upon by paper conjuring  from these matters we pass on to make some observations on the national debt which is another species of paper currency  in short to whatever point the eye is directed whether to the money the paper the manufactures the taxes or the debt the inability of supporting a war is evident unless it is intended to carry it on by fleecing the skin over peoples ears by taxes and therefore the endangering the nation in a war for the sake of the stadtholder of holland or the king of prussia or any other foreign affairs from which england can derive no possible advantage is an absurd and ruinous system of politics  france perhaps is not in a better situation and therefore a war where both must lose and wherein they could only act the part of seconds must historically have been denominated a boyish foolish unnecessary quarrel  but before we enter on the subject of the national debt it will be proper to take a general review of the different manner of carrying on war since the revolution to what was the practice before  before the revolution the intervals of peace and war always found means to pay off the expense and leave the nation clear of encumbrance at the commencement of any succeeding war and even for some years after the revolution this practice was continued  from the year      the era of the revolution to the year   0  a period of fourteen years the sums borrowed by government at different times amounted to fortyfour millions yet this sum was paid off almost as fast as it was borrowed thirtyfour millions being paid off at the commencement of the year   0  this was a greater exertion than the nation has ever made since for exertion is not in borrowing but in paying  from that time wars have been carried on by borrowing and funding the capital on a perpetual interest instead of paying it off and thereby continually carrying forward and accumulating the weight and expense of every war into the next by this means that which was light at first becomes immensely heavy at last the nation has now on its shoulders the weight of all the wars from the time of queen anne this practice is exactly like that of loading a horse with a feather at a time till you break his back  the national debt exhibits at this day a striking novelty it has traveled on in a circular progression till the amount of the annual interest has exactly overtaken or become equal to the first capital of the national debt nine millions here begins the evidence of the predictions so long foretold by the ablest calculators in the nation the interest will in succession overtake all the succeeding capitals and that with the proportioned rapidity with which those capitals accumulated because by continuing the practice not only higher and higher premiums must be given for loans but the money or rather the paper will not go so far as it formerly did and therefore the debt will increase with a continually increasing velocity  the expense of every war since the national debt began has upon an average been double the expense of the war preceding it the expense therefore of the next war will be at least two hundred millions which will increase the annual interest to at least seventeen millions and consequently the taxes in the same proportion the following war will increase the interest to thirtythree millions and a third war will mount up the interest to sixtyfive millions this is not going on in the spirit of prediction but taking what has already been as a rule for what will yet be and therefore the nation has but a miserable prospect to look at the weight of accumulating interest is not much felt till after many years have passed over but when it begins to be heavy as it does now the burden increases like that of purchasing a horse with a farthing for the first nail of the shoe and doubling it  as to mr pitts scheme of reducing the national debt by a million a year applied to the purchase of stock it will turn out to say no worse of it a ridiculous and frivolous project for if a minister has not experience enough to distinguish a feather in the air and such there always will be from the god of war nor the clamours and interest of those who are seeking for jobs and contracts from the voice and interest of the people he will soon precipitate the nation into some unnecessary war and therefore any scheme of redemption of the debt founded on the supposed continuance of peace will with such conduct be no more than a balloon  that the funding system contains within itself the seeds of its own destruction is as certain as that of the human body containing within itself the seeds of death the event is as fixed as fate unless it cannot be taken as a proof that because we are not dead we are not to die  the consequence of the funding scheme even if no other event takes place will be to create two violent parties in the nation the one goaded by taxes continually increasing to pay the interest the other reaping a benefit from the taxes by receiving the interest this is very strongly shadowed forth like the handwriting on the wall by the ingenious author of the commercial atlas in his observations on the national debt  the slumber that for several years has overshadowed the nation in all matters of public finance cannot be supposed to last for ever the people have not yet awakened to the subject and this is taken for granted they never will but if a supposed unnecessary expenditure of between five and six millions sterling in the finances of france for the writer undertakes not to judge of the fact has awakened that whole nation a people supposed to be perfectly docile in all national matters surely the people of england will not be less attentive to their rights and properties if this should not be the case the inference will be fairly drawn that england is losing the spirit that france is taking up and that it is an ingenious device in the ministry to compose the nation to unpopular and unnecessary taxes by shamming a victory when there was no enemy at hand  in short every war serves to increase every kind of paper currency in the nation and to diminish the quantity of gold and silver by sending it to prussia and other foreign countries  it will not be denied that credulity is a strong trait in the english character and this has in no instance shown itself more than in mistaking paper for money except it be in the unaccountable ignorance of mistaking the debt of the nation for riches but the suspicion is beginning to awake  we will close this article with observing that a new kind of paper currency has arose within a few years which is that of country bank notes almost every town now has its bank its paper mint and the coinage of paper is become universal in the mean time the melting down the light guineas and recoining them passes with those who know no better for an increase of money because every new guinea they see and which is but seldom they naturally suppose to be a guinea more when it is really nothing else than an old guinea new cast  from this account of the money paper and national debt of england we proceed to compare it with the money paper and national debt of france  it is very well known that paper has not the credit in france which it has in england and that consequently there is much less of it this has naturally operated to increase the quantity of gold and silver in france and prevent the increase of paper  the highest estimation of the quantity of gold and silver in england as already stated is twenty millions sterling and the quantity of paper grafted thereon immense  the quantity of gold and silver in france is upwards of ninety millions sterling and the quantity of paper grafted thereon trifling france therefore has a long run of credit yet in reserve which england has already expended and it will naturally follow that when the government of france and the nation shall adjust their differences by an amicable embrace of each other that this reserved credit will be brought forth and the power of france will be at least doubly increased the adjustment of these differences is but the business of a day whenever its government shall see the proper moment for doing it and nothing would precipitate this event more than a war the cry of war from the injudicious provocations given by the british ministry and the disadvantageous effect of the commercial treaty is becoming popular in france  the near situation of france to spain and portugal the two countries which import gold and silver and her manufactures being better adapted to the warm climate of these countries than the manufactures of england give her superior opportunities of drawing money into the nation and as she has but little trade to the east indies the money so drawn in is not drawn out again as in england another advantage is that from the greatness of her dominions she has no occasion to waste her wealth in hiring foreign troops as is the practice with england and a third advantage is that the money which england squanders in prussia and other countries on the continent serves to increase the wealth of france because a considerable part of it centers there through the medium of her commerce  admitting great gritain and ireland to contain ten millions of inhabitants the quantity of money per head is forty shillings the money per head in france is three pounds fifteen shillings which is nearly double  the national debt of england compared to the whole amount of money in the nation is as twelve is to one that is the debt is twelve times greater than all the money amounts to  the national debt of france compared to the whole amount of her money is considerably less than as two is to one that is her debt is not so much as twice the amount of her money france therefore as already stated has an immense credit in reserve whenever the settlement of her present internal differences shall furnish her with the means of employing it and that period so much to be dreaded by england is hastening on  the annual interest of the national debt of england and france are nearly equal being nine millions sterling but with this difference that above three millions and a half of the annual interest of france are only life annuitles the interest therefore of her debt lessens every year and she will have a surplus up to the amount of three millions and a half to apply to the purchase of that part of the debt which is on perpetual interest therefore without any new taxes for that purpose she can discharge her whole debt in less than a third of the time on which it can be done in england according to mr pitts plan with his additional tax of a million a year  but let the event of mr pitts plan be what it may as to reducing the debt there is one circumstance that cannot fail to accompany it which is that of making it the interest of government in executing this plan to undermine the interest of its creditors or the value of the funds for the purpose of purchasing at a cheaper rate  the plan is founded on the presumption of a long uninterrupted peace and that future loans would not be wanted which can not now be expected for france in her turn is getting into a temper for war the plan naturally strikes at the credit of government in contracting further debts for were a loan to be opened tomorrow the subscribers naturally perceiving that it was the interest of government to undermine them as soon as they became creditors would consequently seek to secure themselves by demanding higher premiums at first it is a question whether a premium of thirty per cent is now as good as ten was before and therefore the plan in case of a war instead of lessening the debt serves to push it more rapidly on  the minister certainly never understood the natural operation of his plan or he would not have acted as he has done the plan has two edges while he has supposed it to have only one it strikes at the debt in peace and at the credit in war  the gentleman who originally furnished the minister with this plan now gives it totally up he knew its operation both in peace and war but the minister appears not to have comprehended it but if he has made a mistake his youth and inexperience must be his apology  the plan unless it should be altered that is given out for providing for the expense of the late armaments is in reality no other than the american plan of paper money and it is very probable that the minister has received it from some american refugee  the plan given out is that the minister is to borrow the money of the bank here is the delusion the name of money covers the deception for the case is that the bank do not lend the real money but it issues out an emission of bankpaper and the presumption is that there will be no run upon the bank in consequence of such an extraordinary emission but if there should no man can be at a loss in foreseeing the issue  there are those who remember that on a former run the bank was obliged to prolong the time by paying shillings and sixpences and it is universally credited that a quantity of silver is now preserved in the bank for the same purpose but the device to every person of reflection shows that the capital is not equal to the demands and that the chapter of accidents is part of the bible of bank  it may be asked why do not the government issue the paper instead of the bank the answer is that it is exactly the same thing in the end only with this difference in the mode that were the government to do it it would be too visible a system of paper currency and that a disguise is necessary  having recourse to the bank is a kind of playing the bank off against the funds fighting one kind of paper against another and in the combat both will be sufferers  in short the delusion of paper riches is working as rapidly in england as it did in america a young and inexperienced minister like a young and inexperienced congress may suppose that he sees mines of wealth in a printingpress and that a nation cannot be exhausted while there is paper and ink enough to print paper money every new emission until the delusion bursts will appear to the nation an increase of wealth every merchants coffers will appear a treasury and he will swell with paper riches till he becomes a bankrupt  when a bank makes too free with its paper it exposes itself in much the same manner which a government does that makes too free with its power too much credit is as bad as too little and there is such a thing as governing too much as well in a bank as in a government but nothing exposes a bank more than being under the influence instead of the protection of government and whenever either the property or the credit of a bank can be commanded or influenced by a government or a minister its destruction is not far off  we have now stated the comparative condition of england and france as to money matters but there yet remain some things necessary to be touched upon  it is an error very frequently committed in the world to mistake disposition for condition  france with a much better permanent condition for war than england is in a less disposition to enter into one and this want of disposition in her is mistaken in england for want of condition and on the other hand the apparent disposition in england for war is mistaken by her for a condition to undertake and carry one on  there appears a uniformity in all the works of nature from individual animals up to nations the smaller animals are always the most fretful passionate and insulting they mistake temper for strength and often fall a sacrifice to vexatious impetuosity while larger ones go calmly on and require repeated provocations to incense them france may yet be aggravated into war and very probably will where the condition exists the disposition may at any time take place we may create temper but we cannot create strength  while the literature of england preserves an honorable rank among the nations of europe her national character is most miserably suffering in the world through her newspapers the most barefaced persidiousness the most abandoned principles are daily propagated a total disregard to all the obligations of national faith and honor are publicly professed instead of that true greatness of heart that calm grandeur of sentiment that generous disdain of vulgar littleness that ought always to accompany the disputes of nations scarcely any thing is to be seen but mean abuse and low scurrility this is not the case in any other country in the world but england  we will now proceed to conclude with a few additional observations on the state of politics  for several weeks the nation was amused with the daily rumors of some great cabinet secret and admiring how profoundly the secret was kept when the only secret was that there was no secret to divulge  but this opinion of a secret very well shows that the opinion of the nation was different to the opinion of the minister or the supposition of some great secret would not have taken place as the affairs of the stadtholder were then publicly known it shows that the nation did not think the stadtholder of holland a sufficient reason for laying nw taxes on england and running into the risk and expense of a war and great was the surprise when the declaration and counter declaration like twin mice peeped from the cabinet  but there is one secret that requires to be investigated which is whether the minister did not know that france would not engage in a war and whether the preparations were not an idle parade founded on that knowledge  whether it was not meanly putting england under the banners of prussia and taking thereby a dishonorable advantage of the internal perplexity which france was then in and which in its turn may happen to england to assume the air of a challenge which it must be known would not be accepted because there was nothing to make the acceptance necessary  whether this conduct in the minister does not mischievously operate to destroy the harmony that appeared to be growing up between the two nations to lessen if not totally destroy the advantages of the commercial treaty and to lay the seeds of future wars when there was a prospect of a long and uninterrupted peace  when there are two ways of accomplishing the same object it almost always happens that the one is better than the other and whether the minister has not chosen the worst a few observations will elucidate this point  it signifies not what airy schemes projects or even treaties may be formed especially if done under the point of the bayonet for all that can be expected from holland is neutrality her trade is with all nations and it is from her neutrality that this trade has arisen destroy this neutrality and holland is destroyed therefore it matters not what party sentiments men may be of in holland as to the stadtholdership because there is still a superior banner under which all will unite  holland will not expose her trade to the devastations of england by joining france in a war neither will she expose it to france by joining england it may very well be asked what are england or france to holland that she should join with either in a war unless she is compelled to it by one or the other making war upon her as was the case in the last war  events may soon happen in europe to make all the force that prussia can raise necessary to her own defense and holland must be wise enough to see that by joining england she not only exposes her trade to france but likewise her dominions because france can invade her in a quarter in which england cannot defend her for holland lies open to france by land it is therefore more immediately the interest of holland to keep on good terms with france neither can england give her any equivalent to balance this circumstance how foolish then are the politics which are directed to unnatural and impossible objects surely the experience of a century past is sufficient to show to any man except one of yesterday what the conduct of holland in all cases must be  but there is another circumstance that do not fail to impress foreigners and especially holland which is that the immensity of the national debt of england the prospect of its still increasing and the exorbitancy of her paper currencies render her too insecure in herself to be much confided in by foreign nations for any length of time because that which must happen may soon happen  concerning the rescript delivered by the french minister there is one certain explanation to be put upon it which is that if france had been disposed for war she would not have made that communication the very making it goes to a full explanation of the parts and as soon as mr pit obtained this knowledge it appeared to him a safe moment to gird on his sword and when he found that france was as well weaponed as himself to propose to take it off again this is in a few words the whole history of the campaign a war minister in peace and a peace minister in war brave where there is no danger and prudent when there is  the rescript could be nothing else than an explanation on the part of france of the situation she conceived herself to be subject to and the probable consequences that might follow from it this she was not obliged to make and therefore her making it was a matter of civil communication toward a power she was at peace with and which in return entitled her to a similar communication on the part of the british cabinet all this might have been done without either the expense the tumult the provocations or the illblood that has been created  the alliance between france and the dutch was formed while the stadtholder was a part of the government therefore france could not from that alliance take a part either for or against him she could only act when the whole interest of the republic was exposed to a foreign enemy and it was not certain that this might not be the case  the rescript therefore instead of being taken as a ground for war was in itself a ground for peace because it tended to bring on a discussion of all the circumstances of france and england relative to holland which could not have failed to place holland in a state of neutrality and that only will be the final event now because independent of all parties no other is consistent with the whole national interest of that republic  but this not being done it is now left to the dutch to do it for themselves  an alliance with england at the same time there is one existing with france will secure this neutrality so necessary to the dutch republic by this stroke of politics she will be free from all obligations to join with either in a war and be guaranteed by both her alliance with england will debar england from molesting her trade by sea and that with france will debar france from the same thing and likewise from invading her by land in all future cases there are so many probable circumstances to arise on the continent of europe that the situation of holland requires this safeguard more especially from france on account of her land connection  the rising greatness of the russian empire the probable union of the interest of this empire with that of germany and france and consequently with spain whose interests cannot be separated and the probability of a rupture between the emperor and the king of prussia are matters that cannot fail to impress the dutch with the necessity of securing themselves by land as well as by sea and to prevent their being drawn into the quarrels either of england or france  upon the whole as there was a civil as well as an uncivil line of politics to be pursued every man of humane and generous sentiments must lament it was not chosen  a disposition for peace was growing up in every part of france and there appeared at the same time a mutual one rising in england a silent wish on both sides was universally expanding itself that wars so fatal to the true interest and burden some by taxes to the subjects of both countries might exist no more and that a long and lasting peace might take place  but instead of cultivating this happy opportunity the pettish vanity of a young and unexperienced minister who balanced himself between peace and war to take his choice of circumstances instead of principles and who went into an expensive armament when there was none to contend with and not till after the affairs of holand might be said to be terminated has destroyed those seeds of harmony that might have been rendered of more value to both nations than their fleets and armies  he has permitted the nation to run mad under the universal influence of a groundless belief of vast hostile armaments in the east and west indies and the supposition of a secret that never existed by this means the sparks of ill will are afresh kindled up between the nations the fair prospect of lasting peace is vanished and a train of future evils fills up the scene and that at a time when the internal affairs of france however confused they at present appear are naturally approaching to a great and harmonious increase of its power  finis
